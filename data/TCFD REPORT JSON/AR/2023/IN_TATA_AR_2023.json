We expect infrastructure build, investments led by new technologies, and demographics of emerging markets to continue to drive global growth, estimated at 3.2% in CY2024, similar to CY2023.\n\nThe Indian economy maintained a steady momentum within the uneven global macro-economic landscape, supported by public spending on infrastructure and digitalisation, as well as reforms directed towards ease of doing business and incentivising new investment. In FY2023-24, the Indian GDP has grown at 8.2%, which is substantially higher than the global benchmark.\n\nThe steel industry fundamentals re/flected these macro conditions, with geopolitical concerns and moderating demand in China resulting in pressure on steel prices, while input costs have remained relatively elevated and environmental and regulatory costs continue to rise. At the same time, the Indian market stood out as robust infrastructure spending, resurgence in private sector investment and robust demand meant that the industry saw crude steel production growth of 13% over the previous /fiscal. We expect this trend to continue, with domestic steel demand remaining buoyant in FY2024-25 on the back of expansion in economic activity, while pricing conditions might see periods of pressure driven by global economic trends and policy changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel's Indian operations delivered the highest ever crude steel production at 20.8 MT and delivered the highest /finished steel at 19.9 MT. Tata Steel undertook successful trial of hydrogen injection in the E Blast Furnace at Jamshedpur. It was for the /first time in the world that such a large quantity of hydrogen was continuously injected in a blast furnace.\n\nAlso, the Company encountered delays in large projects like the relining of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands and Kalinganagar downstream. The insights gained from these delays will contribute to the smoother and more timely execution of ongoing projects.\n\nAs we expand operations, focus on safety becomes extremely important. We are dedicated to strengthening our processes and practices to achieve our goal of zero harm.\n\nThe Company also made signi/ficant progress towards simpli/fication of its portfolio. The Company has successfully amalgamated /five of its key entities in India.\n\nComing to the Company's /financial performance in FY2023-24, the consolidated revenues were at \u20b92,29,171 crore compared to \u20b92,43,353 crore in FY2022-23 and the consolidated EBITDA was \u20b923,402 crore in FY2023-24 compared to \u20b932,698 crore in FY2022-23. In FY2023-24, the Company's consolidated net loss was \u20b94,910 crore compared to a pro/fit after tax of \u20b98,075 crore in FY2022-23.

Ahead of the transition, we have decided that given the ageing end-oflife condition of several of the heavy end assets, we will carry out a phased closure of the two blast furnaces by September 2024, so as to eliminate losses in the ongoing operations. The proposed project would ensure continuity of steelmaking in Port Talbot after the transition, while also preserving a majority of jobs in Tata Steel UK.\n\nWe have commenced discussions with the Dutch government with regard to the decarbonisation strategy for Tata Steel Nederland. The decarbonisation of the business will be\n\nimplemented in two phases with one blast furnace being replaced before 2030 and the second one thereafter.\n\nFor the /first phase, we have outlined a plan to transition to green steel production by 2030 through the Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) and electric arc furnace route.\n\nThe DRI, set to initially operate on natural gas, will seamlessly transition to hydrogen when it emerges as an accessible and economically feasible energy source.

China's transition from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth contributed to a reduced demand for steel, as the country's focus on heavy infrastructure investments seemed to taper. This was exacerbated by a sluggish real estate sector. The consequent overcapacity in China and higher exports brought about a downward pressure on global steel prices. The expansion of steelmaking capacities in regional markets also intensi/fied competition. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East disrupted traditional supply chains. Raw material prices and other costs remained relatively elevated even as steel prices signi/ficantly softened, putting pressure on margins for steel producers.\n\nMeanwhile, steel companies around the world, but especially in Europe and East Asia, have started to engage very deeply and invest signi/ficantly in /finding solutions to reduce the carbon footprint of the industry and increasing circularity. These e/fforts are part of a trend towards broad energy transition and decarbonisation, but there is no one-size-/fits-all solution.\n\nThe industry will need to continue to create bespoke solutions speci/fic to\n\nindividual geographies, both in terms of new technology solutions and ways to optimise costs of green steel. In addition, such e/fforts at least in the near to medium-term will need to be supported by policy and public spending.\n\n## Q How was Tata Steel's /financial performance in the backdrop of these global challenges?\n\nWhile the global steel demand growth moderated, India was a bright spot with strong demand from the infrastructure and steel-intensive sectors. Tata Steel's India operations were able to leverage this, as the Company achieved the highest-ever crude steel production of ~20.8 MT and deliveries of ~19.9 MT. Domestic deliveries were up 9% y-o-y.\n\nAmong the market segments, automotive volumes were up 8% y-o-y. Our well-established retail brand in long products, Tata Tiscon, witnessed 15% y-o-y growth and crossed 2 MT in annual sales. The focus on improving product mix led to 6% y-o-y growth in high-end product sales.\n\nTata Steel's standalone revenues for the full year were marginally lower at \u20b91,40,987 crore, with an EBITDA of \u20b931,004 crore, re/flecting an 8% y-o-y increase, translating to an EBITDA margin of 22%. The reported PAT at \u20b94,807 crore was lower compared to \u20b914,685 crore in the previous year, primarily due to an impairment charge of \u20b912,560 crore on\n\naccount of the proposed restructuring of operations and closure of our existing heavy end assets at Tata Steel UK.\n\nTata Steel's consolidated revenues in FY2023-24 were at H 2,29,171 crore and EBITDA was H 23,402 crore, which translates to an EBITDA margin of around 10%. Capital expenditure was higher 29% y-o-y at H 18,207 crore during the year driven by the phased commissioning of the 5 MTPA expansion at Kalinganagar and the relining of Blast Furnace 6 at Tata Steel Nederland. Net debt stood at H 77,550 crore, while gross debt was at H 87,082 crore. Group liquidity remained strong at H 31,767 crore, which included cash and cash equivalents of H 9,532 crore.\n\nTata Steel Nederland reported a reduction in deliveries and subdued annual revenues of \u00a35,276 million with an EBITDA loss of \u00a3368 million primarily due to an extended period of relining of Blast furnace 6. Liquid Steel production was at 4.8 MT while deliveries stood at 5.33 MT.\n\nTata Steel UK reported annual revenues of \u00a32,706 million, with liquid steel production at 2.99 MT and deliveries of 2.80 MT. Tata Steel UK reported an EBITDA loss of \u00a3364 million given the end-of-life condition of the heavy end assets, consequent production disruptions, and high /fixed and maintenance costs.",

        "page_content": "## Q Why were EBITDA and cash /flow negative for Tata Steel Nederland? What is the expectation for FY2024-25?\n\nTata Steel Nederland recorded negative EBITDA and cash /flow due to operational and market issues during FY2023-24. The relining of Blast Furnace 6 and its ramp up took longer than anticipated, a/ffecting the production levels leading to signi/ficantly lower volumes, higher /fixed costs and higher costs of maintenance, spares and capex. Additionally, while steel prices fell, raw materials and other costs were relatively high in the region, putting pressure on margins.\n\nHowever, Blast Furnace 6 is back to full production at the close of the year, and in FY2024-25 we expect Tata Steel Nederland to produce steel commensurate with its rated capacity, resulting in better /fixed cost absorption and more e/fficient operations. As production volumes stabilise and improve along with improvements in material and conversion costs, it will result in improved EBITDA margins and cash /flows for the coming year.\n\n## Q What are the plans for restructuring and transitioning to EAF-based steelmaking at Tata Steel UK?\n\nAs we have previously stated, the current heavy end assets of Port Talbot are nearing their end of life, are operationally unstable and are resulting in unsustainable /financial losses. Tata Steel UK will close its Blast Furnaces 5 and 4 by the end of June and September 2024, respectively. The coke ovens were closed in March 2024, as operations became unviable. In April 2024, the Company completed an exhaustive 7-month process of national-level formal and informal consultations on all options with the Unions and concluded that the multi-union plan which involved continuity of Blast Furnace 4 through the transition is not technically, operationally or /financially viable. To mitigate the impact of the announced restructuring, a generous voluntary redundancy programme has been developed and is being o/ffered to the impacted employees. The restructuring costs associated with this exercise will be phased over a period of 18 months.\n\nBlast Furnace 6 at IJmuiden Plant, Tata Steel Nederland\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn September 2023, Tata Steel reached an agreement with the UK government to jointly invest \u00a31.25 billion (including a \u00a3500 million UK government grant), the largest investment in many decades in British steelmaking, in a new electric arc furnace (EAF) project which would ensure future continuity of steelmaking at Port Talbot. The project will reduce direct emissions of CO2 from the steel works by 50 MT over 10 years and utilise locally available scrap in the UK. Tata Steel is at an advanced stage of engineering and plans to place equipment orders for the EAF by September 2024 and begin construction by August 2025.\n\nUntil the commissioning of the EAF in 2027, the Hot Strip Mill operations and downstream units in the UK will be supported by import of slabs and hot-rolled coils from Tata Steel's own operations in India and the Netherlands as well as other suppliers. Tata Steel UK has put in place solutions for logistics for the transition period and executed a power connection agreement which will ensure the necessary high-voltage power for the electric arc furnace in line with the project plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn September 2023, Tata Steel reached an agreement with the UK government to jointly invest \u00a31.25 billion, the largest investment in many decades in British steelmaking, in a new electric arc furnace project which would ensure future continuity of steelmaking at Port Talbot.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTowards Net Zero by 2045\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q What are your decarbonisation plans for Tata Steel Nederland?\n\nWe are in discussions with the Dutch government for a /financial and policy-level support on a decarbonisation plan to replace one of the two blast furnaces with a Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) plant and an EAF before 2030. On March 28, 2024, the Dutch cabinet con/firmed that the government is willing to support the proposal from Tata Steel and has given a mandate to the government to negotiate the same.\n\nThe Dutch government intends to reach a binding agreement with Tata Steel by the end of the present /fiscal year, after approval from the Dutch parliament and the Tata Steel Board. The government has commenced due diligence on the proposal's /financial, commercial, and technical aspects. This will be followed by detailed discussions over the next several months.\n\n## Q What were the commissioning activities undertaken at Kalinganagar during the year? What are Tata Steel's plans for future expansion there?\n\nWe continued the phased commissioning of the 5 MTPA capacity expansion at Kalinganagar during the year. We started the 2.2 MTPA Cold Rolling Mill which has enhanced our product mix. The commissioning of the 6 MTPA Pellet Plant signi/ficantly reduced the Company's dependence on external purchases, contributing to better cost management and operational e/fficiency. Stove heating was initiated, and power was charged into the new blast furnace which is expected to start production by September 2024. We also started the chimney heating for coke ovens.\n\nAs stated previously, Tata Steel is focused on investing in value accretive growth in India, which is an attractive market with increasing demand for steel. We are building a 0.75 MTPA electric arc furnace based steel plant in Ludhiana, Punjab, India. At Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, which was\n\nacquired through the Government of India's DIPAM programme, we expect to increase the capacity from 1 MTPA to 5.5 MTPA in the /first phase. We also expect to increase the Tata Steel Kalinganagar's capacity in the 3 rd phase (after completion of the current phase) from 8 MTPA to 13 MTPA. We are exploring plans to increase capacity at our Meramandali operations as well. Finally, we are also looking to enhance our downstream capabilities and related businesses.\n\n## Q What is the status of the amalgamation of business entities announced in FY2022-23?\n\nAs of March 2024, /five strategic business entities were successfully merged into Tata Steel following the completion of regulatory procedures. This consolidation marks a pivotal step towards fortifying our position in value-added segments by leveraging our marketing and sales network across product lines. We are also accruing various bene/fits through synergies on raw materials, centralised procurement, inventory optimisation,",

What has been the /financial impact of this surrender?\n\nThe Sukinda mine faced signi/ficant operational and regulatory challenges leading to its surrender. Historically operated through open cast mining, the mine's reserves depleted. To continue extraction, transitioning to underground mining was necessary. The shift would have taken 2-3 years to commence, during which period production was to be on hold.\n\nHowever, the mining regulations, including the Mine Development and Production Agreement (MDPA) targets, did not provide the required /flexibility for the transition. Consequently, we decided to surrender the mine, resulting in a one-time cost of approximately \u20b9500 crore.\n\n## Q What were the sustainability e/fforts made by Tata Steel during the previous year?\n\nTata Steel has a multipronged approach to progress on its sustainability journey and many initiatives are undertaken with the aim of reducing our carbon footprint, enhancing resource e/fficiency, and fostering a sustainable future.\n\nTata Steel is among the /first movers in decarbonising steelmaking operations. The Company has announced its plans to transition to low-CO2 steel manufacturing across operations in the UK and the Netherlands.\n\nThe construction of our /first lowcarbon steel plant in Ludhiana, Punjab, India has started. This scrap-based EAF facility will signi/ficantly reduce carbon emissions compared to traditional steelmaking. The plant is expected to be commissioned by March 2025 and will produce 0.75 MT of steel annually.\n\nTata Steel /finalised agreements with Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited and TP Vardhman Surya Limited to source 379 MW of captive renewable power. This strategic move is expected to reduce 50 MT of carbon emissions over 25 years.\n\nWe also undertook pilots to avoid or convert captured carbon emissions including measures to green our energy mix such as biochar and hydrogen. We championed bamboo plantation in our leasehold land and communities' barren land around our Jharia coal mines. This collaboration aims to generate livelihood opportunities for farmers and act as a carbon sink over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe bamboo can be converted into biochar which can replace, to a certain extent, pulverised coal injection in our blast furnaces to reduce emissions. Our water conservation e/fforts led to zero e/ffluent discharge at Kalinganagar site.\n\nWe integrated an eco-conscious /fleet of advanced commercial vehicles from Tata Motors into our operations. These vehicles, powered by LNG and electric batteries, are expected to signi/ficantly reduce our Scope 3 CO 2 emissions in road transportation.\n\nWe also completed a fullladen voyage using B24 biofuel, transporting 1,48,500 tonnes of coal from Gladstone, Australia to Paradip, India and achieved a 20% reduction in carbon emissions. The B24-grade biofuel blend consisted of 24% used cooking oil methyl ester (UCOME) and 76% very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO). We also became the /first company in India to use LNG-powered capsize bulk carrier for transporting raw materials.\n\nContinuous Annealing Line, Tata Steel Kalinganagar\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese milestones highlight our commitment to sustainable maritime practices.\n\nThe Company signed an MoU with Imperial College London to invest \u00a310 million to establish a Centre for Innovation in Sustainable Design and Manufacturing that will focus on smart manufacturing techniques, sustainable multi-material joining technologies, and Net Zero construction innovations. The Company also joined the Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), a platform initiated by Sweden and India, that fosters Net Zero transitions across heavy industries through initiatives such as Coal Bed Methane (CBM) injection, hydrogen injection in blast furnaces, and carbon capture plant.\n\nWe launched 'Tata Steel - Sprint to Zero' 2023 challenge to fund innovative projects focused on lowcarbon hydrogen technologies. The initiative aligning with the UK-India hydrogen partnership supports two groundbreaking projects aimed at decarbonising the steel Industry.\n\nOur Kalinganagar and Meramandali plants received the ResponsibleSteel TM Certi/fication, with over 90% of our steel production capacity in India now accredited under this framework. This certi/fication acknowledges our dedication to environmental stewardship and responsible business practices. Rea/ffirming this deep-rooted commitment to sustainability, Tata Steel was distinguished as a Steel Sustainability Champion by the World Steel Association (worldsteel) for the seventh consecutive year, marking its unwavering recognition since the inception of this demanding sustainability programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata Steel has a multipronged approach to progress on its sustainability journey and many initiatives undertaken with the aim of reducing our carbon footprint, enhancing resource e/fficiency, and fostering a sustainable future.\n\n## Q Could you elaborate on the Company's initiatives for community engagement and outreach in the regions where it operates?\n\nTata Steel has implemented a comprehensive range of community engagement and outreach initiatives aimed at fostering sustainable development and improving the quality of life in the regions where it operates.\n\nTata Steel Foundation (TSF) anchors the Company's social impact programmes, which impacted 4.4 million people in FY2023-24. TSF focuses on designing scalable and replicable change models across education, public health, tribal identity, livelihoods, agriculture, water, and disability.\n\nOur Initiatives like the MANSI+ (Maternal and Newborn Survival Initiative) operates in over 50 development blocks across districts in Jharkhand and has helped to stabilise over 80% of identi/fied severely acute malnourished newborn children.

The programme operates through both residential and non-residential bridge schools designed to transition children from child labour to formal education. In addition to educational needs, the initiative also addresses health and psychological support to children.\n\nWe have also undertaken signi/ficant e/fforts to advance the preservation and growth of tribal identity and languages and fostering a deeper connection to the cultural heritage among tribal communities. These e/fforts currently cover 40,600 learners across 702 centres, promoting the use of 10 di/fferent tribal languages of eastern India. During the year, we developed around 40 original literary and academic works in these\n\nTata Steel's education initiatives helped in eliminating child labour\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlanguages. Samvaad, a pan-India tribal conclave plays a crucial role in these e/fforts as it serves as a platform for dialogue and cultural exchange, helping to maintain and celebrate tribal identities.\n\nThe Company's climate-resilient agriculture initiatives have assisted over 90,000 farmers, leading to increased incomes through sustainable farming practices and market linkages. Our health programmes have focused on reducing the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis through community awareness and health camps for early diagnosis and prompt treatment, as well as the identi/fication and treatment of highrisk cases, particularly among women and children.\n\nDuring the year, we expanded our health infrastructure by inaugurating two new Tata Main Hospitals in\n\nNoamundi and West Bokaro, Jharkhand, adding approximately 200 beds to the region's medical capacity. The hospitals we have built, provide medical care to over 1 million people.\n\nWe have also focused on water conservation, creating signi/ficant water storage capacity in treated lands. Our water conservation activities have touched over 47,000 lives, creating nearly 166 cubic feet of water storage and treating 1,450 acres of land in the past three years.\n\nOur initiatives are designed to bring a transformational change through a collaborative approach. The Company's extensive understanding of communities enables it to partner e/ffectively with like-minded organisations. Going forward, we would like to leverage both private and public capital to amplify the impact of our programmes on a much larger scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining initiative for Tata Steel's transgender employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q Could you shed some light on Tata Steel's initiatives that aim to promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) across the organisation and e/fforts to ensure safe working environment?\n\nTata Steel has been the vanguard of DE&I principles. It consistently works to establish a welcoming and supportive workplace, irrespective of gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other distinction. The Company's comprehensive DE&I approach is manifested through various initiatives including unconscious bias training, the establishment of employee resource groups, and the provision of inclusive bene/fits packages.\n\nTata Steel is actively advancing its DE&I initiatives through progressive hiring practices and through various events such as Ananta Quest and QUEERious. The inaugural Ananta Quest event this year, aimed at students with disabilities from India's top institutions and winners were o/ffered internships and placement opportunities, highlighting the\n\ndedication to integrating diverse talent. Tata Steel also became the /first Indian company to integrate transgenders into mining operations, when it welcomed 14 transgender employees as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery operator trainees at its West Bokaro Division in Jharkhand, India. This aligns with our pioneering e/fforts to promote inclusivity and integration of LGBTQIA+ talent into the corporate environment. For its consistent and progressive e/fforts, Tata Steel was recognised as a Gold Employer by the India Workplace Equality Index (IWEI) 2023.\n\nComing to workplace safety, the Company continues to adopt a proactive stance on ensuring safety against potential personnel and operational risks.

The country is the secondlargest producer and consumer of crude steel globally and is expected to report sustained growth aided by rapid pace of urbanisation, continued manufacturing push under 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and low per capita consumption. Major projects under the National Infrastructure Pipeline and Gati Shakti Plan, including highways, railways, ports, and urban infrastructure, will signi/ficantly boost steel demand.\n\nWhile India drives economic growth, Europe leads in policy development to accelerate the adoption of decarbonising processes and technologies across various sectors, encouraging both private and public enterprises. The collaboration in strategic procurement between  India and Europe can reduce costs and enhance supply chain reliability.

The Company has always upheld the highest standards of ethical business practices across its geographically diversi/fied operations.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Tata Steel observed 25 years of institutionalising the Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC). Guided by the TCoC, Tata Steel has deployed the Management of Business Ethics (MBE) framework with the following four pillars:\n\n## Leadership\n\n- \u00bb The Corporate Governance structure includes Board-level committees and management-level committees, which oversee the deployment of vigil mechanism in the organisation.\n- \u00bb The Senior Leadership team does role modelling by communicating the values and principles through various forums, addressing di/fferent stakeholders across divisions thereby ensuring open and transparent culture.\n- \u00bb The Chief Ethics Counsellor (CEC) is responsible for driving MBE initiatives and reports to the Chief Executive O/fficer & Managing Director (CEO & MD), who is also the Principal Ethics O/fficer. Apart from a dedicated Corporate Ethics department, the deployment is\n\nsupported by line managers and employees who are nominated and trained as Divisional Ethics Coordinators and Ethics Champions and constitute the Organisation of Ethics Counsellors (OECs). Besides them, local POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) representatives play a pivotal role in connecting with and instilling con/fidence among the people on shop /floors and supporting them in reporting sexual harassment cases.\n\n## Compliance structure\n\n- \u00bb Various systems and processes are used to ensure a robust vigil mechanism for the deployment of the TCoC and related policies in the organisation.\n- \u00bb Tata Steel's in-house IT-enabled digital platform 'Darpan' hosts declarations on the TCoC and Con/flict of Interest, external assignment declarations, and Gift and Hospitality declarations. Other key IT platforms used by Tata Steel are the Management of Business Ethics Information System for Ethics Counsellor Management, the dilemma portal called 'Kashmakash', and the Integrated Concern Management System.\n- \u00bb Tata Steel also has a third-party whistleblowing helpline facility\n\ncalled 'Speak Up', which ensures stakeholders' con/fidence in the whistleblowing process. The facilities include a 24/7 toll-free number, web access, postal services, and email.\n\n## Communication and training\n\n- \u00bb Communication is crucial in deploying the MBE framework across the organisation through various communication platforms, including round-table discussions for employees, business associate meets for vendors, distributors, suppliers, transporters, and service providers, and mass meetings at shop /floors to connect with the frontline employees and contract workforce.\n- \u00bb Customised training programmes on POSH, Respectful Workplace, and Third-Party Due Diligence, amongst other topics, are conducted online, in classrooms, and on web-based mediums.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe activities of the OECs are captured in the online Management of Business Ethics Information System.\n\nThe e/ffectiveness of the MBE framework deployment is constantly evaluated using the feedback from the MBE Survey and MBE Assessment.\n\nTata Steel has and will always relentlessly focus on strengthening the ethical culture across all its locations by reinforcing the policies and guidelines, setting high standards of transparency through strong corporate governance practices, and leveraging technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe steel industry, historically a bastion of rigorous regulatory oversight and scrutiny, /finds itself at a pivotal juncture as the global imperative shifts towards sustainability and decarbonisation. Additionally, signi/ficant stakeholder expectations, shifts in social attitudes, and public perception, particularly in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) domain, are shaping industry practices and priorities. Given this shift, compliance is at a critical in/flexion point as it transcends the traditional boundaries of regulatory adherence and legal conformity. Compliance is now emerging as a strategic function that serves as a cornerstone in supporting the trajectory of the enterprise towards a sustainable future.\n\nThe Compliance function at Tata Steel involves a robust and comprehensive programme that focuses on regulatory changes and trends, addresses stakeholder expectations, and facilitates continuous improvement while aligning with the Company's strategic objectives and values. It plays a pivotal role in fostering a culture that is anchored in integrity, transparency and accountability and prioritises fairness, upholds rights, promotes safety, and advocates ethical conduct.\n\nActing as a second line of defence, it assesses compliance gaps, guides the implementation of internal controls, and provides critical insights to the management. In addition to ensuring adherence to a myriad of applicable laws and regulations, the function serves as a valued advisor, providing essential guidance, training, and consultation to the business in meeting its compliance obligations.\n\nLast year, the function achieved ISO 9001:2015 standards certi/fication, incorporating rigorous quality management in its compliance practices, crucial for meeting contemporary and ever-evolving regulatory demands e/ffectively. This achievement marks a signi/ficant stride in propelling the function towards sustained operational excellence. It is also signi/ficant in light of the function's aspiration to secure ISO 37301:2021 standards certi/fication in the coming years.\n\nRecognising the importance of technology in driving compliance, the function prioritised automating compliance processes to streamline operations, reduce manual e/ffort and minimise human error. Automation was utilised for user follow-ups and generating management reports. The function also introduced modules to its compliance solution for\n\nstreamlining compliance procedures on user concern management and statutory licences review.\n\nIn FY2024-25, the focus would be on enhancing review and testing protocols through compliance audits to assess gaps, ensure coverage, promote awareness, and foster a compliance culture.\n\nIn the coming years, the function will continue to develop compliance capabilities across all levels within Tata Steel and across the corporate spectrum, which includes group entities. It will look to extend its monitoring and oversight perimeter to include third parties. It would continue to evaluate and upgrade its technology stack to ensure it meets the emerging compliance demands.\n\nThe function is headed by the Company Secretary and Chief Legal O/fficer (Corporate & Compliance), who is primarily responsible for overseeing and managing regulatory compliances. The function is adequately sta/ffed with compliance managers who are responsible for establishing business and industry-speci/fic standards in all units across the organisation.\n\n## ISO 9001:2015\n\nCerti/fication received by the Compliance function during FY2023-24",

The last assessment was conducted in FY2022-23.\n\nMateriality assessment is a detailed exercise that covers stakeholders from all operating geographies India, Thailand, the Netherlands, and the UK - and the identi/fied risks and opportunities help in developing the Company's strategy over the short, medium, and long term. The assessment also facilitates deeper stakeholder engagement and incorporates their feedback on the Company's roadmap, regularly reviewed by Tata Steel's senior leadership and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe risks arising out of material issues are assessed as per the organisation's Enterprise Risk\n\nManagement process and framework.\n\nIn accordance with the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard, Tata Steel identi/fies the following as its stakeholders:\n\n- \u00bb Senior Management\n- \u00bb Investors (Debt & Equity)\n- \u00bb Employees\n- \u00bb Contractual Workforce\n- \u00bb Community\n- \u00bb Suppliers\n- \u00bb Customers\n- \u00bb Media\n- \u00bb Regulatory Bodies\n- \u00bb Industry Bodies\n- \u00bb Non-government organisations\n\nThe last materiality assessment, conducted in FY2022-23, was undertaken on a consolidated basis through a structured stakeholder consultation by an independent agency, according to best-in-class international practices.

The economy is better placed now, than at the same time in 2023 with the risk of a global recession receding. In late 2023, headline in/flation neared its pre-pandemic level in most economies for the /first time since the start of the global in/flation surge. As global in/flation descended from its peak, economic activity grew steadily, defying warnings of stag/flation and global recession. The United States, with some middle-income economies, displayed strong economic performance, with aggregate demand supported by stronger than expected private consumption amidst still tight though easing labour markets.\n\nIndia's economic growth has been resilient against global headwinds for three /fiscals now. Policy and regulatory support and prudence have helped, as has the gradual reinvigoration of the private sector. This positively impacts the steel industry, which showed 14% growth in /finished steel demand in FY2023-24 over FY2022-23. Higher steel exports from China led to softening prices in the international market, thereby lowering the pro/fitability of Indian mills. The European steel industry, already grappling with weak domestic demand, also felt the heat of cheap steel imports.\n\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel Limited completed the amalgamation of 5 Indian subsidiary companies. Please refer to the section 'Forging a Stronger Future' on the following page.\n\n## Generation of capital Performance for FY2023-24\n\nTata Steel, during FY2023-24 generated a consolidated revenue of \u20b92,29,171 crore (as compared to PY \u20b92,43,353 crore) and a consolidated EBITDA of \u20b923,402 crore (as compared\n\nto PY \u20b932,698 crore). The Company's consolidated cash /flow from operations stood at \u20b920,301 crore. Considering the performance, the Board has recommended a dividend of \u20b93.60 per Ordinary (Equity) Share.\n\nIn India, the Shikhar25 programme drove savings and value protection of around \u20b96,821 crore, while in Europe, improvement programmes yielded savings of \u20ac124 million for Tata Steel in the Netherlands and \u00a348 million in the UK. A sustained focus on balance sheet and cost optimisation aids Tata Steel's strategic objective, helping it retain its position as a global cost leader.\n\nAs part of fund-raising, the Company issued and allotted Unsecured, Rated, Listed, Redeemable, Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) aggregating to \u20b92,700 crore, to identi/fied investors on a private placement basis.\n\nDuring the year, Moody's upgraded Tata Steel's credit rating from 'Ba1' Positive to 'Baa3' Stable, while S&P retained the 'BBB-' rating. Domestic rating agencies have rated Tata Steel 'AA+', indicating a strong credit pro/file and operating performance. With this, Tata Steel is the only Indian steel company which is currently rated investment grade by both international and domestic credit rating agencies.\n\n## Deployment of capital Investments for growth and sustainability\n\nCapacity augmentation to leverage India's growth potential is key to strengthening Tata Steel's leadership position in chosen segments. In the past decade, the Company has doubled its steel production capacity through organic and inorganic routes and has outlined plans to reach 40 MTPA capacity in India.\n\nIn FY2023-24 Tata Steel accelerated capital expenditure towards the Kalinganagar 5 MTPA capacity expansion and 2.2 MTPA CRM Complex project. Out of the total consolidated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapital expenditure of \u20b918,207 crore, it allocated over \u20b95,300 crore for these projects with the second blast furnace at Kalinganagar now in the process of commissioning in FY2024-25. \u20ac550 million were spent on the relining of the Blast Furnace 6 at IJmuiden, to prolong the life of the asset and improve its e/fficiency. The Company also spent over \u20ac168 million on the various sustainability projects in the Netherlands. \u20b91,400+ crore expenditure went towards mining capacity expansion in India.\n\nThe Company is setting up a 0.75 MTPA scrap-based electric arc furnace facility in Ludhiana, Punjab, India. Tata Steel has also invested in particulate matter emissions reduction in the Netherlands. In September 2023, Tata Steel and the UK Government announced a joint agreement on a proposal to invest in a state-of-the-art electric arc furnace steel manufacturing facility at the Port Talbot site with a capital cost of \u00a31.25 billion inclusive of a grant from the UK Government of up to \u00a3500 million. In the UK, Tata Steel plans to shut down both blast furnaces in 2024 and has started working towards the proposed transition to EAF-based low CO 2 steelmaking. The Company's UK business incurred an EBITDA loss of \u00a3364 million in FY2023-24. Though the transition would lead to redundancy and restructuring costs and losses in the ongoing operations in FY2024-25, the business is expected to stabilise by the end of FY2024-25.",

The newly launched 'Wellness for Life' portal is designed to support the employees in managing their holistic well-being.\n\n## Fostering diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nTata Steel Limited strives to be a benchmark of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). DE&I is not a choice at Tata Steel, but a way of life. To achieve the goal of 20% diverse workforce in India by 2025, Tata Steel has identi/fied four focus areas for intervention: Women, the LGBTQIA+ community, Persons with Disabilities and the A/ffirmative Action Community (Tribal Communities).\n\n## Four pillars of driving DE&I at Tata Steel India\n\n## Women\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Persons with Disabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A/ffirmative Action Community\n\n(Tribal Communities)\n\n## LGBTQIA+ community",

        "page_content": "## Green steel transition in the UK\n\nIn September 2023, Tata Steel announced a proposed investment of \u00a31.25 billion to enable green steelmaking, which includes a UK Government grant of up to \u00a3500 million, to build a new 3 MTPA capacity state-of-the-art electric arc furnace (EAF) in Port Talbot, UK.\n\nThe announcement was followed by weeks of deep engagement and detailed discussions with UK Steel Committee (multi-trade union representative body in UK) and its advisors. Tata Steel carefully considered their endorsed proposal for maintaining a single blast furnace. After signi/ficant deliberation, Tata Steel agreed to adopt elements of it, but considered that continued blast furnace production was not feasible or a/ffordable.\n\nAfter seven months of formal and informal national-level discussions with the UK trade unions, Tata Steel has decided to proceed with its proposed plan and commence closure of the existing heavy-end assets. The two Blast Furnaces, No.5 and No.4, at Port Talbot, will close by the end of June 2024 and by the end of September 2024, respectively. Following the closure of Blast Furnace No.4, the remaining heavy-end assets will wind down, and the Continuous Annealing Processing Line will close in March 2025.\n\nThe Company shall endeavour to maximise voluntary redundancies and has put forward a comprehensive package to support the employees impacted by the proposed transformation of the UK business.  The precise details of the support package remain subject to the outcome of discussions with interested parties.\n\nTata Steel will also provide additional support to a/ffected employees with job searches, support facilities for training and upskilling\n\nactivities, /finance for small and medium-sized businesses through the UK Steel Enterprise regeneration and job creation scheme. Tata Steel has committed a one-time payment of \u00a320 million to the Transition Board. Tata Steel will work closely with the Transition Board and a range of regional and national stakeholders to ensure that this investment, coming at the same time as the establishment of the Celtic Freeport, provides a catalyst for the economic regeneration of South Wales and creates high skilled, well-paid jobs for local people in the coming decades.\n\n## Business and human rights\n\nTata Steel is committed to responsible mining and manufacturing and has pledged to uphold the human rights and interests of all vulnerable communities, including the indigenous communities, in the proximity of its value chain. The Tata Code of Conduct lays down the principles and standards that governs the actions of the Company and employees and emphasises Tata Group's commitment to labour standards and human rights.\n\nA publicly declared Business and Human Rights Policy followed by the formation of an Apex Business and Human Rights Committee for governance, re/flects Tata Steel's deep commitment to uphold human rights and interests of its stakeholders. Under the policy, the Company has identi/fied the following six categories of rights-holders whose human rights can potentially be impacted by the operations of the organisation:\n\n- \u00bb Tata Steel's personnels covering all persons working for or on behalf of the Company.\n- \u00bb Tata Steel's contract workforce\n- \u00bb Communities impacted by the Company's operations\n- \u00bb Consumers and customers of the Company's products and services\n\n- \u00bb Employees of value chain partners such as suppliers, vendors, dealers, distributors, sales representatives, and franchisees\n- \u00bb Family members of the Company's personnel\n\nIn FY2023-24 Tata Steel undertook third party human rights due diligence audits across its sites and value chain in India. Using a sampling approach, onsite audits were carried out across di/fferent business units and locations, including steel manufacturing facilities, mines and downstream facilities across India. The audit process included documentation review, site visits to the vendor facilities, online surveys and interviews with rightsholders. Representatives across all the six rights-holders categories participated in the audit. The audit outcomes have been analysed and the key areas of improvements have been identi/fied.\n\n## Prioritising safety\n\nTata Steel is committed to zero harm at the workplace, and the community at large. The Company's safety management system framework and robust governance structure are overseen by the Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Committee of the Board, working in tandem with the Apex Safety Council, led by the Chief Executive O/fficer & Managing Director.\n\nKey safety initiatives include building safety leadership capability at all levels, leveraging digital tools and technology, strengthening deployment of contractor safety management standards, improving competency and capability for hazard identi/fication and risk management, improving road and rail safety across the Company, excellence in Process Safety Management, establishing industrial hygiene, and improving occupational health.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nState-of-the-art Practical Safety Training Centre, Jamshedpur\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn FY2023-24, Tata Steel rolled out the revised Life Saving Rules, campaigns like 'Know Your Personal Protective Equipment' and 'Working at Height', and e-learning modules on safety standards to strengthen safety discipline in the workforce. All employees and vendors were included in the Safety Rewards and Recognition Policy. Felt Leadership 2.0 was launched to improve the safety leadership competency of associated companies, union leadership, and vendor partners.\n\nThe state-of-the-art Practical Safety Training Centre (PSTC) has been established in Jamshedpur, and addresses risk perception, while Safety Leadership Development Centres in Jamshedpur and IJmuiden are fully operational. These facilities are now being extended to Kalinganagar and Meramandali.\n\nDigital tools such as video analytics and system-based access control are used to ensure the secure handling of critical equipment, including electric\n\noverhead travelling cranes, conveyor belts, and wagon tipplers. Tata Steel received the World Steel Association's Safety and Health Excellence Recognition 2023 for real time visualisation of risk movement under the Process Safety category.\n\nIn India, the Safety Management System IT portal has been upgraded to EnsafeNxt, where mentioned digital alerts are also connected to uniform review and escalation mechanism. This transition introduced a user-friendly interface, coupled with advanced visualisation capabilities, ensuring easy data retrieval for end-users. The Company rolled out the integrated Safety Performance Index (SPI) to review the performance of departments across important safety key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nThe Company has made technological interventions such as the Driver Fatigue Monitoring System, Dala raised interlock and anti-tilt\n\nmechanisms across all dumpers covering 100% of heavy vehicles plying inside steelworks. The Company is in the process of developing an integrated command centre for e/ffective control over the /fleet through live monitoring of heavy vehicles. The Company ensured competency development of heavy vehicle drivers through simulator-based training facilities at Meramandali, West Bokaro, Joda, Noamundi, and Jamshedpur. As Tata Steel grows in size and complexity, the means to ensure zero harm shall increase and intensify, wherever the Company operates.",

Around 60% of the cost of crude steel is incurred till the hot metal stage, of which around 70% is attributed to coking coal.\n\nIn India, Tata Steel has six captive operating mines at Noamundi, Katamati, Joda East, Khondbond, Vijaya II and Koida. Given the planned Indian crude steel capacity expansion in the coming decade, the captive iron ore capacity also needs to be increased to remain self-reliant. Accordingly, the Gandhalpada and Kalamang iron ore leases plan to commence mining operations in the coming years. Additionally, the Company owns iron ore assets in Labrador and Northern Quebec regions of Canada.\n\n## 100%\n\n## Iron ore requirement met through captive mines in India\n\nApart from iron ore, around 19% of the clean coal requirement for our Indian operations is ful/filled by two operating open-cast pits in West Bokaro and three operating underground collieries in Jharia. The state-of-the-art coal washing plants with a 2 MTPA capacity in Jamadoba, 1 MTPA in Bhelatand, and 6.5 MTPA in West Bokaro, convert raw coal to clean coal used in the steelmaking process. Following the principles of circular economy, the by-products generated during clean coal production viz. middlings, tailings, and rejects, are sold for power generation. The water used for washing is recovered and recycled.\n\nFor manganese and chrome requirements, the Company has four operating manganese mines in Joda West, Khondbond, Tiringpahar, and Bamebari, and two operating chromite mines in Kamarda and Saruabil. Its ferroalloy processing plants at Joda, Bamnipal, Athagarh, Gopalpur, Jajpur,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand Balasore produce di/fferent types and grades of ferroalloys, i.e. ferrochrome, silico manganese and ferromanganese.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tata Steel is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of ferrochrome.\n\n## Key digitalisation initiatives in mining operations\n\nThe Company has undertaken several automation and digitalisation initiatives in the mining operation and bene/ficiation plants as well as logistics, including setting up networks for digital communication and data transfer, sensorisation of plant equipment and mining equipment. It has enabled the automatic capturing of data using the Internet of Things (IoT), remotecontrolled operations of equipment like conveyors and pumps, centralised monitoring of plant and mine operations, Suraksha Card, video analytics, online safety management plan, and digital mine mapping using drone survey and GIS-based technologies. Digital initiatives have resulted in signi/ficant improvement in managing the assets of the Company with better e/fficiency.\n\n## Committed to protecting the environment\n\nTata Steel Limited is dedicated to preserving the environment through its ongoing e/fforts to curb emissions, reduce, reuse, and recycle waste, conserve biodiversity, and promote circular economy. The Company's commitment is re/flected in its investment in various environmental initiatives aligned with the Tata Group-level environmental sustainability initiative 'Project Aalingana'. These encompass reducing air emissions, promoting nature-based solutions, increasing steel scrap usage, reducing water consumption, minimising waste through reuse and recycling, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninnovating processes to foster sustainable product manufacturing.

As part of the evaluation process, the Company's automotive /flat steel products underwent an end-to-end evaluation at every stage of their product lifecycle, leading to measurable environmental bene/fits.\n\n## c) Environment Product\n\nDisclosure (EPD): In India, Tata Steel has published EPD for steel rebars, steel hot rolled coils and steel structural hollow section, under the brand Tata Structura. In the coming years, it aims to receive eco-labels (GreenPro) and transparently disclose environmental performance for Tata Steel's key products manufactured across various sites to support its\n\ncustomers with product-related sustainability information.\n\nIn Europe, Tata Steel became the /first steel manufacturer globally to develop and operate an EPD programme. The programme covers the development of Type III environmental declarations in accordance with the requirements of EN 15804 and ISO 14025:2006. The programme is intended to support Tata Steel in communicating its environmental credentials of its products in a standardised manner.\n\n## Circular economy\n\n## Transition to scrap-based steelmaking in the UK and the Netherlands\n\nTata Steel is in discussion with the Dutch government about closing one of its two blast furnaces in the Netherlands by 2030 and replacing it with a direct reduced iron (DRI) electric arc furnace (EAF). It will increase the proportion of scrap in steel manufacturing at IJmuiden to 30%.\n\nTata Steel also signed an agreement in September 2023 with the UK Government on proposals to replace the two blast furnaces at Port Talbot with an EAF, reducing direct emissions of CO 2 by 50 MT over a decade.\n\nThe transition will enable scrap-based low-CO2 steelmaking by using locally available scrap in the region, thereby not only cutting down emissions but also ensuring the raw material self-su/fficiency of the domestic steel industries.\n\n## 50 MT\n\nReduction in direct emissions of CO 2 over a decade\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteel Recycling Plant, Rohtak\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steel recycling business\n\nIn India, the Steel Recycling Business (SRB) completed its second year of plant operations in FY2023-24, clocking nearly 340 KT despatch. The business has leveraged digital power to set up robust supply chains, as the collection and aggregation of scrap for the recycling plant entails reverse logistics. FerroHaat, a digital app, was launched to source steel scrap from scrapyards and has gained deep penetration in the supply chain. Over 180 vendors have been registered on the app for scrap supply.\n\nSRB is also responsible for sourcing and supplying the Company's entire scrap requirement in India. Besides supplying processed scrap from its Rohtak plant, it also supplies scrap from various sources across India. There has been a dedicated e/ffort to increase scrap charging in steel melting shops to reduce their carbon footprint. Multiple cross-functional strategy workshops have been conducted to develop a roadmap for securitising its long-term scrap requirement.\n\nBesides sustainability bene/fits, the SRB is also dovetailed with its long products growth strategy. It will cater to the scrap requirement of the upcoming EAF at Ludhiana, Punjab paving the way for sustainable steelmaking for the Company in India.",

These are key raw materials for various industries like cement, chemicals, construction, and power. In FY 2023-24, Tata Steel achieved 100% solid waste utilisation at Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar, Meramandali, and Gamharia. To promote sustainable construction, Tata Steel launched Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman, India's /first branded steel slag products, produced through a state-of-the-art integrated slag processing plant and accelerated weathering facility.\n\nAs a sustainable alternative to natural aggregates, these have been used extensively to construct national highways and urban and rural roads in India. Tata Steel has joined hands with the South Eastern Railway (SER) in FY2023-24 in India for the utilisation of the two products in the blanketing layer of railway tracks.\n\nThe Company has also developed a patented sustainable waste management technology for utilising BOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace) slag to manufacture a sulphur-rich nutrient supplement branded 'Dhurvi Gold'. Other key initiatives include a one-of-a-kind endeavour to convert the hazardous LD sludge into value-added pellets, develop a low-sulphur furnace oil from coal tar, and a greener alternative to crude coal tar usage in blast furnaces. Tata Steel has also developed eco-friendly light construction products such as green paver blocks and interlocking blocks, which are manufactured using iron and steel slags.\n\nKailash Top, Gamharia, Jamshedpur - a 30-acre ash mound transformed into a vibrant biodiversity park with 25,000 plants and shrubs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nTata Steel has persistently made e/fforts to improve its performance in biodiversity conservation and reduce its impact on the ecosystem. It endeavours to avoid, minimise, regenerate, restore and transform its biodiversity impact. In consultation with stakeholders and experts, the Company has developed Biodiversity Management Plans (BMPs) for 17 sites and plan to cover the remaining ones in the coming years.\n\nIn Jharia, Tata Steel has championed bamboo plantation in the leasehold and barren community land, aggregating to about 110 acres. A strong collaboration with farmers in the plantation areas generates new livelihood opportunities, reducing their vulnerability to climate change.\n\nThe water requirement is managed through treated wastewater from the captive e/ffluent treatment plant, realising the principle of circularity. In Jamshedpur, Tata Steel created a new 1-acre water body in the Sidhgora area, with a capacity of 10 million litres. In Meramandali, a 9.5-acre pond was renovated.  With a 25 million litres capacity, the water body touches the lives of approximately 600 people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Gamharia, a 30-acre barren ash mound within the plant premises was stabilised by developing a rich biodiversity park, Kailash Top, with around 25,000 plants and shrubs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata Steel's West Bokaro colliery in Jharkhand, India is spread over 1,740 Ha. This colliery operates 2 opencast mechanized coal mines along with coal bene/ficiation facility, accounting for ~3 MT of coking coal. The colliery faces signi/ficant challenges in relocating settlers and public infrastructure to free up land for mining, which is crucial for unlocking vast raw coal reserves and ensuring the continuity of mining operations. Over the past /five years, West Bokaro has successfully relocated ~2,500 families and 25 public institutions and unlocked ~12 MT of raw coal\n\nwhich would have otherwise been atrophied. In the next /five years, the focus will be on relocating an additional 1,500 families and 19 public infrastructure entities.\n\nIn FY2023-24, West Bokaro achieved its best annual relocation /figures by relocating 896 families and 3 public institutions and unlocked 0.84 MT of raw coal.\n\nAs mining operations expand, it has also become necessary to relocate Company's infrastructure. It's a proud moment to dedicate the New Union o/ffice and the New Tata Main Hospital at West Bokaro, which will contribute\n\ntowards Tata Steel's cultural legacy and class-leading healthcare services to the local communities. The state-ofthe art medical facilities, built with the support of Nest-In, has a capacity of 62 beds, along with ICUs, NICUs, and modular operation theatres.\n\nThe Company has shown commitment to bring back the ecological balance of the mined-out areas. The Company has achieved remarkable progress in restoring these areas and turning them into biodiversity parks such as the J N Tata Park and Sir Dorabji Tata Park.",

While it is the foundation of sustainable economic growth, the steel industry, like cement, power, chemical re/fining, airlines, etc. is a hard-to-abate sector from a climate change perspective.\n\n70% of global steel production occurs through the traditional blast furnace route using coal as a reductant. While cost-e/ffective and yielding high-quality output, the\n\nprocess creates a signi/ficant carbon footprint. Though the electric arc furnace production route, which utilises scrap which is comparatively sustainable, its range of value-added steel grades remains limited. The limited availability of scrap is also a challenge as most scrap metal is available in economically advanced regions, such as the US and Europe, which have a long history of infrastructure investment.\n\nSteel producers worldwide are confronted with /finding ways to reduce the emissions generated by steel production. These pathways will need to consider the availability of\n\nresources in speci/fic regions, ensure a fair transition for the ecosystem and supply chain, and provide a /financially viable and technologically sustainable solution.\n\nAs a responsible corporate citizen, Tata Steel places a strong emphasis on environmental, social and governance aspects in its corporate strategy. In the FY2022-23, the Company adopted the target to be Net Zero by 2045 across its operations. It aligns with the Tata Group target as part of 'Project Aalingana' and is an ambitious endeavour underlining the Company's strong commitment to\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRainwater harvesting park, Noamundi\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainability.

Several potential technology solutions are being evaluated and developed for decarbonisation of Tata Steel's steel operations globally. Given the options at various stages of development, and a bouquet of solutions is expected to emerge over the next decade for the India operations.\n\nTata Steel continues to promote circularity. Tata Steel UK has announced its decision to close its existing blast-furnace based heavy end operations and transition its entire steel production to a ~3 MTPA electric arc furnace (EAF) to be commissioned around end 2027, which will rely largely on available local scrap in the UK and reduce direct CO 2 emissions in its operations by ~5 MTPA. Tata Steel already operates electric arc furnacebased steelmaking facilities in Thailand, which recycle steel scrap and have a very low CO emission\n\n2\n\nintensity. The Company is setting up its /first scrap-based green/field EAF steelmaking facility in India, in Punjab. Tata Steel will also explore expanding the same process route to other locations in India.\n\nAs a founding member of TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), Tata Steel played a crucial role in developing the TCFD standard. It is also one of the /first companies in India to have adopted the recommendations of TCFD, pursuant to which it has undertaken extensive physical climate risk assessments and transition climate risk assessments using independent third-party experts across all its major steelmaking sites in line with the recommendations and incorporated them in its Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\nThis report discusses the four pillars of TCFD:\n\nGovernance\n\nStrategy\n\nRisk Management\n\nMetric & Targets",

Applying Industry 4.0 solutions to drive /financial and operational impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## India\n\nIndia is currently the secondlargest steel-producing country in the world. The National Steel Policy of India envisages 300 MT of annual steel production in India by 2030, and local demand is expected to continue increasing 4-5 times the current levels by the middle of this century. To capitalise on the opportunity, Tata Steel has a stated ambition to double its steelmaking capacity in India to 40 MTPA.\n\nIndia's growth trajectory poses decarbonisation challenges for the blast furnace-dominated domestic steel industry. The sparse availability of competitively priced low-carbon fuel (Green Hydrogen and Natural Gas) and the associated delivery infrastructure signi/ficantly constrain the viability of such technologies at scale.\n\nThe relatively low level of embedded steel within the country's steel-intensive assets like infrastructure, automotive, and consumer goods indicates a low rate of scrap recovery from the supply chain in the medium term, as end-of-life steel recovery will take time to mature.\n\nOn the other hand, local iron ore reserves present a more natural and viable input for steelmaking. Carbon capture and storage technologies are nascent, while technology solutions for substituting carbon in blast furnaces are at the pilot or concept stage.\n\nAs yet, India has no regulated market or de/fined allocation of carbon credits to industry, which is necessary to build an economic framework and the foundation for the investment thesis for decarbonisation. It may be noted that India has already introduced the requisite legislation for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nan Indian carbon market through The Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The Indian Carbon Market is being developed by the Bureau of Energy E/fficiency in India. Initially, it is expected to cover select sectors, including the iron and steel sector, and then gradually expand to cover other sectors. The form and coverage of the Indian Carbon Market are expected to play a crucial role in India's emission reduction trajectory.\n\nTata Steel's transition strategy will seek to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in India progressively and will take into consideration both the regulatory development and the Company's decarbonisation ambitions:\n\nUp to 2030\n\n- Installation and commissioning of modular scrap-based EAF plants strategically in India in scrap generating regions 1\n- Increasing the share of renewable energy in the power mix 2\n- Using higher amounts of scrap in its existing ore-based BOF steelmaking process assets 3\n- Reduction in use of coal by utilising lower CO 2 emission fuels such as biochar, natural gas, and coke oven gas 4\n- Piloting new low TRL (Technology Readiness Level) technologies in partnership with academia and OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) 5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUp to 2045\n\n- Continuing capacity addition in India using the scrap-based EAF route 1\n- Full replacement of any fossil-based grid power with renewable power in the mix 2\n- Addition of new and alternate ironmaking technologies like hydrogen/ gas-based DRI 3\n- Scale-up of HIsarna direct smelting technology 4\n- Scale-up of gas injection directly into blast furnaces to sharply reduce coal and coke use 5\n- Sustainable production, storage, and use of Green Hydrogen across the steel value chain 6\n- Upscaling pilots of Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and dovetailing with the existing processes 7\n- Developing value-added products using captured carbon. 8",

This arrangement will replace part of the existing coal-based power generation in the Company's Jamshedpur plant and cater to the Kalinganagar facility's requirements and the Ludhiana, Punjab, India EAF project.\n\nFurther, Tata Steel is in discussion with Tata Power Renewable Energy Limited to set up a captive solar power plant with 70 MW capacity in the state of Maharashtra. This project will generate ~17 MW of renewable power and reduce 115 kilotonnes of carbon annually. This will make ~49% of Tarapur and Khopoli power green. With this, Tata Steel Limited's total installed captive renewable power capacity will be\n\n1,036 MW, meeting around 16% power requirement.\n\nTata Steel also completed a /first-inthe-world trial of hydrogen injection in the E Blast Furnace in Jamshedpur, of up to 40% of injection capacity for 3.5 days.\n\nAs part of its ongoing e/fforts to decarbonise the steel sector, Tata Steel announced 'Tata Steel - Sprint to Zero' 2023 Challenge, an initiative to fund innovative research and development projects in low carbon hydrogen that o/ffers tech-led or tech-enabled solutions to address green hydrogen technologies for the industrial sector's sustainable future. The announcement is part of the UK-India Hydrogen Partnerships, which builds on the UK-India Hydrogen Hub announced by the UK and Indian Prime Ministers in 2022. Tata Steel is the /first sponsor of the UK-India Hydrogen Partnerships sprint series to support innovative projects in low-carbon hydrogen. The Company will also o/ffer experiential engagement to selected entities as part of the Challenge, including priority access to its integrated steel plants.\n\nTata Steel has become the /first Indian steel company to join hands with the Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), aiming to collaborate with countries and companies striving to achieve Net Zero emissions in heavy industry. Backed by the World Economic Forum, LeadIT was instituted by the governments of Sweden and India during the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019. This collaboration allows Tata Steel to gain valuable insights, best practices, and innovative ideas related to sustainable practices and green technologies in the steel sector.\n\nTata Steel and ABB have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to co-create innovative models and technologies to help reduce steel production's carbon footprint. ABB will bring global experience in automation,\n\nelectri/fication, and digitalisation to the mining and metals industries.\n\nAs part of scrap recycling in steelmaking, Tata Steel is increasing its share of scrap utilisation across Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar, Meramandali, and Gamharia. Using the short sea route, Tata Steel launched the Multimodal Service to streamline the scrap supply chain and move scrap from Chennai to Tata Steel sites. It is a /first-of-itskind green supply chain solution to containerise scrap movement on the east coast of India.\n\nTata Steel also received the /first batch of deliveries of next-generation, greenfuel-powered commercial vehicles, including Prima tractor-trailers, tippers, and the Ultra EV bus, all powered by low and emission-free technologies - LNG and electric batteries. The green-fuelpowered vehicle will address the Scope 3 emissions in road transportation and reduce 0.74 kg CO 2 /km using Electric Vehicles (EV) and 0.13 kg CO 2 /km using LNG.\n\nTata Steel is also evaluating the feasibility of investments in gas-based DRI production, using natural gas, coke oven gas, or syngas from coal gasi/fication as a transitional technology until cost-competitive Green Hydrogen becomes available.\n\nTata Steel has completed pilot projects at Tata Steel Meramandali and Tata Steel Nederland which makes use of E-Liability carbon accounting methodology. This methodology, developed by Prof Robert S Kaplan and Prof Karthik Ramanna, aims to help companies tackle ESG reporting in a more targeted and auditable way by measuring GHG emissions at a product level rather than an entity level. It thereby goes beyond the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and uses traditional accounting principles for carbon accounting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommitted to sustainability, Tata Steel Nederland\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Europe\n\nTata Steel aims to achieve a CO2 reduction of about 40% as early as 2030 for its steelmaking site in IJmuiden, the Netherlands. For Tata Steel Nederland downstream sites, the ambition is to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nThe Company is engaged in a transformational project to replace its existing heavy-end iron and steelmaking assets at Port Talbot in the UK with an EAF. The transformation is expected to reduce direct emissions from the site by approximately 5 MT and reduce the direct CO2 emissions per tonne of crude steel production by over than 90%. This transformation represents a huge stride forward for Tata Steel UK in meeting its Net Zero by 2045 ambition.\n\nDriven by a combination of government action and the increasing expectations of customers and broader society, the pressure to decarbonise its steelmaking operations has been felt keenly in the UK and the Netherlands. The Dutch and the UK governments seek leadership positions in global climate action. The European Commission adopted its 'Fit for 55' package of proposals in 2021 to align the EU's climate, energy, land use, transport, and taxation policies with the legal objective of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990. Since then, the EU institutions have increased the stringency of the cornerstone EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).\n\nAlso, in speci/fic industry sectors (cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electric energy production, hydrogen, iron and steel, some precursors, and a limited number of downstream products), free allocation of EU ETS will be gradually phased out. It is due to the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a new measure to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage as the EU ramps up its climate ambition.\n\nThe United Kingdom was amongst the /first countries to legislate for Net Zero by 2050 and, in early 2021, announced its acceptance of the recommendations of its statutory advisory committee on climate change (UKCCC) to ensure (i) the UK achieves a 78% reduction in emissions by 2035 (compared to 1990) and (ii) that orebased steelmaking in the UK achieves 'near-zero' emissions by 2035. In 2023, the UK government announced that it would tighten emissions reduction trajectory across the traded sector (i.e., those in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS)) in line with its Net Zero by 2050 legislation, which equates to a ~53% reduction in emissions by 2030 compared to 2019. It has also announced its commitment to a robust suite of measures to mitigate carbon leakage, including a UK CBAM, mandatory product standards, and measures to grow market demand for low-carbon products. The UK CBAM is expected to be e/ffective from 2027.\n\nTata Steel understands that CBAMs for the EU and UK are vital to ensure a level playing /field for steel producers in those regions while governments are pursuing climate policies that increase the cost of emitting CO2. The precise design of CBAM requires careful attention to ensure that the extra costs faced by steel producers in the EU and UK do not cause the relocation of steel production and steel-intensive manufacturing to countries and regions of the world with little or no cost of emitting CO2. At the same time, it is essential that a level playing /field be maintained between the UK and the EU.\n\nTata Steel is committed to working closely with policymakers to deliver a profoundly signi/ficant contribution to achieving national emissions reduction aspirations. The Group's emission reduction commitments, participation in global initiatives and other actions to date are evidence of this. Across Europe, there is a growing recognition that steelmakers need government support to decarbonise. Steelmakers and governments in several countries are working together to develop their decarbonisation plans, with such discussions covering a selection of suitable technology, access to abundant, green energy supply and infrastructure at a competitive price, possible /fiscal support from the national governments, and the need to create",

The agreement between Tata Steel and the UK Government to co-invest in the transition to EAF steelmaking at Port Talbot represents a milestone in joint decarbonisation e/fforts by a steel company and national Government.\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nTata Steel's steel manufacturing plant at IJmuiden, in the Netherlands, has two blast furnaces with a steelmaking capacity of 7 MTPA. Through consistent energy e/fficiency and process improvements since 1990, the plant has reduced approximately 15% of its CO 2 emissions per tonne of steel. With its CO 2 intensity being 7% lower than the European average, the IJmuiden plant is one of the most CO 2 e/fficient steel plants in the world (among the top three as per the World Steel Association benchmark).\n\nTata Steel has made a public commitment in the Netherlands to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 5 MT by 2030 through an accelerated transition process.\n\nIn November 2023, Tata Steel presented the updated Green Steel Plan to the government, covering the following three key objectives:\n\nClean: In the Netherlands, Tata Steel intends to prioritise reducing particulate matter and nitrogen dioxides. In addition to measures already being taken to reduce particulate matter, the Green Steel Plan contains non-statutory measures to cover raw material storage. These canopies prevent the drift of /fine and coarse dust. Tata Steel is already implementing measures to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, such as constructing a large DeNOx installation at the Pellet Factory, which will be operational in 2025, reducing NOx emissions by around 80% versus its 2019 baseline.\n\nIJmuiden plant, the Netherlands - one of the most CO 2 e/fficient steel plants in the world\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreen: From 2030 onwards, Tata Steel Nederland intends to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 5 MT, annually. To achieve this, the Company plans to replace Blast Furnace 7 and Coking and Gas Plant 2 (to be closed by 2029) with a Direct Reduced Iron Plant (DRP) combined with an electric arc furnace. The DRP will initially run on natural gas. As cost-competitive hydrogen becomes available in su/fficient quantity, the plant would be able to run on hydrogen without any modi/fication. The iron from this DRP will be used in the EAF and supplemented with scrap in a much larger quantity than currently used in the IJmuiden plant.\n\nCircular: By 2030, the Company plans to increase the use of scrap in the IJmuiden plant to approximately 30% of total annual production. Thus, it will become less dependent on primary raw materials and more supportive of the circular economy principles.\n\nThe Green Steel Plan is a signi/ficant move towards reducing environmental and climate impact as quickly as possible. It will probably be the most prominent industrial transition in the Netherlands in the coming years. Tata Steel is discussing the Green Steel Plan with the Ministry of Economic A/ffairs, the province of North Holland, and simultaneously engaging with suppliers, customers, the local community, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Green Steel Plan entails signi/ficant investment by Tata Steel and can succeed only with policy\n\nand /financial support from the government. With the submission of the plan, a new phase has begun in the discussion between Tata Steel and the Dutch government, and both parties will continue to discuss and negotiate to reach a /final agreement for its implementation.\n\nTata Steel has introduced Zeremis\u00ae Carbon Lite - steel with an allocated carbon footprint reduction of up to 90%, gaining traction among customers in various industries, including automotive, construction, and new mobility sectors. Tata Steel has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Snop and Gedia for the long-term steel supply with a lower environmental footprint. Initially, Tata Steel intends to provide Gedia with Zeremis\u00ae Carbon Lite steel, with an allocated carbon footprint reduction of up to 90%. Tata Steel will provide Zeremis\u00ae-embodied green steel when the IJmuiden steelworks adopts its new steelmaking route.\n\nTata Steel has also launched Zeremis\u00ae Delivered, which allows customers to receive their steel orders through lower-emission transportation methods. The service enables customers to reduce their Scope 3 emissions and other emissions linked to the transportation of steel. Under the Zeremis\u00ae Delivered brand, the Company has introduced a broad range of zero-emission logistics solutions across modalities such as battery electri/fication and fuel cell technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata Steel has signed an agreement with Swedish metal company Boliden to procure low-carbon zinc, which has one of the lowest CO 2 footprints of any re/fined zinc globally. According to Boliden, the supplied zinc emits less than 1 tonne of CO 2 per tonne of zinc, compared to the industry average of 3.6 tonnes.\n\nTata Steel has also completed over thirty environmental investments from the Roadmap Plus programme to reduce air emissions, including dust and noise pollution at IJmuiden. For example, three new dedusting installations were implemented in IJmuiden at the beginning of 2024. In the Pellet Plant at IJmuiden, a dustremoval installation was /fitted. With this expansion, Tata Steel expects to reduce emissions of particulate matter, lead and other heavy metals by approximately 80% at the Pellet Plant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn February 2024, Tata Steel started two major projects as part of the Roadmap Plus improvement programme:\n\n- \u00bb DeNOx installation at the pellet plant will capture NOx compounds and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% versus a 2019 baseline.\n- \u00bb An 18-metre high and 1,000-metre long windbreaker to reduce dust emissions from raw material storage.\n\nTata Steel Nederland has also completed the pilot project, which makes use of E-Liability carbon accounting methodology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata Steel UK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The United Kingdom\n\nOn September 15, 2023, Tata Steel announced that it had reached an agreement with the UK government on proposals that would see the two blast furnaces at Port Talbot replaced with an electric arc furnace (EAF). The EAF and associated investments will cost \u00a31.25 billion. The UK government will pay \u00a3500 million, and Tata Steel will fund the balance. To be able to deliver the proposed electric arc furnace by 2027, Tata Steel has begun engineering design work and construction planning for a furnace that would be among the most modern in the world.\n\nThe project will bolster the UK's steel security and be the /first leap towards decarbonising the UK steel industry, potentially reducing direct carbon emissions by 5 MTPA, a 90% reduction in direct emissions. It will also be transformational regarding the UK's progress towards a more circular economy, leveraging domestically available scrap steel and promoting value addition.\n\nSubsequently, after seven months of formal and informal national-level discussions with the UK trade unions, Tata Steel has announced its decision to proceed with closure of the existing\n\nheavy-end assets. The two Blast Furnaces, No.5 and No.4, at Port Talbot will close by the end of June 2024 and September 2024, respectively. Following the closure of Blast Furnace No.4, the remaining heavy-end assets will wind down.\n\nDuring the transition period and project phase, Tata Steel will ensure uninterrupted and reliable product supply to ful/fil customer and market commitments, through the import of hot rolled coil and slabs from stable and responsible supply chains, including its plants in India and the Netherlands, to feed its downstream units.\n\nTata Steel has already progressed the EAF investment programme to an advanced engineering stage and expects to place equipment orders by September 2024. Based on current timelines, construction on the project will begin by August 2025. Tata Steel has also accepted a revised and updated connection o/ffer from National Grid, the UK's power infrastructure company, ensuring it will have the power infrastructure to commission the EAF on schedule by the end of 2027.",

The incentivising green steel premia available to early movers is also attractive. Tata Steel looks to capitalise on the opportunity and increase its product portfolio's share of advanced high-strength steel grades and green steel.\n\n## Green infrastructure\n\nSteel is essential to green electricity generation, storage, and transmission. It is used in wind turbines, transmission and distribution infrastructure, hydropower, nuclear power plants, battery manufacturing, and transportation of green fuel (e.g. green hydrogen pipelines). Tata Steel is conscious of the global transition to green energy and is constantly building a product portfolio to support the demand from the green industrial revolution.\n\n## Cost reduction and optimisation opportunities\n\nTata Steel consistently invests in renewable energy infrastructure to replace fossil fuel-derived energy. With the carbon-related regulatory framework maturing across Europe, decarbonising its value chain will also reduce the Company's compliance cost associated with emissions trading schemes. Tata Steel is also working on a sustainable /finance framework that would reduce the cost of /financing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D. Metrics and targets\n\nThe long-term decarbonisation roadmap is based not only on compliance with national targets in local geographies but also on the Company's commitment to Net Zero by 2045.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nTata Steel reports its emissions per the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol, a sector-agnostic emission reporting methodology that helps investors make capital allocation decisions across sectors. It has been prepared by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and is the world's most widely used greenhouse gas\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe World Steel Association has recognised Tata Steel as a 2024 Steel Sustainability Champion for the seventh consecutive year. It was a founder participant in WSA's Climate Action programme and has been recognised as an accredited Climate Action member ever since. It has developed sector-leading expertise in life cycle assessment. This tool enables it to understand the CO 2 impacts of products holistically, taking account of emissions from raw material extraction through production and use of /finished products, such as buildings to the end of life. It is the /first steel company globally to become an operator of its own Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) programme, through which it produces EPDs that\n\naccounting standard for companies. The use of the GHG Protocol has also been recommended by the standards issued by the International Sustainability Standards Boards (ISSB) under the IFRS Foundation, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), and the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Protocol).\n\nTata Steel also reports its emission intensity based on the World Steel Association (WSA) guidelines. These guidelines were initially derived from the GHG Protocol methodology and have been explicitly designed for and widely adopted by the steel sector. The guidelines provide for site-wise emission reporting by steel companies based on standard de/finitions and agreed-upon boundaries. The data\n\nare shared with customers to enable them to understand the carbon and other environmental impacts associated with Tata Steel products.\n\nResponsibleSteel TM is the steel industry's /first global multistakeholder standard and certi/fication initiative. It works with steel producers, consumers, and intermediaries to build a sustainable steel industry by addressing pressing challenges, including climate change, diversity, human rights, and more.\n\nTata Steel continues to lead the way in sustainable steel production as its Kalinganagar and Meramandali plants received the prestigious ResponsibleSteel TM Certi/fication in FY2023-24. It marks a signi/ficant milestone in the Company's\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncollection programme enables individual steel plants to compare themselves against the sector's average and best performance and identify the scope for improvement.\n\nTata Steel has adopted a standard and consistent set of emission metrics and targets across its global operations.\n\n## KPI\n\n- \u00bb Total emission, Scope 1, 2 and 3, as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n- \u00bb Emission intensity per tonne of crude steel, as per the WSA methodology.\n\n## Target\n\n- \u00bb Net Zero by 2045\n\nsustainability journey, following Jamshedpur's historic achievement as the /first Indian steel plant to receive the certi/fication in 2022. In India, Tata Steel now has more than 90% of its steel production from ResponsibleSteel TM certi/fied sites.\n\nTata Steel has a long, unbroken record of annual disclosure to CDP. Its most recent disclosure in 2023 secured a rating of A-, placing it very close to the top within steel sector listings. Tata Steel's performance on its key performance indicators has been disclosed in the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report and the ESG Factsheet, included in the Company's Integrated Report for FY2023-24.",

Consolidated emissions of FY2023-24 are aggregated based on 'Operational Control' approach (i.e. included full emissions of parent company and subsidiaries irrespective of equity held by Tata Steel Limited).\n- 1.e Equity-consolidated emissions of /five key joint ventures are included under 'Investment' category (Scope 3 as per GHG Protocol Value Chain Standard). Till FY2022-23, the emissions were consolidated on equity basis with JVs included in mainstream Scope 1&2 emissions.\n- 1.f Presence of power generation assets within consolidated boundary results in lower Scope 2 emissions than Scope 2 emissions of standalone boundary.\n\nNote 1: Worldsteel methodology allows credits due to export of various co-products /by-products (incl. process gases). No credits are included in GHG Protocol estimation under Scope 2 and 3.\n\n- Note 2: Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel consolidated numbers have been corrected and updated for FY2019-20 to FY2021-22.\n\n##

The reporting period for various indicators ranges from 1 - 3 years and is aligned with the prescribed SEBI format.\n- 8. FY2023-24 was one of the more volatile years for Tata Steel due to the merger of several large subsidiary companies, continued stabilisation of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, relining of one of the two blast furnaces at Tata Steel Nederland, and increased activity undertaken for the ongoing 5 MTPA expansion at Kalinganagar. Actual production was also di/fferent year-on-year, which had a direct impact on the operational indicators.\n- 9. In view of the mergers during FY2023-24, the reporting boundaries for FY2022-23 have been revised to ensure comparability of FY2023-24 /figures to that of FY2022-23 /figures.",

Name of Assurance Provider\n\nTata Steel Limited has appointed Price Waterhouse & Co Chartered Accountants LLP (PW & Co CA LLP) for assurance on BRSR Core indicators and selected indicators in the Annual Integrated Report.\n\n## 15.  Type of Assurance Obtained\n\nPW & Co CA LLP has undertaken reasonable assurance of the BRSR Core indicators on a standalone basis for FY2023-24. Tata Steel has opted to voluntarily disclose the BRSR core indicators on a consolidated basis for the select entities as mentioned above. In addition, PW & Co CA LLP has also undertaken the assurance on a standalone basis unless otherwise stated, of select environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators, which are part of the ESG factsheet published in the Company's Integrated Report.\n\nReasonable Assurance Report on BRSR Core indicators & select indicators of ESG factsheet and Limited Assurance Report on select indicators of ESG factsheet issued by PW & Co CA LLP are annexed to Tata Steel's Integrated Report for FY2023-24 and accessible on the link: https://www.tatasteel.com/investors/integrated-reportannual-report/\n\nIt is to be noted that Tata Steel's key subsidiary companies, Tata Steel UK Limited and Tata Steel Nederland BV, are in the middle of signi/ficant restructuring due to the planned transition to low carbon steelmaking. As a result, while Tata Steel has undergone assurance on a standalone basis, it has also adopted a pathway to undertake assurance on a consolidated basis over the next 2 to 3 years.\n\n## II.

A sizable number is engaged to carryout expansion projects, including that at Kalinganagar.\n\nNote 2: 'Permanent Employees' (E) includes Permanent Workers (G). 'Permanent employees' includes all personnel on rolls of the Company excluding those on /fixed term contract, who are covered under 'Other than Permanent employees' (F). Permanent workers (G) are on rolls of the Company but do not perform managerial or administrative role.\n\nNote 3: 'Others' includes 87 transgender personnel in case of Permanent workers, also included in Permanent employees. Other than Permanent workers include 64 workers overseas without gender bifurcation.\n\nTata Steel is in the process of expanding its crude steel capacity in India. The phased commissioning of 5 MTPA expansion at Kalinganagar is ongoing and intends to produce 1.7 million tonnes of crude steel in FY2024-25. The contract workforce engaged by the Company is instrumental in timely and cost-e/fficient project execution, as it provides /flexibility and supplements the skillset of the permanent workforce. By ensuring process e/fficiency and agile execution, the contract workforce enables Tata Steel to remain resilient in a dynamic environment.\n\nThe Company values their role in its output and achieving its long-term goals. Thus, recognising their contribution to the Company's exceptional performance in FY2022-23, Tata Steel - as a pioneering step - gave the employees of its vendor partners, working in the Company's establishments in India, an ex gratia reward.\n\nThe Company acknowledges the importance of building a future-ready culture as a lever to achieve its Strategic Objectives. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are recognised as the pillars of the aspired organisational culture. To achieve the goal of a 20% diverse workforce in Tata Steel Limited by 2025, the Company has identi/fied four focus areas for intervention:\n\n## i) Women\n\nThe metals & mining sector, due to its structural bottlenecks, traditionally had a low female participation in its workforce. Despite best intentions and concerted e/fforts, progress has been slow due to deeply entrenched stereotypes and a lack of female role models. Tata Steel has consistently worked towards changing the scenario by breaking the stereotypes and the glass ceiling.\n\n- \u00bb Tata Steel Limited is the /first company in India to deploy women in all shifts in mines. The Women@Mines programme provides technical training to unskilled women workers and enable them to work in core jobs in mines.\n- \u00bb Under the 'Flames of Change' initiative, Tata Steel Limited recruited 23 women to create the /first-ever crew of female /fire/fighters in the steel industry in India.",

In December 2021, Tata Steel Limited became the /first Indian company to open core mining operations to the transgender community.\n\n- \u00bb In March 2024, Tata Steel Limited welcomed a new group of 14 transgender employees as Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) Operator Trainees in its West Bokaro mining operations.

Complaints/Grievances on any of the Principles (Principles 1 to 9) under the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct:\n\n## Stakeholder Group Grievance Redressal Mechanism in Place\n\n## Communities\n\nYes, Tata Steel has grievance redressal mechanisms, underpinned by the Tata Code of Conduct, in place to address grievances of all key stakeholder groups across all geographies, including communities. The grievance mechanisms are designed based on location speci/fic requirements, so as to be most e/ffective.\n\nTata Steel Foundation (TSF), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tata Steel Limited, is responsible for driving community engagement processes in the operational areas of Tata Steel Limited in India. It involves regular interactions with the community, subgroups, and local stakeholders to address and resolve grievances. TSF has implemented initiatives in over 5,000 villages across Jharkhand and Odisha, impacting over 4 million lives in FY2023-24. It has a team of over 1,400 people working on impactdriven initiatives that focus on developing tribal and excluded communities with a process of co-creation. These initiatives are change models that can be replicated at regional and national scales. TSF embeds societal perspectives in key business processes to create value and long-term social capital.\n\nTSF has created a grievance redressal ecosystem that facilitates input from communities in and around Tata Steel Limited's sites. This ecosystem ensures real-time information /flow concerning Tata Steel's Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives. It enables issues to emerge before they even reach the grievance stage requiring redressal. The ecosystem consists of the following:\n\n- 1. The contact numbers and names of Unit Heads and Key Personnel are prominently displayed in all TSF o/ffices and in various publicly accessible places. This has resulted in the easy and immediate approachability of TSF's senior leadership to anyone from the community. The TSF leadership team receives regular feedback regarding TSF's work on the ground, ensuring corrective action is taken in advance and concerns are addressed.\n- 2. TSF o/ffices across various regions are accessible to the local communities and stakeholders who frequently visit the team to discuss their issues. In these meetings, community members' concerns are addressed at length, and their feedback on the work done by TSF is considered. This feedback is a valuable source of continuous learning that enables the team to identify lessons and prevent the recurrence of similar grievances in the future. By understanding the dynamic ecosystem well, the team can adapt and implement initiatives, prioritising them based on the list of addressed gaps.\n- 3. Tata Steel Limited has established forums that involve the participation of community representatives and citizens. These forums are designed to follow a participatory approach rather than a formal grievance redressal system. This approach ensures a free /flow of input and enables understanding of di/fferent perspectives and concerns. Hence, these forums help to create a deep two-way relationship between the Company and the communities. Some of the key forums are:\n- a) Scheduled Tribe Stakeholder's Council\n- b) Scheduled Caste Stakeholder's Council\n- c) Citizens' Forum of Jamshedpur\n\nTSF deeply engages with communities and Panchayats to implement Tata Steel's CSR initiatives. This involves continuous interactions and feedback to the TSF team. Local recruits act as a bridge between the Company and communities, addressing grievances promptly and comprehensively.\n\nTSF teams have an in-built mechanism where the /field sta/ff, programme team, and unit heads regularly communicate with individuals and groups within the communities and other stakeholders. This ensures that any grievances are brought to the attention of senior management. Additionally, the mechanism is supported by regular interactions between the communities and other stakeholders, the thematic and geographic heads of TSF and the TSF leadership team.\n\nTSF team members conduct interactive sessions during visits to listen to complaints and provide assistance. They identify complaint-prone areas, study them, and implement remedial measures. Outcome monitoring is carried out to ensure timely and strategic grievance redressal.\n\nPublic hearings are crucial in obtaining environmental clearance for projects. The Company conducts public hearings regularly to listen to community concerns. Based on feedback, it takes up projects as commitments to address issues raised by stakeholders and communities.\n\nSimilarly, Tata Steel has intensi/fied communication with the community in the Netherlands to address concerns among residents and employees who often live nearby. Employees from neighbourhood towns often receive many questions from their community. Tata Steel regularly updates its employees so that they can, in turn, update their respective communities.\n\nResidents a/ffected by disturbances from the Company's operations in IJmuiden can report them to Tata Steel through multiple channels, including the information desk in Wijk aan Zee, by phone, or by using a complaint form on the Tata Steel Nederland's website. All complaints are investigated. The Company aims to trace the possible source of disturbance promptly and speci/fically on the premises and take necessary measures as quickly as possible.\n\nBased on various data measurements and complaints, processes are improved wherever feasible. For instance, it has been observed that noise disturbances are primarily associated with incidents such as impacts and collisions, as well as annoying sounds like whistling, humming, and buzzing. To determine possible noise sources, the Company has installed, for example, sound meters on cranes involved in scrap processing. When it comes to measures to reduce noise, it investigates the possibility of building dampers in certain installations.",

It however, receives a number of complaints from members of the public living in the proximity of its Port Talbot steelworks. The Company values the feedback it receives from the local community and takes the concerns of neighbours seriously. It undertook a large-scale survey of the public in Port Talbot during 2023 to generate feedback on the processes it uses to address public concerns.

Awareness programmes conducted for value chain partners on any of the principles during the /financial year:\n\nTata Steel takes several initiatives to create awareness amongst its value chain partners on key issues related to the 9 Principles of the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct. Most of the awareness programmes conducted for value chain partners can be broadly classi/fied into three segments, i.e., Safety, Ethics and Business Responsibility:\n\n- a. Safety: Tata Steel's goal is to achieve 'Zero Harm' and to become an industry leader in Safety and Health performance. The Company has taken several measures in this direction:\n- \u00bb Enunciated safety policies that provide clear direction.\n- \u00bb Created a sound safety governance structure.\n- \u00bb Established robust management and reporting systems.\n- \u00bb Created training and communication mechanisms.\n- \u00bb De/fined performance measures and indicators to track its Safety and Health performance.\n\nThese measures extend to employees, workers, and all value chain partners who enter the Company's sites. All individuals, including contract employees working with vendor partners, need to undergo compulsory safety training to enter Tata Steel's plants. This ensures a shared understanding of safety risks and principles between all personnel present on the site.\n\n- b. Ethics: Tata Steel's vendor partners frequently undergo awareness sessions on the Company's Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, the Tata Code of Conduct, and the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy. Key topics covered under these awareness sessions include Governance, Ethics, Health and Safety, Labour Practices, and Human Rights.",

        "page_content": "- c. Supply Chain Responsibility: All Tata Steel's supplier partners in India are signatory to Tata Steel Business Associate Code of Conduct (TSBACoC ) which outlines the ESG standards required for conducting business with Tata Steel, covering essential areas such as regulatory compliance, bribery and corruption, health and safety, human rights, environmental protection, asset protection, third-party representation, violation reporting, and con/flict of interest. Tata Steel has launched its RSCP Programme across multiple geographies. The programme covers issues related to ethical behaviour, human rights, health & safety, and environmental sustainability, amongst others. For all key entities of the Tata Steel Group, 100% of suppliers are made aware of Tata Steel's RSCP through various training programmes. The critical suppliers de/fined using ResponsibleSteel TM guidelines are evaluated by a third-party according to the minimum expectations of the policy and categorised from 'Basic' to 'Leading' based on their performance. During FY2023-24, the Company assessed 216 critical suppliers in India. It conducts trainings and webinars to educate all critical suppliers on the four principles of RSCP. The gaps/opportunities for improvement are identi/fied through the third-party assessments. Through the Vendor Capability Advancement Programme (VCAP), Tata Steel collaborates with the suppliers to take up improvement projects to enhance their productivity, safety standards, delivery e/fficiency, product quality, and sustainability performance by sharing best practices and enabling cross learning.\n- 2. Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage con/flict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same.\n\nYes, Tata Steel has the Tata Code of Conduct for all members of Tata Steel's Board, which requires all Directors of the Company to always act in the interest of the Company and ensure that any other business or personal association which they may have does not involve any con/flict of interest with the operations of the Company. In case of any actual or potential con/flicts of interest, the concerned Director is required to immediately report such con/flicts and seek approvals as required by the applicable law and under Company's policies.\n\nThe Company receives an annual declaration from its Board of Directors and all employees con/firming adherence to the Code of Conduct, which includes the provisions on dealing with con/flict of interest.\n\n## Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.\n\n## Essential Indicators\n\n- 1.

Tata Steel also provides process research and support to ironmaking, steelmaking, and casting and takes a leading role in decarbonising the UK's steelmaking processes.\n- vii. The Tata Steel Imperial Centre for Innovation for collaborative research in Sustainable Design and Manufacturing with Imperial College London, UK was established.\n\nviii. The Centre for Innovation in Advanced Materials has been established at The Henry Royce Institute, UK.\n\nThe Company has leveraged digital tools and technologies in the areas of energy management, supply chain management, environment management, employee health and safety, and customer engagement, etc. In the process, Tata Steel has built strong in-house arti/ficial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, leveraging mathematical modelling to drive YETQP (Yield, Energy, Throughput, Quality, and Productivity) gains across the value chain. Some of the key digital initiatives and technologies adopted by the Company are digital solutions for energy management, digital supply chain management, far-site remote operation centres, and physically delinking workplace and work.\n\nTata Steel has been recognised as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) Global Lighthouse by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for three steel manufacturing sites - Kalinganagar and Jamshedpur in India and IJmuiden in the Netherlands. The recognition is given to manufacturing sites that are worldwide beacons for achieving e/fficiency and driving value through digital transformation. Over 75% of Tata Steel's entire steel production is through WEF-recognised Global Lighthouse sites, one of the highest in the world.\n\n## 2 a.  Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No)\n\nYes, Tata Steel has a Responsible Supply Chain Policy (RSCP) for its key operations, which applies to all supply chain partners. All our supplier partners are also signatory to the Tata Steel Business Associate Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Responsible Supply Chain policy encourages our suppliers to share Tata Steel's commitment on embedding sustainable and focusses on the following four principles:\n\n- i. Health and safety: Tata Steel expects its suppliers to adopt management practices in health and safety that provide a high level of safeguard for their workers.\n- ii. Fair business practices: The business associate code of conduct outlines the ethical standards and fair business practices by which Tata Steel conducts its business, and the Company expects its suppliers to adopt similar principles.\n- iii. Environmental protection: Tata Steel expects suppliers to maintain e/ffective policies, processes, and procedures to manage their environmental impact.",

        "page_content": "- iv. Human rights: Tata Steel expects suppliers to develop and implement policies and procedures to promote and protect human rights in their business and across their value chain.\n\nAll our key suppliers are assessed at a pre-de/fined frequency on the RSCP principles, and our supplier are classi/fied into 5 maturity bands ranging from Basic to Improving , Established, Mature and Leading. The gaps and opportunities identi/fied for improvement during the RSCP assessment is shared with our supplier partners which enables them to take up collaborative projects and share best practices to bridge the same. As a next step, a 4-step sustainable procurement framework has also been developed in the direction of integrating sustainability in the buying decisions and will be piloted in some key buys in FY'25. The 4 steps are:\n\n- a) Planning/product selection ESG risks within our supply chain are identi/fied and a comprehensive understanding is developed on the sustainable products and suppliers (suppliers with ResponsibleSteel or equivalent certi/fications) in the market.\n- b) Vendor selection During the vendor selection phase, only those vendors who have successfully quali/fied our assessment process will be considered for future business.\n- c) Evaluation and contract issuance The sustainability performance of our suppliers will be assessed and incentives will be provided to those who demonstrate superior performance.\n- d) Contract Management Sustainability requirements will be integrated into the contract documents and mechanisms established for performance monitoring\n\nAs a member of ResponsibleSteel TM , Tata Steel also promotes and recognises other relevant programmes, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative, amongst its suppliers. Since 2019, Tata Steel Nederland has also been a member of the Metal Covenant, an initiative of the Social and Economic Council, where the government, unions, non-governmental organisations, and companies collaborate on the implementation of the OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct and work on improving conditions in the metals value chain.\n\nIn the UK, in FY2023-24, Tata Steel had a procurement spent of ~\u00a31.2 billion with approximately 2,500 'active' vendors of which 625 vendors, had been quali/fied or re-quali/fied through SAP Ariba which includes alignment with the Company's Responsible Supply Chain Policy. 100% of Tata Steel UK vendors are made aware of the policy during their onboarding process. The Company is currently in the process of developing Tata Steel UK Responsible Sourcing & Modern Slavery Policies.\n\n## b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?\n\nAll suppliers of Tata Steel must declare their commitments to Tata Steel's sustainability expectations during registration.100% of Tata Steel's inputs in India are sourced from suppliers who commit to its guiding principles by providing declarations during the vendor onboarding /registration phase.\n\nIn the UK, 94% of the suppliers have committed to Tata Steel's RSCP. In the Netherlands, 48% of Tata Steel's inputs are sourced through suppliers who commit to the guiding principles or equivalent.\n\n## 3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.\n\nSteel has a very long useful life (typically 25 to 30 years) due to its durability before it needs to be scrapped and recycled. Steel is ideally suited to a circular economy: it is durable and /flexible with a long lifespan, provides many opportunities for its reuse and product life extension, is easily recovered and recycled after scrapping due to its magnetic properties, and can produce new steel using well-proven low-carbon technology. Steel is the only genuinely cradle-to-cradle recycled material, and end-of-life steel, or scrap steel, is not considered a waste product by the steel industry. Instead, it is regarded as an input for steelmaking by remelting and is a globally traded commodity.\n\nTata Steel is committed to circularity and looks to maximise the use of steel scrap in its operations. Accordingly, Tata Steel reuses scrap generated during the production process as well as procures external scrap. In FY2023-24, Tata Steel recycled around 4.3 million tonnes of scrap (~1.8 million tonnes internal scrap and ~2.5 million tonnes external scrap).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata Steel also has implemented systems to recycle plastic waste (including packaging), e-waste, and hazardous waste safely. For the disposal of such waste, the Company contracts with authorised recyclers and /files returns with the appropriate statutory bodies. Tata Steel has optimised its processes to the point where over 98% of the waste produced across all geographies is either recycled and reused in its operations or sold as co-products to other industries, with the largest customer being the cement industry. The cement industry uses steel slags as a replacement for clinker, decreasing the emission intensity of cement production. Tata Steel has achieved 100% solid waste utilisation at Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar, Meramandali, and Gamharia.\n\n- 4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity's activities (Yes/No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.\n\nYes. In India, di/fferent types of wastes are being managed as per the rules noti/fied by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), Government of India.\n\nTata Steel Limited obtained the Plastic Waste EPR Registration Certi/ficate under the 'Brand Owner' and 'Importer' categories as per the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016; Battery Waste EPR Registration Certi/ficate under the 'Producer' category for Jamshedpur location as per the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, and Hazardous Waste Authorisation for various sites as per the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016.\n\nTata Steel UK has a formal legal Extended Producer Responsibility obligation under the Producer Responsibility Obligations Regulations in the United Kingdom with respect to its packaging grades of steel. This accounts for around 13% of Tata Steel UK's turnover. The regulations stipulate minimum end-of-life recycling rates to be achieved through direct action and activities in its value chain. Tata Steel is in compliance with the regulations.\n\n## Leadership Indicators\n\n- 1. Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format.\n\nYes, Tata Steel conducts LCA for most of its products manufactured across various facilities, allowing it to demonstrate that improvements in material utilisation and right-/first-time manufacturing can reduce emissions during the production phase. The Company also plans to collaborate with its customers to conduct a cradle-to-grave LCA study to comprehend the impact of its products.\n\nTata Steel UK is widely recognised for its expertise in LCA. By taking a supply chain perspective, the Company demonstrates how improvements in material utilisation and right-/first-time manufacturing can reduce emissions during the production phase. Its LCA models allow it to consider the complete value chain, for instance the impact of the carbon intensity of regional grid electricity (gCO 2 /kWh) on the carbon footprint of a vehicle or building. To extend its capability in this area, Tata Steel UK developed the PACI (Product Assessment Carbon Indicator) tool. This streamlines the process of undertaking life cycle studies of products and enables an understanding of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission hotspots and trade-o/ffs in the steel product value chain, which can be used to inform new product developments and optimise existing manufacturing routes. PACI has been used to support collaborative projects with customers and to support sharing and learning about opportunities for emissions reduction over the product's life cycle from manufacture through to use and /finally end-of-life: for example, working with an automotive OEM to examine all aspects of materials selection, including material type, steel grade, gauge, and aspects of formability and part design. Another example has been the use of the tool in understanding the trade-o/ff between bene/fits in use from improving motor e/fficiency versus embodied GHG emissions associated with di/fferent grades of electrical steels. The tool was recognised by World Steel Association in 2023, winning a Steelie award for Excellence in Life Cycle Assessment.",

If there are any signi/ficant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products/services, as identi/fied in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, brie/fly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same.\n\nAs identi/fied in the Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), no signi/ficant social or environmental concerns and risks arise from the disposal of the Company's products and services. However, steel production is an energy-intensive process with a substantial emission footprint. These anthropogenic CO 2 emissions are a critical source of global warming.\n\nTherefore, Tata Steel feels a strong sense of responsibility and has committed to being Net Zero across all operations by 2045. Tata Steel has also published a Climate Change Report aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, with detailed disclosures on its Climate Action Strategy, Governance, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets for the Tata Steel Group. For further details refer to the Climate Change Report, which is part of Tata Steel's Integrated Report for FY2023-24.\n\n## 3.

case of any eventuality or death, /financial aid to the family is extended under the Tata Steel Suraksha Scheme.\n\n1 Tata Steel employees at Jamshedpur and mining locations are covered under the Company's medical hospital for free medical treatment for self and dependents.\n\n2 For Tata Steel's European subsidiaries, Health Insurance and/or medical bene/fits are either provided by the government (e.g., the National Health Services in UK) or are compulsory. Accordingly, all employees are considered to be covered. Under Thailand labour law, health insurance, accident insurance, maternity bene/fits, paternity bene/fits and day care facilities are covered under social security schemes for other than permanent workers.\n\n3 For Tata Steel's European subsidiaries, day care facilities are typically provided by the national governments or part of the national school system. Employers are not directly involved, but 100% employees have access to such bene/fits.\n\n4 Others includes transgender personnel in case of permanent employees and workers. Other than permanent workers include transgender workers as well as overseas personnel where gender bifurcation is not available.\n\nAcross Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar, and mining locations in India, the Industrial Hygiene assessment was completed in 14 departments, and the Ergonomic assessment was completed in 24 departments. Tata Steel also o/ffers its employees various in-house health and wellness programmes, counselling services, and health clinics to promote their overall physical and mental well-being. The Company also organises regular health and wellness activities, including health fairs, wellness workshops, and health camps, to encourage employees to adopt healthy habits and lifestyles.\n\nAs a signi/ficant step towards ensuring holistic well-being of the Company's employees, a Chief Wellness O/fficer was appointed to drive Occupational Health initiatives. In FY2023-24, the 'Wellness for Life' portal was launched. This initiative includes the introduction of two apps, 'Wellspring' and 'The Wellness Corner', accessible through the portal. These apps serve as a comprehensive platform for employees to assess, monitor, and improve their health.\n\nTata Steel has also partnered with an external agency to provide counselling services to employees and their families for their mental well-being. Tata Steel employees in India are eligible for a periodic executive health check-up.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Tata Steel is implementing a health roadmap, with the vision: 'We work in optimal conditions to be able to live and work in a healthy and vital way' . This shared vision emphasises the importance of sustainable employability and preventive sickness absence. Preventing exposure to hazardous substances and conditions is one of the top priorities for the avoidance of occupational diseases. The chance that employees may experience extreme temperatures is inherent in steelmaking. To remove the risk, the Company is working on an app that employees can use to manage their 'heat stress'. Further e/fforts include a campaign to draw employees' attention to the importance of respiratory protection in speci/fic situations.\n\nIn the UK, Tata Steel is committed to promoting, protecting, and maintaining the mental health and well-being of all employees through workplace practices by reducing the stigma around mental health and encouraging all employees to take proactive steps for their own well-being. Tata Steel UK has deployed a mental health policy and created new supporting resources and training for our Mental Health First Aiders (MHFA) who act as a point of contact for employees experiencing emotional distress or su/ffering in silence with mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety or depression.",

        "page_content": "Career progression and career development policies are in place for most of the permanent employees and workers at all locations. Speci/fically for workers, di/fferent policies are in place for various Tata Steel Group entities based on local market practices. Performance and career development reviews assess the skill level of each worker, which is essential in their career progression and development. Such reviews are at an individual level at some locations, and team-based performance review mechanisms are in place at other locations (e.g., Incentive Bonus schemes, Team Performance Rewards, Iron Ore Su/fficiency Rewards, Coal Production Enhancement Rewards, etc.). The annual bonus scheme for Permanent Workers depends on their performance across productivity, pro/fitability, and safety parameters.\n\n## 10.  Health and safety management system:\n\n## a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?\n\nYes, Tata Steel has implemented an occupational health and safety management system. The system is based on ISO 45001:2018 and is designed to ensure that the Company meets EHSMS (Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System) related legal obligations and provides a safe and healthy working environment for its employees. Safety and Health Management are integrated into the Company's annual business planning process and cascaded down from the Apex level to divisional and departmental levels to ensure employee health and safety and place accountability and responsibility at all levels.\n\n## b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?\n\nTata Steel places the highest emphasis on employee health and safety. The Company has introduced a recalibrated Risk Matrix to improve its hazard identi/fication and risk assessment process. It has implemented an Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Risk Management framework to assess risks associated with all activities. The framework also captures the top organisational risks related to EHS and outlines strategies to address them.\n\nTata Steel's commitment to safety is demonstrated through its continuous e/fforts to strengthen its safety culture and reduce risks through strategic interventions. The Company employs several proactive safety tools and measures to ensure a safe working environment for its employees. These include:\n\n- 1. Safety Visits and Line Walks, involving regular workplace inspections to identify potential unsafe acts and conditions by all levels of Company employees.\n- 2. Elimination of Commonly Accepted Unsafe Practices targets unsafe practices that are commonly accepted but pose a risk to employees' safety.\n- 3. The Fatality Risk Control Programme is another proactive tool for identifying potential risks that could lead to fatalities.\n- 4. Job Cycle Checks is a tool for checking the compliance and adequacy of Standard Operating Procedures for a particular job. It involves reviewing each stage of a job while getting performed at the workplace.\n\n## Digital interventions for safety:\n\n- i. Tata Steel's Connected Workforce platform uses a plant-wide heat map that assigns a colour code to microzones inside the works. By using electronic work permit data, training data, skill data, etc., coupled with near real-time image analytics, the system delivers a continuous risk assessment of person, place, process, and asset.\n- ii. As part of its business responsibility of ensuring a safe work environment and improving safety and health at workplace, far-site Integrated Remote Operation Centre (iRoC) has been established for Agglomerates (8 iSPOC for Sinter Plant and Pellet Plant Operations), Raw Materials (14 iRMSC for Remote Supervision of 5 raw material locations) operations, Coke Plant (the newly inaugurated iCPROC at Jamshedpur) and the Integrated Maintenance Excellence Centre (iMEC) is TSL's innovation hub, o/ffering real-time, advanced maintenance advice to shop /floors to reduce the physical human footprint at the hazardous shop /floor location and provide ergonomic and comfortable environment to employees compared to near location control rooms. It has the added bene/fit of reducing the carbon footprint of operators travelling to remote plant and raw material locations, making them more sustainable.",

Tata Steel's Safety Management System IT portal in India is being upgraded to EnsafeNxt with digital alerts linked to a uniform review and escalation mechanism. This transition introduced a user-friendly interface and advanced visualisation capabilities, ensuring end-users can retrieve data easily. The essence of this inventive step was to enhance the system's usability and facilitate proactive decision-making through visualisation graphs, thereby strengthening the review system at all organisational levels for real-time insights and proactive risk mitigation.\n\n## c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks.\n\nYes, all employees can report incidents and near-misses through a bespoke IT platform to enable prompt reporting, investigation, and learning. Tata Steel follows a reporting and investigation process to identify the root cause of any incidents and to implement corrective and preventive measures to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. The reporting and investigation process is aligned with the incident investigation procedures outlined in the Tata Steel Incident Management System.\n\nThe 'Speak Up' helpline can be used by employees to raise their safety concerns anonymously.\n\nIn addition to these reporting mechanisms, Tata Steel also conducts regular safety audits, safety assessments, and safety walk-downs to identify and address any safety risks in the workplace. These audits and assessments are performed by internal safety auditors and external safety experts, and the /findings are used to improve the safety management system.\n\n## d. Do the employees/worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?\n\nYes. Tata Steel prioritises the health and well-being of its employees and workers. The Company provides access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services, such as hospitals, dispensaries, and health insurance, at their respective locations. At overseas locations our employees have access to national health services provided by national governments.\n\n## 11.

A team of product application engineers engage with customers to provide technical support and assistance. The senior leadership and cross-functional teams engage with customers through periodic customer meets and knowledge sharing sessions. The details of other engagement forums are mentioned below:\n\n- 1) Customer Service Team: The Customer Service Team collaborates with automotive customers to drive engagement and deliver value. It is a cross-functional group, involving process experts from Tata Steel and customer organisations, that aims to identify key customer challenges or issues and continuously /find solutions.\n- 2) Value Analysis and Value Engineering (VAVE): VAVE is a study of vehicle structures/assemblies to identify cost and weight reduction opportunities in a controlled and systematic manner.\n- 3) ECAfez: It is a website portal for customer engagement and knowledge management for the MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) customers.",

        "page_content": "- 4) ECAfez  Qualithon: It is an initiative under which all engagement programmes are carried out for the MSME customers (e.g., Skilling India, etc).\n- 5) Vehicle Teardown and Benchmarking: Vehicle Teardown is a systematic process of dismantling the entire vehicle to obtain precise details of vehicle design, material usage, and manufacturing process. Data is captured at each stage of the dismantling process in such a way that no information is lost in the process. Teardown activities are carried out with pre-decided outcomes as per the customer requirements.\n- 6) Early Vendor Involvement: It is a structured approach to working with automotive customers during the conceptualisation and design phases of a new vehicle programme, providing inputs in the steel material selection and its application.\n- 7) Parivaar  Meet: It is the milestone annual event of Tata Steel where the Company engages with its channel partners to discuss and deliberate the long-term plans of Tata Steel. Tata Steel also uses this opportunity to reward and recognise the top performing channel partners.\n- 8) Tata Steel UK engages with a wide range of customers who operate at di/fferent positions in the value chain. For example, the Construction businesses will engage with product speci/fiers, such as architects as well as those transactional customers who purchase our products. Depending on the customer archetype, for example spot business customers versus original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers then TSUK will engage with customers through dedicated account teams. Account teams, in line with the Account plan will engage at multiple levels with the target customers, covering key topics such as our performance as one of their key suppliers. Moving forward in FY2024-25, the Company will increase the performance measurement (in the customers eyes) through the deployment of touchpoint surveys and more regular relationship surveys. This information will be made available to the account leaders for the purposes of continual improvement in customer experience.\n\n## Leadership Indicators\n\n- 1. Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.\n\nTata Steel has delegated the consultation between the stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics to the Chief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director (CEO&MD) of the Company. The CEO&MD and the senior leadership team of Tata Steel and its subsidiary companies regularly update the Board and various Board Committees on relevant issues. These updates are provided during the Board meetings and separate meetings for various Board Committees.\n\nTata Steel has established various processes which ensure feedback from key stakeholders are received by the management and presented to the Board and Board committees in their meetings. Some examples of forums to receive feedback from various stakeholder groups are listed in Section C, Principle 2, Essential Indicators, Question 2.\n\n- 2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identi/fication and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.\n\nYes, Tata Steel relies on the outcome of the stakeholder's consultation, including those identi/fied during the Materiality Assesment Exercise, to identify its key policies and activities on environmental and social topics. Following the Materiality Exercise, Tata Steel has adopted ambitious targets for all identi/fied areas. As one of its strategic objectives, Tata Steel aspires to achieve industry leadership in sustainability. Initiatives taken to achieve these targets have been articulated in this BRSR.\n\nTata Steel follows an integrated approach of balancing stakeholder requirements while formulating Long Term Plans and Annual Business Plans, which helps to mitigate adverse impacts and community risks that may arise from its operations. Accordingly, the sustainability issues identi/fied during the Materiality Assessment (please refer to Section A, Sub-section VII, Question 24) are embedded in Tata Steel's strategic planning process and their impact is mitigated through focused action plans and resource allocation, including capital expenditure, revenue expenditure, technology adoption, manpower planning, etc.",

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups.\n\nIn India, Tata Steel's steelmaking and mining operations are in the states of Jharkhand and Odisha, both of which have a large indigenous population, and accordingly the community amongst which it operates can be considered to be vulnerable and marginalised stakeholder groups.\n\nThe value proposition of Tata Steel's engagement with the community is to enable lasting betterment in the well-being of communities in the operating region through regional development models prioritising the excluded and those proximate to business operations. Additionally, Tata Steel is also looking at addressing core development gaps at a national scale through replicable models of development. Some actions taken by the Company to address their concerns are:\n\n- 1. Ensuring safety in operating sites so that the health and safety of communities is not compromised.\n- 2. Sustaining community outreach activities in areas where the Company operates.\n- 3. Actively supporting communities through initiatives encompassing public health, household nutrition, access to conservation of water, household sanitation, holistic education, stable livelihoods, nurturing sporting talent, enabling a life of dignity for persons with disabilities, creating necessary public infrastructure and amenities, and enabling grassroot leadership.\n\nFurther details on Tata Steel's engagement with communities are provided in the Social and Relationship Capital chapter of Tata Steel's Integrated Report for FY2023-24.\n\n## Principle 5: Businesses should respect and promote human rights.\n\n## Essential Indicators\n\n- 1.

Tata Steel's Business & Human Rights policy (https://www.tatasteel.com/media/15484/tsl-policy.pdf) is aligned with the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labour Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and is consistent with the Tata Code of Conduct. This policy applies to Tata Steel and all its subsidiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Describe the internal mechanisms in place to redress grievances related to human rights issues.\n\nTata Steel has a strong commitment to sustainable development and has taken several measures to protect and promote human rights. Tata Steel has put systems in place to encourage the reporting of concerns related to human rights. In addition to Tata Steel's own internal processes, employees and suppliers are encouraged to use Tata Steel's con/fidential reporting system to report any concerns. The Speak Up platform is available to employees to anonymously raise concerns about any aspect of Tata Steel's operations. (https://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/our-organisation/ethics/).\n\nOn receipt of any concern through email, letter, web helpline or orally, it is registered by the Ethics Department of Tata Steel. The investigation team gathers, validates, and analyses the data and provides their observations and recommendations.\n\nThe investigation report is further reviewed by the Chief Ethics Counsellor or other appropriate authority and the recommendations are acted upon. The documentation of the action taken is /filed for records. Issues concerning the Key Managerial Personnel's, Senior Managerial Personnel's and Chief Ethics Counsellor are addressed to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Company and those concerning other employees are addressed to the Chief Ethics Counsellor of the Company. The Ethics Counsellor regularly provides an update to the Tata Steel Board's Audit Committee on the status of various grievance redressal mechanisms.\n\nTata Steel also obtains declarations from all the value chain partners regarding SA8000:2014 and other ISO requirements. Moreover, all of Tata Steel's value chain partners have to a/ffirm compliance with the Tata Code of Conduct.\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, Tata Steel requires suppliers operating in regions recognised as having a higher risk of human rights abuse, including slavery and human tra/fficking, to adopt suitable and robust policies and procedures to prevent such abuses. It could include having suitable accreditation (e.g., SA 8000:2014). If no suitable accreditation exists, a supplier must provide evidence that their policies cover the key elements of SA8000:2014, including no forced labour in their operations. Any reported concerns are investigated thoroughly, and appropriate action taken following due process.\n\nNo reports were received in respect of modern slavery or human tra/fficking in the supply chain during FY2023-24. No evidence of such instance has been observed in the value chain during the third-party human rights due diligence assessment.\n\n## 6.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases.\n\nTata Steel encourages its employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders to raise concerns or make disclosures when they become aware of any actual or potential violation of TCoC, policies or law and accordingly has put in place mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant, as below:\n\n- i. As part of the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Policy (POSH) and Whistle Blower Policy, Tata Steel is committed to the protection of the identity of the complainant and all such matters are dealt with in strict con/fidence, with appropriate measures taken to maintain such con/fidentiality.\n- ii. Under the POSH Policy, aggrieved party may lodge a complaint of sexual harassment against respondent to the chairperson or any member of the relevant Internal Committee (IC). All complaints must be sent in writing and are dealt with in strict con/fidence by the IC members. After hearing both the parties, the IC thoroughly investigates (including meeting the aggrieved party, examining all evidence, meeting all witnesses, and consulting with experts) and makes a report of its /findings for action. The Company also ensures that any employee/stakeholder involved in the investigations is not victimised or subjected to any unfavourable treatment.\n- iii. Regular awareness and training sessions are conducted to ensure that the employees/stakeholders are fully aware of various aspects of sexual harassment and the redressal mechanism.\n- iv. Under the Whistle Blower Policy, complete protection is given to whistleblowers against any unfair practice, such as retaliation, threat, or intimidation of termination/suspension of service, disciplinary action, transfer, demotion, refusal of promotion, or the like, including any direct or indirect use of authority to obstruct the whistleblower's right to continue to perform his/her duties and functions, including making further disclosures.\n- v. The Company take steps to minimise di/fficulties for the whistleblower because of making the disclosure. Thus, if the whistleblower is required to give evidence in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, the Company arranges for the whistleblower to receive advice about the procedure.\n- vi. The identity of the whistleblower is kept con/fidential to the extent possible and permitted under law.\n- vii. While TCoC discourages retaliation against anyone reporting any legitimate concern, the Whistle Blower policy also provides for disciplinary action in case the complaint registered is found to be frivolous, false, or made with a mischievous intention.\n\n## 9. Do human rights requirements form part of your business agreements and contracts? (Yes/No)\n\nYes, human rights requirements form part of Tata Steel's business agreements and contracts. The terms of a contract or purchase order copies submitted to vendors include compliance with SA8000:2014 requirements, and all vendor partners must comply with such requirements. The SA8000:2014 policy covers various aspects of human rights such as child labour, forced or compulsory labour, health and safety, freedom of association, non-discrimination, disciplinary practices, security practices, working hours, compensation practices, supply chain practices and management systems.\n\nTata Steel also follows the TCoC globally and expects all business associates and value chain partners to adhere to its principles. Speci/fic clauses of the Tata Code of Conduct, including clauses on human rights, are included in all its business agreements and contracts/purchase orders.\n\nThe  Tata  Code  of  Conduct  can  be  accessed  at  https://www.tatasteel.com/corporate/our-organisation/ethics/. The Business Associates Code of Conduct can be found at https://www.tatasteel.com/media/9244/business-associatescode-of-conduct.pdf.\n\nFurthermore, Tata Steel's Responsible Supply Chain Policy encourages supply chain partners to share the same commitment. It expects them to integrate the four sustainability principles of Tata Steel (Fair business practices, Health and safety, Human Rights, and Environmental Management) in all their business decision-making, and extend them to their own supply chain.",

Renewable/non-conventional power generation.\n- vi. Adaptation of new and emerging technologies/best practices and digital initiatives.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, the Impact Centre has helped in the implementation of signi/ficant initiatives across the value chain, resulting in savings of more than H 750 crore. Some initiatives towards energy saving taken by Tata Steel in recent years are listed below:\n\n- a. Installation of Energy Recovery Micro Turbines to reduce the energy loss in the pressure reducing station for the supply of process steam.\n- b. Implementation of energy-e/fficient fan in the cooling towers at Jamshedpur works.\n- c. Tata Steel is experimenting to generate electricity by tapping low heat rejected from the furnace hood. If implemented, the pilot project would be the /first of its kind in the world.\n- d. Tata Steel uses data from processes, equipment, and other sources to identify areas for reducing energy consumption. It uses machine learning and optimisation algorithms to optimise energy usage across its operations. It includes:\n- i. Monitoring and optimising the consumption of fuel (solid, liquid and gaseous), and electrical power.\n- ii. Monitoring the availability and optimisation of the calori/fic value of the by-product gases used as fuel.\n- iii. Monitoring all environmental parameters through the Environment Canvas platform, which helps evaluate the e/ffectiveness of the interventions and prompt necessary preventive/corrective actions.\n- e. In the Netherlands, as part of the Star investment programme, the new furnace to be installed in the Hot Strip Rolling Mill has a signi/ficantly lower energy consumption.\n- f. Tata Steel in the UK commissioned a new 30MWe steam turbine in autumn 2021, which, through increased capacity and e/fficiency, will provide an estimated 13MWe increase in the average amount of electricity generated from the site using process gases. Tata Steel is also currently commissioning an innovative system for reheating furnaces at the Port Talbot Hot Rolling Mill, which uses lasers to measure fuel combustion e/fficiency to substantially optimise fuel rates and, therefore, emissions.\n- g. Tata Steel in Thailand has conducted a Total Productive Maintenance project to continuously improve, develop and increase e/fficient energy usage and invested in high-e/fficiency energy projects such as replacing fuel oil usage with natural gas, production process improvement both at the steel plant and the rolling mill and installing solar roof at one of its plants, with further plans to implement solar roof technology at the remaining two plants.\n- 2.

If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.\n\nTata Steel is in the process of putting in place a system for achieving zero liquid discharge at all its locations in India.\n\nAt all of Tata Steel's facilities, proactive measures are being implemented to mitigate the potential contamination of local water sources and to attain a goal of Zero E/ffluent Discharge (ZED). In line with Tata Steel's commitment towards water risk mitigation, Tata Steel has implemented various projects under the zero e/ffluent discharge initiative, leading to a substantial reduction in freshwater consumption.\n\nMany of Tata Steel's downstream entities and those of subsidiaries are already 'zero' water discharge plants and 100% of their wastewater is recycled for various  purposes.\n\nFurthermore, Tata Steel is extending its sustainability e/fforts beyond its operational boundaries by undertaking ZED projects within its township. These projects include converting municipal sewage into water suitable for industrial use, further enhancing the organisation's water stewardship initiatives. Moreover, many downstream entities and subsidiaries of Tata Steel have already achieved the status of ZED plants, with 100% e/ffluent utilisation for process and low-end purposes.\n\nIn the UK and the Netherlands, Tata Steel's facilities operate in locations that are substantially less water-constrained than some of the facilities in which Tata Steel operates in India. Both IJmuiden and Port Talbot steelmaking sites occupy coastal locations and much of the water they extract from the environment is used in once-through' cooling systems before being returned to the environment with no loss of quality.

Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\n\nTata Steel believes in the 'Zero Waste' philosophy using the 3R (Reduce, Reuse & Recycle) circular economy principles. Tata Steel has collaborated with suppliers and taken up several projects to refurbish equipment under use, improving their life and preventing unnecessary waste. In a /first-of-its-kind initiative in India, Tata Steel successfully recycled 12,000 tonnes of used refractories, contributing towards its sustainability goals. Tata Steel also initiated trial runs with its suppliers to switch from high-speed diesel to alternate fuels, such as Lique/fied Natural Gas, to decarbonise its mining operations.\n\nTo minimise the waste produced in the steelmaking process, Tata Steel has a dedicated pro/fit centre for waste management, called the Industrial By-Product Management Division (IBMD), to ensure e/fficient by-product management by adopting advanced practices for steel waste processing.\n\n- i) Reuse & Recycle: Ironmaking and steelmaking slags are the major by-products generated in the steel industry. Other by-products include dust, sludge, mill scales, waste refractories, etc. The by-products are used in various external applications (BF slag in cement manufacturing, metallics in secondary steelmaking, coal tar in coal tar pitch and Carbon Black, and non-metallics of steelmaking slag in civil works, road construction, /fly ash bricks) and internal applications (/flue dust, lime dust, steelmaking sludge, kiln dust, mill scale and sludge, iron-bearing muck, GCP (Gas Cleaning Plant) sludge, LD slag /fines, etc., in sinter making, and metallics in steelmaking).\n- ii) Resource Recovery and Utilisation: Tata Steel has invested in state-of-the-art technologies for processing by-products to maximise value creation. A few of the key facilities are as follows:\n- a) Metal Recovery and Steam Ageing Plant: Here, the steelmaking by-product slag undergoes crushing and screening, followed by magnetic separation that recovers the iron content to be used as a raw material in the steelmaking process. Non-metallic slag aggregates that undergo weathering at the steam ageing facility are used for civil or road construction. The /fines are used as a cementitious material.\n- b) Scrap Processing-Storage-Handling Facility: As a signi/ficant CO 2 reduction initiative, IBMD collects and processes internal scrap to maximise the scrap charge in steel melting shops. It generated a total scrap volume of 1207 KT, comprising 917 KT of steel scrap, which helped reduce the equivalent volume of external scrap buy.\n- c) New By-product Value Creation Centre: A state-of-the-art facility equipped with a baling machine, specialised cut-to-length line, and a mechanised processing line for /flat product arisings has been set up to deliver customised o/fferings to external customers. The facility also houses an Innovation Lab to develop light concrete products using in-house slag aggregates such as Tata Aggreto and Tata Nirman. Green pavers and interlocking blocks have been developed with slag-based aggregates.\n- d) Slag Processing & Grinding Plant: The slag generated during the ironmaking process in Blast Furnaces (BF slag) is divided into air-cooled slag and granulated slag. Granulated BF slag is sold to cement manufacturers, whereas air-cooled slag is processed and utilised in road construction. GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag) was introduced to create additional value from BF slag, which can be used as a partial replacement for Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in concrete production. Tata Steel GGBS is now available under the name 'Tata Dureco.'\n- iii) E-Waste  Management: The Company has established a process to ensure e/ffective e-waste management in compliance with the E-Waste Management (EWM) Rules, 2016. The electronic waste is collected at a central location and managed by the authorised vendor. They are certi/fied to undertake the activities as per the rules and guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\n\nWhile most processed solid waste is reutilised within the manufacturing process, Tata Steel partners with external agencies to dispose of hazardous waste in a secure land/fill that is not processed or recycled.",

While Tata Steel Nederland is still at an early stage of deliberately integrating biodiversity at the IJmuiden site, numerous relevant initiatives concerning biodiversity are already in place. The biodiversity initiatives are part of a comprehensive biodiversity management plan that is titled Staalblauwtje (Steel Blue) which has been in place for a number of years. It aims to use our site at IJmuiden as a corridor between the two Natura 2000 dune reserves that border the site, creating better connectivity between these areas.\n\nIn the UK, Tata Steel is guardian to large areas of natural habitat including several areas with the UK designation 'Sites of Special Scienti/fic Interest (SSSIs).' It works closely with the relevant regulators in England and Wales, agreeing management plans for these areas and ensuring responsible stewardship of the habitats and species that thrive on them. In addition to the designated areas with its sites, some of TSUK's operations are in proximity to habitats bene/fitting from a range of UK habitat designations. In all such cases, the environmental permit regulations require the Company to assess any impact its operations may have on the adjacent habitats. The assessed impacts are very small. Any protections linked to the protected habitats are incorporated into environmental permits for the relevant sites and Tata Steel is in compliance with such requirements. In addition to meeting its responsibilities for protected sites, where opportunities arise to do so, it looks for ways to encourage biodiversity on other landholdings and thereby contribute to protecting the natural heritage of the UK's landscape.",

Tata Steel launched its Biodiversity Policy in 2016 to integrate biodiversity into its business ecosystem for a greener future. The policy is a public commitment to conserve, enhance, and restore biodiversity in the Company's present and prospective areas of operation and across the supply chain.\n\nThe Biodiversity Policy is operationalised through actionable Biodiversity Management Plans (BMPs), which are designed on the foundation of a mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimise, restore, and o/ffset) tool. These include biodiversity studies, ground truthing studies, secondary research, stakeholder interactions, and understanding the risks from the Company's operations and community behaviour.\n\nIn India, Tata Steel has deployed BMPs for 17 sites in India and plans to cover the remaining ones. In the Netherlands, a comprehensive biodiversity management plan called Staalblauwtje (Steel Blue) which has been in place for a number of years. It aims to use the site as a corridor between the two Natura 2000 dune reserves that border the site, creating better connectivity between these areas. Tata Steel aims to cover 100% of sites in India, in the UK, in the Netherlands under the Biodiversity Management Plan by 2025.\n\nSome initiatives implemented by Tata Steel in India in FY2023-24 are given in the Natural Capital section of Tata Steel's Integrated Report FY2023-24.\n\nWhere deforestation is unavoidable, Tata Steel is committed to o/ffsetting the forest loss with compensatory a/fforestation, leading to no net deforestation. Tata Steel also conducts periodic assessments of its sites to determine the exposure to critical biodiversity.",

Operations and Performance\n\n## 1. Tata Steel Group\n\nDuring the year under review, the consolidated crude steel  production  for  Tata  Steel  Group  ( 'TSG' )  was 29.94 MT as against 30.65 MT of FY2022-23, a marginal decline of 2% which was primarily on account of the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands which was  offset  by  an  increase  in  production  at  Indian operations  owing  to  de-bottlenecking  across  sites and higher steel production at Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited  ( 'NINL' ).  The  production  increased  at  Tata Steel Limited to 20.12 MT which was higher by 2% (FY2022-23: 19.67 MT) attributable to de-bottlenecking across  sites.  Tata  Steel  Europe  ( 'TSE' )  produced 7.80  MT,  lower  by  17%  (FY2022-23:  9.35  MT)  due to the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands along with subdued market demand. NINL produced 0.66  MT  (FY2022-23:  0.20  MT),  as  it  commenced production from October 2022 onwards post takeover of  its  operations  by  the  Company.  Production  at South-East Asia ( 'SEA' ) of 1.36 MT (FY2022-23: 1.43 MT) was lower due to weak demand. The consolidated steel deliveries of TSG was at 29.39 MT in FY2023-24 as against 28.79 MT in FY2022-23, increase of 2% primarily at Tata Steel Standalone (1.06 MT). Deliveries declined at TSE on  account  of  the  reline  of  Blast  Furnace  6  in the Netherlands.\n\nThe turnover of TSG in FY2023-24 at H 2,29,171 crore was lower over FY2022-23 by H 14,182 crore (6%) on account of decline in steel realisations across geographies along with decline in deliveries at the European operations attributable  to  decrease  in  demand  and  lower production, partly o/ffset by higher deliveries in India.\n\nThe EBITDA in FY2023-24 at H 23,402 crore was lower over FY2022-23 by H 9,296 crore (28%), due to subdued performance from the European operations on account of contraction in steel prices and lower deliveries. EBITDA however, improved in the Indian operations on account of higher deliveries by 1.06 MT along with decrease in input costs, which was partly o/ffset by lower steel realisations.",

India\n\nDuring  the  year  under  review,  total  deliveries  at Tata Steel Limited were at 19.91 MT (previous year: 18.85  MT),  higher  by  1.06  MT.  Turnover  was H 1,40,987 crore (previous year: H 1,42,913 crore), which was marginally lower against the previous year mainly due to decline in steel prices, partly o/ffset by higher deliveries. EBITDA was at H 31,004 crore (previous year: H 28,753 crore), higher by 8% than that of the previous year,  primarily  on  account  of  increase  in  deliveries and lower raw material cost, mainly coking coal and purchased pellets, partly o/ffset by decline in steel prices. During the year under review, the crude steel production in Tata Steel Limited increased by 2% to 20.12 MT on account of de-bottlenecking at sites.\n\nNINL achieved crude steel production of 0.66 MT, while deliveries stood at 0.65 MT, both higher than previous year by 0.46 MT and 0.48 MT respectively, due to full year of operation. The turnover at H 5,505 crore was signi/ficantly higher on account of higher deliveries partly o/ffset by decline in steel prices. EBITDA at H 53 crore was higher against a negative EBITDA of H 770 crore in the previous year.\n\nTotal deliveries of Tata Steel from its Indian operations (including NINL) stood at 19.91 MT which is higher than  the  previous  year  by  6%.  The  turnover  was H 1,42,902 crore, marginally at par against previous year and  EBITDA  (excluding  inter-company  eliminations and adjustments) was H 31,057 crore, improved by 10% over previous year. The improvement in EBIDTA is due to decrease in input cost on account of decrease in imported coking coal prices and higher deliveries, partly o/ffset by decline in steel realisations.\n\n## 3. Europe\n\nDuring the year under review, liquid steel production from European operations was 7.80 MT (previous year: 9.35 MT), a decrease of 17% against the previous year due to the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands along with subdued market demand. Deliveries from European  operations  decreased  by  around  6%  to 7.68 MT primarily due to decline in demand and lower production. Revenue from operations was H 78,144 crore (previous year: H 90,300 crore) which was lower than FY2022-23 owing to reduction in average revenue per tonne along with lower deliveries.\n\nEBITDA stood at negative H 7,612 crore (previous year: positive H 4,632 crore) which was lower than the previous year. This signi/ficant reduction in EBITDA was seen in both TSN and TSUK. In TSN, the impact of the Blast Furnace 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreline and lower spreads within the market contributed for the decline whereas in TSUK the performance was adversely impacted by the performance of the end of life assets at the Port Talbot site as well as subdued market conditions.\n\n## D.

Operations\n\n## Transformation  from  blast  furnaces  to  green steelmaking  in  the  UK  and  initiation  of  statutory consultation\n\nOn  September  15,  2023,  Tata  Steel  UK  reached  a historic milestone as it announced a joint agreement with the UK Government on a proposal to invest in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace, that would replace the two blast furnaces at the Port Talbot site by incurring a capital cost of \u00a31.25 billion including a grant of up to \u00a3500 million from the UK Government. The proposal remains  subject  to  relevant  regulatory  approvals, information, and consultation processes, and /finalisation of detailed terms & conditions. The project will bolster the UK's steel security and will be the /first major step towards  decarbonisation  of  the  UK  steel  industry, potentially  reducing  direct  carbon  emissions  by 50 MT over a decade. The proposal would also mark a transformation in the UK's progress towards a more\n\ncircular economy, leveraging domestically available scrap steel and promoting value addition within the UK.\n\nThe Company has commenced statutory consultation as a part of its transformation and restructuring plan of UK business to transition from the legacy of blast furnaces to a more sustainable, green steel business which would result in securing most of Tata Steel UK's existing product capability and maintain the country's self-su/fficiency in steel making, while also reducing CO 2 emissions. Subsequently, the Company has also decided to cease its operations of the Coke Ovens at the Port Talbot plant, in Wales, UK. The Company is under discussions with trade unions in the UK on its proposal for the planned restructuring involving closure of the iron and steelmaking assets at Port Talbot, and for subsequent transition to sustainable low CO 2 steelmaking. This is a part of the Company's commitment to transitioning to low-carbon steelmaking and is also a step aligned to the Company's goal of achieving Net Zero carbon emission by 2045.\n\nTata Steel UK announced a proposal which would lead to the cessation of its existing 'heavy end' assets - such as its blast furnaces and coke oven plants - which are reaching the end of their operational life. During the transition period  and  project  phase,  Tata  Steel  UK  will  work intensively to ensure uninterrupted and reliable supply of products to ful/fil customer and market commitments including through import of additional steel substrate from stable and responsible supply chains to feed its downstream units.\n\nAs part of Tata Steel's commitment to advance global research  and  innovation  in  materials  science  for  a sustainable future, the Company also announced its intention  to  invest  approximately  \u00a320  million  over 4 years to set up two additional Centers of Innovation & Technology in the UK at the Henry Royce Institute at Manchester (for advanced materials research) and at Imperial College London (for research in Sustainable Design & Manufacturing).",

The bamboo plantation in Jharia is a major step towards becoming a leader in NbS, supporting community livelihood and sequestering carbon.\n\nTata  Steel's  Kalinganagar  and  Meramandali  plants received ResponsibleSteel TM Certification, marking a signi/ficant milestone in the Company's sustainability journey. Jamshedpur plant was the /first Indian steel plant to be certi/fied in 2022. In India, Tata Steel produces more than 90% steel from ResponsibleSteel TM certi/fied sites.\n\nFurther, Tata Steel deployed Business and Human Rights Policy across its sites through extensive due diligence, for 6 identi/fied categories of stakeholders across the value chain.\n\nAcross Europe, steelmakers need government support to decarbonise and Tata Steel is engaging with the Dutch, UK, and Welsh Governments on these complex themes.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  Group  has  launched  commercial propositions that allow customers to take a stake in its decarbonisation journey, whilst demonstrating their own contribution to societal CO 2 emission reductions. Under the brand names Zeremis Carbon Lite and Optemis Carbon Lite for Tata Steel Nederlands ( 'TSN' ) and Tata Steel UK ( 'TSUK' ) respectively, the propositions are based on carbon 'insetting,' where actual emissions reductions are third-party veri/fied, banked and o/ffered to customers for o/ff-setting their Scope 3 emissions of CO 2 . The CO 2 savings are subject to veri/fication by leading assurance organisation DNV in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas ( 'GHG' ) Protocol Project and Product Accounting Standard. Operation of the CO 2 banks is based on a mass balance approach outlined in ISO 22095: 2020. Revenues from the sale of certi/ficates are used to fund projects generating further CO 2 savings. During FY2023-24, both the Zeremis and Optemis Carbon Lite o/fferings continued to gain traction amongst customers. At the end of 2023, TSN launched Zeremis\u00ae Delivered, the solution for customers to receive their steel orders through lower-emission transportation methods. The service enables customers to reduce their scope 3 emissions, along with other emissions linked to the transportation of their steel. TSN and the Dutch government signed an Expression of Principles in FY2022-23 to reduce CO 2 emissions by 5 MT by 2030. In FY2023-24, TSN has submitted its transition plan, embarking next step in this process.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Environment\n\nBeing  a  responsible  corporate  citizen,  Tata  Steel continues to strive for environmental excellence across operations. Towards this, the Company has undertaken prioritised set of initiatives for environmental protection by addressing environmental concerns associated with its operations and supply chain. The Safety, Health and Environment Committee of the Board provides oversight and necessary guidance on the environmental matters. The Company has identi/fied internal teams to take care of environmental requirements and issues at its operating locations, globally. As part of responsible advocacy, the Company syndicates its stance with key stakeholders on environmental policy matters including regulatory issues and actively participates in various national and international initiatives on diverse issues.\n\nGuided by the Tata Code of Conduct, Climate change policy for Tata companies, Tata Steel's corporate policies (environmental  policy,  energy  policy,  biodiversity policy), the Company endeavours to set steel industry benchmark in environmental performance. The Company has achieved signi/ficant reduction in its environment footprint over the years through process optimisation, asset upgradation and e/fficiency enhancement to realise its commitment as a responsible stakeholder in the community. Towards this, the Company has undertaken several initiatives in areas of resource conservation, pollution control and waste management, amongst others.  The  Company  has  adopted  environment friendly  processes,  best  available  technologies, real-time  monitoring  systems  and  has  IT  enabled real-time  dashboards  to  facilitate  environmentally friendly  operational  control.  The  Company  has digitised  the  systems  of  real-time  monitoring  of environmental parameters for faster identi/fication of probable environmental impacts of its operations to initiate mitigating actions for controling environmental pollution. The Company maintains transparency of its environmental performance through various disclosures to stakeholders from time to time. During the year under review, the Company has taken initiatives to retain Indian benchmark position of Jamshedpur Steel Works in speci/fic stack dust emissions and speci/fic fresh-water intake amongst coal-based Blast Furnace - Basic Oxygen Furnace (BF-BOF) plants.\n\nIn the UK, Tata Steel achieved a re-certi/fication of the environmental management system at its main sites to ISO 14001: 2015 and secured ongoing certi/fication of its products to the BES6001 sustainability standard. Despite the Company's e/fforts, it noted an increase in the number of complaints received from members\n\nof the public during FY2022-23 and the early part of FY2023-24, speci/fically regarding concerns about odour, noise,  and  dust.  These  concerns  arose  primarily  in relation to issues related to the stability of the two blast furnaces at Port Talbot. In response to the complaints, the Company examined its processes and operations to ensure it was taking all necessary steps to meet and go beyond regulatory requirements. In recognition of the value it places on the feedback received from the local community, it initiated a review of its complaint management process to ensure timely and e/ffective resolution of issues raised by the public. This led to the implementation of a revised, improved process. By fostering open lines of communication, the Company aims to strengthen its relationship with the community and  address  their  environmental  concerns  more e/ffectively. The Company always has, and always will, deeply value the well-being and prosperity of everyone who forms a part of the communities in which it operates. Its commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its operations remains resolute.\n\nDuring the year, TSN further accelerated the measures under the Roadmap+ programme by implementing measures  to  reduce  dust,  noise,  odour  and  other emissions. In January 2024, TSN commissioned its largest environmental installation, a dedusting installation at its IJmuiden Pellet Plant. The dedusting plant is to reduce emissions of lead by 70%, alongside reduction in dust. It will be accompanied with a nitrogen oxide reduction (deNOx), which is expected to be operational in 2025. Tata Steel is also building windbreaker screens of about 18 metres height and around a kilometre length around the raw material storage facilities, thereby reducing wind speeds and the associated dust dispersal. Local artist and residents have been encouraged to participate in the design. The windbreaker will be finished in the second half of 2024. As part of its transition to low CO 2 steelmaking, and its discussions with the government regarding  state  support,  TSN  has  also  announced environmental measures to include in the transition plan, mainly focussing on reduction of /fine dust.\n\n## 2. Climate Change\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing issues the world faces today, and the Company recognises its obligation to work towards mitigation of climate change related risks and strives to reduce its carbon footprint especially of steelmaking facilities across all geographies.  The  Company  is  committed  to  be aligned to national commitments on climate change in geographies, it operates in. The Company is a signatory",

Speci/fic mitigation and contingency plans for each of the identi/fied risks have been integrated within the Company's long-term strategy.\n\nThe Company is collaborating with a wide range of organisations in developing the ecosystem to mitigate climate change transition risk. To move closer towards lower carbon pathway, the Company is working towards installing gas-based Direct Reduction Iron (DRI) and be future-ready in use of hydrogen. The Company continues to work towards integrating hydrogen gas in iron making processes as a non-fossil fuel and reductant. In India, the Company is pursuing its e/fforts to reduce Greenhouse Gases  (GHG)  intensity  of  business  by  improving resource e/fficiency through adoption of best available technologies  and  good  practices  which  includes measurement, analysis, reporting review, target-setting and engagement with key stakeholders on related issues, experimenting with sustainable alternatives of fossil fuels, and stakeholder collaborations.\n\nTata Steel strives to retain benchmark positions in GHG intensity of IJmuiden globally and Jamshedpur Steel Works in India amongst BF-BOF based steelmaking facilities. Enhanced use of electricity from renewable sources in electricity mix, energy e/fficiency of production processes  and  multiple  improvement  initiaives across value chain including logistics (shipping and transportation), Steel Recycling Business amongst others in India are key enablers in pursuit of intermediate goal of 2030.\n\nAt IJmuiden, the Company pursues major decarbonisation plan  to  achieve  quantum  reduction.  The  Company has also embarked upon the implementation of its decarbonisation plans at Port Talbot plant in UK.\n\nDuring the year, plans were announced for a \u00a31.25bn investment to transform the UK business, moving from blast furnace to EAF technology. This will signi/ficantly reduce the overall carbon footprint, reduce direct CO 2 emissions by ~90%. It will also ensure an increase in the amount of recycled content of the Company's steel and reduce the amount of scrap exported from the UK.\n\nEnergy  and  carbon  reduction  implementation  is progressing in many of the Company's sites which is  complimented  by  ISO  50001:  2018  accreditation. Hartlepool, Catnic and Corby sites achieved this standard within the year, joining Shotton who already held the standard and have progressed key projects including site wide LED lighting upgrades, saving 57.3% and a furnace recuperator upgrade on the galvanising line saving.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn November 2023, Tata Steel UK completed installation of a \u00a35m furnace upgrade project at Corby, which will result in a 16% reduction in process energy demands for the site's largest energy user and ensuring reliable manufacturing of Celsius products for the future by replacing the combined gas and electric furnaces with modern state-of-the-art electrical induction units.\n\nDuring the year under review, Tata Steel has taken initiatives to retain its global benchmark positions in CO 2 intensity (scope 1&2) of IJmuiden Plant in Netherlands and Jamshedpur Steel Works in India amongst BF-BOF based steelmaking facilities. This has been enabled due to increase in use of recycled scraps in steelmaking and renewables in the energy mix which have lead to improving energy e/fficiency of production processes and multiple improvement initiatives across value chain.\n\nTSN  has  a  public  commitment  to  reduce  its  CO 2 emissions by 5 Megatons by 2030. In the previous year, TSN submitted a request to the Dutch government for 'Maatwerk' support (a tailor-made support package) to enable the /first phase of its decarbonisation plan. An improved Green Steel Plan with an enhanced focus on reducing the impact on our environment and making TSN more circular was submitted to the Dutch government in  November  2023.  The  Company  is  committed  to transitioning in a phased manner out of blast furnace operations to steel making using direct reduced iron technology and electric smelting, with an eventual transition to Green Hydrogen depending on availability and economics. It is currently engaged with multiple technology  and  engineering  partners  to  complete detailed evaluation and engineering, implementation planning and costing of the project.\n\n## 3. Health and Safety\n\nTata Steel places health and safety at the forefront of it's responsibilities. The Company is committed to zero harm at the workplace. Health and Safety Management are integrated into the Company's annual business planning process and cascaded down to ensure accountability at all levels. Additionally, the Company also has a robust governance structure, overseen by the Safety, Health, and Environment Committee of the Board, working in tandem with the Apex Safety Council. These directives permeate  through  sub-committees  and  Divisional Implementation Committees, chaired by members of the Senior Management.\n\nTata  Steel  has  significantly  enhanced  it's  safety leadership capabilities, embraced digital innovations in safety practices, and strengthened contractor safety",

The Company's focused e/fforts on hazard identi/fication, risk management, road and rail safety, process safety management, and occupational health  have  made  considerable  advancements  in enhancing the safety risk sensitivity across Tata Steel. To institutionalise cross-learning between four Tata Group Companies, a safety workshop with senior leadership and the Group Chairman was organised.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Company undertook several initiatives, including the successful establishment of Safety Alert Command Centre. This initiative has paved the way for the scalable implementation of innovative safety measures such as video analytics, and connected workforce. Tata Steel India's Safety Management System IT portal has been upgraded to EnsafeNxt, whereby digital alerts are also connected to uniform review and escalation mechanism. Integrated Safety Performance Index ( 'SPI' ) was rolled out to review the performance of departments on important Key Performance Indicators in safety to improve organisation's overall safety culture.\n\nTo promote positive safety culture throughout the organisation, 4 th edition of Safety Health & Environment Excellence Awards, 2023 was organised with the theme 'Values Driven Excellence'. This event aimed at recognising & rewarding the e/fforts of employees, contractors, and departments in the /field of Safety, Health, Environment, and 5S & Visual Workplace Management ( 'VWM' ).\n\nFor addressing road safety risks, Tata Steel has developed Model Heavy Vehicles Parking areas and Transport Parks, implemented technological interventions such as a Driver Fatigue Monitoring System, dump-body raised interlock, and Anti-tilt mechanisms across all Dumpers covering 100% of heavy vehicles plying inside works. An integrated command centre is being developed for e/ffective control over the /fleet through live monitoring of heavy vehicles plying inside and analysing feeds from Driver Fatigue Monitoring System. The competency development  of  heavy  vehicle  drivers  through  a simulator-based training facility has been commenced at Jamshedpur, Meramandali and Raw-Material locations.\n\nThe  'Contractor  Safety  Management  Standard'  has been fully implemented across all sites and is now being deployed at NINL. For strengthening oversight management  of  Operation  &  Maintenance  ( 'O&M' ) contracts, a guideline was formulated and quarterly audits of all 102 O&M vendors across locations were carried out. Focused initiatives for the upgradation of skill-certi/fied workmen and supervisors from Silver to Gold and Platinum at all locations were carried out.\n\nTata Steel received the 'Safety and Health Excellence Recognition 2023' from the World Steel Association for 'Real-time visualisation of risk movement' under the Process Safety category. Process Safety Management was rolled out in High Hazard departments of Tata Steel Gamharia, erstwhile Tata Steel Mining (now amalgamated with the Company) and NINL. To develop exemplars in process safety, certi/fication programs were conducted via School of Excellence and National Examination Board in Occupational Safety and Health ( 'NEBOSH' ).\n\nFatality of contract employees has been the topmost safety concern for the Company. It is with deep regret that the Company reports 5 fatalities during the year under review. The Company has rolled out the revised Life-Saving Rules designed for manufacturing units, construction sites, and mines to enhance safety discipline across locations. The Company has launched hazard specific safety campaigns viz. 'Know your Personal Protective  Equipment's',  along  with  focused  safety campaign on 'Manual Tasks and Tools' at Jamshedpur and Meramandali locations. Initiatives like Felt Leadership 2.0 and the transformation of 86 safety standards into e-learning modules underscore Tata Steel's commitment to widespread safety knowledge dissemination. Lost Time Injuries ( ' LTIs' ) at Tata Steel (India & South-East Asia) have reduced by 8% from the previous year. Tata Steel Jamshedpur achieved 35% reduction in LTIs.\n\nA Chief Wellness O/fficer was appointed during the year to drive focus towards Occupational Health initiatives. 'Wellspring', Tata Steel's Health & Well-being App was rolled  out  for  all  the  employees,  covering  physical well-being, nutrition, health promotion & emotional well-being. Industrial Hygiene assessment was completed in 14 departments of Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Raw Material locations. Ergonomic assessment was completed in 24 departments of Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and Raw Material locations.\n\nIn  the  UK  and  the  Netherlands,  Health  and  Safety continues  to  be  of  utmost  priority.  In  the  UK,  the business currently operates an internal 15-Principle health and safety management system but has started its  transition  towards  a  certified  health  and  safety management system ISO 45001: 2018. Currently, three units have achieved certi/fication with plans in place for the rest of the business to transition. During FY202324, Tata Steel UK deployed a health and safety annual plan with a focus on three key areas viz; occupational safety,  process  safety  and  occupational  health  & well-being.

From a process safety perspective, the Company submitted a site safety report for the main steel making site at Port Talbot as part of its Control of Major Accident Hazard (COMAH) obligations. It continued to improve knowledge and competence on process safety leadership through targeted interventions and course across the business. In terms of occupational health and well being, the change in the business awareness and activity continued at pace with a health and well-being hub established, 380 mental health /first aiders trained and increased levels of engagement and interventions on a range of health and well-being topics. Safety leadership continues to be demonstrated with through senior leadership, audits, across the business.\n\nTo further improve the level of safety on TSN sites, TSN is implementing an additional strategy to create a pro-active safety management culture regarding unsafe behaviour. In addition to keeping an eye on incidents (safety issues), more focus is created on the positive aspects of safety: the circumstances and moments in which work runs smoothly and safely. In that way the focus is on looking for causes and conditions that contribute to safe operations. As a result of this, risks are eliminated. Next to this, attention is paid to role responsibility, as well as continuing to manage risks and maintaining dialogue regarding healthy and safe working practices. An important aspect of this strategy is safety awareness among employees, regarding both themselves and their  colleagues,  and  associated  behaviours  and communication. With this approach, a link is made with TSN's three leadership principles, Connect, Change and Care, in underlining the responsibility of the individual for safety. Furthermore, TSN is implementing a health roadmap, with the vision: 'We work in optimal conditions to be able to live and work in a healthy and vital way'. This shared vision emphasises the importance of sustainable employability and preventive sickness absence.\n\nBoth at TSN and TSUK, an integrated health and safety management system ensures a consistent approach to  health  and  safety  throughout  the  organisation. The Health and Safety Management System follows the Plan, Do, Check, Act management model, which is a process of continuous improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. Research and Development\n\nTata Steel R&D and Technology division establishes the technical underpinnings essential for organisation's sustainability and enduring success. The division achieves this by fostering innovating thinking and continually enhancing products and processes. Tata Steel possesses R&D capabilities across the steel value chain starting from raw materials/mining to /final products/solutions.\n\nAlong with R&D Centre at Jamshedpur, the Company has  initiated  measures  to  extend  its  footprint  not only nationwide but also on a global scale. During the year under review, Tata Steel inked Memorandum of Understanding with the Imperial College London and The Henry Royce Institute to set up centres of innovation. The centre at Imperial College London is focused on Sustainable Design and Manufacturing and enables the acceleration of technology development and  deployment  in  strategic  areas,  attract  talent, and strengthen the industry-academia collaborative eco-system. The innovation Centre at the Henry Royce Institute  aims  to  accelerate  research  on  advanced materials  along  with  the  broader  UK  innovation eco-system involving multiple universities, catapult centres and the National Health Service.\n\nAs a part of the ongoing e/fforts to decarbonise the steel sector, Tata Steel has executed the trial injection of hydrogen gas using 40% of the injection systems in 'E' Blast Furnace at its Jamshedpur Works. This was the /first time in the world that such a large quantity of hydrogen gas was continuously injected in a blast furnace. Another key implementation on sustainability this year was SMART solution package for cooling tower. The machine learning  algorithm-based  solution  has  resulted  in substantial improvements in energy e/fficiency, reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, water savings, operational expenses without causing any operational disturbances. The project won the 'Energy Transition Changemakers' award during COP 28.\n\nWith  focus  on  customer  centricity,  Tata  Steel  has developed an engineered polymer coating solution that make 7-tanks pre-treatment process redundant. This technology is mainly developed for Cold Rolled Steel and can be directly applied without any pre-treatment or primer coatings. Integrating sensors into production processes  is  gaining  momentum  in  manufacturing industry as it enables enhanced monitoring, analysis and optimisation of parameters, ultimately contributing to increased e/fficiency and quality control. Amongst several notable implementation on sensorisation front, R&D developed Fiber Bragg Grating based sensors",

The system is designed to improve productivity and safe operations.\n\nThe emphasis on establishing technology leadership precipitated in /filing of 142 patent applications and grant of 395 patents, marking the highest tally in history, and underscoring a dedicated commitment to innovation. R&D won several prestigious awards this year including Asia IP Elite 2023, CII Innovation award, CII Industrial IP Award, Energy transition change maker award COP'28 for smart cooling tower, and R&D 100 award for 5 TPD CO 2 capture from Blast Furnace.\n\nTata  Steel  UK  ( 'TSUK' )  produces  approximately  6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide ( 'CO 2 ' ) annually and is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. The e/ffort to reduce this footprint has been two-fold. The /first is the closure of the heavy end operations through the Blast Furnaces route and the investments in the EAF technology. With this, almost 90% of the CO 2 emissions would be addressed. The second is the continued e/fforts to work on technologies that enable further carbon capture and storage/utilization CCU/S- both at Port Talbot as well as the downstream operations.\n\nWith  the  transition  to  EAF  technology,  increased utilisation of the UK's scrap resource is going to be key. With this in mind, TSUK has continued its involvement in the UKRI funded SUSTAIN and RECTIFI Partnerships working with universities and other industries to develop the foundations for future steelmaking. The focus on scrap utilisation has led to the development of tools for the current processes studying the instances of loss of containment from hot metal charging.  This has directly led to a deeper understanding of the UK scrap supply whilst also aiding process stability. The ongoing commitment to CO 2 reduction has led to utilisation of various scrap types in our blast furnaces.  TSUK has also actively studied the replacement of fossil carbon in its coal injection facility by biomass in collaboration with Aberystwyth and Cardi/ff Universities.\n\nTSUK  continues  to  participate  in  yet  another  UKRI funded project, titled Flue2Chem. This project o/ffers a unique opportunity not only to test higher capacity carbon capture technology but also to develop and validate a new business model and capability, to enable the utilisation of waste gases to generate feedstocks and chemicals for use in the production of consumer products in the UK. Tata Steel has also partnered on the UKRI funded Com-2-Coat project. The project has developed digital tools for creating energy-e/fficient and resource-e/fficient functional coatings for steel - specially antimicrobial spray coating.\n\nTSUK is also working on a strategic UK governmentfunded  Catapult  partnership  project  with  Warwick Manufacturing Group ( 'WMG' ) at Warwick University. Under  this  partnership,  TSUK  is  focussing  on  the following:\n\n- \u00bb Innovative solutions for the UK packaging sector. The  objective  is  to  develop  high-strength, double-reduced packaging steels with strengths 600 to 750 MPa and elongation ~5%. These steels are vital for the Easy Open End ( 'EOE' ) and aerosols market, offering comprehensive solutions within a gauge range of about 0.15-0.25 mm. Increased strength and ductility will facilitate further downgauging, potentially reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 1% per can. TSUK and WMG are /filing a patent for this new microstructure, aimed at the high-strength packaging industry aligning to the EN10202:2022 packaging standard.\n- \u00bb Support  to  TSUK's  decarbonization  strategy; particularly aligning with the EAF operations and increasing scrap content, which will in/fluence elements like copper, nickel, tin, and chromium. Pilot work has been conducted to study the impact of residual elements on material properties.  A comprehensive approach is being adopted that integrates residual e/ffects in the development of low-carbon formable steel grades.\n- \u00bb In line with developing a supply chain for packaging laminates in the UK, laboratory-scale extrusion and lamination of new polymer materials on tin cans are being explored. In collaboration with TSN, equipment for producing sanitary and easy-open can lid ends has been developed.\n\nIn June 2023, TSUK R&D organised STIR (Stimulating Innovations in Research) in hybrid mode to discuss and deliberate research and technology themes pertinent to the TSUK towards its journey of Net Zero, Circular Economy and Sustainable Product Portfolios. This was followed up in December 2023 when TSUK hosted its inaugural UK Innovation Awards.  The event saw 74 nominations and recognized around 300 colleagues across /five categories, including the prestigious Chris Elliot Innovation Prize for signi/ficant cross-functional innovations.\n\nWith the adoption of the EAF technology, TSUK is actively working on new research and technology areas e.g. Arti/ficial Intelligence and Machine Learning for scrap beneficiation; Optimisation of Residuals in Scrap for advanced steel grades.\n\nIn  Tata  Steel  Netherlands  ( 'TSN' ),  82%  of  the  R&D technology  programme  was  developed  under  the",

Risk Management\n\nTata Steel operates in a dynamic and uncertain business landscape. Hence, the Company has developed and deployed  its  Enterprise  Risk  Management  ( 'ERM' ) framework to create long-term value. The organisation pursues risk intelligent decision-making to proactively prepare for unforeseen scenarios. The ERM framework incorporates benchmark industry practices, international standards  (including  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organisation of the Treadway Commission - COSO & ISO 31000: 2018), while also being customised to suit the business of the Company.\n\nThe  Risk  Management  Committee  ( 'RMC' )  of  the Board  provides  an  oversight  and  sets  the  context for  implementation  of  the  ERM  process  across the organisation.\n\nThe  RMC  ensures  that  appropriate  methodology, processes, and systems are in place to evaluate and monitor  risks  associated  with  the  business  of  the Company. It reviews the status of key risks, progress of ERM implementation across locations and any exceptions as /flagged to it, on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe risk appetite of the organisation is approved by the RMC and the Board and is aligned to the Vision of the",

It is an important metric for governing all business actions and strategic decisions.\n\nThe risk appetite is driven by the following:\n\n- \u00bb Health  and  safety  of  the  employees  and  the communities in which the Company operates are the prime concern and the operating strategy is focused on the above objective.\n- \u00bb All business decisions are aligned to the Tata Code of Conduct.\n- \u00bb Management actions are focused on continuous improvement.\n- \u00bb Environment  and  Climate  Change  impacts  are assessed on a continuous basis and business decisions support  systems  including  capital  allocation, considers climate impact through the internal carbon pricing framework.\n- \u00bb The long-term strategy of the Company is focused on generating profitable growth and sustainable cash/flows that creates long-term stakeholder value.\n\nRisk Owners may accept risk exposure to their annual and long-term business plans, which after implementation of mitigation strategies, is aligned to the Company's risk appetite.\n\nIn order to drive the ERM implementation, the Company has also constituted a Management Committee called Apex  Risk  Committee  ( 'ARC' )  which  comprises  of the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, ( 'CEO & MD' ), Executive Director and Chief Financial O/fficer ( 'ED & CFO' ) and Vice President - Corporate Finance, Treasury & Risk Management ( 'VP CFT & RM' ) as its members. The ARC reviews the business plan of ERM, engages on the macro environment and deliberates on the risks that the Company faces, every quarter.\n\nThe ERM framework is deeply embedded across the organisation and is driven by a dedicated Central ERM team led by VP CFT & RM who acts as the Chief Risk Officer ( 'CRO' ) of the Company. The CRO reports to ED & CFO and also to the RMC Chairperson. The ERM team  continuously  scans  the  external  and  internal environment for developments which may throw up emerging risks for the organisation. The risk /flags and risk insights are shared with the Senior Management for deep diving into emerging risk areas for the Company. 'Expert Lens' sessions are organised for the leadership team where external experts are invited to discuss emerging risk areas contextual for the Company. Business Units ( 'BUs' ) consider these inputs during identi/fication and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanagement of bottom-up risks, which are reviewed quarterly as per de/fined ERM Governance mechanism. The bottom up ERM process is decentralised, and the ownership of the risks resides with the BUs. Hence, capability development for risk management remains a focus area across the organisation. The bottom-up process is complemented by a top-down process, which helps in identi/fication of strategic enterprise level risks.\n\nThe  Company  follows  co-ordinated  risk  assurance and  the  ERM  process  is  integrated  with  Corporate Audit, Corporate Strategy & Planning, Corporate Legal, Compliance  and  Security  functions.  The  two-way communication with these functions brings further rigor in driving the process across the organisation and the Tata Steel Group Companies ( 'TSGCs' ). Corporate Audit team, led by Chief Audit Executive (who reports to CEO & MD of the Company and Chairperson of the Audit Committee), conducts an independent audit of the ERM process deployment across the organisation, as the third line of defense. The ERM process being data intensive, an in-house built IT system has been deployed across the organisation for management of risks through live dashboards. The IT system supports risk analytics and helps in developing a uniform risk culture as the same ERM framework is used while identifying, assessing, evaluating, monitoring and reviewing risks.\n\nThe year has been disruptive for the global business environment, with the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas con/flict, attacks on the global trade route through Red Sea, to name a few. The Company remained vigilant of the evolving macroeconomic, geopolitical situation  and  global  financial  market  sentiments  to proactively manage risks in FY2023-24. The focus on identi/fication and tracking of 'Early Warning Indicators' and  implementation  of  risk  mitigation  strategies proactively has been a key enabler in managing these risks.\n\nThe Company was conferred with the 'RIMS ERM Global Award of Distinction 2023' for 2 nd consecutive year. The award  recognises  the  Company's  outstanding  ERM achievements that have enabled the organisation to streamline processes and strengthen collaboration across the enterprise in order to achieve strategic objectives.\n\nRisk Maturity Assessment was also conducted during the year by an external agency. The assessment evaluated the deployment of the ERM process across Tata Steel India. Based on the independent evaluation, the Company has received a score of 4.71 on a scale of 5 and assessed to be much ahead in the risk maturity curve as compared to its peers in the same industry.",

Overview\n\nThe  objective  of  this  report  is  to  convey  the Management's  perspective  on  the  external environment and steel industry, as well as strategy, operating  and  financial  performance,  material developments  in  human  resources  and  industrial relations, risks and opportunities and internal control systems and their adequacy in the Company during Financial Year 2023-24. This should be read in conjunction with the Company's /financial statements, the schedules and  notes  thereto  and  other  information  included elsewhere in the Integrated Report and Annual Accounts 2023-24.  The  Company's  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards ( 'Ind AS' ) complying with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( 'SEBI' ) from time to time.\n\n## II. External Environment\n\n## 1. Global Economy\n\nThe  global  economy  continues  to  show  resilience despite facing several strong headwinds viz., the Middle East crisis, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, high in/flation, high costs and falling household purchasing power, rising geopolitical uncertainties, and forced monetary tightening. Global growth is estimated to sustain at 3.2% in 2024, similar to 2023. The economy is better placed now than at the same time in 2023, with the risk of a global recession receding. In late 2023, headline in/flation neared its pre-pandemic level in most economies for the /first time since the start of the global in/flation surge. As global in/flation descended from its peak, economic activity grew steadily, defying warnings of stag/flation and global recession. The United States with some middle-income economies displayed strong economic performance, with aggregate demand supported by stronger than expected private consumption amidst still tight though easing labour markets. Continuing geopolitical tensions, including the Middle East crisis, Russia-Ukraine war and the upcoming US presidential elections pose a risk to dampen growth in 2024.\n\nGrowth in the United States is expected to be 2.4% in 2024, while the Eurozone is expected to witness a minor recovery of 0.7%. Recovery in Europe will be driven by declining in/flation and energy prices normalising. China\n\nwitnessed stronger-than-expected growth of 5.2% in 2023, with 2024 growth projected at 4.65%. Industrial overcapacity, continued slowdown in domestic demand, deepening deflation and heightened trade tensions with the West will remain major headwinds for China throughout 2024.\n\n## Economic Outlook\n\nThe  baseline  forecast  is  for  the  world  economy  to continue growing at 3.2% during 2024 and 2025, at the same pace as in 2023. A slight acceleration for advanced economies where growth is expected to rise from 1.6% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025 will be o/ffset by a modest slowdown in emerging market and developing economies from 4.3% in 2023 to 4.2% in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nGlobal in/flation is forecast to decline steadily, from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.9% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025, with advanced economies returning to their in/flation targets sooner than emerging market and developing economies. Core in/flation is generally projected to decline more gradually.\n\nEnergy  prices  are  expected  to  rationalise  in  2024. Coal and natural gas prices are expected to continue declining from their earlier peaks with the gas market becoming increasingly balanced on account of new supply, dampened demand, and high storage levels. The forecast for non-fuel commodity prices is expected to be broadly stable in 2024, with prices for base metals expected to fall on account of weaker industrial activity in Europe and China.\n\nWith in/flation projected to reduce in this year, policy rates of central banks in major advanced economies are expected to start declining in the second half of 2024. Governments are expected to tighten /fiscal policy in 2024 and, to a lesser extent, in FY2025-26. Among major advanced economies, the structural /fiscal balance to GDP ratio is expected to rise in the United States and in the euro area in 2024. In emerging market and developing economies, the projected /fiscal stance is expected to be, on average, broadly neutral in 2024, with a tightening projected for 2025.\n\nAdvanced economies are expected to see incremental growth, largely re/flecting a recovery in the euro area from low growth in 2023. Developing economies are expected to experience stable growth through 2024 and 2025, with regional di/fferences.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nChina is expected to witness its slowest growth since the mid-90's, outside of the pandemic years. Property sector will continue to remain weak with falling demand and developers lacking /finances to complete projects. Trade growth is also expected to remain low due to subdued global demand. There remains a possibility that the Middle East con/flict escalates which could have far reaching impact, including rise in oil prices and shipping challenges especially for containerships through the Red Sea.\n\n## 2. Indian Economy\n\nIndia's economic growth has been resilient against global headwinds for three /fiscal years now. Policy and regulatory support and prudence have helped, as has the gradual reinvigoration of the private sector.\n\nThe Country's attractiveness as an investment destination remains robust, given the size and scale of operations it has to o/ffer to global companies, abundant skilled talent pool, and prowess in technology and innovation.\n\nThe industrial manufacturing sector has experienced a signi/ficant boost, attracting global technology giants to expand their supplier networks within India. This momentum is further supported by the implementation of state industrial policies that complement sector speci/fic incentive schemes. Concurrently, substantial investments in logistics and infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, highways, and rail tracks, underscore the Government's commitment to bolstering this critical sector. Capital spending by the Government and strong manufacturing activity have meaningfully contributed to the robust growth outcomes in 2023.\n\nVarious Production Linked Incentive ( 'PLI' ) schemes have revived the manufacturing sector post pandemic. They are helping build up critical value chains and industrial clusters, besides expanding the Country's export basket. Overall, the PLI schemes have brought in a new regulatory framework, which can be aligned to address industrial and manufacturing technology de/ficiencies and improve output. The Government is also contemplating extending the scheme to further sectors, to develop new segments in labour intensive sectors.\n\nServices export grew on a year-on-year basis on the back of rising exports of software, business and travel services. The rise in net services exports receipts and softening of the global commodity prices, more than compensated for a slight rise in merchandise trade de/ficit. This has helped cushion the Current Account De/ficit ( 'CAD' ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndia's retail in/flation for FY2023-24 has seen a signi/ficant downturn, marking its lowest point since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Re/flecting this trend, the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee ( 'MPC' ) in its recent meeting, decided to maintain policy rates at their current levels, citing the ongoing reduction in price pressures across the country.\n\n## 3. Global Steel Industry\n\nSteel industry has been impacted by high inflation and interest rate environment in addition to growing geo-economic fragmentation. The slowdown of steel consuming sectors, especially in EU & US continued in 2023 as investment and consumption weakened. The delayed e/ffect of tightening monetary policy may allow slow recovery in 2024 in advanced economies while emerging economies, particularly Asia may grow faster. Persistent core in/flation, high oil prices and tight job market remain the downside risks to stabilising in/flation.\n\nAs Tata Steel approaches the end of this monetary tightening cycle, tighter credit conditions and higher costs have led to a sharp slowdown in housing activity in most major markets and have hampered manufacturing sector globally. While it seems the world economy will experience a soft landing from this monetary tightening cycle, global steel demand growth is expected to remain weak and market volatility remaining high on lagged impact of monetary tightening, high costs and high geopolitical uncertainties. While residential construction has been impacted by high interest rates, infrastructure investments have cushioned the impact in many regions, including advanced economies. Manufacturing and consumer durables sectors continued to slow against weak demand. While automotive recovery continued in 2023, it's expected to decelerate in 2024.\n\nChinese economy is in a structural transition phase. The property sector turmoil impacted domestic steel demand through most of 2023, albeit the position improved slightly in the later half of the year largely on account of Government interventions. 2023 witnessed a growth of ~9% in steel exports from China leading to softening prices in the international market and lowering pro/fitability of mills in emerging markets. Steel demand in China in 2024 is expected to remain around the level of 2023, as real estate investments continue to decline, but the corresponding steel demand loss will be o/ffset by growth in steel demand coming from infrastructure investments and manufacturing sectors.",

        "page_content": "European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) are deemed  to  be  facing  the  biggest  challenges  with geopolitical shifts, high in/flation monetary tightening and partial withdrawal of /fiscal support, and still high energy and commodity prices. While EU demonstrated resilience through the recent energy crisis, high interest rates and energy costs continue to impact manufacturing. The downside factors pulled the demand in 2023 to lowest since 2000. The demand in 2024 is expected to be just over the pandemic levels.\n\n## Demand Outlook\n\nGlobal Steel demand is expected to grow by ~2% to reach 1,793 MT in 2024. Chinese domestic demand will continue to be impacted by property sector woes, however, Government  impetus  may  improve  infrastructure investment in later part of 2024 and domestic demand is expected to sustain 2023 level. Exports are expected to continue to be at 2023 levels. Consolidation in the sector may improve pro/fitability of Chinese mills in the long run but squeeze margins during investment phase. In 2024, Chinese steel demand is expected to sustain at 2023 level. However, it is likely to decline in the mediumterm, as China gradually moves away from a real estate and infrastructure investment dependent economic development model.\n\nThe  developed  world  is  also  expected  to  show  a strengthening recovery with 1.3% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025, as it is expected to see steel demand /finally show a meaningful uptick in the EU in 2025 and continued resilience in the US, Japan, and Korea.\n\nEmerging regions like Middle East and North Africa ( 'MENA' ) and Association of Southeast Asian Nation ( 'ASEAN' ) are expected to show accelerating growth in their steel demand over 2024-2025 after a signi/ficant slowdown  over  2022-2023.  Political  instability  and erosion of competitiveness may lead to a lower trend steel demand growth going ahead.\n\nIndia has emerged as the strongest driver of steel demand growth since 2021. The growth is backed by a booming construction sector with private consumption as well as robust Government expenditure fuelling infrastructure and capital goods as well. Automotive also performed better than expected while consumer durables industry underperformed in the in/flationary environment. Coking coal prices softened towards the end of the /financial year and imports from China squeezed margins for domestic players while pulling down international steel prices.\n\nThe growth projection for India's GDP in the FY2024-25 is expected to be 6.8% reflecting both global and\n\ndomestic optimism in the Country's economy on the back of robust manufacturing activity and infrastructure spending. India is expected to retain its tag of the fastest growing large economy.\n\nWhile private industrial capital spending in India has been slow, it is expected to pick up with ongoing supply chain diversi/fication bene/fits and investors response to the Government's PLI scheme to boost key manufacturing industries. Additionally, rising capacity utilisation, robust credit growth and upbeat business sentiment point to an improving outlook for private investment.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep interest rates constant in the near term, while restrained public consumption spending is expected to be o/ffset by strong public investment expenditures.\n\nFor the next fiscal, inflation is expected to decline further on an average amid risks to food in/flation. Soft commodity prices and healthier farm output should help moderate in/flation. However, geopolitical disruption in the Middle East could add some pressure on in/flation.\n\nSofter crude oil prices and moderation in domestic growth is expected to keep trade de/ficit in check despite tepid export of goods. Alongside, robust services trade surplus and healthy remittances is expected to keep the CAD in check which coupled with healthy foreign portfolio  flows  amid  a  favourable  domestic  macro environment would support the Indian Rupee.\n\nSteel demand in India is expected to grow at ~8% in 2024 to reach 144 million tonnes. Interim budget has signaled strong demand with 11% increase in infrastructure budget. Steel demand growth is expected to continue, albeit slightly subdued in the /first half of the year due to slowdown of construction during general elections. Prices are expected to remain soft in light of cheaper Chinese  imports  in  absence  of  policy  intervention. Integrated steel plants are expected to continue capacity additions, although at a slower pace than announced given tough operating environment. With capacity additions planned in FY2024-25, industry leverage is expected to increase signi/ficantly.\n\nUtilisation levels are expected to remain healthy at close to 80%. Net export position is expected to strengthen with improving global demand.\n\n## 4. Global Raw Material Market\n\nThe steel raw materials market in FY2023-24 exhibited ongoing volatility, notably within coal markets due to intermittent weather disruptions in Eastern Australia and unforeseen interruptions in logistics and production.",

India had seen a remarkable increase in steel production, with total crude steel production rising 11.8% y-o-y to 140.2Mt, but the steel production in EU fell to 7.4% y-o-y in 2023 to 126.3Mt due to beleaguered steel demand.\n\nChinese iron ore imports in 2023 rose 6.6% y-o-y to 1.18Bt, owning to stronger-than expected demand amid a lack of Government mandated steel output restrictions and higher steel exports. Similarly, coking coal imports to China also surged 60.6% year-on-year to 101.9Mt due to healthy demand, rising volumes from Mongolia and competitive prices for Russian coals.\n\nOn top of sharp rise in coking coal imports, China also ramped up domestic coal production, with its raw coal production hitting a record high in 2023, at 4.66Bt, up 2.9% y-o-y. Australian coal exports to China also resumed gradually in 2023 following the lifting of uno/fficial bans, but volumes were substantially lower at 2.8Mt, compared to 35.4Mt in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian coking coal exports declined for  the  fourth  consecutive  year,  dropping  by  5.0% y-o-y to 150.6Mt, in line with lower mine utilisation rate observed across major Australian PHCC producers. Logistics  and  mining  operations  were  adversely a/ffected by heavy rainfall and occasional /flooding in Eastern Australian, while unplanned maintenance and production also disrupted coal production and delivery.\n\n## Prices\n\nSeaborne Iron ore prices in 2023 had been largely /flat y-o-y, in line with relatively /flat crude steel production. 62% Fe CFR China prices ranged between $97.35/t and $141.45/t in 2023 compared to $80.15/t and $162.75/t in 2022. Average iron ore prices stood at ~$119.75/t for the year, /flat from $120.16/t for 2022.\n\nIron ore prices saw intermittent support in the year as the Chinese government's stimulus buoyed sentiments and prices.\n\nNegative steel margins reported by Chinese mills have however, limited further upside to iron ore prices despite /firm demand from end-users. At the same time, key property metrics in China, such as new home sales and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstarts, also remained lagged in 2023, which weighed on steel demand and prices.\n\nOn the supply front, total shipments from Australia and Brazil remained healthy, at an average of 25.1Mt/week in  2023.  However,  uncertainty  surrounding  China's downstream  steel  recovery  and  potential  resilient performance in steel exports could impact seaborne iron ore demand in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeaborne Coking coal prices remained elevated due to adverse weather conditions alongside the production disruptions faced by major suppliers. Prime Hard Coking Coal ( 'PHCC' ) Free on Board ( 'FOB' ) Australian prices ranged between $221.5/t and $390.0/t in 2023, compared between $188/t and $670.5/t in 2022. Average coking coal prices stood at $296.3/t for the year, down from $363.7/t the year prior.\n\nFOB Australian prices in 2023 have eased from last year amid rebalancing of trade /flows. However, prices were still elevated on a historical basis as wet weather condition and unforeseen production disruptions led to decline in production volumes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInto 2024, coking coal prices are expected to trade within a tighter range, although volatility may persist due to weather developments, particularly in Eastern Australia.",

Out of few coals tried out in Tata Steel plants in FY2023-24, 7 new coals have been included in the sourcing plan for FY2024-25.\n- \u00bb Blend optimisation to take advantage of market opportunities : Initiatives  undertaken  towards leaning of blend through usage of additives, weaker coals, value in use accretive coals in blend for each basket, to partly o/ffset the increase coal prices.\n- \u00bb Price Prediction Models : As part of digital initiatives, Tata Steel has developed an in-house price prediction model for forecasting of coking coal prices. This is one of the levers being used, along with market & competitive intelligence, to source better.\n- \u00bb Supplier  Engagement : Tata  Steel  has  been strengthening metcoal supplier connect through organised meets in Australia, longer term contracts, and other value in use initiatives.\n- \u00bb Domestic Sourcing : Long-term contract agreement has been entered with Coal India Limited to reduce import  dependency  of  thermal  coal  for  power generation and operations as well as enhancing security of supplies from mines in proximity.\n\n## III.  Strategy\n\nDuring the year under review, in line with its aspiration of becoming the most respected and valuable steel company  globally,  the  Company  has  continued  to focus on growth through the organic route in its India operations while upgrading of the assets in Europe. Furthermore,  the  Company  has  been  successful  in keeping its investment grade credit rating. With the merger of /five companies into and with Tata Steel, the portfolio is being simpli/fied to derive synergies.\n\nThe Company continues to be committed to achieving its plan for growth until 2030. The following will assist in accomplishing the Company's objectives:\n\n## Market Leadership in India\n\nThe demand for steel in India is being driven by structural factors like growing infrastructure investment, rapid\n\nurbanisation, the push towards domestic manufacture, and rising a/ffordability. Growth in demand combined with substantial raw material reserves and an extensive pool  of  competent  manpower  provide  structural advantages for the steel sector. Tata Steel intends to take advantage of this potential for growth by expanding organically. The Company is on track to double its production capacity in India. The acquisition of NINL's steel production facility enhanced the Company's long products product basket thereby balancing the portfolio between long and /flat products. The Company has made good progress in the execution of TSK phase 2 capacity expansion project in FY2023-24 which will enable the necessary volumes and grades of steel to suit growing and evolving customer needs.\n\nThe  initiatives  aimed  to  increase  the  Company's captive  raw  material  mining  are  proceeding  as planned. Tata Steel is further enhancing its e/fforts of digital adoption, understanding how consumers are changing, and creating an organisation-wide culture of customer obsession.\n\n## Consolidate position as global cost leader\n\nRaw material prices as well as steel prices continue to be volatile under the in/fluence of supply chain disruption emanating  from  geopolitical  uncertainties  and increased China export outlook. The Company aspires to achieve benchmark operating KPIs through process improvements and savings through structured initiatives like Shikhar25.\n\nTata Steel is also working parallelly on structural cost reduction  by  strengthening  the  logistics  network, expansion of raw material portfolio, reduction of /fixed costs, among others. The Company will keep leveraging technology and digital solutions to achieve and sustain benchmark cost performance.\n\n## Attain leadership position in adjacent businesses\n\nTechnology, innovation, and customer expectations are developing at an unprecedented rate, generating possibilities for expansion of businesses that serve the steel sector. Tata Steel is creating a new paradigm for the future by blending alternative thinking and the ability to visualise opportunities. The strategy is to stand out by having a thorough grasp of the demands of  the  client,  providing  relevant  technology-based solutions, and fostering the development of signi/ficant talents within the ecosystem of client needs, pertinent technology-based problem solving, and the ecosystem's development of relevant capabilities.

Tata Steel Group Operations\n\n## 1. Major Highlights\n\nDuring the year under review, the consolidated crude steel  production  for  Tata  Steel  Group  (' TSG ')  was 29.94  MT  which  was  lower  by  2%  (FY2022-23: 30.65 MT), primarily on account of the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Tata Steel Netherlands, which was o/ffset by an increase in production at Indian operations owing to de-bottlenecking across sites and higher steel production at Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (' NINL ') during the year.\n\nThe production increased at Tata Steel Standalone to  20.12  MT  which  was  higher  by  2%  (FY2022-23: 19.67 MT) attributable to de-bottlenecking across sites. NINL produced 0.66 MT (FY2022-23: 0.20 MT), as it started\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduction from October 2022 onwards post takeover of its operations by the management of Tata Steel.\n\nThe European Operations produced 7.80 MT, lower by 17% (FY2022-23: 9.35 MT) due to the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Tata Steel Netherlands along with subdued market demand. Production at South East Asia (' SEA ') of 1.36 MT (FY2022-23: 1.43 MT) was lower due to weak demand.\n\nThe  consolidated  steel  deliveries  of  TSG  was  at 29.39  MT  in  FY2023-24  increase  of  2%  (FY2022-23: 28.79 MT), primarily at Tata Steel Standalone (1.06 MT). Deliveries declined at Europe on account of the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands.\n\nThe  turnover  of  TSG  in  FY2023-24  was  lower  over FY2022-23 by H 14,182 crore (6%) on account of decline in steel realisations across geographies along with decline in deliveries at the European operations attributable to decrease in demand and lower production, partly o/ffset by higher deliveries in India.\n\nThe EBITDA  in  FY2023-24  was  lower  over FY2022-23  by H 9,296  crore  (28%),  primarily  due  to subdued performance from the European operations primarily due to contraction in steel prices and lower deliveries. EBITDA however, improved in the Indian operations on account of higher deliveries by 1.06 MT along with decrease in input costs, which was partly o/ffset by lower steel realisations.\n\nTata Steel Group ( 'TSG' ) on a consolidated basis reported a loss after tax of H 4,910 crore as compared to pro/fit after tax of H 8,075 crore in FY2022-23 primarily on account on account of higher charges under exceptional items of H 7,814 crore as against a credit of H 113 crore in the previous year majorly due to the impairment of Property Plant and Equipment at TSUK for heavy-end restructuring along with provision for redundancy and restructuring costs. The decline in pro/fit was also due to lower EBITDA attributable to subdued operational performance of European operations.\n\n## 2.

DI Pipes are used in water infrastructure projects for conveyance of drinking water, sewage and irrigation, while Pig Iron is used in foundries for manufacturing ferrous castings.\n\n## Pig Iron\n\nDemand for PI remained subdued during the year with downward price corrections from time to time. This was due to price volatility of raw materials, weak buying sentiments and over-supply in domestic market.\n\n## DI Pipe\n\nThe DI Pipe business domestic demand was robust throughout the year with very healthy order load of 7-8 months on account of signi/ficantly increased demand from Government's water infrastructure projects under Jal Jeevan Mission ( 'JJM' ) and AMRUT 2.0 schemes. DI Pipe exports were, however, weak, due to slow down in the global economies and shortage of funds for projects in the developing countries.\n\nThe production and sales performance is as below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Year in review\n\n- \u00bb FY2023-24, the Division produced Pig iron of 120 kt, lower by 149 kt over FY2022-23 and produced DI Pipes of 398 kt, higher by 98 kt over previous year. Deliveries of PI of 122 kt lower by 140 kt over FY2022-23 in line with lower production whereas, deliveries of DI Pipes of 396k tonnes were higher by 100k tonnes over the previous year.\n- \u00bb DI Pipe 2 (new plant) witnessed a smooth ramp up. The Division achieved signi/ficant steps strides towards  ongoing  Phase-II  expansion  goals. The  Division  is  aggressively  moving  ahead  to complete  the  commissioning  of  the  entire expansion  project  by  FY2024-25  which  will signi/ficantly enhance its name plate capacity to 0.45 Mtpa. The market share of the DI Pipe Division was 12%, same as the previous year, though on much larger base.\n\n## Recognition:\n\n- \u00bb Rewarded 'Gold Award' for increasing Pulverized Coal Injection ( 'PCI' ) rate in Blast Furnace.\n- \u00bb Obtained 'Silver Award' for increasing throughput of Coke Plant.\n- \u00bb Under Energy Excellence obtained 'Silver Award' for linear Cooler Fan speed optimisation; and\n- \u00bb 7 th CII Kaizen competition - 'Silver Award' for Best Innovative Kaizen in Quality",

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\n## Standalone Performance\n\n## 1. Tata Steel Limited\n\nDuring  FY2023-24,  the  Company  recorded  a profit  after  tax  of H 4,807  crore  (previous  year: H 14,685 crore). The decrease is primarily on of account higher charge under exceptional items owing to impairment of investments in group companies. Excluding the impact of charge under exceptional items, the pro/fit increased due to higher operating pro/fits as compared to the previous year attributable to higher sales volume and lower raw material costs due to decrease in raw material prices mainly of coking coal and lower purchase of pellets, which was partly o/ffset by, decrease in steel realisations. Finance cost was higher due to additional loans taken during the year. The basic and diluted earnings for FY2023-24 were at H 3.85 per share each (previous year: basic and diluted: H 11.76 per share each).\n\nThe analysis of major items of the /financial statements is given below:\n\n## a) Revenue from operations\n\n|                                | FY24    | FY23    | ( H  crore) Change (%)   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|---------|--------------------------|\n| Sale of products               | 137,284 | 139,669 | (2)                      |\n| Sale of power and water        | 1,913   | 1,775   | 8                        |\n| Other operating revenue        | 1,790   | 1,469   | 22                       |\n| Total revenue from  operations | 140,987 | 142,913 | (1)                      |\n\nDuring the year under review, sale of products was marginally lower as compared to that of the previous year, primarily due to decrease in realisations in domestic as well as export markets, partly o/ffset by higher steel deliveries by 1.06 MT. Sale of power and water and other operating income increased in line with higher demand and prices.\n\n## b) Purchases of stock-in-trade\n\n|                             | FY24   | FY23   |   ( H  crore) Change (%) |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Purchases of stock-in-trade | 9,702  | 7,424  |                       31 |\n\nDuring the year under review, purchases of stock-in-trade was signi/ficantly higher as compared to the previous /financial year primarily due to higher purchase of traded rebars from NINL and Tata Steel Thailand. These were partly o/ffset by decrease in external scrap purchases as own generated pooled iron was utilised.\n\n## c) Cost of materials consumed\n\n|                   | FY24   | FY23   | ( H  crore) Change (%)   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Cost of materials | 48,018 | 59,949 | (20)                     |\n| consumed          | 48,018 | 59,949 | (20)                     |\n\nDuring the year under review, cost of materials consumed reduced primarily due to decline in imported coking coal prices, along with lower cost of purchased pellets post commencement of pellet plant at Kalinganagar during the year.\n\n## d) Employee bene/fits expense\n\n|                            | FY24   | FY23   |   Change (%) |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|\n| Employee bene/fits expense | 7,402  | 7,221  |            3 |\n\nDuring the year under review, the employee bene/fits expense increased primarily due to salary revisions and its consequential impact on retirement provisions along with increase in leave salary and sta/ff welfare expenses.\n\n## e) Depreciation and amortisation expense\n\n|                                        | FY24   | FY23   | ( H  crore) Change (%)   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Depreciation and  amortisation expense | 5,970  | 5,956  | -                        |\n\nThe depreciation charge during the year is at par with the previous year as the higher charge for new additions during the year, was o/ffset by assets fully depreciated during the year.\n\n## f) Other expenses\n\n|                | FY24   | FY23   |   ( H  crore) Change (%) |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Other expenses | 45,661 | 41,379 |                       10 |",

Cash in/flow from working capital changes in FY2023-24 is mainly due to decrease in non-current/current  financial  and  other  assets  by H 1,947 crore, in trade receivables and other advances with public bodies along with decrease in inventories by H 901 crore primarily due to decrease in prices. Increase in Non-current/current  financial  and  other  liabilities/ provisions by H 125 crore primarily due to increase in trade payables for coal purchases and other liabilities.

Europe Operations\n\nEconomic growth continued to decelerate globally in 2023. The rise of central bank rates to /fight in/flation continued  to  negatively  impact  consumption  and investments. Global GDP growth increased by 2.7% (2022: 3.1%). In/flation at 6.1% was lower than the 8.1% in 2022 but still signi/ficantly above levels seen in earlier years (2.9% in 2016-2020). In China GDP growth was 5.2% (2022: 3.0%) as economic activity increased due to the reopening of the Chinese economy in January 2023 after being shut down during the pandemic. Growth in China was held back during the year by a weak property market with house prices declining which led to issues for real estate developers.\n\nThe EU economy decelerated to 0.5% (2022: 3.5%) and the UK economy to 0.1% (2022: 4.4%). Monetary tightening and high energy costs impacted the economy. Output",

Growth across the EU was uneven across the individual economies. Germany experienced a mild recession with -0.1% and France and Italy grew by 0.9% and 0.7% respectively.\n\nGlobal steel demand declined in 2023 for the second year in a row by 1.1%, in line with the weak macro-economic conditions, after -3.3% decline in 2022. Demand in China decreased by 3.3% (2022: -2.9%). This decline was mainly driven by the downturn in the Chinese real estate sector. Steel demand from the manufacturing sectors continued to grow. Chinese steel demand is gradually shifting from construction to manufacturing and from long steel products to /flat steel products. Demand in the EU decreased by 10.0% (2022: -7.9%). Activity growth in the main steel-using sectors decelerated but remained slightly positive in 2023. Although construction output was negatively impacted by the high interest rates, especially  for  real  estate,  automotive  output  grew strongly due to backlogs.\n\nIn 2023 global steel production decreased by 0.2% to 1,848 Mt (2022: -3.3%). Steel production in China decreased by 0.4% to 1,015 Mt (2022: -1.4%) and equated to 55% of global steel production. In the EU, production decreased by 7.3% to 126 Mt (2022: -10.7%) as ~20% of blast furnaces were idled in response to lower demand for steel.\n\nThe market reference price for iron ore /fines (China CFR 62%) remained relatively stable in 2023 at US$120/t (change against the previous year: -$1/t), with a low of US$105/t in May and a high of US$137/t in December. The hard coking coal spot price (Australia FOB) declined to US$296/t (change against the previous year: -$69/t). In March 2022 the price was at an all-time high of 594 US$/t due to the loss of supply from Russia as a result of the war in the Ukraine. The German benchmark scrap price (Sorte 2/8) decreased to \u20ac340/t (change against the previous year: -\u20ac74/t) compared to the previous calendar year. The price of CO 2 increased in 2023 to \u20ac84/t (change against the previous year: +\u20ac3/t), reaching an all-time high in February 2023 at \u20ac92/t. Reforms of the EU Emissions Trading System lead to a reduction in the supply of permits which cause the price to rise.\n\nIn the second half of 2023 the price declined mainly due to the weak economy reducing the demand for carbon allowances.\n\nThe European steel spot Hot Rolled Coil price (Germany, parity point) decreased in 2022 to \u20ac713/t (-\u20ac193/t).\n\nIn April 2022 the steel price was at an all-time high of \u20ac1,346/t due to the loss of supply from Ukraine and Russia. In 2023 the price was relatively low due to declining demand for steel.\n\nIn 2024 economic growth is expected to gradually accelerate in both the EU and the UK due to a lowering of the bank rates as inflation normalises. However, the high interest rates will continue to impact the economy leading to a gradual recovery. In 2024 growth of 0.8% is expected for the EU and 0.5% for the UK. Economic growth is expected to return to long-term levels pre-pandemic in 2026. Output growth in the steel-using sectors is forecast to be low in 2024 due to the tight monetary policy. A recovery in real demand is not foreseen in 2024 but a rebound of steel demand of 2.9% is expected due to restocking as the steel-using sectors start to anticipate higher demand for their products.\n\nThe  turnover  and  profit/(loss)  figures  of  TSE  are given below:\n\n|                                               | FY24     | ( H  crore) FY23   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------|\n| Turnover                                      | 78,144   | 90,300             |\n| EBITDA                                        | (7,612)  | 4,632              |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before  exceptional | (12,555) | 1,103              |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                      | (19,262) | 1,304              |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before exceptional   | (12,896) | (3,464)            |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                       | (19,603) | (3,263)            |\n\nThe production and sales performance of TSE (continuing operations) is given below:\n\n|                         |   FY24 |   FY23 | (mn tonnes) Change (%)   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Liquid Steel Production |   7.8  |   9.35 | (17)                     |\n| Deliveries              |   7.68 |   8.16 | (6)                      |\n\nProduction in FY2023-24 decreased by 1.55 MT (17%) compared to the previous year due to the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands. TSE's deliveries decreased by ~6% over the previous year due to the reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands along with subdued demand from the market. The reduction in deliveries was less than the reduction in production due to the utilisation of stock built up in the prior year in anticipation of the Blast Furnace 6 reline.\n\nDuring the year under review, the revenue stood at H 78,144 crore which was lower than FY2022-23.

TSE reported an EBITDA loss of H 7,612 crore during FY2023-24 lower than the EBITDA pro/fit of H 4,632 crore during FY2022-23. This signi/ficant reduction in EBITDA was seen in both TSN and TSUK. In TSN the impact of the Blast Furnace 6 reline and lower spreads within the  market  contributed  for  the  decline  whereas  in TSUK the performance was adversely impacted by the performance of the end of life assets at the Port Talbot site as well as subdued market conditions.\n\nTata Steel Nederlands ('TSN') - Liquid steel production at IJmuiden Steel Works, Netherlands during FY2023-24 at 4.81 MT was 1.52 MT lower than the previous year due to the reline of Blast Furnace 6. With completion of the repairs that were scheduled in the outage, the Blast Furnace 6 will be able to stay in production until TSN is ready to transition to a whole new way of producing steel and the newly built DRI plant is commissioned.\n\nIn October 2022, TSN submitted a request for 'Maatwerk' to enable the /first phase of its decarbonisation plan, which is to be completed by 2030. An improved Green Steel Plan with an enhanced focus on reducing the impact on the environment and making TSN more circular was submitted to the Dutch Government in November 2023. The Green Steel Plan entails the closing of the largest blast furnace (blast furnace 7) and cokes and gas plant 2 and replacing them with a direct reduced iron plant and an electric arc furnace.\n\nThe  Green  Steel  Plan  is  contingent  on  receiving 'Maatwerk'  support.  External  advisors,  engaged  by the Ministry of Economic A/ffairs and Climate Policy to assess TSN's Green Steel Plan against alternatives viewed from the perspective and policy choices of the State. The report came out on March 28, 2024 and describes 5 scenarios. The cabinet has indicated in its letter of the same date to Parliament that it will investigate as quickly as possible if they can start discussions with TSN based upon the Green Steel Plan with accelerated reduction of nuisance.\n\nWith  the  continued  support  of  Tata  Steel,  and  the increased urgency to reduce our environmental impact, TSN  is  confident  that  in  the  coming  year  TSN  will accelerate the process towards concluding a 'Maatwerk' support package. In the meantime, the process to obtain permits for the new facilities has started and TSN is actively engaging with local communities to inform on TSN plans and seek feedback.\n\nIn FY2023-24, the Roadmap Plus Program took a big step forward with completion of the dust removal installation and start of constructing the DeNOx installation, both at\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe Pellet Plant. The DeNOx installation aims to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 80% by capturing NOx compounds at the Pellet Plant.\n\nWith the Green Steel Plan, TSN is at the threshold of an important transition. To be able to a/fford that plan, it is essential to have and maintain a strong competitive position and to be agile enough to respond to rapidly changing  circumstances  and  new  developments. In FY2023-24 an initiative that focusses on improving the operational and /financial performance of Tata Steel IJmuiden was launched under the name 'TSIJ.NU'. The initiative aimed to increase throughput and utilise the full product portfolio resulting from the latest investments and the measures taken consist of improving our market position, reducing various fixed costs and working towards stable production.\n\nIn the year under review, TSN completed the upgrade of  its  Continuous  Galvanising  Line  3,  that  enables a more robust production of advanced (ultra) high strength steels with increased dimensional windows, and the extensive upgrade of Cold Mill 21, that allows us to manufacture grades, such as existing and future advanced and ultra-high strength steels, at signi/ficantly larger dimensional windows, improved surface quality, improved thickness performance, and a better surface inspection to improve the customer performance.\n\nTata Steel UK ('TSUK') - Liquid steel production at Port Talbot Steel Works, Wales during FY2023-24 at 2.99 MT was marginally lower over the previous year. During both years TSUK's primary steel making assets in Port Talbot produced significantly below their planned outputs due to operational issues with the assets which were near the end of their useful lives. These operational issues contributed to the closure of the coke ovens in March  2024  and  towards  a  strategic  review  of  the remainder of the heavy end assets in Port Talbot.\n\nThe  Drive  to  Save  programme  was  developed  and launched at the start of the year to focus on the cash position on the business. The programme delivered important savings with \u00a356m in cash improvements in first half of FY2023-24. There were a number of improvement implemented with the aim of maximising value from TSUK's downstream assets. These included the installation of the UK's largest and heaviest slitter at Hartlepool, a new welder at the Automotive Finishing Line at Llanwern which has increased gauge and coating weight capability and new drossing robots improving the zinc yield at the Zodiac Plant at Llanwern and making the operation safer for employees.",

Tata Steel Thailand\n\nDuring FY2023-24, total steel consumption in Thailand totalled 16.33 MT which decreased slightly (0.4%) in 2023 as compared to 2022. Import volume was 11.21 MT, at 69% of the demand for steel in Thailand, expanded by 4.0% y-o-y.\n\nDemand  for  long  product  in  Thailand  was  6.2  MT, has remained static with a marginal increase of 0.4% y-o-y. Import volume was 2.6 MT, 42% of the demand for  long  product  in  Thailand,  increased  by  5.3% y-o-y.\n\nThailand's economy in 2023 fell short of initial forecasts, with a growth rate of only 1.9%, signi/ficantly lower than earlier predictions of 2.5% to 3.2%. While the tourism sector showed some recovery, weaker performance in  exports,  manufacturing,  and  private  investment hindered overall growth.\n\nDeliveries during the current year were comparatively lower on account of increased competition in rebars from induction furnace producer, higher imports of wire rods from China, higher input cost (scrap prices) and lower demand in the international market.\n\nThe turnover and profit/(loss) of Tata Steel Thailand ( 'TSTH' ) for the Financial Year 2023-24 are as follows:\n\n|                                               | FY24   | ( H  crore) FY23   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Turnover                                      | 5,829  | 6,992              |\n| EBITDA                                        | 44     | 239                |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT), before  exceptional | (30)   | 166                |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT)                      | 22     | 155                |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT), before exceptional   | (29)   | 167                |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)                       | 23     | 156                |\n\nThe  production  and  sales  performance  of  TSTH  is given below:\n\n|                |   FY24 |   FY23 | (mn tonnes) Change (%)   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Saleable Steel |   1.12 |   1.2  | (6)                      |\n| Sales          |   1.12 |   1.21 | (8)                      |\n\nDuring  FY2023-24  the  saleable  steel  production decreased by 0.07 MT and sales declined by 0.09 MT\n\nover FY2022-23. The turnover decreased by H 1,163 crore primarily due to sluggish demand for retail in domestic market. The pro/fit after tax was lower by H 134 crore on account of lower operating pro/fits, o/ffset by exceptional gain on account of disposal of Mini-blast furnace.\n\n## Year in Review\n\n- \u00bb Enhanced  efficiency  of  scrap  sourcing  strategy through the development and implementation of the Scrap Reservation Application.\n- \u00bb Increased in volume of Use scrap to bring production cost down.\n- \u00bb Highest sale volume in High Value Product rebar, dowel and export sale.\n\n## Recognitions\n\n- \u00bb TSTH has been listed in SET ESG Ratings 2023 at the 'A' level which is the /first year of evaluation in the form of ratings, previously known as Thailand Sustainability Investment  ( 'THSI' )  from  the  Stock  Exchange  of Thailand ( 'SET' ).\n- \u00bb TSTH received Sustainability Disclosure Award for the year 2023 from Thaipat Institute.\n\n## Safety/Health/Environment\n\n- \u00bb TSMT - SCSC received 'Thailand Labor Management Excellence Award' 2023 in National Level, continued 5 th year, from Department of Labor Protection & Welfare, Ministry of Labor.\n- \u00bb TSMT - SISCO received 'Certi/ficate of Carbon Footprint for Organization' 2023 from Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organisation.\n- \u00bb TSMT - NTS, SCSC, SISCO received 'Green Mining Award' 2023 from Department of Primary Industries and Mines, Ministry of Industry.\n\n## 4.

SIW's factory is based in Rayong, Thailand and it is a leader in its industry with 34% market share (for PC Strand and PC Wire) in Thailand and it also has a strong export presence across key continents such as Europe, ASEAN, America and Oceania.\n\nTSN Wires is in the business of manufacturing Galvanized Wires and is based out of Rayong, Thailand and is a 60% subsidiary of SIW. TSN Wires serves the Fencing, Poultry, Farming, Paper and other related segments with its Galvanized Wires for various end use applications.\n\nThailand steel demand has been impacted from the delay of new Government formation in H1FY2023-24 and because of the postponement of the national Budget until April/May  2024.  Consequently,  demand  from Government projects which are key demand drivers for sales of PC Products has been absent and on the other hand the private sector also continued to struggle due to lack of demand. In summary, both SIW and TSN Wires got challenged from these two key factors: (1) Demand Slowdown in Thailand, EU and US and (2) Severe  high  competition  and  price  dumping  from Chinese competitors.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit/(loss) of SIW for the Financial Year 2023-24 are as follows:\n\n|                          | FY24   | ( H  crore) FY23   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Turnover                 | 1,416  | 1,930              |\n| EBITDA                   | 67     | 235                |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) | 41     | 190                |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  | 29     | 159                |\n\nThe  production  and  sales  performance  of  SIW  is given below:\n\n|                |   FY24 |   FY23 | (mn tonnes) Change (%)   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Saleable Steel |   0.2  |   0.2  | 3                        |\n| Sales          |   0.21 |   0.22 | (2)                      |\n\nThe turnover and profit/(loss) of TSN Wires for the Financial Year 2023-24 are as follows:\n\n|                          | FY24   | ( H  crore) FY23   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Turnover                 | 251    | 267                |\n| EBITDA                   | (1)    | 0                  |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) | (17)   | (14)               |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  | (17)   | (14)               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe production and sales performance of TSN Wires is given below:\n\n|                |   FY24 |   FY23 | (mn tonnes) Change (%)   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Saleable Steel |   0.03 |   0.03 | (1)                      |\n| Sales          |   0.03 |   0.03 | -                        |\n\nDuring  FY2023-24,  the  combined  saleable  steel production (SIW & TSN Wires) decreased marginally by 2% due to subdued demand, whereas the deliveries were at par. The combined turnover decreased by 24% due to decline in prices.

The product is railed to Sept-Iles (a city in Canada) for shipping to the customers worldwide.\n\nIn FY2023-24, the business was able to produce ~2 MT of iron ore /fines and complete total shipment of 1.94 MT. During this period, total revenues from such sales was U$157 mn against the plan of U$ 154 mn due to steady iron ore prices. TSMC achieved 100% compliance for %Fe and %Silica in it's products resulting in zero quality penalties. Further, premiums were obtained on some product o/fferings (lumps @U$14/ton) in F2023-24 from merchant shipments to China.\n\nThe turnover and pro/fit/(loss) /figures for the Financial Year 2023-24 are as follows:\n\n|                          | FY24   | ( H  crore) FY23   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Turnover                 | 1,330  | 649                |\n| Pro/fit before tax (PBT) | (771)  | (1,086)            |\n| Pro/fit after tax (PAT)  | (771)  | (1,086)            |\n\nDuring FY2023-24, the turnover more than doubled to H 1,330 crore which was signi/ficantly higher over previous year by H 681 crore (105%) owing to higher volumes and prices. FY2023-24 reported a lower loss before tax amounting to H 771 crore as against loss of H 1,086 crore in previous year primarily on account of higher operating pro/fits which was partly o/ffset by higher /finance cost during the year.\n\n## Consolidated Performance\n\nThe consolidated pro/fit after tax of the Company was ( H 4,910 crore) as against H 8,075 crore in the previous year. The decrease was due to lower operating pro/fits on subdued performance from the European operations due to contraction in steel prices and lower deliveries. EBITDA however, improved in the Indian operations primarily on account of higher deliveries along with decrease in input costs, which was partly o/ffset by lower steel realisations in India. Moreover, there were higher charges under exceptional items of H 7,814 crore majorly due to the impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment at TSUK for heavy-end restructuring along with provision for redundancy and restructuring costs. Higher net finance charges by H 1,136 crore mainly at European operations owing to additional loans taken during the year. Tax charge was lower by H 6,397 crore in line with lower pro/fitability.

The increase in Gross Debt was mainly due to net borrowings of H 1,230 crore\n\nmainly in term loans primarily at Tata Steel Limited Standalone for funding capital expansion projects. The increase was further impacted by adverse exchange rate movements on the borrowings.\n\nThe increase in Net Debt was in line with increase in gross debt along with signi/ficant decrease in cash and cash equivalents mainly at Europe due to subdued performance owing to lower activities for reline of Blast Furnace 6 in the Netherlands, and at SIW post dividend payment.

Corporate Finance\n\nIn 2024, the International Monetary Fund expects Global GDP growth to be at 3.1% y-o-y and in/flation to moderate from 8.8% in 2022 to 4.3%. Global central banks have been focused on in/flation and as policy transmission sustained, it has re/flected in the in/flation trajectory across\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nkey regions. Looking ahead to 2025, the Global GDP is expected to witness a marginal increase to 3.2% y-o-y. Global outlook for 2024-25 re/flects better prospects for developed economies including U.S. even as developing economies like India remain resilient. China continues to be a key watchpoint, with its heavily indebted real estate market weighing on economic recovery. China Government has /fixed its o/fficial growth target at around 5% and has also pledged to create 12 million jobs amidst growing concerns over rising unemployment.\n\nOverall, the chances of a hard landing for global economy have diminished due to disin/flation and steady growth in select regions. As a result, risks to global growth are also broadly balanced. For instance, on the upside, expansive /fiscal policy and continued disin/flation can boost growth but raise the risk of a more costly adjustment later on. Conversely, commodity price spikes due to geopolitical issues such as Red Sea attacks may result in persistent inflation  and  lead  to  prolonged  tighter  monetary policy. Hence, in the near term, global policymakers focus will be on e/ffectively managing in/flation while promoting growth.\n\nIn India, The Reserve Bank of India ( 'RBI' ) expects GDP to grow close to 8% y-o-y in 2024, higher than 7.2% y-o-y recorded in 2023. Domestic economic activity has been aided by Government spending, household consumption, rise in manufacturing activity and services sector. These factors along with healthy corporate and bank balance sheets and rising integration with global supply chains are likely to aid growth in the near term. In 2025, India GDP is expected to expand by 7.4% y-o-y and Consumer Price Index ( 'CPI' ) is likely to moderate from 5.4% in 2024 to 4.5% levels. In/flation trajectory to be shaped by evolving food in/flation, state of supply chains and global commodity prices especially oil.\n\n## Financial Markets:\n\nGlobal financial markets have continued to remain volatile  and  uncertain  due  to  inflation  -  rate  hike dynamics. In the U.S., sharp rise in interest rates, since February 2022, have led to a situation where short-term U.S. Treasury yields have surpassed those of longer-term U.S. Treasury bonds, creating an inverted yield curve. Moreover, persistent in/flation and the ongoing rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve have continued to weigh on the global credit market, culminating in benchmark rates for U.S. Treasuries reaching their highest levels in 16 years (by October 2023). Since then, slight decline in the CPI and signs of a cooling labour market in the U.S. have led to improved sentiment.",

        "page_content": "In India, /financial markets have witnessed improvement and remained resilient despite global uncertainties and  geopolitical  tensions.  RBI  maintained  its  repo rate throughout the year while investors witnessed a remarkable ascent, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex scaling new heights. Nifty attained a record peak of 22,097 points on January 15, 2024, registering a 27% increase for the year. Sensex also reached an all-time high of 73,328 points on the same day, emphasising the broader market strength. Overall, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex have witnessed gains of around 25%, positioning this year as one of the most successful in recent times. The movement was visible across broad sectors including steel. Tata Steel share price has increased from around ' 107 per share levels in early March 2023 to around ' 157 per share in March 2024, reaching an all-time high and surpassing the previous best recorded nearly three years ago. Moving to yields, the 10-year Government securities (G-secs) have remained relatively stable within a certain range during the /financial year. In February 2024, the yield on the 10-year benchmark G-sec fell by ~10 basis points following the announcement of a reduced /fiscal de/ficit in the interim union budget. The anticipated decrease in total Government borrowing and the expected inclusion of G-Secs in major global bond indices by 2025, indicates that the Government might be able to secure funding at lower costs from the market and this augurs well for the broader market sentiment.\n\n## Central Banks and Monetary Policy:\n\nThe International Monetary Fund ( 'IMF' ) expects global in/flation to fall from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. Developed economies are expected to see faster disin/flation than emerging market and developing economies. While factors vary, disin/flation is primarily expected to be driven by softening labour markets, food in/flation and energy prices. In the U.S., Federal Reserve had raised rates in July 2023 by 0.25% to 5.25% - 5.50% and since then, it has kept rates unchanged despite concerns about banking industry, persistent in/flation, and robust job numbers. While US Federal Reserve continues to remain cautious, it has steadily pivoted to rate cuts in 2024. The Federal Open Market Committee appears to have transitioned from a stringent to a more accommodating stance and in its December 2023 meeting, signalled three quarter-point rate cuts by the end of 2024 to lower the fed fund rates to 4.6%. As of now, U.S. Federal Reserve's projections suggest that Personal Consumption Expenditure in/flation will settle at 2.5% in 2024 and ease to 2.2% in 2025.\n\nIn the same vein, Eurozone consumer price in/flation has also declined from 9.2% in February 2023 to 2.6% in March 2024. In the United Kingdom, consumer price in/flation including housing costs has decreased from 9.2% in February 2023 to 3.8% in February 2024. With inflation  rates  moderating  across  key  regions,  the European Central Bank witnessed peak interest rate of 4.5% in September 2023 following its tenth increase since July 2022, while the Bank of England witnessed its peak of 5.25% in August 2023. Since then, central banks have maintained rates, anticipating that the e/ffects of the rate hikes implemented throughout 2023 will sustain progress with respect to in/flation dynamics.\n\nIn India, RBI maintained the policy repo rate at 6.5%, unchanged during the /financial year (FY2023-24). The last increase was in February 2023. RBI continues to remain focused on maintaining CPI in/flation at 4% in the medium-term, with a tolerance range of plus or minus 2%, while also promoting economic growth.\n\n## Financing:\n\nTata Steel triangulates its capital allocation between deleveraging,  return  to  shareholders  and  growth capex to provide optimal returns to the shareholders and our strategy is calibrated to evolving operating cycles.  For  instance,  in  FY2020-21  and  FY2021-22, Tata Steel successfully deleveraged our gross debt by H 40,767  crore  and  this  was  much  higher  than  the Company's annual deleveraging target of $1 billion. During these years, the focus was on strengthening the balance sheet of the Company and positioning to aid future growth. Subsequently, in FY2022-23 and FY202324, Tata Steel has prioritised growth capital expenditure especially for Kalinganagar. This along with volatile operating environment that led to higher working capital requirements and out/flows for acquistion of NINL and dividend have meant that our gross debt increased from H 75,561 crore in FY2021-22 to around H 88,230 crore in FY2023-24. On an annual basis, gross debt has witnessed only  a  marginal  increase  between  FY2022-23  to FY2023-24 despite the volatile operating environment.\n\nThe phased commissioning of 2.2 MTPA Cold Rolling mill  complex  and  operations  of  pellet  plant  in Kalinganagar have already begun during 2024. The Company looks forward to commissioning of 5 MTPA blast furnace which is expected to aid cash/flows as well as credit metrices. Tata Steel remain focused on cost optimisation and working capital.

As stated, the Company have successfully amalgamated five listed and unlisted subsidiaries after duly completing the regulatory processes and the integration is underway. The /five companies had a cumulative turnover of around ' 19,700 crore in FY2022-23. The amalgamation is value accretive and will also drive synergies through raw material security, centralised procurement, optimisation of inventories, reduced logistics costs, and better facility utilisation. For three other companies - Bhubaneswar Power Private Limited (wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Steel), Angul Energy Limited (Tata Steel shareholding 99.99%) and The Indian Steel and Wire Products Limited (Tata Steel shareholding - 98.61% as on the date of this report), the merger process is at advanced stages with the respective jurisdictional National Company Law Tribunals and is expected to be completed by Q1FY2024-25, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\n## Credit Ratings:\n\nPartway through the year, international rating agency Moody's upgraded Tata Steel Limited's corporate family rating from 'Ba1' to 'Baa3.' The rating outlook was also changed from 'Positive' to 'Stable' citing Tata Steel's consistent  operational  performance  and  prudent financial  strategies.  Separately,  S&P  Global  Ratings reiterated its 'BBB-' corporate family rating for Tata Steel while maintaining a 'Positive' rating outlook. With this, Tata Steel becomes the only steel company in India to be rated Investment grade by both the international credit rating agencies. Domestic credit rating agencies, India Ratings and CARE Ratings have also rea/ffirmed Tata Steel's long-term credit rating at 'AA+'.\n\n## VIII.  Risks and Concerns\n\nTata Steel operates in an interconnected world with stringent regulatory and environment requirements, increased geopolitical risk and fast pace technological disruptions that could have a material impact across the value chain of the organisation. Tata Steel has implemented a Enterprise Risk Management ( 'ERM' ) process to provide a holistic view of the aggregated risk exposure as well as to facilitate more informed decision-making.\n\nIn  its  journey  towards  Risk  Intelligence,  a  robust governance structure has been developed across the organisation. The Board of Directors has constituted a Committee of the Board called the Risk Management Committee. At senior management level, an Apex Risk Committee ( 'ARC' ) has been constituted to drive the ERM process across Tata Steel Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation regarding Key Risk facing Tata Steel and their mitigation strategies is given below:\n\n## Financial Risk\n\nTata Steel aspires to double its capacity in India in a sustainable manner to capitalise on India's growth opportunity.  The  capacity  growth  is  aimed  to  aid continued strong presence across segments focused on sectors leading high returns.\n\nAdditionally, Tata Steel UK will initiate the transitioning to EAF in 2024, and TSN is also planning to undergo decarbonisation in next few years. Access to /finance will be required to enable Tata Steel's journey to a low carbon future with potential capital investments and signi/ficant transition and decommissioning costs.\n\nTata  Steel  has H 77,550  crore  of  net  debt  as  on March 31, 2024. The Company plans to deleverage and fund the growth through internal accruals and raising external capital from banks and capital markets. The cost of borrowings may be a/ffected due to changing sentiments of the global /financial market.\n\nAlso, climate change and sustainability will continue to take centre stage with rising stakeholder expectations having implications on cost and availability of capital. Strengthening ESG guidelines and disclosure standards are likely to weigh in accessing overseas /finance, which may lead to increase in funding cost.\n\nThe  financialisation  of  commodities  and  growing geopolitical con/flicts may heighten market volatility, notably impacting raw material prices and may lead to escalations in the cost of hot metal and increased working capital requirements. Volatility in /financial markets may lead to depreciation of INR against USD which will further impact cost of capital.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nTata  Steel  is  focused  on  cash  flow  generation  and debt reduction for mitigating the risks. The objective is to balance between growth and deleveraging with a focus on returns to shareholders. The Company is strategically diversifying its sources of capital including grants  from  Government  to  transition  to  greener operations. The Company also strives to access various pools  of  capital  and  actively  pursue  opportunities to  secure  longer  term  debt  with  flexible  terms. The Company has prioritised projects with higher value accreditation (ROIC: 15%) and short payback periods in it's capital allocation strategy. Additionally, Tata Steel is actively engaged in portfolio restructuring to optimise our holdings, striving for operational excellence by",

Tata Steel plans on increasing capital flows by exploring sustainable financing options such as green bonds. The Company also intends to actively communicate with investors to address any doubts regarding the credibility of green labelling and to ensure that funds are used in a certi/fied and independent manner.\n\nTata Steel has also implemented the concept of 'One Treasury',  which  efficiently  manages  the  treasury operations for the entire Tata Steel Group including its Subsidiaries. This comprehensive approach, combined with skillful management of cash/flows, currencies and commodity hedging, e/ffectively reduces the impact of price /fluctuations, and delivers better /financial stability in a dynamic market environment.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Market Risk\n\nSlowdown of growth in China resulted in higher exports which weighed on the international and Indian steel prices. While India's steel manufacturers rode on a strong double-digit demand in 2023, increase in imports in Indian market has resulted in excess supply of cheaper material and impacted the prices.\n\nTSN and Tata Steel UK, along with other European steel producers, are being squeezed between rising import pressures and a long-term decline in demand.\n\nFast paced technological changes and shifting customer preferences may necessitate adoption of newer grades of steel and/or alternate materials.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nIn India, as Tata Steel sales are predominantly focused on  the  domestic  market,  the  Company  targets  the price volatility by adjusting its sales mix geographically and across di/fferent segments. To mitigate the risk of cyclicality, long-term contracts are entered into with discerning customers (especially automotive segment) and by o/ffering solutions.\n\nTata Steel has invested in building a strong marketing franchise  with  well-regarded  brands  and  a  large network of distributors, dealers, and stocking points across  the  country.  Dedicated  marketing  and  sales teams have nurtured strong customer relationships\n\nthrough tailored solutions, enhanced reliability, and value-added products.\n\nThe Company has speci/fically focused on green steel o/fferings in Netherlands and UK.\n\nThe European Union is developing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism ( 'CBAM' ) to put a fair price on  the  carbon  emitted  during  the  production  of carbon-intensive goods. A similar fair price mechanism is expected to be rolled out for the UK as well. Tata Steel operations in the Netherlands and UK recognise the importance of CBAM in ensuring a level playing /field to manage the risk of cheap imports.\n\nThe introduction of green certi/fied/sustainable products and diversifying our product o/fferings beyond steel with new materials such as Composites, Fiber Reinforced Products, etc., helps meet the unique requirements of our discerning customers.\n\n## Regulatory Risk\n\nThe regulatory landscape in global metals and mining industry  is  becoming  stringent  due  to  geopolitical conditions, changing trade patterns, tari/ff, protectionist policies, enhanced focus on ESG. Non-adherence to such stringent regulatory ecosystem may impact business operations and reputation.\n\nBoth Tata Steel Netherlands & Tata Steel UK are subject to a wide range of regulations, with main concerns around the implementation of CBAM and changes in energy and by-product legislation in Netherlands. Additionally, there is an increased trend of protectionism at a global scale, re/flected in the imposition of tari/ffs and anti-dumping measures. TSN has a longstanding presence in the U.S. steel market where the U.S. Section 232 tari/ffs are still in place.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nRegulatory risk is emerging and evolving. Tata Steel is constantly monitoring the regulatory landscape to proactively assess the changing laws and policies that may  impact  the  Company's  operations  and  future growth trajectory. The Company has a policy of zero tolerance towards non-compliance. The Company has robust compliance management systems to ensure awareness and compliance.\n\nThe Company complies with existing laws and regulations while promoting environmental stewardship.\n\nTata Steel identi/fies key issues and opportunities for policy advocacy to promote best available practices, ensure level playing /field through safeguard measures",

In addition, TSN  sees  a  continuation  of  current  EU  safeguards measures beyond June 2024 as an absolute necessity. While CBAM will be important in ensuring a level playing /field for EU steel, however, the uncertainty surrounding the exact functioning of CBAM remains a watchpoint.\n\nDuring transition, Tata Steel UK will rely upon steel imports, from both Europe and the rest of the world, and are in discussion with the Trade Remedy Authority ( 'TRA' ) regarding revision of the relevant quotas, to enable  sourcing  of  the  required  volumes  without unsustainable tari/ff costs.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\nThe  steel  manufacturing  processes  are  vulnerable to disruptions resulting from a range of external and internal factors. Rising uncertainty in extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, supply chain disruption are some of the external factors whereas equipment failures, maintenance delay and process safety related incidents are some of the internal factors. Further, Tata Steel UK has speci/fic issues of ageing assets. Such disruptions may impact the Company's operations, safety, and customer service levels.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nThe Company endeavours to ensure plant availability, eliminate defect generation through equipment (link to /final Product Quality), delivery services at optimum cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand ensure supply of Power, Gas & Utilities for meeting end customer production requirements.\n\nThe  Company  has  adopted  advanced  maintenance practices for enhanced plant availability and reliability.\n\nThe continuously evolving Asset Management needs have  accelerated  change  from  being  reactive  to predictive and now with the fast-changing technological landscape, the Company is making a shift from the situation of preventive maintenance to maintenancefree  assets  i.e.  from  preventive  maintenance  to maintenance prevention.\n\nTata  Steel  has  set  up  an  Integrated  Maintenance Excellence Centre to leverage advanced technologies such as Arti/ficial Intelligence, prescriptive analytics and Asset Monitoring and Diagnostic Centre for enabling predictive analytics. This paradigm shift extends beyond mere Asset Management, permeating the very fabric of the approach towards a digitally enabled green economy.\n\nThe robust digital ecosystem enables real-time shutdown management for optimal co-ordination and improved asset reliability across the steel value chain. Tata Steel Jamshedpur, Kalinganagar and the IJmuiden Plant in the Netherlands, have been recognised as 'Advanced 4 th Industrial  Revolution  Lighthouse'  by  the  World Economic Forum.\n\nTata Steel UK transition plan to an EAF operation is underway. Several structural improvement initiatives at  IJmuiden  operations  are  being  taken  under  the improvement  program  of  TSN.  Corporate  Asset Management Framework at TSN is delivering improved insight into the assets in relation to reliability, failure, risk and prioritisation of resources.\n\nThe Company has been working on improving structural integrity  and  safety  of  gas  lines  through  usage  of Drone based technologies for condition monitoring, thermography to identify potential blockages in gas lines, Use of Rope Access System (with web catch) for improving the roof inspection system.\n\nThe  growing  geopolitical  situations  and  instances of supply chain disruptions have further aggravated the uncertainty in availability of spares which have dependence on single geography/vendor partner or have limited alternatives. Hence, the focus has been on indigenisation of spares to achieve self-reliance and to digitalise the process to maintain optimised inventory. The indigenisation initiative is aligned to the 'Make-in-India'  focus  and  encourages  the  vendor partners  to  supply  supreme  quality  spares  and benchmark lead times.",

To ensure our employees' safety and business operations' continuity, the Company has developed a detailed disaster plan and standard operating procedures to respond to natural disasters, epidemics/pandemics, and extreme weather events.\n\n## Safety Risk\n\nSteel industry is inherently prone to hazards a/ffecting workforce health and safety. Any deviation in process and workforce safety requirements, safety laws and regulation  may  have  adverse  impact  on  business continuity and operation. This is further aggravated with the geographical expansion and diversi/fication of our business and operations that faces various geography speci/fic stringent safety laws and regulations.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nSafety remains paramount in the organisation. Tata Steel operates with the objective of 'Committed to Zero' and a safety-first mindset. The Company has remained steadfast to our belief of safeguarding people and continuing business operations. The Company is continuously strengthening Safety Management and Governance mechanism and has built a safety focused culture across business operations. Risk reduction at the workplace and improvement in the risk perception of the workforce is the focus area. The Company follows uniform risk management framework and has developed online and on-site visualisation of risks.\n\nImproving  behavioral  safety  of  the  workforce  at workplace through experiential learning and focus on dissemination of safety standards has been the key to improve risk perception.\n\nTata  Steel  has  institutionalised  business  continuity management through development of tactical centre for responding to any major onsite emergency and has developed Centre of Excellence ( 'CoE' ) in Process Safety Management to deploy standardised process safety management across the organisation. Safety Excellence Reward and Recognition framework has been extended beyond managerial positions and vendor partners for demonstrating safety commitment and promoting a culture of safety in the organisation.\n\nFurther, Tata Steel emphasises on skill development and training of all stakeholders such as employees, vendor and business partners, trainees at regular intervals. Practical Safety Training Centre has been developed with a purpose to improve the risk perception of the workforce on various critical hazards. Here, hands-on training\n\nis imparted on di/fferent modules such as Working at Height, Material Handling, Gas Safety, Con/fined Space, Heavy vehicle simulators, First Aid & Cardiac Pulmonary Resuscitation and Virtual Reality for moving machinery.\n\nVarious campaigns such as 'Road Safety Month', 'National Safety Week' and those related to mitigation of risks associated with top hazards are undertaken. Deeper introspection on road safety practices, reaching beyond the  Company  premises,  systematically  introducing technological  interventions  on  roads  and  vehicles, and connecting with all the road pilots on one-to-one basis has improved the risk perception and behavior. Additionally,  focused  campaigns  such  as  'Process Safety Alerts,' Know Your PPE Series', etc. to identify the hazards and its risk mitigation by risk hierarchy of control philosophy has reinforced safe behavior among Company employees and contract employees. Tata Steel has also launched the revisited 'Life Saving Rules' speci/fic to nature of operation ranging from Mining, Operation and Maintenance, and Construction.\n\nWorkplace  Safety  and  Process  Safety  Management in Tata Steel have matured over the years through adoption of various robotic and technological solutions to eliminate man-machine interface. Digital platforms have  been  continuously  enhanced  to  address  and mitigate key concerns. In this regard, through its various command  centres,  Tata  Steel  leverages  the  CCTV infrastructure to identify unsafe behavior and proactively prevent incidents.\n\nAt  Tata  Steel's  UK  operation,  a  time-out  for  safety campaign, which was rolled out across all employees and core contractors in the UK, continued throughout FY2023-24. Positive feedback and impact since this started has increased the level of engagement.\n\n## Community Risk\n\nThe  Company  has  always  centered  it's  business model  and  social  engagement  around  community collaboration, aiming for tangible improvements in quality of life, particularly for marginalised groups in the vicinity of it's operations.\n\nThere are growing expectations of the communities proximate to the Company's operating locations.\n\nInability to address expectations or an erosion of trust with the communities arising out of any situation has bearing on the Company's societal impact and harm our reputation or impede business continuity. Moreover, there is a growing pressure from local communities proximate to Tata Steel's coal-based manufacturing facilities in Netherlands over emissions.",

A focused strategic approach is towards becoming the industry leader in CSR by creating long-lasting relations with communities in it's operational areas. The various focused programs  are  implemented  through  the  Tata  Steel Foundation in India. The Company implemented various programs and collaborated with multiple platforms to address the societal development challenges that has impacted over 4.4 million lives directly in FY2023-24. One of the key programs was community led-water conservation e/fforts yielding more than 100 million cubic feet of recharge capacity in key watersheds.\n\nThe Company has also developed various programs to create change models in the ecosystem. The key programs are highlighted as:\n\n- i) Signature health program is a lifecycle approach to maternal and child health and nutrition (MANSI+). It covers the entire Kolhan division of Jharkhand. Project works in close coordination with frontline health  workers  (Sahiya)  to  ensure  Institutional delivery of identi/fied high risk pregnant women that has been 87.2% in FY2023-24.\n- ii) Signature  program  on  education  rolled  out  in 37 blocks of Jharkhand and Odisha wherein the learning  model  has  been  devised  to  provide access to school for out of school children, learning support to overcome de/ficits, and governance for strengthening the school management.\n- iii) Samvaad: Over 150 tribes across 24 states of the country have come together through dialogues and other engagement aimed at preserving tribal culture and practices\n- iv) Development  Corridor  program  focus  on strengthening and functioning of the grassroots governance  at  72  panchayats  across  the 272 km stretch of road that connects Tata Steel at Jamshedpur and Kalinganagar.\n- v) Embedding  societal  perspective  in  business decisions:  Tata  Steel  leverages  its  experience and capability in societal impact to build impact ecosystems, engaging partners for regions and communities  that  need  deeper  attention.  The Company also believes in the power of empathy within an organisation, and hence the need for senior\n\n<!-- image -->\n\no/fficers and frontline managers to be sensitised towards key development challenges of the Dalit and tribal discourse. Accordingly, a social immersion program 'Unurum' was initiated and many senior, middle and entry level executives have undergone this program. This was extended to sensitise future business  leaders  from  management  school  to develop deeper understanding of socio-economic realities faced by the most vulnerable communities because of non-inclusive industrialisation.\n\n- vi) Identification  and  engagement  with  key stakeholders: The Company convenes structured forums periodically to engage in dialogue with communities, facilitating co-creation of a shared impact agenda and replicating successful processes in new locations.\n- vii) Facilitating dialogue through social and traditional media. The Company  also implements a dedicated social  media  strategy  that  entails  putting  out ground-up communities on the digital space for the right voices to amplify its impact and engage with a wider audience, facilitating dialogue and share progress transparently. Along with traditional media and AI, the Company believes in the power of communities speaking their minds and enable the right narrative to be amongst all.\n\nTata Steel UK is working closely with the Transition Board and national stakeholders to ensure economic regeneration of South Wales.\n\nTata  Steel  UK's  Community  Partnership  Program 'Future Generations', with sub-themes of education, environment, health, and well-being, works across the UK, assisting job and wealth creation by supporting small  and  medium  businesses  with  finance  and business premises.\n\nTSN is actively pursuing measures through 'Roadmap+' program to reduce emissions such as nitrogen oxide, dust  deposition,  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons, heavy metals, lead, particulate matter, etc. to address health concerns of IJmuiden communities and support local initiatives.\n\n## Supply Chain Risk\n\nSupply  Chain  Division  is  responsible  for  planning, sourcing, delivery, and logistics of more than 100 MT of materials which include raw materials, /finished goods and by-products across Tata Steel's footprint. Annually, more than 60 MT of Raw Material comprising of 200+ grades from 50+ sources located across the globe is planned, scheduled, and transported to our consumption centres.",

        "page_content": "On the delivery side, 32 MT of /finished goods consisting of multiple SKUs from various production units (inclusive of Steel Processing Centers) are delivered to a diverse group of customers.\n\nSince, Tata Steel is on a journey to expand its Indian operations,  it  would  entail  doubling  of  movement for another ~20 MT Crude Steel production in fully ramped up stage thereby further adding to the scale and complexity.\n\nThe Indian Steel Industry is expected to grow at 7% CAGR till 2030 with 25% of the capacity planned in Odisha (~75 MT), thus adding to the existing infrastructural stress particularly on railways and ports in Eastern India. Events like the power crisis occurring every year puts stress on the rake availability. In addition, railways accidents, regional strikes (e.g.: Kurmi strike in FY2023-24) add to the uncertainty particularly in raw material circuit which is heavily dependent on railways for movement.\n\nThere is now a constant risk of escalation of geo-political tensions, or any other black swan event impacting supply chain reliability and delivered cost due to increased ship/ container freights and lower container availability. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine con/flict, Red Sea crisis are some such events that may pose risk to our Shipping operations and spend. The statutory norms are also getting more stringent  thus  making  it  necessary  to  address  the Environmental, Social and Governance ( 'ESG' ) issues for scope3 operations also.\n\nThus, supply chain faces a potential multi-faceted risk of business discontinuity due to disruption in infrastructure, market, changing policies and statutory norms.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\n- \u00bb Debottlenecking Port Infrastructure: Tata Steel has long-term partnership agreements with major ports like Dhamra and Paradip Kalinga International Coal Terminal Private Ltd to de-risk import supply chain. In view of long-term growth plan, work is in progress for tie up/investment in new port infrastructure.\n- \u00bb Alternative  to  Indian  Railways:  To  improve  the reliability, Tata Steel has invested in private freight train  schemes-  13  new  rakes  were  added  under General Purpose Wagon Investment Scheme and 11 new rakes were introduced under Special Freight Train Operator in FY2023-24. In the long-term, Tata Steel is working on commissioning a 7 MTPA slurry pipeline from its iron ore mines to plant. In addition, projects  have  been  taken  up  to  improve  road infrastructure in Kalinganagar and Meramandali for raw material movement.\n\n- \u00bb Controlling Freight/logistics costs: Tata Steel has been able to maintain its shipping spend within the plan through continuous portfolio management and hedging initiatives.\n- \u00bb Sustainability  Initiatives:  Supply  Chain  has strengthened  tracking  and  measurement  of Scope 3 emissions and has proactively undertaken several initiatives for its commitment towards a greener supply chain. Tata Steel has increased deployment of CNG/LNG/EV vehicles from 69 in FY2022-23 to 191 in FY2023-24 in its short lead circuit to reduce its CO 2 footprint from road movement. This is further being increased to almost double the current number in FY2024-25. In FY2023-24, Tata Steel became the /first Indian company to import cargo on Lique/fied Natural Gas ( 'LNG' ) fueled bulk carrier. 5 such shipments for imported raw materials were performed in FY2023-24 in addition to 22 biofuel-based shipments. More such shipments are in pipeline to be executed in coming years using alternate fuels such as Biofuel, Ammonia, Methanol etc.\n\n## Information Security Risk:\n\nThe Company's operations signi/ficantly rely on IT and digital infrastructure. The organisation has made several investments on digital transformation for important and  complex  processes.  Key  attributes  of  Digital transformation journey are the connected Architecture i.e., B2B integrations, Information Technology (IT) and Operating  Technology  ( 'OT' )  integration  channels for  Analytics  and  Insights,  remote  operations which  brings  many  benefits,  such  as  increased efficiency,  better  decision-making,  and  improved operational performance.\n\nAccelerated pace of digitisation of our vast value chain also brings the need to identify and mitigate emerging risks arising from advancements of technology usage such as Al deployment, Robotics Process Automation, Machine Learning etc. AI is getting adopted wherever feasible and applicable. Generative AI is also transforming the way Company interacts with customers and is driving business growth.\n\nHowever, these integrations increase the organisation's exposure to cyber and privacy risks, non-compliance to industry laws and regulations, faulty and o/ffensive data as well as performance instability.\n\nDigital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023 has data privacy laws and regulations to govern the data privacy and protection requirements.

Pro-active software asset management is being carried out to ensure compliance.\n\nData governance has been implemented to ensure that  data  is  well  protected  with  required  level  of confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability  including retention of data as per regulations.\n\nIt is also ensured that the con/figuration and consumption of Gen AI tech is done in a secure private environment to prevent risk emanating from AI adoption.\n\nContinuous technology refresh is taken up to eliminate risk  of  technology  obsolescence  according  to business priorities.\n\nTata  Steel  regularly  assesses  cybersecurity  posture and  conducts  security  audits  to  identify  potential vulnerabilities. The same security initiatives are being extended to Tata Steel Group Companies ( 'TSGCs' ) and has implemented Security information and Event management as core fundamentals of Security Operation Centre in various TSGCs. Zero Trust Architecture is also being implemented for TSGCs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commodity Risk\n\nRaw  materials  (primarily  iron  ore  and  coal)  and Bulk  Commodities  (refractory,  De-Sulphurisation compound, ferroalloys etc.) contribute to a major part of the procurement spend of Tata Steel. In recent years, commodity markets have seen high price volatility driven by various geopolitical events, weather disruptions, mining issues etc. These events have also led to supply chain disruptions and imbalances reducing reliability and impacting inventory. Therefore, an agile response to mitigate price risk while maintaining a secure and stable supply chain is critical.\n\n## Raw Material Procurement\n\n- \u00bb Seaborne supply of coal has been largely dependent on  Australia.  While  prices  of  PCI  and  soft  coal have softened in the recent past, dependency on Australia for PCI is still high. The Company has made steady progress in trying new coals from alternate geographies thereby, mitigating the risk.\n- \u00bb Extreme weather events in key raw material exporting countries like Australia, Canada and geo-political events pose risk to the supply chain reliability beyond the price risk.\n- \u00bb Limited investment in new mines mainly in Australia, driven by decarbonisation, may impact long-term demand supply balance for metallurgical coal.\n- \u00bb High dependency on speci/fic geographies for material sourcing (Australia for metallurgical coal and South Africa for DRI grade thermal coal) poses a high risk in case of any force majeure situation.\n- \u00bb High dependency on Talcher coal/fields area to meet demand of non-coking thermal coal leading to a risk of supply chain disruption if operations are interrupted in any of their collieries.\n- \u00bb Announcement of auctions (linkage and spot) for Non-Regulated Sector ( 'NRS' ) and material movement by road mode only increases the dependency on /fleet movement, which may sometimes impact the inventory levels due to sudden restrictions imposed by local administration bodies, leading to unavailability of road transport.\n- \u00bb Considering demand and supply ratio from sectors other than captive power plant like independent power producers, fertilisers, cement etc. lead to a risk of exposure to high premiums in spot auctions.\n- \u00bb Unlike  Indian  operations,  both  TSN  and  Tata Steel UK do not have access to captive iron ore,",

Though the prices of these consumables have been on a gradual decline over the months, changes in market sentiment in China has the potential to a/ffect the volatility of these materials.\n- \u00bb Changes in statutory and sustainability norms in importing/exporting countries pose a threat to the reliability of the supply chain.\n- \u00bb Exposure to energy shortages and price increases are also a relevant risk due to multiple ongoing geopolitical disruptions.\n\n## Mitigation Strategies\n\nChanging prices of coal and iron ore generally re/flect through adjustments in steel prices, which in e/ffect acts as a natural hedge against volatility. However, there may be a lead and lag involved and hence, several steps are being taken to manage the price volatility -\n\n- \u00bb For iron ore buy from external market, the Company hedges the spread between the bought-out ore and con/firmed steel orders. The Company has also started hedging of coal buy.\n- \u00bb Price forecasting tools are being used for commodities like Coal, Zinc, Aluminum etc. to understand price movements and time the buy to optimise costs.\n- \u00bb Tools like reverse auctions are being used for e/fficient price discovery for commodities like coal, ferro alloys, refractories etc.\n- \u00bb Captive/domestic  raw  materials  provide  another avenue  to  guard  against  volatility  as  they  have relatively stable cost/price.\n- \u00bb Diversifying  coal  sourcing  from  countries  like Indonesia,  USA,  and  Canada  and  long-term tie-ups  to  secure  preferred  grades  to  ensure long-term supply security.\n\n- \u00bb Trial of new grades of coals and blend optimisation with increased usage of weaker/lower cost coals are used to mitigate price risk.\n- \u00bb Evaluating potential sources with other geographical locations in Odisha and Chhattisgarh - like IB valley coal/field and Talabira mines in Odisha and Kusmunda and Gevra which are the collieries of South-Eastern Coal/fields Limited in Chhattisgarh to minimise the risk on supply security of non-coking thermal coal.\n- \u00bb Contracting with local suppliers by rail mode to increase the rail co-e/fficient for consistent and uniform domestic coal supplies.\n- \u00bb Maximising Fuel Supply agreement to mitigate the risk of prevailing market volatility due to gap in demand and supply e/ffecting premiums of spot auction events.\n- \u00bb For  bulk  commodities,  Indigenisation  has  been identified  as  one  of  the  major  levers  to  de-risk the  supply  chain  for  both  direct  and  indirect commodities which are dependent on import sources (like  De-Sulphurisation  compounds,  refractories, cored wires etc.) to ensure safeguarding against geo-political  escalations  and  single  country dependence. Where indigenisation is not possible, alternate  country  sourcing  or  development  of substitute products is also under implementation.\n- \u00bb Tata  Steel  is  collaborating  with  Government  of Odisha and has ear marked ~100 acre of land close to Kalinganagar, where vendors can set up local manufacturing units/refurbishment plants/Assembly units/warehouses which will enable localisation and development of local supplier eco-system and a leaner supply chain for Tata Steel.\n- \u00bb Tata Steel ensures that all suppliers mandatorily sign the Tata Business Associate Code of Conduct during the vendor onboarding process. High risk vendors undergo an assessment for adherence to Anti-Bribery  &  Anti-Corruption  ( 'ABAC' ) and Anti-money Laundering ( 'AML' ) policies. This is also incorporated in the contract clauses of the purchase order which enables adherence to the ABAC and AML policies.\n- \u00bb The Company has adopted sustainable procurement policy  wherein  the  Company  engages  with  it's suppliers/service providers to take initiatives in the areas of reduce, recycle, and reuse.\n- \u00bb Risk assessment for key vendors is also undertaken to assess the capability of vendors in meeting the supply requirement.",

Internal Control Systems and it's Adequacy\n\nThe Company has an Internal Financial Controls ( 'IFC' ) framework, commensurate with the size, scale, and complexity of the Company's operations. The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for ensuring that IFC have been laid down by the Company and that such controls are adequate and operating e/ffectively. The internal control framework has been designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to recording and providing reliable /financial and operational information, complying with applicable laws, safeguarding assets from unauthorised use, executing transactions with proper authorisation, and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. The Company's internal financial control framework is commensurate with the size and operations of the business and is in line with requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company has laid down Standard Operating Procedures and policies to guide the operations of each of its functions. Business heads are responsible to ensure compliance with these policies and procedures. Robust and continuous internal monitoring mechanisms ensure timely identi/fication of risks and issues. To make the controls more robust and comprehensive, IFC standardisation and rationalisation project was undertaken three years ago which had ensured comprehensive coverage cutting across all functions of the Company. To reduce manual time and e/fforts involved in control testing, improve con/fidence in testing results, increase the frequency of testing and resort to full checking of the data as compared to sample testing, automation of controls was also undertaken\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin FY2021-22 whereby around thirty percent of the controls were automated which have been tested in automated environment in the current /financial year also.

The management, statutory auditors and internal auditors have also carried out adequate due diligence of the control environment of the Company through rigorous testing.\n\nThe  Company  has  deployed  SAP  Governance,  Risk and Compliance Module and other IT platforms to keep the IFC framework robust and our Information Management Policy governs these IT platforms. IFC has been documented and embedded in the business processes and such controls have been assessed during the year under review and no material weaknesses were observed.\n\n## X. Statutory Compliance\n\nThe  Company  has  in  place  adequate  systems  and processes to ensure that it is in compliance with all the applicable laws. The Company Secretary & Chief Legal Officer (Corporate & Compliance) is responsible for implementing the systems and processes for monitoring compliance with the applicable laws and for ensuring that the systems and processes are operating e/ffectively. The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, places before the Board, at each meeting, a certi/ficate of compliance with the applicable laws.

E/ffective corporate governance practices constitute the  strong  foundation  on  which  successful  commercial enterprises are built to last. Strong leadership and e/ffective corporate governance practices have been the Company's hallmark inherited from its culture and ethos. At Tata Steel, it is imperative that our Company's a/ffairs are managed in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nWe ensure that we evolve and follow not just the stated corporate governance guidelines, but also globally best practices.  We  consider  it  our  inherent  responsibility  to protect the rights of our shareholders and disclose timely, adequate and accurate information regarding our /financials and performance, as well as the leadership and governance of the Company.\n\nIn accordance with our Vision, Tata Steel Group ( 'TSG' ) aspires to be the global steel industry benchmark for 'value creation' and 'corporate citizenship'. TSG expects to realise its Vision by taking such actions as may be necessary, to achieve its goals of value creation, safety, environment and people.\n\nThe  Company  is  in  compliance  with  the  requirements stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of Regulation 46(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ( 'SEBI Listing Regulations' ), as applicable, with regard to corporate governance.\n\nTo further strengthen the Company's corporate governance philosophy, the Company has also adopted the Tata Business Excellence Model.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nThe Company has a strong legacy of fair, transparent and ethical governance practices.\n\nThe Company has adopted the Tata Code of Conduct ( 'TCoC/ Code' ) for Executive Directors ( 'EDs' ), Senior Management Personnel and other Executives and Employees, which is available on the website of the Company at https://www. tatasteel.com/media/1864/tcoc.pdf  The  Company  has received  confirmations  from  the  EDs  as  well  as  Senior\n\nManagement Personnel regarding compliance of the Code during the year under review. The Company has also adopted the Code of Conduct for Non-Executive Directors ( 'NEDs' ) of the Company which includes the Code of Conduct of Independent Directors ( 'IDs' ) which suitably incorporates the duties of Independent Directors as laid down in the Companies Act, 2013 ( 'Act' ). The same is available on the website  of  the  Company  at  https://www.tatasteel.com/ media/3930/tcoc-non-executive-directors.pdf The Company has received con/firmation from the NEDs and IDs regarding compliance of the Code, for the year under review.\n\n## Tata Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015, ( 'SEBI Insider Trading Regulations' ), as amended from time to time, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Tata Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices ( 'Insider Trading Code' ).\n\nMr. Parvatheesam Kanchinadham, Company Secretary & Chief Legal O/fficer (Corporate & Compliance) is the 'Compliance O/fficer' in terms of this Insider Trading Code.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors ( 'Board' ) is at the core of our corporate governance practice and oversees and ensures that the Management serves and protects the long-term interest of all our stakeholders. We believe that an active, well-informed and independent Board is necessary to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\n## Size and Composition of the Board\n\nOur policy is to have a mix of EDs, NEDs, and IDs to maintain the Board's independence and separate its functions of governance and management. As on March 31, 2024, the Board comprised of ten members, two of whom are EDs, three are NEDs and /five are IDs including two Women Independent Directors.

The familiarisation programme for our Directors is customised to suit their individual interests and area of expertise. The Directors are usually encouraged to visit the plant and raw material locations of the Company and interact with members of Senior Management as part of the induction programme. The  Senior  Management  make  presentations  giving  an overview of the Company's strategy, operations, products, markets, group structure and subsidiaries, Board constitution and guidelines, matters reserved for the Board and the major risks and risk management strategy. This enables the Directors to get a deep understanding of the Company, its people, values and culture and facilitates their active participation in overseeing the performance of the Management.\n\nAs stated in the Board's Report, the details of orientation given to our existing Independent Directors are available on our website at https://www.tatasteel.com/media/21203/ familiarization-programme-ids-2024.pdf\n\n## Board Evaluation\n\nThe NRC has formulated a Policy for the Board, its Committees and Directors and the same has been approved and adopted by the Board. The details of Board Evaluation forms part of the Board's Report.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for Board and Senior Management\n\nThe Board has approved the Remuneration Policy for Directors, Key Managerial Personnel ( 'KMP' ) and all other employees of the Company. The same is available on our website at https:// www.tatasteel.com/media/6817/remuneration-policy-ofdirectors-etc.pdf Details of remuneration for Directors in FY2023-24 are provided in Table C below.",

These commodities have complex global supply chains and multiple factors such as continued geopolitical tensions, weather disruption, mining issues,  upcoming  elections,  exchange  rate  movements, supply-demand  imbalance,  policy  interventions  by governments in key sourcing/consuming countries (especially China), which serve as critical determinants of commodity market behaviour. These factors coupled with changes in market dynamics cause volatility in prices of raw materials that has a bearing on the input costs of steel making. With decarbonisation concerns, there is limited new investment in metallurgical coal. Therefore, an agile response to mitigate price risk while maintaining a secure and stable supply chain is critical.\n\nThe changes in prices of commodities are balanced through adjustments in steel prices over a period which in e/ffect act as a natural hedge to the business. However, there may be a lead and lag involved and hence several steps are being taken to manage the price volatility such as /fixed price deals and multiple pricing mechanism, diversi/fied basket of suppliers, reduction through Value-in-use.\n\nThe Company meets 100% of its iron ore requirements in India, through its captive iron ore mines and about 22% of its coking coal requirements from its coal mines. These captive  mines  provide  a  structural  hedge  to  the  price risk of these commodities. The Company has a dedicated commodity sourcing team which engages with key raw material producers across the globe and the commodity market at large to optimise sourcing. The team proactively undertakes the assessment of risks of single geography and proprietary sourcing. Several mitigations have been put in place for diversi/fied sourcing with focus on indigenisation as one of the major levers to de-risk the supply chain for both direct and indirect commodities which are dependent on imports. Coal sourcing is being diversi/fied - such as sourcing being established from countries like Indonesia, USA, and Canada in addition to Australia and long-term tie-ups with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncoal suppliers in Australia will keep prices competitive with an improved reliability. This coupled with the trial of new grades of coals/use of weak coals with better Value-in-use will ensure the availability of coal to meet the plant requirements and reduce the cost of sourcing.\n\nTata Steel, being an importer of coking coal, is exposed to risk of volatility in coal prices. In view of continuous market /fluctuations, predictive analytics tools have been leveraged to have an advance information on the price movement and optimise the timing of our spot buys through reverse auctions. This has been integrated with the Company's customised e-auction tool to mainly execute metallurgical coal spot trades and better adjust Laycan timing of term cargoes. Price forecasting tools are also being used for commodities such as Zinc, Aluminium, etc. to understand price movements and to time the buy for optimising costs. Similarly, reverse auctions are being used for e/fficient price discovery for commodities such as ferroalloys, refractories, etc. Further, the Company is actively exploring new sources of Ferrous and Coal products with a lower landed cost net of Value-in-use.\n\nRisk assessment for key vendors is also undertaken to assess the capability of vendors in meeting the supply requirement. Tata Steel ensures that all suppliers mandatorily sign the Tata Business Associate Code of Conduct during the vendor onboarding process. High risk vendors undergo an assessment for adherence to Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption ( 'ABAC' ) and Anti-Money Laundering ( 'AML' ) policies. Sustainable procurement policy has been deployed to engage with suppliers/service providers to take initiatives in the areas of 'reduce, recycle, and reuse' and foster responsible supply chain policy.\n\nGlobal  steel  demand  was  subdued  in  FY2023-24  as geo-political factors ensured sustained inflation, sliding currencies and supply disruptions and detours that also increased freights. Russia's war with Ukraine showed no signs of de-escalation however fresh trouble broke out in the form of Israel-Hamas war and the more recent Red Sea crisis. Chinese steel exporters aggressively sold across the world at highly competitive prices, impelled by dull home demand and the yuan's depreciation. Steel prices fell more dynamically relative to raw materials in FY2023-24. Coking coal prices have been volatile since Q2FY2023-24, thermal coal prices have remained more range bound. However, Domestic steel consumption is expected to moderate (7-8% in FY2024-25). Since additional capacities are coming up in India, supply-side pressures will be felt, and a supply-demand imbalance may emerge in the current /fiscal. Domestic steel prices might continue to be under pressure if the external global macroeconomic environment remains subdued. The Company continuously revisits the risks through analysis of multiple risk scenarios to arrive at focused mitigation plans.",

The  innovation has a potential to produce an additional 50,000 tonnes of coke annually, marking  a signi/ficant step towards sustainable steel production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Selective /flotation of iron ore                                                           | Lowering alumina in Indian iron is a technological challenge. Tata Steel R&D has developed  a reagent which is extremely selective to aluminosilicates and this reagent through reverse  iron ore /flotation can lower alumina level from 5% in the feed to 3% in the product with  concentrate yield of 75%. The pilot plant trial using the said reagent is in progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Oily bubble /flotation to improve /fine clean yield  at coal washery                       | In the endeavour of improving the /fine clean coal yield in the coal washery, Tata Steel has  developed a new technology wherein the air bubble in the /flotation circuit gets coated  with thin layer of oil. This localised presence of oil at the bubble interface lowers the energy  barrier required for three-phase attachment of the bubble with the particle and increases the  hydrophobicity of the bubble. With successful trials in the lab and pilot scale, the process is  now getting tested at plant scale.                                                                                                                    |\n| Thermal Hawk: A One Stop Solution for Real-Time  Visualisation inside the Blast Furnace    | Thermal Hawk is a thermal sensor-based system that provides real-time visualisation of the  processes occurring inside the blast furnace top and enables continuous measurement  of process-in/fluencing parameters.

An AI based expert system has been  developed which considers chemistry, thickness, properties, acceptance norms and rollability  matrix to regrade the slabs automatically. The model provides /flexibility to choose desired  quality and re-grade accordingly.

The initial results w.r.t coal ash and yield are quite encouraging and being closely monitored.\n\n## Agglomeration\n\n- \u00b7 Lime  sludge  as  an  alternative  to  limestone in sintering\n\nLime sludge is a waste product generated in a PVC resins manufacturing facilities, has a CaO content greater than 65% with lower LOI of 27%. Replacing the limestone with the lime sludge in sintering process, gives us an opportunity to utilise other industries revert in reducing the CO 2 emissions and helping us to move one step closer to our goalnet zero emissions. Lab scale trials with partially replacing limestone with lime sludge has been completed  and  achieved  encouraging  results, further plant scale trial is planned at sinter plant.\n\n- \u00b7 Production of High MgO Pellet in Grate Kiln at TSG\n\nThe pellet plant at TSJ and TSK produces high MgO dual fluxed pellets (limestone and pyroxenite) in travelling grate, whereas similar grade pellets are  produced  for  the  first  time  in  grate  kiln technology at TSG. The high MgO pellets have superior metallurgical properties required for blast furnace performance.\n\nThere was an apprehension of increase in accretion inside the kiln with higher /flux addition. Accretion was well managed during high /flux operation by adjusting the thermal pro/file in kiln and by avoiding direct exposure of refractory to high temperature. The  high  MgO  pellets  delivered  metallurgical properties like TSJ pellets. This helped to increase pellet burden in BFs at TSJ and TSM.",

Use of this CDQ dust helps to increase inert% in the blend and thereby, coke mean size. Therefore, a trial was conducted at Bat 8-11 by addition of 2% CDQ dust in the blend. There was improvement in coke mean size and coke yield. This also led to reduction in coal blend cost.\n\n## Blast Furnace\n\n- \u00b7 Use Of Low viscosity fuel Oil at C And E BF to reduce fuel rate\n\nCoal Tar which was being used as an auxiliary fuel injectant was replaced with low viscosity fuel oil. Fuel oil has higher calori/fic value, lower viscosity & higher hydrogen % than coal tar. Lower viscosity of fuel oil enabled to achieve higher auxiliary injection rates with same hardware. With higher injection rates blast humidity was eliminated which further helped in reducing fuel rate of the furnace. Post implementation in September 2023, fuel rate of smaller furnaces dropped by about 20 kg/tHM.\n\n- \u00b7 Biochar injection to substitute part of fossil fuel PCI and lower down emission\n\nIn Blast furnace, coke is charged from top and pulverised coal is charged from bottom. However, both  the  fuels  are  non-renewable  fossil  fuels contributing to CO 2 emissions. To address this issue and to achieve the target of lowering down CO 2 emissions, Tata Steel has been exploring multiple trials and among these trials, most promising & cost-effective solution has been identified as 'Biochar injection in blast furnaces' - to substitute part of pulverised coal. So far, January 2023 to March 2024, around 11.2 Kt charcoal has been injected which has reduced equivalent amount of pulverised coal and reduced CO 2 emission by around 32,800 tonnes and its continuing at TSJ blast furnaces.\n\n## Process visibility\n\n- \u00b7 Improved sensorisation at Blast Furnace\n\nTo monitor mean size of material fed into the Blast furnace on real-time basis for optimal, a camera has been installed over MB1 belt at I BF. Algorithm has been developed using image processing to extract  detailed  features  to  estimate  detailed size distribution of the metallics and coke. The size  estimated  using  the  algorithm  developed\n\nduring trial is 95% consistent with lab results. The permanent deployment of the system is in progress at I BF with help of Operations team.\n\n## Kalinganagar:\n\n## Sinter Plant\n\n- \u00bb Best ever RDI (<30) compliance of 99.05% (Previous best was 97.98% in FY2022-23).\n\n## Hot Strip Mill\n\n- \u00bb Successfully rolled Electrical Steel up to 3.3% Silicon (1 st time in India).\n- \u00bb 20% increase in supplies of high strength automotive grades to market.\n- \u00bb Successfully rolled 300kT+ of slabs from TSM, TSJ and JSPL through synergy initiatives.\n- \u00bb Consistent supply of API grades with superior quality (for nation building-City Gas Project, CGP) with respect to surface, shape & mechanical properties.

Signi/ficant  management  judgement  is required to assess such matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material out/flow of economic resources and whether a provision should be recognised or a disclosure should  be  made.  The  management  judgement  is  also supported with legal advice in certain cases, as considered appropriate. As the ultimate outcome of the matters are uncertain and the positions taken by the management are based on the application of their best judgement, related legal  advice  including  those  relating  to  interpretation  of laws/regulations, it is considered as a key audit matter.\n\n## Other Information\n\n- 5. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises Management Discussion and Analysis and Board's report (but does not include the standalone /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and additional information excluding those referred above that would be included in the Integrated Report (titled as 'Tata Steel Integrated Report & Annual Accounts 2023-24'), which is expected to be made available to us after the date of our report.

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone /financial statements that give a true and fair view of the /financial position, /financial performance, changes in equity and cash /flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards speci/fied under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls, that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 7. In  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's /financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\n- 8. Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the standalone /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic\n\n- decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone /financial statements.\n- 9. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgement  and  maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and content  of  the  standalone  financial  statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",

We also provide those charged with governance with a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n- 12.

These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\n- 3. Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls\n\n- and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n- 4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls system with reference to standalone /financial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material misstatement of the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n- 5. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls system with reference to standalone /financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to /financial statements\n\n- 6. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions",

Company Information\n\nTata Steel Limited ('the Company') is a public limited Company  incorporated  in  India  with  its  registered office in Bombay House 24, Homi Modi Street Fort, Mumbai-400 001, Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on the BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE).\n\nThe Company has presence across the entire value chain of steel manufacturing from mining and processing iron ore and coal to producing and distributing finished products. The Company o/ffers a broad range of steel products including a portfolio of high value added downstream products such as hot rolled, cold rolled, coated steel, rebars, wire rods, tubes and wires.\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the Company is Indian Rupee ('\u20b9') which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\n\nAs on March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited owns 31.76% of the Ordinary Shares of the Company and has the ability to in/fluence the Company's operations.\n\nThe /financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 29, 2024.\n\n## 2. Material accounting policies\n\nThe material accounting policies applied by the Company in the preparation of its /financial statements are listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied consistently to all the periods presented in these /financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThe  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in accordance  with  the  Indian  Accounting  Standards (referred to as 'Ind AS') prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe /financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair value by Ind AS.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nAll assets and liabilities have been classi/fied as current and non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle which is based on the nature of businesses and the time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation of cash and cash equivalents. The Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\n\n## (c) Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements,  the Company  makes  judgements  in  the  application  of accounting policies; and estimates and assumptions which a/ffects carrying values of assets and liabilities that  are  not  readily  apparent  from  other  sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods a/ffected.\n\nThe Company uses the following critical accounting estimates  and  judgements  in  preparation  of  its /financial statements.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Company estimates the recoverable value of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on future cash /flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and the impact of climate change which may result in a change of current production process given the decarbonisation plan of the Group. The estimated cash /flows are developed using internal forecasts. The cash /flows are discounted using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Further details of the Company's impairment review and key assumptions are set out in note 3, page F44, note 4, page F49, note 5, page F52 and note 6, page F54.",

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## Impairment of /financial assets (other than subsequent measurement at fair value)\n\nMeasurement of impairment of /financial assets require use of estimates and judgements, which have been explained in the note on /financial instruments under impairment of /financial assets. (refer note 2(m), page F38).\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets\n\nThe Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods. The policy has been detailed in note 2(e), page F34, note 2(j), page F36 and note 2(k), page F36.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as result of a past event and it is probable that the outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. They include provisions on decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions as well which may change where changes in estimated reserves a/ffect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities. All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimates.\n\nThe Company uses signi/ficant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be con/firmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past event where it is either not probable that an out/flow of resources will be utilised to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the /financial statements. Further details are set out in note 19, page F89 and note 34(A), page F105.\n\n## Fair value measurements of /financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including Discounted Cash Flow Model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements  include  considerations  of  inputs  such as liquidity risks, credit risks and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Further details are set out in note 37, page F113.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company evaluates if an arrangement quali/fies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 'Leases'. Identi/fication of a lease requires signi/ficant judgement in assessing the lease term including anticipated renewals and the applicable discount rate.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Retirement bene/fit obligations\n\nThe  Company's  retirement  benefit  obligations  are subject to a number of assumptions including discount rates,  inflation,  salary  growth  and  mortality  rate. Significant  assumptions  are  required  when  setting these criteria and a change in these assumptions would have a signi/ficant impact on the amount recorded in the Company's balance sheet and the statement of pro/fit and loss. The Company sets these assumptions based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice. The assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted following actuarial and experience changes. Further details on the Company's retirement bene/fit obligations, including key assumptions are set out in note 33, page F98.\n\n## (d) Business combination under common control\n\nBusiness combinations involving entities or businesses under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method. Under pooling of interest method, the assets and liabilities of the combining entities or businesses are reflected at their carrying amounts  after  making  adjustments  necessary  to harmonise  the  accounting  policies.

The identity of the reserves is preserved in the same form in which they appeared in the /financial statements of the transferor and the di/fference, if any, between the amount recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve.\n\n## (e) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes all direct costs and expenditures incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Trial run expenses are capitalised. Borrowing costs incurred during the period of construction is capitalised as part of cost of qualifying asset.\n\nDepreciation is provided so as to write o/ff, on a straight line basis, the cost / deemed cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual value. These charges are commenced from the dates the assets are available for their intended use and are spread over their estimated useful economic lives. The estimated useful lives of assets, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed regularly and revised when necessary.\n\nDepreciation on assets under construction commences only when the assets are ready for their intended use.\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the main categories of property, plant and equipment are:\n\n| Freehold and long leasehold buildings                                                    | Estimated  useful life (years) upto 60 years*   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Roads                                                                                    | 5 to 10 years                                   |\n| Plant and machinery                                                                      | upto 40 years*                                  |\n| Furniture, /fixture and o/ffice equipments                                               | 3 to 10 years                                   |\n| Vehicles and aircraft                                                                    | 5 to 20 years                                   |\n| Railway sidings                                                                          | upto 35 years*                                  |\n| Assets covered under the Electricity Act  (life as prescribed under the Electricity Act) | 3 to 38 years                                   |\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  evaluated  for recoverability wherever there is any indication that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such\n\nindication exists, the recoverable amount is higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use is determined on an individual asset basis under the asset that does not generate cash /flow that are largely independent from the assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a tax free discount rate that re/flects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable value of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is reduced to its recoverable value. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nMining assets are amortised over the useful life of the mine or lease period whichever is lower. For certain mining assets, where unit of production is considered to be more re/flective of the pattern of use, amortisation is done based on unit of production method.\n\nMajor furnace relining expenses are depreciated over a period of 10 years (average expected life).\n\nFreehold land is not depreciated.\n\n- * For these class of assets, based on internal assessment and independent technical evaluation carried out by chartered engineers, the Company and some of its subsidiaries believe that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which such Company expects to use these assets. Hence the useful lives for these assets are di/fferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (f) Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\nExpenditures associated with search for speci/fic mineral resources are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets. The following expenditure comprises cost of exploration and evaluation assets:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining of the rights to explore and evaluate mineral reserves and resources including costs directly related to this acquisition\n- \u00b7 researching and analysing existing exploration data",

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n- \u00b7 conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling\n- \u00b7 examining and testing extraction and treatment methods\n- \u00b7 compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies\n- \u00b7 activities  in  relation  to  evaluating  the  technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.\n\nAdministration and other overhead costs are charged to the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only if directly related to an exploration and evaluation project.\n\nIf a project does not prove viable, all irrecoverable exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with the project net of any related impairment allowances is written o/ff to the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Company measures its exploration and evaluation assets at cost and classifies as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets according to the nature of the assets acquired and applies the classification consistently.  To  the  extent  that  a  tangible  asset  is consumed in developing an intangible asset, the amount re/flecting that consumption is capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible asset.\n\nAs the capitalised exploration asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All exploration and evaluation assets are monitored for indications of impairment. An  exploration  and  evaluation  asset  is  no  longer classified as such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable and the development of the deposit is sanctioned by the management. The carrying value of such exploration and evaluation asset is reclassi/fied to mining assets.\n\n## (g) Development expenditure for mineral reserves\n\nDevelopment is the establishment of access to mineral reserves  and  other  preparations  for  commercial production.  Development  activities  often  continue during production and include:\n\n- \u00b7 sinking shafts and underground drifts (often called mine development)\n- \u00b7 making permanent excavations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 developing passageways and rooms or galleries\n- \u00b7 building roads and tunnels and\n- \u00b7 advance removal of overburden and waste rock.\n\nDevelopment  (or  construction)  also  includes  the installation of infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities and housing), machinery, equipment and facilities.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and presented as part of mining assets. No depreciation is charged on the development expenditure before the start of commercial production.\n\n## (h) Provision for restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe Company has liabilities related to restoration of soil and other related works, which are due upon the closure of certain of its mining sites.\n\nSuch liabilities are estimated case-by-case based on available information, considering applicable local legal requirements. The estimation is made using existing technology, at current prices, and discounted using an appropriate discount rate where the e/ffect of time value  of  money  is  material.  Future  restoration  and environmental costs, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and the corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration and environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant and equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are depreciated over the life of the related asset. The e/ffect of time value of money on the restoration and environmental costs liability is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (i) Stripping Costs\n\nThe Company separates two di/fferent types of stripping costs that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n\n- \u00b7 developmental stripping costs and\n- \u00b7 production stripping costs\n\nDevelopmental stripping costs which are incurred in order to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves that will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part of mining assets.\n\nCapitalisation of developmental stripping costs ends when the commercial production of the mineral reserves begins.

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nregarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning and production. In this case, stripping costs are accounted for separately, by reference to the ore extracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning and production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\nThe determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's speci/fic circumstances. The following factors normally point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- \u00b7 mining  of  the  second  and  subsequent  pits  is conducted consecutively with that of the /first pit, rather than concurrently\n- \u00b7 separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset\n- \u00b7 the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n- \u00b7 the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\nThe relative importance of each factor is considered by the management to determine whether, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.\n\nProduction stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore in the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an additional component of an ore body or deeper levels of material. Production stripping costs are accounted for as inventories to the extent the bene/fit from production stripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\nThe Company recognises a stripping activity asset in the production phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will /flow to the Company\n\n- \u00b7 the Company can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and\n- \u00b7 the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nSuch costs are presented within mining assets. After initial recognition, stripping activity assets are carried at cost/deemed cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment. The expected useful life of the identi/fied component of the ore body is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping asset.\n\n## (j) Intangible assets\n\nSoftware costs and other intangible assets are included in the balance sheet as intangible assets when it is probable that associated future economic bene/fits would /flow to the Company.

The Company recognises rightof-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception comprises of the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nLease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to re/flect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to re/flect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to re/flect any reassessment or lease\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmodi/fications. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the remeasurement in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nVariable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities are expensed to the statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which the events or conditions which trigger those payments occur.\n\nPayment made towards leases for which non-cancellable term is 12 months or lesser (short-term leases) and low value leases are recognised in the statement of Pro/fit and Loss as rental expenses over the tenor of such leases.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\n- (i) Operating lease Rental income from operating leases is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in  which  economic  benefits  from  the  leased asset is diminished. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (ii) Finance lease When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of minimum lease  payments  is  recognised  as  a  receivable. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the  present  value  of  receivable  is  recognised as  unearned  finance  income.  Lease  income  is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which re/flects a constant periodic rate of return. Such rate is the interest rate which is implicit in the lease contract.\n\n## (l) Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are carried at cost/deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Financial  assets  and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /financial assets and /financial liabilities (other than /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of /financial asset or /financial liability. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss are immediately recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss. Trade receivables that do not contain a signi/ficant /financing component are measured at transaction price.\n\n## (I) Financial assets\n\n## Cash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances consist of:\n\n- (i) Cash and cash equivalents which includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term deposits which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant  risk  of  change  in  value  and  have original maturities of less than three months. These balances with banks are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n- (ii) Other balances with bank which also include balances and deposits with banks that are restricted for withdrawal and usage.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these /financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if such /financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and to sell such /financial assets and the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThe  Company  in  respect  of  certain  equity investments (other than in associates and joint ventures)  which  are  not  held  for  trading  has made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value of such equity instruments. Such an election is made by the Company on an instrument by instrument basis at the time of initial recognition of such equity investments. These investments are  held  for  medium  or  long-term  strategic purpose. The Company has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as fair value through other comprehensive income as the management believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than re/flecting changes in fair value immediately in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are carried at fair value through pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and e/ffective interest rate applicable and is recognised in the statement of pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised in the statement of pro/fit or loss when the right to receive payment has been established.\n\n## Impairment of /financial assets\n\nLoss  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses  is recognised  for  financial  assets  measured  at",

Loss allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses is recognised if the credit risk of the financial asset has significantly increased since initial recognition.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial assets\n\nThe Company de-recognises a /financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\n\nIf  the  Company  neither  transfers  nor  retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.\n\nIf the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the /financial asset and also recognises a borrowing for the proceeds received.\n\n## (II) Financial liabilities and equity instruments Classi/fication as debt or equity\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classi/fied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e/ffective interest rate method where the time value of money is signi/ficant.\n\nInterest bearing bank loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Any di/fference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial liabilities\n\nThe Company de-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.\n\n## Derivative /financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company uses certain derivative financial instruments to reduce business risks which arise from its exposure to foreign exchange, base metal prices and interest rate fluctuations. The instruments are confined principally to forward foreign exchange contracts, forward rate agreements, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and collars. The instruments are employed as hedges of transactions included in the /financial statements or for highly probable forecast transactions//firm contractual commitments. These derivatives  contracts  do  not  generally  extend beyond six months, except for certain currency swaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Company adopts hedge accounting for forward foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity contracts,  wherever  possible.

This documentation includes, inter alia, items such as identi/fication of the hedged item and transaction and nature of the risk being hedged. At inception each hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving an o/ffset of changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The e/ffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ine/ffective portion of designated hedges is recognised immediately in the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n\n- \u00b7 for fair value hedges of recognised assets and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss and compensate for the e/ffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives.\n- \u00b7 for cash /flow hedges, the e/ffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ine/ffective portion is recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss. If the cash /flow hedge of a /firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non/financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains  or  losses  on  the  derivative  that  had previously  been  recognised  in  equity  are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item a/ffects the statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  are recognised in the statement of pro/fit and loss as and when they arise.\n\nHedge  accounting  is  discontinued  when  the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or  exercised,  or  no  longer  qualifies  for  hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\nFurther  details  on  the  Company's  financial instruments are set out in note 37, page F113.\n\n## (n) Employee bene/fits\n\n## De/fined contribution plans\n\nContributions under defined contribution plans are recognised as expense for the period in which the employee has rendered service. Payments made to state managed retirement bene/fit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Company's obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a de/fined contribution retirement bene/fit scheme.\n\n## De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nFor defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuation being carried out at each year-end balance sheet date. Remeasurement gains and losses of the net de/fined bene/fit liability/(asset) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) are recognised as an expense within employee costs.\n\nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related restructuring costs or termination bene/fits are recognised, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the balance  sheet  represents  the  present  value  of  the de/fined bene/fit obligations as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.",

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which they arise.\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised based on actuarial valuation.\n\n## (o) Inventories\n\nInventories comprise the followings:\n\n- a) Raw materials,\n- b) Work-in-progress,\n- c) Finished and semi-/finished goods\n- d) Stock-in-trade, and\n- e) Stores and spares.\n\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is ascertained on a weighted average basis. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the cost of conversion from their existing state to a /finished condition and for the cost of marketing, selling and distribution.\n\nProvisions are made to cover slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience of utilisation on a product category basis, which involves individual businesses  considering  their  product  lines  and market conditions.\n\n## (p) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised in the balance sheet when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nas a result of a past event, which is expected to result in an out/flow of resources embodying economic bene/fits which can be reliably estimated. They also include provisions on decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions as well. Each provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured on a discounted basis.\n\nConstructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\n- (i) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a su/fficiently speci/fic current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities and\n- (ii) as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on  the  part  of  those  other  parties  that  it  will discharge such responsibilities.\n\n## (q) Onerous contracts\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected bene/fits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of  meeting  its  obligations  under  the  contract.  The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any  impairment  loss  on  the  assets  associated  with that contract.\n\n## (r) Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at its fair value, where there is a reasonable assurance that such grants will be received and compliance with the conditions attached therewith have been met.\n\nGovernment grants related to expenditure on property, plant and equipment are credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss over the useful lives of qualifying assets or other systematic basis representative of the pattern of ful/filment of obligations associated with the grant received.

Taxable pro/fit di/ffers from net pro/fit as reported in the statement of pro/fit and loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  is  the  tax  expected  to  be  payable  or recoverable on di/fferences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the /financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable pro/fit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su/fficient taxable pro/fits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets re/flects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and there are legally enforceable rights to set o/ff current tax assets and current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the statement of pro/fit and loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## (t) Revenue\n\nThe Company manufactures and sells a range of steel and other products.\n\n## Sale of products\n\nRevenue from sale of products is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped or delivered to the speci/fic location as the case may be, the risks of loss has been transferred, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satis/fied. Sale of products include related ancillary services, if any.\n\nGoods are often sold with volume and price discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price speci/fied in the contract, net of the estimated volume and price discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the most likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal will not occur. A liability is recognised for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of /financing is deemed present as the sales are generally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which is consistent with market practice. Any obligation to provide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\nThe Company does not adjust the transaction prices for any time value of money in case of contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer does not exceed one year.",

Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Company to sublet the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Company. Extension and termination options are included in some property and equipment leases. These are used to maximise operational /flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Company's operations. Majority of the extension and termination options held are exercisable based on mutual agreement of the Company and the lessors.\n\nWith the exception of short-term leases and leases of low-value underlying assets, each lease is re/flected on the balance sheet as a right of- use asset and a lease liability. Payments made for short term leases and leases of low value are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nVariable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate (such as lease payments based on a percentage of sales) are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and asset.\n\nFor leases recognised under long-term arrangements involving use of a dedicated asset, non-lease components are excluded based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. A change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on the measurement of lease liabilities and the related right-of-use assets.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company has recognised the following in the statement of pro/fit and loss:\n\n- a) expense in respect of short-term leases and leases of low-value assets \u20b9 28.66 crore (2022-23: \u20b925.85 crore) and \u20b9 1.41 crore (2022-23: \u20b91.42 crore) respectively.",

The cash/flow projections include the impact of decarbonisation given that both the UK and Tata Steel Netherlands (TSN) businesses within TSE have stated their plans to move away from the current production process and to transition to electric arc based production. Decarbonisation as a whole is likely to provide signi/ficant opportunities to TSE as it is likely to increase the demand for steel as it is crucial as an infrastructure enabler for all technological transition within the wider economy (e.g. wind power, hydrogen, electric vehicles, nuclear plants etc.) and compares favourably to other materials when considering the life cycle emissions of the",

The technology transition and investments are dependent on national and international policies and would also be driven by the government decisions in the country of operation. Management's assessment is that generally, these potential carbon reduction-related costs would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through public spending/subsidies.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, Tata Steel UK Limited ('TSUK') which forms the main part of the UK Business, announced a joint agreement with the UK Government on a proposal to invest in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace ('EAF') steel making at the Port Talbot site with a capital cost of \u00a31.25 billion inclusive of a grant from the UK Government of up to \u00a3500 million, subject to relevant regulatory approvals, information and consultation processes, and the /finalisation of detailed terms and conditions. The proposal also includes a wider restructuring of other locations and functions across TSUK.\n\nAs per local regulations in the UK, the National Consultation between TSUK and the UK multi trade union representative body (UK Steel Committee) on the asset closure plan has now been concluded. Under the proposed re-structuring programme, Port Talbot's two blast furnaces (No.5 and No.4) would get closed by end of June 2024 and latest by the end of September 2024 respectively. Following the closure of Blast Furnace No. 4, the remaining heavy end assets would wind down and the Continuous Annealing Processing Line (CAPL) would close in March 2025. TSUK has also agreed that it would continue to operate the hot strip mill through the proposed transition period and in future.\n\nGiven the risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with the underlying market and business conditions including higher in/flation, higher interest rates and supply chain disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, the uncommitted nature of available /financing options and pending the /finalisation of funding support from the UK Government for the proposed EAF investment, there exists a material uncertainty surrounding the impact of such adversities on the /financial situation of TSUK.\n\nWith respect to Tata Steel Netherland operations (TSN) which forms main part of the Mainland Europe (MLE) business, discussions with the government on the proposed decarbonisation roadmap have been initiated. The transition plan considers that the policy environment in the Netherlands and EU is supportive to the European steel industry and a level playing /field would be achieved by, either one or a combination of: a) Dutch Policy developments, b) Convergence with EU on (/fiscal) climate measures, enabling EU steel players to pass on costs and c) tailor made support mechanisms. In relation to the likely investments required for the de-carbonisation of TSN operations driven by regulatory changes in Europe and Netherlands, inter alia, the scenarios consider that the Dutch Government will provide a certain level of /financial support to execute the decarbonisation strategy, which are being discussed between the Company/TSN and Dutch Government.\n\nBased on the above and other available measures, MLE business is expected to have adequate liquidity to meet its future business requirements.\n\nThe recoverable value of investments held in T Steel Holdings Pte. Ltd. (TSH), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company is dependent on the operational and /financial performance of TSE, Tata Steel Minerals Canada (TSMC) and net assets of the other underlying businesses.\n\nThe recoverable value of TSE is based on fair value less cost to sell (FVLCTS) for TSUK and TSN, which inter -alia considers impact of switching the heavy end and other relevant assets to a more 'Green Steel' capex base. The fair value computation uses cash /flow forecasts based on most recent /financial budgets, strategic forecasts and future projections taking the analysis out into perpetuity based on a steady state, sustainable cash /flow re/flecting average steel industry conditions between successive peaks and troughs of pro/fitability.\n\nKey assumptions for the fair value less cost to sell model relate to expected changes to selling prices and raw material & conversion costs, EU steel demand, energy costs, exchange rates, the amount of capital expenditure needed for decarbonisation, changes to EBITDA resulting from producing and selling steel with low embedded CO 2 emissions, levels\n\n<!-- image -->",

The projections are based on the both past performance and the expectations of future performance assumptions therein. The Company estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that re/flect the current market rates adjusted to re/flect the way the European Union steel market would assess the speci/fic risk. The weighted average post-tax discount rates used for discounting the cash /flows projections is in the range of 8.20% - 9.11% (March 31, 2023: 7.90% to 8.80%). Beyond the speci/fically forecasted period, a growth rate in the range of Nil - 2.00% (March 31, 2023:1.70% - 2.00%) is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.\n\nThe Company has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests including sensitivity in respect of discount rates. If any of the key assumptions change, there is a risk that the headroom in the model would reduce and that the reduction in the headroom could lead to impairments of carrying amount of investments in TSH. However, the Company believes that key assumptions represent the most likely impact from decarbonisation at this point in time. Going forward, the key assumptions would be kept under review for changes, if any, based on the progress of the discussions with the government and regulators on the decarbonisation plan.\n\nBased on above, the Company carried out an impairment assessment of its investments held in TSH, which in turn holds investments in TSE, and recognised an impairment loss of \u20b9 10,038.00 crore during the year in the standalone /financial statements.\n\n- (iv) The Company, through erstwhile Tata Steel Long Products Limited ('TSLP') now merged with the Company, on July 4, 2022, completed the acquisition of Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited ('NINL'). As on March 31, 2024, the total investment of the Company in NINL is \u20b914,196.82 crore.\n\nThe recoverable value of such exposure in NINL has been assessed at fair value less costs to sell using cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved business plan for /financial year 2024-25. Beyond /financial year 2024-25, the cash /flow forecasts is based on strategic forecasts which cover a period of eight years and future projections taking the analysis out to perpetuity. It also includes capital expenditure for capacity expansion of steel making facilities from the current 1.1 MTPA to 4.95 MTPA by /financial year 2029-30 as well as estimated EBITDA changes due to implementation of the expansion strategy and operating the assets.\n\nKey assumptions to the fair value less costs to sell model are changes to selling prices and raw material costs, steel demand, amount of capital expenditure needed for expansion of the existing facilities, EBITDA and post-tax discount rate of 10.10% (March 31, 2023: 10.10%). The estimates are based on management's best estimate of implementing the expansion strategy.\n\nFor the fair value less costs to sell model, a terminal growth rate of 4.00% (March 31, 2023: 4.00%) has been used to extrapolate the cash /flows beyond the speci/fically forecasted period.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment assessment as on March 31, 2024 for investments held in NINL has not resulted in any impairment of investments.\n\nThe management has conducted sensitivity analysis including sensitivity in respect of discount rates, on the impairment assessment of the carrying value of investments held in NINL. The management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the model would cause the carrying value of investments to materially exceed its recoverable value.",

Borrowings (Contd.)\n\n[Item No. V(a)(i) and VI(a)(i), Page F26]\n\nThe loan was repayable in 16 equal semi-annual instalments after completion of four years from the date of the tranche.\n\nThe Company /filed a writ petition being WP No. 70 of 2006 (subsequently renumbered as WPO 70 of 2006) before the High Court at Calcutta in February 2006 claiming waiver of the outstanding loan and interest and refund of the balance lying with Steel Development Fund (\"SDF\"). The Writ Petition was decided by judgment dated August 3, 2022. By the judgment, the High Court declared that the corpus of SDF can only be utilised for the bene/fit of the main steel producers. However, the waiver of loan as sought by the Company was not allowed. Hence, against the judgment the Company /filed an appeal in the High Court being APO No. 85 of 2022.\n\nThe appeal has been decided on January 3, 2023. By the /final order, High Court has directed the Company to submit a fresh representation to Union of India and /fixed a time of three months for Union of India to take a decision on the representation. The Company has submitted the representation on March 28, 2023.\n\nThe representation of the Company was rejected by Government of India (Ministry of Steel) on December 29, 2023. By a letter of January 2024, the Company sought No-objection certi/ficate ('NoC') from Joint Plant Committee ('JPC') for scheme of amalgamation of two of its subsidiary companies, namely Bhubaneshwar Power Private Limited and Indian Steel and Wire Products Limited. By its letter dated February 22, 2024, while NoC has been issued for the merger, JPC has directed the Company to repay the outstanding SDF loans with interest within one month.\n\nThe Company has challenged the rejection of representation by Union of India (vide its communication dated December 29, 2023) and the direction of JPC to the Company to repay the outstanding loans by /filing a Writ Petition being WPO No. 227 of 2024. It was also the contention of the company that the company is entitled to refund of all sums paid by it to SDF and that the Union of India has no right to the same. On May 24, 2024, the Calcutta High Court (Single Bench) has dismissed the writ petition /filed by the Company. The Company is in the process of evaluating the future course of action.\n\nThe loan as stated in the standalone /financial statement includes funded interest \u20b9 1,189.92 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b91,111.84 crore).\n\nIt includes \u20b9 1,639.33 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b91,639.33 crore) representing repayments and interest on earlier loans for which applications of funding are awaiting sanction and is not secured by charge on movable assets of the Company.\n\n- (iii) As at March 31, 2024, the register of charges of the Company as available in records of the Ministry of Corporate A/ffairs (MCA) includes charges that were created/modi/fied since the inception of the Company. There are certain charges which are historic in nature and it involves practical challenges in obtaining no-objection certi/ficates (NOCs) from the charge holders of such charges, despite repayment of the underlying loans. The Company is in the continuous process of /filing the charge satisfaction e-form with MCA, within the timelines, as and when it receives NOCs from the respective charge holders.",

The only amounts included in the balance sheet are those relating to the prior months contributions that were not due to be paid until after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe major de/fined contribution plans operated by the Company are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nThe Company provides provident fund bene/fits for eligible employees as per applicable regulations wherein both employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the eligible employee's salary. Contributions under such schemes are made either to a provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees or to state managed funds.\n\nBene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to state managed funds and the Company does not have a future obligation to make good short fall if any, are treated as a de/fined contribution plan.",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\n## (b) Superannuation fund\n\nThe Company has a superannuation plan for the bene/fit of its employees. Employees who are members of the superannuation plan are entitled to bene/fits depending on the years of service and salary drawn.\n\nSeparate irrevocable trusts are maintained for employees covered and entitled to bene/fits. The Company contributes up to 15% of the eligible employees' salary or \u20b91,50,000, whichever is lower, to the trust every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The Company does not have any further obligation beyond this contribution.\n\nThe contributions recognised as an expense in the statement of pro/fit and loss during the year on account of the above de/fine d contribution plans amounted to \u20b9 210.42 crore (2022-23: \u20b9195.78 crore).\n\n## B. De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans operated by the Company are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nProvident fund bene/fits provided under plans wherein contributions are made to an irrevocable trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees are treated as a de/fined bene/fit plan as the Company is obligated to provide the members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company's contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nIn accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities based on guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is de/ficiency in the interest cost in respect of the entities merged with the Company wherein the expenses incurred (net) during the year \u20b9 5.21 crore (2022-23: \u20b97.14 crore) out of which \u20b9 0.40 crore (2022-23: \u20b92.08 crore) has been recognised within statement of pro/fit and loss and \u20b9 4.81 crore (2022-23: \u20b95.06 crore) has been recognised within other comprehensive income, as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is lesser than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.\n\nKey assumptions used for actuarial valuation are as below:\n\n|                                       | Year ended  March 31, 2024   | Year ended  March 31, 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                         | 7.00%                        | 7.20% to 7.30%               |\n| Guaranteed rate of return             | 8.25%                        | 8.15%                        |\n| Expected rate of return on investment | 7.55% to 8.15%               | 7.55% to 8.15%               |\n\n## (b) Retiring gratuity\n\nThe Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit retirement plan covering eligible employees as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The plan provides for a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service.

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\n## (c) Post-retirement medical bene/fits\n\nUnder this unfunded scheme, employees of the Company receive medical bene/fits subject to certain limits on amounts of bene/fits, periods after retirement and types of bene/fits, depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company under an early separation scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The Company accounts for the liability for post-retirement medical scheme based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (d) Other de/fined bene/fits\n\nOther bene/fits provided under unfunded schemes include post-retirement lumpsum bene/fits, pension payable to directors of the Company on their retirement, farewell gifts and reimbursement of packing and transportation charges to the employees based on their last drawn salary.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans expose the Company to a number of actuarial risks as below:\n\n- (i) Investment  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government bond yields. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan de/ficit.\n- (ii) Interest  risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of plan's debt investments.\n- (iii) Salary  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (iv) Longevity  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n\n## C.

Contingencies and commitments\n\n## A. Contingencies\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Company assesses  such  claims  and  assertions  and  monitors the legal environment on an on-going basis with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its /financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Company provides disclosure in the /financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable.\n\nThe following is a description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is possible, but not probable. The Company believes that none of the contingencies described below would have a material adverse e/ffect on the Company's /financial condition, results of operations or cash /flows.\n\nIt is not practicable for the Company to estimate the timings of the cash out/flows, if any, pending resolution of the respective proceedings. The Company does not expect any reimbursements in respect of the same.\n\n## Litigations\n\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings, both as plainti/ff and as defendant. There are claims which the Company does not believe to be of a material nature, other than those described below:\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe Company has ongoing disputes with income tax authorities relating to tax treatment of certain items. These mainly include disallowance of expenses, tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by the Company as deduction and the computation of or eligibility of the Company's use of certain tax incentives or allowances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this regard the Company has entered into various agreements with Tata Steel Utilities and Infrastructure Services Limited ('TSUISL'), whereby TSUISL provides the services to the Company, and the Company in turn provides such services to the residents. TSUISL charges GST on the invoices raised and the Company takes Input Tax Credit (ITC) of the same in terms of the GST Laws. Further, the Company maintains Tata Main Hospital (TMH) in the town of Jamshedpur, wherein health care services are provided to employees as well as non-employees. The Company has taken ITC of GST paid on various services received which is attributable\n\nto employees (no billing done for healthcare services). Both the above ITC was disputed by the department resulting in issuance of Show Cause Notice dated August 3, 2022.

The value of these sales was also disclosed in the periodical returns filed as per the Jharkhand VAT Act, 2005. The Commercial Tax Department has raised demand of Central Sales Tax by levying tax on the differences between value of sales outside the states and value of F-Form submitted for stock transfers. The tax amount involved for various assessment years 2012-13, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 as on March 31, 2024 is amounting to \u20b9 221.00 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b9200.00 crore).\n\n## Other taxes, dues and claims\n\nOther amounts for which the Company may contingently be liable aggregate to \u20b9 20,781.57 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b918,199.79 crore).\n\nThe details of signi/ficant demands are as below:\n\n- (a) The  State  Government  of  Odisha  introduced 'Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio Economic Development Act, 2004' with e/ffect from February 2005 levying tax on mineral bearing land computed on the basis of value of minerals produced from the mineral bearing land.

Other signi/ficant litigations\n\n- (a) Odisha Legislative Assembly issued an amendment to Indian Stamp Act, 1889, on May 9, 2013 and inserted a new provision (Section 3A) in respect of stamp duty payable on grant/renewal of mining leases. As per the amended provision, stamp duty is levied equal to 15% of the average royalty that would accrue out of the highest annual extraction of minerals under the approved mining plan multiplied by the period of such mining lease. The Company had /filed a writ petition challenging the constitutionality of the Act on July 5, 2013. The Hon'ble High Court, Cuttack passed an order on July 9, 2013 granting interim stay on the operation of the Amendment Act, 2013. Because of the stay, as on date, the Act is not enforceable and any demand received by the Company is not liable to be proceeded with. Meanwhile, the Company received demand notices for the various mines at Odisha totalling to \u20b9 5,579.00 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b95,579.00 crore). The Company has concluded that it is remote that the claim will sustain on ultimate resolution of the legal case by the court.\n\nIn April 2015, the Company has received an intimation from Government of Odisha, granting extension of validity period for leases under the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 up to March 31,2030 in respect of eight mines and up to March 31, 2020 for two mines subject to execution of supplementary lease deed. Liability has been provided in the books of accounts as on March 31, 2020 as per the existing provisions of the Stamp Act 1899 and the Company had paid the stamp duty and registration charges totalling \u20b9413.72 crore for supplementary deed execution in respect of eight mines out of the above mines.\n\n- (b) Noamundi Iron Ore Mine of the Company was due for its third renewal with e/ffect from January 01, 2012. The application for renewal was submitted by the Company within the stipulated time, but it remained pending consideration with the State and the mining operations were continued in terms of the prevailing law.\n\nBy a judgement of April 2014 in the case of Goa Mines, the Supreme Court took a view that second and subsequent renewal of mining lease can be e/ffected once the State considers the application and decides to renew the mining lease by issuing an express order. State of Jharkhand issued renewal order to the Company on December 31, 2014. The State, however, took a view on interpretation of Goa Mines judgement that the mining carried out after expiry of the period of second renewal was 'illegal' and hence, issued a\n\ndemand notice of \u20b93,568.31 crore being the price of iron ore extracted. The said demand has been challenged by the Company before the Jharkhand High Court.\n\nThe mining operations were suspended from August 1, 2014. Upon issuance of an express order, Company paid \u20b9152.00 crore under protest, so that mining can be resumed.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation (MMDR) Amendment Ordinance, 2015 promulgated on January 12, 2015 provides for extension of such mining leases whose applications for renewal have remained pending with the State(s). Based on the new Ordinance, Jharkhand Government revised the Express Order on February 12, 2015 for extending the period of lease up to March 31, 2030 with the following terms and conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 value  of  iron  ore  produced  by  alleged  unlawful mining during the period January 1, 2012 to April 20, 2014 for \u20b92,994.49 crore to be decided on the basis of disposal of our writ petition before Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand.\n- \u00b7 value of iron ore produced from April 21, 2014 to July 17, 2014 amounting to \u20b9421.83 crore to be paid in maximum 3 instalments.\n- \u00b7 value of iron ore produced from July 18, 2014 to August 31, 2014 i.e. \u20b9152.00 crore to be paid immediately.\n\nDistrict  Mining  Officer  Chaibasa  on  March  16,  2015 issued a demand notice for payment of \u20b9421.83 crore, in three monthly instalments. The Company on March 20, 2015 replied that since the lease has been extended by application of law till March 31, 2030, the above demand is not tenable. The Company, has paid \u20b950.00 crore under protest on July 27, 2015, because the State had stopped issuance of transit permits.\n\nThe Company /filed another writ petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand which was heard on September 9, 2015. An interim order was given by the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand on September 17, 2015 wherein the Court has directed the Company to pay the amount of \u20b9371.83 crore in 3 equal instalments, /first instalment by October 15, 2015, second instalment by November 15, 2015 and third instalment by December 15, 2015.\n\nIn view of the interim order of the Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand \u20b9124.00 crore was paid on September 28, 2015, \u20b9124.00 crore on November 12, 2015 and \u20b9123.83 crore on December 14, 2015 under protest.",

This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares and mutual funds.\n\nValuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). This level of hierarchy includes the Company's over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.\n\nValuation techniques with signi/ficant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair value is determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. This Level includes investment in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.",

Therefore, for substantially all /financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could have realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates.

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## (d) Transfer of /financial assets\n\nThe  Company  transfers  certain  trade  receivables under discounting arrangements with banks//financial institutions. Some of such arrangements do not qualify for de-recognition due to recourse arrangements being in place. Consequently, the proceeds received from transfer are recorded as short-term borrowings from banks and /financial institutions. As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, there has been no such transfer of trade receivables.\n\n## (e) Financial risk management\n\nIn the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily to /fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact the fair value of its /financial instruments.\n\nThe Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the /financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to:\n\n- (i) create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency and interest rate /fluctuations on the Company's business plan.\n- (ii) achieve  greater  predictability  to  earnings  by determining the /financial value of the expected earnings in advance.\n\n## (i) Market risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realising fair values or in future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  equity  price /fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future  specific  market  movements  cannot  be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (a) Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\nThe /fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potential impact on the statement of pro/fit and loss and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/ liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe Company, as per its risk management policy, uses  foreign  exchange  and  other  derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the Company's cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of /financing the Company's capital expenditures.\n\nA  10%  appreciation/depreciation  of  foreign currencies with respect to functional currency of  the  Company  would  result  in  an  increase/ decrease in the Company's net pro/fit/equity before considering tax impacts by approximately \u20b9 831.11 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024 (March 31, 2023: \u20b93,380.99 crore).\n\nThe foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by assuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been based on the composition of the Company's /financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other derivative and non-derivative /financial instruments (except investment in preference shares and loans receivable) not forming part of debt and which do not present a material exposure. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average balance outstanding during the period.\n\n## (b) Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by using the cash /flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Company's cash /flows as well as",

The Company is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Company's interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\nBased on the composition of debt as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would increase the Company's /finance costs (before considering interest eligible for capitalisation) and consequently reduce net pro/fit/equity before considering tax impacts by approximately \u20b9 249.43 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024 (2022-23: \u20b9207.55 crore).\n\nThe risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (c) Market risk - Equity price risk:\n\nEquity price risk is related to change in market reference price of investments in equity securities held by the Company.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments held by the Company exposes the Company to equity price risks. In general, these investments are not held for trading purposes.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments in equity, classi/fied as fair value through other comprehensive income as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 was \u20b9 1,994.33 crore and \u20b9988.94 crore, respectively.\n\nA 10% change in equity prices of such securities held as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023,\n\nwould  result  in  an  impact  of  \u20b9 199.43 crore and \u20b998.89 crore respectively on equity before considering tax impact.\n\n## (ii) Credit risk:\n\nCredit risk is the risk of /financial loss arising from counter-party  failure  to  repay  or  service  debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default  and  the  risk  of  deterioration  of  credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nThe Company has a policy of dealing only with credit  worthy  counter  parties  and  obtaining su/fficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of /financial loss from defaults.\n\nFinancial instruments that are subject to credit risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade receivables, loans receivables, investments in debt securities and mutual funds, balances with bank,  bank  deposits,  derivatives  and  financial guarantees provided by the Company. None of the /financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk except investment  in  preference  shares  made  by  the Company in its subsidiary companies and loans provided to wholly owned subsidiaries.\n\nThe carrying value of /financial assets represents the  maximum  credit  risk.  The  maximum exposure to credit risk was \u20b9 25,304.18 crore and \u20b951,604.96 crore, as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank  deposits,  investments  in  debt  securities, mutual funds, loans, derivative assets and other /financial assets.\n\nThe risk relating to trade receivables is presented in note 12, page F70.",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\nThe Company's exposure to customers is diversi/fied and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.\n\nIn respect of financial guarantees provided by the Company to banks//financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Company is exposed to is the maximum amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.\n\n## (iii) Liquidity risk:\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its /financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain su/fficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks. Furthermore, the Company have access to undrawn lines of committed and uncommitted borrowing/ facilities,  funds  from  debt  markets  through commercial  paper  programs,  non-convertible debentures  and  other  debt  instruments.  The Company invests its surplus funds in bank /fixed deposits and in mutual funds, which carry no or low market risk.\n\nThe Company also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets with a view to maintaining /financial /flexibility.\n\nThe Company's liquidity position remains strong at \u20b9 25,628.72 crore as at March 31, 2024, comprising \u20b9 6,555.14 crore in the form of current investments, cash and cash equivalents and other balances with banks (including non-current earmarked balances) and  \u20b9 19,073.58 crore  in  committed  undrawn bank lines.",

The Code has been published in the Gazette of India and subsequently on November 13, 2020 draft rules were published and invited for stakeholders' suggestions. However, the date on which the Code will come into e/ffect has not been noti/fied. The Company will assess the impact of the Code when it comes into e/ffect and will record any related impact in the period the Code becomes e/ffective.\n- 42. The erstwhile Tata Steel BSL Limited was eligible under Package Scheme of Incentives, 1993, and accordingly as per the provisions of the Scheme it had obtained eligibility certi/ficate from Directorate of Industries. As per the Scheme the Tata Steel BSL Limited has an option to defer the payment of sales tax for a period of fourteen years upto a speci/fied limit (twenty-one years in case the speci/fied limit is not availed in fourteen years). The said tax collected shall be paid after fourteen years in /five annual equal instalments and has been recognised as deferred sales tax liability, which as at March 31, 2024 amounts to \u20b9 27.65 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b924.85 crore). Post-introduction of GST, the Maharashtra government modi/fied the scheme, whereby the Company needs to deposit the GST and claim refund of the same. During the year, the Company has recognised \u20b9 14.28 crore (2022-23: \u20b962.75 crore) as an income on account of such scheme.\n- 43.

The equity shareholders of the entities will be entitled to fully paid-up equity shares of the Company in the ratio as set out in the respective scheme.\n\nAs part of the scheme(s) of amalgamations, equity shares and preference shares, if any, held by the Company in the above entities shall stand cancelled. No shares of the Company shall be issued nor any cash payment shall be made whatsoever by the Company in lieu of cancellation of shares of TSML and S&T Mining (both being wholly owned subsidiaries). The amalgamations will enhance management e/fficiency, drive sharper strategic focus and improve agility across businesses based on the strong parental support from the Company's leadership. The amalgamations will also drive synergies through operational e/fficiencies, raw material security and better facility utilisation. Merging entities are primarily engaged in the manufacturing of steel, pig iron, ductile iron pipe and downstream steel products.\n\nAs part of de/fined regulatory process, each of the above schemes has received approval(s) from stock exchanges and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

The Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on February 6, 2023, considered and approved the amalgamation of Angul Energy Limited ('AEL') into and with the Company by way of a scheme of amalgamation and had recommended a cash consideration of \u20b91,045/- for every 1 fully paid-up equity share of \u20b910/- each held by the shareholders (except the Company) in AEL. Upon the scheme coming into e/ffect, the entire paid-up share capital of AEL shall stand cancelled in its entirety.\n- The amalgamation will ensure consolidation of power assets under a single entity, leading to increased plant reliability, optimisation of power utilisation and other operation and cost synergies. Further, such restructuring will lead to simpli/fication of group structure by eliminating multiple companies in similar operation, optimum use of infrastructure, rationalisation of cost in the areas of operations and administrative overheads, thereby maximising shareholder value of the Company post amalgamation.\n- As part of the de/fined regulatory approval process, this scheme has received approval(s) from stock exchanges and SEBI. Thereafter, the scheme has been /filed at the relevant benches of the NCLT. The scheme has been approved by the shareholders of Tata Steel Limited on February 9, 2024. The Scheme has been approved and sanctioned by the NCLT, Delhi Bench on April 18, 2024. The approval and sanction of the NCLT, Mumbai Bench is awaited.\n- 45. The Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on November 1, 2023, considered and approved the amalgamation of Bhubaneshwar Power Private Limited ('BPPL') into and with the Company, by way of scheme of amalgamation.\n- As part of the scheme, equity shares and preference shares, if any, held by the Company in BPPL shall stand cancelled. No shares of the Company shall be issued, nor any cash payment shall be made whatsoever by the Company in lieu of cancellation of shares of BPPL (being wholly owned subsidiary).\n- The scheme has been /filed with the Hyderabad bench of the NCLT and sanction is awaited, /filing of the scheme with the Mumbai bench of the NCLT has been dispensed with.\n- 46. Consequent to the whistle-blower complaint in the Company's Graphene Business Division, the Company has carried out a detailed assessment and review of the matter and made the accounting adjustments/provisions, as appropriate, in the books of account, which were not material to the /financial statements. Based on the assessment(s) and review, it has been concluded that there has not been any fraud under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013. A report under sub-section (12) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 has been /filed by the statutory auditors in Form ADT-4 as prescribed under Rule 13 of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 with the Central Government.\n- 47. With e/ffect from April 1, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate A/ffairs (MCA) has made it mandatory for every company, which uses accounting software for maintaining its books of account, to use only such accounting software which has a feature of recording audit trail of each and every transaction, creating an edit log of each change made in books of account along with the date when such changes were made and ensuring that the audit trail cannot be disabled.\n- The Company uses multiple accounting software including SAP HANA Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software to maintain its books of accounts. Implementation of the above noti/fication to ensure enabling appropriate audit log on /financial tables in aforesaid SAP HANA, which have high frequency database operations would lead to a severe system performance degradation thereby adversely impacting business operations and users, besides requiring signi/ficant additional storage and supporting infrastructure.\n\nWith a view to address the above challenges while ensuring compliance with the MCA noti/fication and mitigate the risks involved therein, the Company has appropriately designed and implemented alternate mitigating controls over direct change at database level.",

We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated /financial statements of Tata Steel Limited (hereinafter referred to as the 'Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (Holding  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  together referred to as 'the Group'), its associate companies and jointly controlled entities (refer Note 1 to the attached consolidated /financial statements), which comprise the consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and the consolidated Statement of Pro/fit and Loss (including Other  Comprehensive  Income),  the  consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated /financial statements, material accounting policy information and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as 'the consolidated /financial statements').\n- 2. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated /financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of a/ffairs of the Group, its associate companies and jointly controlled entities  as  at  March  31,  2024,  consolidated  total comprehensive income (comprising of loss and other comprehensive income), consolidated changes in equity and its consolidated cash /flows for the year then ended.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n- 3. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) speci/fied under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associate companies and jointly controlled entities in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant  to  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements in India in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and\n\nthe relevant provisions of the Act, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in sub-paragraph 15 of the Other Matters section below, other than the unaudited /financial statements//financial information as certi/fied by the management and referred to in sub-paragraph 16 of the Other Matters section below and /financial information not available as referred to in sub-paragraph 17 of the Other Matters section below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\n- 4. We  refer  to  Note  49  to  the  consolidated  financial statements. Our opinion is not modified in respect of the following Emphasis of Matter that has been communicated  to  us  by  the  auditors  of  Tata  Steel Europe Limited, a step-down subsidiary of the Holding Company,  vide  their  audit  report  dated  May  28, 2024 on the /financial information for the year ended March 31, 2024:\n- 'Without modifying our opinion on the special purpose /financial information, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made in the special purpose /financial information concerning the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. On 15 September 2023, Tata Steel UK Limited announced a joint agreement with the UK Government on a proposal to invest in an Electric Arc Furnace in Tata Steel UK Limited. As part of this agreement the UK company will receive a government grant of up to \u00a3500m along with a commitment from Tata Steel Limited to inject equity of at least \u00a31,000m. Whilst both Tata Steel Limited and the UK Government have signed a term sheet setting out the details, the proposal is currently non-binding until the time that the Grant Funding Agreement ('GFA') between Tata Steel UK Limited, Tata Steel Limited and the UK Government which captures all the key points contained in the term sheet is signed and the Final Investment Decision ('FIA') is made. The UK business has also received a letter of support from T S Global Holdings Pte Ltd to either re/finance or repay its uncommitted facilities and term loans due to expire in the next 18 months. This letter states that it represents present policy, is given by way of comfort only and is not to be construed as constituting a promise as to the future conduct of the entities or",

These conditions, along with the other matters explained in the special purpose /financial information, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast signi/ficant doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. The special purpose /financial information does not include the adjustments that would result if the entity was unable to continue as a going concern'.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n- 5. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAssessment  of  litigations  and  related  disclosures  of contingent liabilities\n\n[Refer to Note 2(c) to the consolidated /financial statements'Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities',  Note  37(A)  to  the consolidated  /financial  statements  'Contingencies'  and Note 38 to the consolidated /financial statements - 'Other signi/ficant litigations']\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Holding Company has exposures towards litigations relating to various matters as set out in the aforesaid Notes. Signi/ficant management judgement is required to assess such matters to determine the probability of occurrence of material out/flow of economic resources and whether a provision should be recognised or a disclosure should  be  made.  The  management  judgement  is  also supported with legal advice in certain cases, as considered appropriate. As the ultimate outcome of the matters are uncertain and the positions taken by the management are based on the application of their best judgement, related legal  advice  including  those  relating  to  interpretation  of laws/regulations, it is considered as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 We  understood  from  the  management,  assessed  and tested  the  design  and  operating  e/ffectiveness  of  key controls surrounding assessment of litigations relating to the relevant laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 We  have  reviewed  the  legal  and  other  professional expenses of the Holding Company and enquired with the management for recent developments and the status of the material litigations which were reviewed;\n- \u00b7 We  performed  our  assessment  on  a  test  basis  on  the underlying calculations supporting the contingent liabilities/other  signi/ficant  litigations  disclosed  in  the consolidated /financial statements;\n- \u00b7 We used auditor's experts/specialists to gain an understanding and to evaluate the disputed tax matters;\n- \u00b7 We  considered  external  legal  opinions,  where  relevant, obtained by management;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's assessments by understanding precedents set in similar cases and assessed the reliability of the management's past estimates/judgements;\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  management's  assessment  around  those matters  that  are  not  disclosed  or  not  considered  as contingent liability, as the probability of material out/flow is considered to be remote by the management; and\n- \u00b7 We  assessed  the  adequacy  of  the  disclosures  in  the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nBased on the above work performed, no signi/ficant exceptions were  noted  in  the  assessment  in  respect  of  litigations  and related  disclosures  relating  to  contingent  liabilities/other signi/ficant litigations in the consolidated /financial statements.",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n- 11. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate companies and jointly controlled entities to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence",

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- 15.

A company's internal /financial control with reference to /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /financial control with reference to /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2) provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the /financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to /financial statements\n\n- 7.

Company Information\n\nTata Steel Limited ('the Company') is a public limited Company incorporated in India with its registered o/ffice in Bombay House 24, Homi Modi Street Fort, Mumbai-400 001, Maharashtra, India. The Company is listed on the BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE).\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as 'the Group') have presence across the entire value chain of steel manufacturing from mining and processing iron ore and coal to producing and distributing /finished products. The Group offers a broad range of steel products including a portfolio of high value added downstream products such as hot rolled, cold rolled, coated steel, rebars, wire rods, tubes and wires.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements as at March 31, 2024 present the /financial position of the Group as well as its interests in associate companies and joint arrangements. The list of entities consolidated is provided in note 54, page F264.\n\nThe presentation currency of the Group is Indian Rupee (' H ').\n\nAs on March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited owns 31.76% of the Ordinary Shares of the Company and has the ability to in/fluence the Group's operations.\n\nThe /financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on May 29, 2024.\n\n## 2. Material accounting policies\n\nThe material accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of its consolidated /financial statements are listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied  consistently  to  all  the  periods  presented in  these  consolidated  financial  statements,  unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as 'Ind AS') prescribed under Section  133  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013  read  with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair value by Ind AS.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nAll assets and liabilities have been classi/fied as current and non- current as per the Group's normal operating cycle which is based on the nature of businesses and the time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation of cash and cash equivalents. The Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\n\n## (c) Use of estimates and critical accounting judgements\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial statements,  the  Group  makes  judgements  in  the application of accounting policies; and estimates and assumptions which affects carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and future periods a/ffected.\n\nThe  Group  uses  the  following  critical  accounting estimates  and  judgements  in  preparation  of  its consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Group estimates the recoverable value of the cash generating unit (CGU) based on future cash /flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rates, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and the impact of climate change which may result in a change of current production process given the decarbonisation plan of the Group. The estimated cash /flows are developed using internal forecasts. The cash /flows are discounted using a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Further details of the Group's impairment review and key assumptions are",

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\nset out in note 3, page F165, note 4, page F170, note 5, page F173 and note 6, page F174.\n\n## Impairment of /financial assets (other than subsequent measurement at fair value)\n\nMeasurement of impairment of /financial assets require use of estimates and judgements, which have been explained in the note on /financial instruments under impairment of /financial assets (refer note 2(n), page F159).\n\n## Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets\n\nThe Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation and amortisation expense in future periods. The policy has been detailed in note 2(g), page F155, note 2(I), page F158 and note 2(m), page F158.\n\n## Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group assesses the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on future taxable income projections, which are inherently uncertain and may be subject to changes over time. Judgment is required to assess the impact of such changes on the measurement of these assets and the time frame for their utilisation. The Group reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period. The policy has been detailed in note 2(t) page F163 and its further information are set out in note 12, page F186.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, as result of a past event and it is probable that the out/flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made. They include provisions on decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions as well which may change where changes in estimated reserves a/ffect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities. All provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to re/flect the current best estimates.\n\nThe  Group  uses  significant  judgements  to  assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nevents, the existence of which will be con/firmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past event where it is either not probable that an out/flow of resources will be utilised to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated /financial statements. Further details are set out in note 24, page F213 and note 37(A), page F235.\n\n## Fair value measurements of /financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  cannot  be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including Discounted Cash Flow Model. The inputs to these models are  taken  from  observable  markets  where  possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risks, credit risks and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could a/ffect the reported fair value of /financial instruments. Further details are set out in note 40, page F243.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group evaluates if an arrangement quali/fies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116 'Leases'. Identi/fication of a lease requires signi/ficant judgement in assessing the lease term including anticipated renewals and the applicable discount rate.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Retirement bene/fit obligations and assets\n\nThe Group's retirement bene/fit obligations are subject to a number of assumptions including discount rates, in/flation, salary growth and mortality rate. Signi/ficant assumptions are required when setting these criteria and a change in these assumptions would have a signi/ficant impact on the amount recorded in the Group's balance sheet and the consolidated statement of profit and loss.  The  Group  sets  these  assumptions  based  on previous experience and third party actuarial advice. The assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted following actuarial and experience changes.

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\ndetails on the Group's retirement bene/fit obligations, including  key  assumptions  are  set  out  in  note  36, page F223.\n\n## Allocation of consideration over the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  acquired  pursuant  to  business combination are stated at the fair values determined as of the date of acquisition. The carrying values of assets acquired are determined based on estimate of a valuation carried out by independent professional valuers appointed by the Group. The values have been assessed based on the technical estimates of useful lives of tangible assets and bene/fits expected from the use of intangible assets. Other assets and liabilities were recorded at values that were expected to be realised or settled respectively.\n\n## (d) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company i.e. its subsidiaries. It also includes the Group's share of pro/fits, net assets and retained post acquisition reserves of joint arrangements and associates that are consolidated using the equity or proportionate method of consolidation, as applicable.\n\nControl is achieved when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to the variable returns of the entity and the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nAssociates are those companies over which the Company has the ability to exercise signi/ficant in/fluence on the /financial and operating policy decisions, which it does not control. Generally, signi/ficant in/fluence is presumed to exist when the Company holds more than 20% of the voting rights. Joint arrangements, which include joint ventures and joint operations, are those over whose activities the Company has joint control, typically under a contractual arrangement. In joint ventures, the Group exercises joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. The investment is accounted for under the equity method and therefore recognised at cost at the date of acquisition and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition, less any impairment incurred. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying value of such investments, the carrying value is reduced to Nil\n\nand recognition of future losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligation in respect of the associate/ joint venture.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates acquired or disposed o/ff during the year are included in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss from the e/ffective date of acquisition or up to the e/ffective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n\nIntra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  represent  the  portion  of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and  are  presented  separately  in  the  consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## (e) Business combinations\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.\n\nAcquisition  related  costs  are  recognised  in  the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred in the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognised, as applicable. Where the fair value of the identi/fiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after re-assessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identi/fiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-byacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying value of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling",

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\ninterests even if it results in the non-controlling interests having a de/ficit balance.\n\nOnce  control  has  been  achieved,  any  subsequent acquisitions where the Group does not originally hold hundred percent interest in a subsidiary are treated as an acquisition of shares from non-controlling shareholders. The identi/fiable net assets are not subject to further fair value adjustments and the di/fference between the cost of acquisition of the non-controlling interest and the net book value of the additional interest acquired is adjusted in equity.\n\n## (f) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to bene/fit from the synergies of the combination. Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit's value may be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGU is higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\nThe /financial projections basis which the future cash/flows are  estimated  consider  economic  uncertainties, assessment of discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated /first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit in proportion to the carrying value of each asset in the unit.\n\n## (g) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost applied on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Cost includes all direct costs and expenditures incurred to bring the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Trial run expenses are capitalised. Borrowing costs incurred\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nduring the period of construction is capitalised as part of cost of qualifying asset.\n\nDepreciation is provided so as to write o/ff, on a straight line basis, the cost / deemed cost of property, plant and equipment to their residual value. These charges are commenced from the dates the assets are available for their intended use and are spread over their estimated useful economic lives. The estimated useful lives of assets, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed regularly and revised when necessary.\n\nDepreciation on assets under construction commences only when the assets are ready for their intended use.\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the main categories of property, plant and equipment are:\n\n| Freehold and long leasehold buildings                                                    | Estimated   useful life (years) upto 60 years*   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Roads                                                                                    | 5 to 10 years                                    |\n| Plant and machinery                                                                      | upto 40 years*                                   |\n| Furniture, /fixture and o/ffice equipments                                               | 3 to 25 years                                    |\n| Vehicles and aircraft                                                                    | 4 to 20 years                                    |\n| Railway sidings                                                                          | upto 35 years*                                   |\n| Assets covered under the Electricity Act (life  as prescribed under the Electricity Act) | 3 to 38 years                                    |\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  evaluated  for recoverability wherever there is any indication that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use is determined on an individual asset basis under the asset that does not generate cash /flow that are largely independent from the assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a tax free discount rate that re/flects current market assessment of the time value of money and the risk speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable value of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is reduced to its recoverable value. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.",

Hence the useful lives for these assets are di/fferent from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (h) Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\nExpenditures associated with search for speci/fic mineral resources are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets. The following expenditure comprises cost of exploration and evaluation assets:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining of the rights to explore and evaluate mineral reserves and resources including costs directly related to this acquisition\n- \u00b7 researching and analysing existing exploration data\n- \u00b7 conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling\n- \u00b7 examining and testing extraction and treatment methods\n- \u00b7 compiling pre-feasibility and feasibility studies\n- \u00b7 activities  in  relation  to  evaluating  the  technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.\n\nAdministration and other overhead costs are charged to the cost of exploration and evaluation assets only if directly related to an exploration and evaluation project.\n\nIf a project does not prove viable, all irrecoverable exploration and evaluation expenditure associated with the project net of any related impairment allowances is written o/ff to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nThe Group measures its exploration and evaluation assets at cost and classi/fies as property, plant and equipment or intangible assets according to the nature of the assets acquired and applies the classi/fication consistently. To the extent that a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible asset, the amount re/flecting that consumption is capitalised as a part of the cost of the intangible asset.\n\nAs the capitalised exploration asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All exploration and evaluation assets are monitored for indications of impairment. An  exploration  and  evaluation  asset  is  no  longer classified as such when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource are demonstrable and the development of the deposit is sanctioned by the management. The carrying value of such exploration and evaluation asset is reclassi/fied to mining assets.\n\n## (i) Development expenditure for mineral reserves\n\nDevelopment is the establishment of access to mineral reserves  and  other  preparations  for  commercial production.  Development  activities  often  continue during production and include:\n\n- \u00b7 sinking shafts and underground drifts (often called mine development)\n- \u00b7 making permanent excavations\n- \u00b7 developing passageways and rooms or galleries\n- \u00b7 building roads and tunnels and\n- \u00b7 advance removal of overburden and waste rock.\n\nDevelopment  (or  construction)  also  includes  the installation of infrastructure (e.g., roads, utilities and housing), machinery, equipment and facilities.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalised and presented as part of mining assets. No depreciation is charged on the development expenditure before the start of commercial production.",

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (j) Provision for restoration and environmental costs\n\nThe Group has liabilities related to restoration of soil and other related works, which are due upon the closure of certain of its mining sites.\n\nSuch liabilities are estimated case-by-case based on available information, considering applicable local legal requirements. The estimation is made using existing technology, at current prices, and discounted using an appropriate discount rate where the e/ffect of time value of money is material. Future restoration and environmental costs, discounted to net present value, are capitalised and the corresponding restoration liability is raised as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. Future restoration and environmental costs are capitalised in property, plant and equipment or mining assets as appropriate and are depreciated over the life of the related asset. The e/ffect of time value of money on the restoration and environmental costs liability is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (k) Stripping costs\n\nThe Group separates two di/fferent types of stripping costs that are incurred in surface mining activity:\n\n- \u00b7 developmental stripping costs and\n- \u00b7 production stripping costs\n\nDevelopmental stripping costs which are incurred in order to obtain access to quantities of mineral reserves that will be mined in future periods are capitalised as part of mining assets.\n\nCapitalisation of developmental stripping costs ends when the commercial production of the mineral reserves begins. A mine can operate several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning and production. In this case, stripping costs are accounted for separately, by reference to the ore extracted from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning and production, stripping costs are aggregated too.\n\nThe determination of whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's speci/fic circumstances. The following\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfactors normally point towards the stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- \u00b7 mining  of  the  second  and  subsequent  pits  is conducted consecutively with that of the /first pit, rather than concurrently\n- \u00b7 separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset\n- \u00b7 the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit\n- \u00b7 expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large\n- \u00b7 the pits extract ore from separate and distinct ore bodies, rather than from a single ore body.\n\nThe relative importance of each factor is considered by the management to determine whether, the stripping costs should be attributed to the individual pit or to the combined output from the several pits.\n\nProduction stripping costs are incurred to extract the ore in the form of inventories and/or to improve access to an additional component of an ore body or deeper levels of material. Production stripping costs are accounted for as inventories to the extent the bene/fit from production stripping activity is realised in the form of inventories.\n\nThe Group recognises a stripping activity asset in the production phase if, and only if, all of the following are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  probable  that  the  future  economic  benefit (improved access to the ore body) associated with the stripping activity will /flow to the Group\n- \u00b7 the Group can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and\n- \u00b7 the costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nSuch costs are presented within mining assets. After initial recognition, stripping activity assets are carried at cost/deemed cost, less accumulated amortisation and impairment. The expected useful life of the identi/fied component of the ore body is used to depreciate or amortise the stripping asset.",

In this case they are measured initially at purchase cost and then amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\n\n|                                       | Estimated   useful life (years)   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Computer software                     | upto 8 years                      |\n| Patents and trademarks                | 4 years                           |\n| Product and process development costs | 5 years                           |\n| Other intangible assets               | 1 to 15 years                     |\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets with de/finite useful lives acquired in a business combination are  reported  at  cost  or  deemed  cost  applied  on transition to Ind AS, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntangible  assets  are  evaluated  for  recoverability wherever there is any indication that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use is determined on an individual asset basis under the asset that does not generate cash /flow that are largely independent from the assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the recoverable value of an asset (CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (CGU) is reduced to its recoverable value. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identi/fied and recognised separately  from  goodwill  where  they  satisfy  the de/finition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.\n\n## (m)  Leases\n\nThe  Group  determines  whether  an  arrangement contains a lease by assessing whether the ful/filment of a transaction is dependent on the use of a speci/fic asset and whether the transaction conveys the right to control the use of that asset to the Group in return for payment.\n\n## The Group as lessee\n\nThe Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative  stand-alone  price  of  the  lease  component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non- lease components. The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception comprises of the amount of initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right- of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that such options would be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nLease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to re/flect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to re/flect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to re/flect any reassessment or lease modifications. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease",

Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying value of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (ii) Finance lease When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of minimum lease  payments  is  recognised  as  a  receivable. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the  present  value  of  receivable  is  recognised as  unearned  finance  income.  Lease  income  is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method before tax, which re/flects a constant periodic rate of return. Such rate is the interest rate which is implicit in the lease contract.\n\n## (n) Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  of  the  instrument.

The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets and /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit and loss are immediately recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.

These balances with banks are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n- (ii) Other balances with bank -which also include balances and deposits with banks that are restricted for withdrawal and usage.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these /financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if such /financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and to sell such /financial assets and the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThe Group in respect of certain equity investments (other than in associates and joint ventures) which",

Such an election is made by the Group on an instrument by instrument basis at the time of initial recognition of such equity investments. These  investments  are  held  for  medium  or long-term strategic purpose. The Group has chosen to designate these investments in equity instruments as fair value through other comprehensive income as the management believes this provides a more meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than re/flecting changes in fair value immediately in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income are carried at fair value through pro/fit and loss.\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and e/ffective interest rate applicable and is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit or loss when the right to receive payment has been established.\n\n## Impairment of /financial assets\n\nLoss  allowance  for  expected  credit  losses  is recognised  for  financial  assets  measured  at amortised  cost  and  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group recognises life time expected credit losses for all trade receivables that do not constitute a /financing transaction.\n\nFor /financial assets (apart from trade receivables that do not constitute of /financing transaction) whose credit risk has not signi/ficantly increased since initial recognition, loss allowance equal to twelve months expected credit losses is recognised. Loss allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses is recognised if the credit risk of the\n\nfinancial asset has significantly increased since initial recognition.\n\n## De-recognition of /financial assets\n\nThe Group de-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\n\nIf the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.\n\nIf the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset,  the  Group  continues  to  recognise  the /financial asset and also recognises a borrowing for the proceeds received.\n\n## (II) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n## Classi/fication as debt or equity\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classi/fied according to the substance of  the  contractual  arrangements  entered  into and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.

The instruments are confined principally to forward foreign exchange contracts, forward rate agreements, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and collars. The instruments are employed as hedges of transactions included in the /financial statements or for highly probable forecast transactions//firm contractual commitments. These derivatives  contracts  do  not  generally  extend beyond six months, except for certain currency swaps and interest rate derivatives.\n\nDerivatives are initially accounted for and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe Group adopts hedge accounting for forward foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity contracts,  wherever  possible.  At  the  inception of each hedge, there is a formal, documented designation  of  the  hedging  relationship.  This documentation includes, inter alia, items such as identi/fication of the hedged item and transaction and nature of the risk being hedged. At inception each hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving an o/ffset of changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. The e/ffectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at the inception and on an ongoing basis. The ine/ffective portion of designated hedges is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen hedge accounting is applied:\n\n- \u00b7 for fair value hedges of recognised assets and liabilities, changes in fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss and compensate for the e/ffective portion of symmetrical changes in the fair value of the derivatives.\n- \u00b7 for cash /flow hedges, the e/ffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ine/ffective portion is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss. If the cash /flow hedge of a /firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss in the same period in which the hedged item a/ffects the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nIn cases where hedge accounting is not applied, changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss as and when they arise.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\nFurther details on the Group's /financial instruments are set out in note 40, page F243.",

Remeasurement gains and losses of the net de/fined bene/fit liability/(asset) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The service cost and net interest on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) are recognised as an expense within employee costs.\n\nPast service cost is recognised as an expense when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when any related restructuring costs or termination bene/fits are recognised, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligations as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.\n\n## Compensated absences\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee bene/fits such as annual leave and sick leave are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method with actuarial valuation being carried out at each yearend balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of pro/fit and loss in the period in which they arise.\n\nCompensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related service are recognised based on actuarial valuation.\n\n## (p) Inventories\n\nInventories comprise the followings:\n\n- a) Raw materials,\n- b) Work-in-progress,\n- c) Finished and semi-/finished goods\n- d) Stock-in-trade, and\n- e) Stores and spares.\n\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is ascertained on a weighted average basis. Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the cost of conversion from their existing state to a /finished condition and for the cost of marketing, selling and distribution.\n\nProvisions are made to cover slow moving and obsolete items based on historical experience of utilisation on a product category basis, which involves individual businesses considering their product lines and market conditions.\n\n## (q) Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, which is expected to result in an out/flow of resources embodying economic benefits which can be reliably estimated. They also include provisions on decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions as well. Each provision is based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the time value of money is material, provisions are measured on a discounted basis.\n\nConstructive obligation is an obligation that derives from an entity's actions where:\n\n- (i) by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a su/fficiently speci/fic current statement,",

The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.

Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. In contrast, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  on  taxable temporary  differences  arising  on  investments  in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference  and  it  is  probable  that  the  temporary di/fference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su/fficient taxable pro/fits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets re/flects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying value of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset to the extent that they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority and they are in the same taxable entity, or a Group of taxable entities where the tax losses of one entity are used to o/ffset the taxable pro/fits of another and there are legally enforceable rights to set o/ff current tax assets and current tax liabilities within that jurisdiction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.",

Material accounting policies (Contd.)\n\n## (u) Revenue\n\nThe Group manufactures and sells a range of steel and other products.\n\n## Sale of products\n\nRevenue from sale of products is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped or delivered to the speci/fic location as the case may be, the risks of loss has been transferred, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satis/fied. Sale of products include related ancillary services, if any.\n\nGoods are often sold with volume and price discounts based on aggregate sales over a 12 months period. Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price speci/fied in the contract, net of the estimated volume and price discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the most likely method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal will not occur. A liability is recognised for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of /financing is deemed present as the sales are generally made with a credit term of 30-90 days, which is consistent with market practice. Any obligation to provide a refund is recognised as a provision. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.\n\nThe Group does not adjust the transaction prices for any time value of money in case of contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer does not exceed one year.\n\n## Sale of power\n\nRevenue from sale of power is recognised when the services are provided to the customer based on approved tariff rates established by the respective regulatory authorities. The Group doesn't recognise revenue and an asset for cost incurred in the past that will be recovered.\n\n## (v) Foreign currency transactions and translations\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of the Group are presented in Indian Rupee (' H '), which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, transactions  in  currencies  other  than  the  entity's functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.\n\nExchange differences arising on the retranslation or settlement of other monetary items are included in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss for the period.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated /financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are expressed in ' H ' using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. On the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the accumulated exchange  differences  in  respect  of  that  operation attributable to the Company are reclassified to the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## (w)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nNo new amendments to Ind AS has been noti/fied by the Ministry of Corporate A/ffairs ('MCA') during the current /financial year.",

Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublet the asset to another party, the right-of-use asset can only be used by the Group. Extension and termination options are included in some property and equipment leases. These are used to maximise operational /flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. Majority of the extension and termination options held are exercisable based on mutual agreement of the Group and the lessors.",

Payments made for short term leases and leases of low value are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nVariable lease payments which do not depend on an index or a rate (such as lease payments based on a percentage of sales) are excluded from the initial measurement of the lease liability and asset.\n\nFor leases recognised under long term arrangements involving use of a dedicated asset, non-lease components are excluded based on the underlying contractual terms and conditions. A change in the allocation assumptions may have an impact on the measurement of lease liabilities and the related right-of-use assets.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Group has recognised the following in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss:\n\n- (i) expense in respect of short-term leases and leases of low- value assets H 37.63 crore (2022-23: H 32.29 crore) and H 36.69 crore (2022-23: H 30.57 crore) respectively.\n- (ii) expense in respect of variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities H 244.31 crore (2022-23: H 1,062.45 crore).\n- (iii) income in respect of sub leases of right-of-use assets Nil (2022-23: H 48.70 crore).\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, total cash out/flow in respect of leases amounted to H 1,948.89 crore (2022-23: H 2,777.04 crore).\n\nAs at March 31, 2024, commitments for leases not yet commenced was H 204.02 crore (March 31, 2023: H 214.35 crore).",

The recoverable value of NINL has been assessed at fair value less costs to sell using cash /flow forecasts based on the most recently approved business plan for /financial year 2024-25. Beyond /financial year 2024-25, the cash /flow forecasts is based on strategic forecasts which cover a period of eight years and future projections taking the analysis out to perpetuity. It also includes capital expenditure for capacity expansion of steel making facilities from the current 1.1 MTPA to 4.95 MTPA by /financial year 2029-30 as well as estimated EBITDA changes due to implementation of the expansion strategy and operating the assets.\n\nKey assumptions to the fair value less costs to sell model are changes to selling prices and raw material costs, steel demand, amount of capital expenditure needed for expansion of the existing facilities, EBITDA, and a post-tax discount rate of 10.10% (March 31, 2023: 10.10%). The estimates are based on management's best estimates of implementing the expansion strategy.\n\nFor the fair value less costs to sell model, a terminal growth rate of 4.00% (March 31, 2023: 4.00%) has been used to extrapolate the cash /flows beyond the speci/fically forecasted period.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment assessment as on March 31, 2024 has not resulted in impairment of Goodwill.\n\nThe Group has conducted sensitivity analysis including sensitivity in respect of discount rate on the impairment assessment of goodwill. The Group believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions used in the model would cause the carrying value of goodwill to materially exceed its recoverable value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Income tax expenses/(bene/fit)\n\nIndian companies are subject to income tax in India on the basis of their standalone /financial statements. Indian companies can claim tax exemptions/deductions under speci/fic sections of the Income-tax Act, 1961 subject to ful/filment of prescribed conditions as may be applicable. The Company and some of its Indian subsidiaries during the year ended March 31, 2020 has opted for the new tax regime under Section 115BAA of the Act, which provides a domestic company with an option to pay tax at a rate of 22% (e/ffective rate of 25.168%). The lower rate shall be applicable subject to certain conditions, including that the total income should be computed without claiming speci/fic deduction or exemptions.\n\nAs per the tax laws, business loss can be carried forward for a maximum period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year to which the loss pertains. Unabsorbed depreciation can be carried forward for an inde/finite period.\n\nApart from India, major tax jurisdictions for the Group include Singapore, United Kingdom and Netherlands. The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe reconciliation of estimated income tax to income tax expense is as below:\n\n|                                                                   |                                                                                                | Year ended   March 31, 2024   | ( H  crore) Year ended   March 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Income tax expense at tax rates applicable to individual entities | Income tax expense at tax rates applicable to individual entities                              | (206.30)                      | 4,766.68                                  |\n| (a)                                                               | Income exempt from tax/items not deductible                                                    | (600.08)                      | 720.15                                    |\n|                                                                   | (b)  Undistributed earning of joint ventures and equity accounted investees                    | (11.89)                       | 42.23                                     |\n| (c)                                                               | Deferred tax assets not recognised because realisation is not probable                         | 5,250.81                      | 3,867.24                                  |\n|                                                                   | (d)  Adjustments to taxes in respect of prior periods                                          | 57.33                         | 11.58                                     |\n| (e)                                                               | Utilisation/credit of unrecognised tax losses, unabsorbed depreciation and other tax bene/fits | (726.83)                      | (133.54)                                  |\n| (f )                                                              | Impact of changes in tax rates (i)                                                             | (0.47)                        | 885.43                                    |\n| Tax expense as reported                                           | Tax expense as reported                                                                        | 3,762.57                      | 10,159.77                                 |",

However, the waiver of loan as sought by the Company was not allowed. Hence, against the judgment the Company /filed an appeal in the High Court being APO No. 85 of 2022.\n\nThe appeal has been decided on January 3, 2023. By the /final order, High Court has directed the Company to submit a fresh representation to Union of India and /fixed a time of three months for Union of India to take a decision on the representation. The Company has submitted the representation on March 28, 2023.\n\nThe representation of the Company was rejected by Government of India (Ministry of Steel) on December 29, 2023. By a letter of January 2024, the Company sought No-objection certi/ficate ('NoC') from Joint Plant Committee ('JPC') for scheme of amalgamation of two of its subsidiary companies, namely Bhubaneshwar Power Private Limited and Indian Steel and Wire Products Limited. By its letter dated February 22, 2024, while NoC has been issued for the merger, JPC has directed the Company to repay the outstanding SDF loans with interest within one month.\n\nThe Company has challenged the rejection of representation by Union of India (vide its communication dated December 29, 2023) and the direction of JPC to the Company to repay the outstanding loans by /filing a Writ Petition being WPO No. 227 of 2024. It was also the contention of the company that the company is entitled to refund of all sums paid by it to SDF and that the Union of India has no right to the same. On May 24, 2024, the Calcutta High Court (Single Bench) has dismissed the writ petition /filed by the Company. The Company is in the process of evaluating the future course of action.\n\nThe loan as stated in the consolidated /financial statement includes funded interest \u20b9 1,189.92 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b91,111.84 crore).\n\nIt includes \u20b9 1,639.33 crore (March 31, 2023: \u20b91,639.33 crore) representing repayments and interest on earlier loans for which applications of funding are awaiting sanction and is not secured by charge on movable assets of the Company.\n\n## (b) Loans from banks//financial institutions\n\nThe borrowings in Tata Steel Europe relate to the senior facility arrangement (SFA) which was re/financed in October 2022. The SFA is secured against the assets and shares of Tata Steel UK Limited and the shares of Tata Steel Netherlands Holdings BV (TSNH). The SFA contains a /financial covenant which sets an annual maximum capital expenditure at TSNH and contains covenants for cash /flow to debt service and debt tangible net worth calculated at the Company level. During the year ended March 31, 2023 Tata Steel Europe made early repayments of EURO 168 million in October 2022 against Facility B. The SFA at March 31, 2024 comprises of the following term loan:",

De/fined contribution plans\n\nThe  Group  participates  in  a  number  of  defined contribution plans on behalf of relevant personnel. Any expense recognised in relation to these schemes represents the value of contributions payable during the period by the Group at rates speci/fied by the rules of  those  plans.  The  only  amounts  included  in  the consolidated balance sheet are those relating to the prior months contributions that were not due to be paid until after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe major de/fined contribution plans operated by the Group are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nThe Company and its Indian subsidiaries provide provident fund bene/fits for eligible employees as per applicable regulations wherein both employees and  the  Company/Indian  subsidiaries  make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the eligible employees' salary. Contributions under such schemes are made either to a provident fund set up as an irrevocable trust by the Company/ Indian subsidiaries to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees or to state managed funds.\n\nBenefits  provided  under  plans  wherein contributions are made to state managed funds and the Company/Indian subsidiaries do not have a future obligation to make good short fall if any, are treated as a de/fined contribution plan.\n\n## (b) Superannuation fund\n\nThe Company and some of its Indian subsidiaries have a superannuation plan for the benefit of its employees. Employees who are members of the superannuation plan are entitled to bene/fits depending on the years of service and salary drawn.\n\nSeparate  irrevocable  trusts  are  maintained  for employees covered and entitled to bene/fits. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries contribute up to 15% of the eligible employees' salary or H 1,50,000, whichever is lower, to the trust every year. Such contributions are recognised as an expense as and when incurred. The Company and its Indian\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsubsidiaries do not have any further obligations beyond this contribution.\n\nThe contributions recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss during the year on account of the above de/fined contribution plans  amounted  to H 1,752.94 crore  (2022-23: H 1,611.21 crore).\n\n## B. De/fined bene/fit plans\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans operated by the Group are as below:\n\n## (a) Provident fund and pension\n\nProvident  fund  benefits  provided  under  plans wherein contributions are made to an irrevocable trust set up by the Company/Indian subsidiaries to manage the investments and distribute the amounts  entitled  to  employees  are  treated  as a defined benefit plan as the Company/Indian subsidiaries are obligated to provide the members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered  provident  fund.  A  part  of  the Company's/Indian  subsidiaries'  contribution  is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company/ Indian subsidiaries and the shortfall of interest, if  any,  are  recognised  as  an  expense  in  the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss under employee bene/fits expense.\n\nIn accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities of Company and its Indian subsidiaries based on guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, other than the amounts recognised during the year ended March 31, 2024 in respect of the Company  and  one  subsidiary  of H 5.27 crore (2022-23: H 6.67 crore), out of which H 0.46 crore (2022-23: H 1.61 crore) has been recognised within consolidated statement of Pro/fit and loss and H 4.81 crore (2022-23: H 5.06 crore) has been recognised within other comprehensive income, there is no de/ficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nguaranteed  rate  of  interest  of  Government administered provident fund.\n\nKey assumptions used for actuarial valuation are as below:\n\n|                                         | Year ended March 31, 2024   | Year ended March 31, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Discount rate                           | 7.00%                       | 7.10% - 7.50%               |\n| Guaranteed rate  of return              | 8.15% - 8.25%               | 7.20% - 8.15%               |\n| Expected rate  of return on  investment | 7.55% - 8.15%               | 8.10% - 8.15%               |\n\n## (b) Retiring gratuity\n\nThe  Company  and  its  Indian  subsidiaries  have an obligation towards gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit retirement  plan  covering  eligible  employees as per The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The plan  provides  for  a  lump-sum  payment  to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of /five years of service. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries make annual contributions  to  gratuity  funds  established  as trusts or insurance companies. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries accounts for the liability for gratuity bene/fits payable in the future based on a year end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (c) Post-retirement medical bene/fits\n\nUnder this unfunded scheme, employees of the Company  and  some  of  its  subsidiaries  receive medical  benefits  subject  to  certain  limits  on amounts of bene/fits, periods after retirement and types of bene/fits, depending on their grade and location  at  the  time  of  retirement.  Employees separated from the Company and its subsidiaries under an early separation scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The Company and such subsidiaries account for the liability for postretirement medical scheme based on a year-end actuarial valuation.\n\n## (d) Tata Steel Europe's pension plan\n\nTata Steel Europe (TSE), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, operates a number of de/fined bene/fit pension and post retirement schemes. The bene/fits o/ffered by these schemes are largely based on pensionable pay and years of service at retirement. With the exception of certain  unfunded  arrangements,  the  assets  of these schemes are held in administered funds that are legally separated from TSE. For those pension schemes set up under a trust, the trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the schemes bene/ficiaries in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant pension legislation. The trustees are generally responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund, after consulting with the sponsoring employer.\n\nTSE accounts for all pension and post-retirement defined benefit arrangements using Ind AS 19 'Employee Bene/fits', with independent actuaries being  used  to  calculate  the  costs,  assets  and liabilities to be recognised in relation to these schemes. The present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation, the current service cost and past service costs  are  calculated  by  these  actuaries  using the Projected unit credit method. However, the ongoing funding arrangements of each scheme, in place to meet their long-term pension liabilities, are governed by the individual scheme documentation and  national  legislation.  The  accounting  and disclosure requirements of Ind AS 19 'Employee bene/fits' do not a/ffect these funding arrangements.\n\nThe principal de/fined bene/fit pension scheme for TSUK is the British Steel Pension Scheme ('BSPS'), which is the main scheme for previous and present employees based in the UK. Bene/fits o/ffered by this scheme are based on /final earnings and years of service at retirement. The assets of this scheme are held in a separately administered fund.\n\nThe BSPS is the legacy de/fined bene/fit pension scheme in the UK and is closed to future accrual. The current Scheme is the successor to the old BSPS which entered a Pension Protection Fund ('PPF')assessment period in March 2018 following a  Regulated  Apportionment  Arrangement ('RAA') which separated the old BSPS from TSUK.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## NOTES\n\nforming part of the consolidated /financial statements\n\n## 36. Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nThe current Scheme was created on March 28, 2018 when 69% of the members of the old Scheme transferred into the current Scheme. The Scheme is sponsored by TSUK and currently has around 64,000 members of which 80% are pensioners with bene/fits in payment. Although TSUK has a legal obligation to fund any future de/ficit, a key condition of the new BSPS going forward was that it was su/fficiently well funded to meet the Scheme's modi/fied liabilities on a self-su/fficiency basis with a bu/ffer to cover residual risks.\n\nSince the Scheme came into existence, the BSPS Trustee and TSUK established a framework for dynamic de-risking as and when conditions were appropriate.  The  framework  provided  for  the parties  to  agree  to  partial  buy-in  transactions with one or more insurers over a period of time. In relation to this, the scheme completed its /first buy-in transaction in respect to a small portion of the overall liabilities during the year ended March 31, 2022. It has also completed two further buyin transactions during the year ended March 31, 2023 involving the purchase of annuities with an external insurer of the order of H 21,378.10 crore and H 20,406.37 crore in May 2022 and December 2022 respectively. On May 17, 2023 the BSPS completed a /final buy-in transaction with an external insurer with a value of the order of H 28,054.51 which ensures that the all liabilities of the Scheme are now fully insured. The funding levels secured as part of these arrangements will enable the Trustee to award a payment of 3% in order to restore an element of member bene/fits which were foregone as part of the RAA. The /final buy-in also included the purchase of an insurance policy on an 'all risks' basis whereby any risks for data cleanse items (e.g. impact of Guaranteed Minimum Pension and Barber equalisation) and residual risks (e.g. whether any members claim that their bene/fit calculations are incorrect) were passed on to the insurer.\n\nOn September 29, 2023 TSUK and the Scheme Trustee  signed  a  Deed  of  Amendment  that stipulated that the Trustee shall apply any surplus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nassets at the time of winding up of the Scheme to augment member bene/fits to the fullest extent possible after allowing for any expenses necessary to wind up the Scheme. The Deed set out both parties'  intentions  that  the  winding  up  of  the Scheme will take place as soon as all the tasks necessary to achieve this are completed. This is expected to take around three years. TSUK retains the sole power to decide whether to proceed to wind-up the Scheme and buy-out liabilities. At the date the Deed was signed TSUK performed an exercise that estimated the expected surplus of the Scheme at the earliest date a wind up was possible was likely to be around H 1,194.91 crore. As a result of the Deed, a past service cost equal to H 1,194.91 crore was recorded in the income statement in the current year.\n\nThe Deed of Amendment means that there is no longer an ability for TSUK to access any of the surplus of the Scheme. In accordance with Ind AS 19 an 'asset ceiling' has been applied to re/flect the fact that TSUK no longer has an unconditional right to a refund from the Scheme and the net surplus has been restricted to Nil on the Group's balance sheet from September 29, 2023.\n\nThe BSPS previously held an anti-embarrassment interest in TSUK agreed as part of the RAA entered into in 2017. The anti-embarrassment interest was initially 33.33% at the time of the RAA but was diluted to less than 1% due to successive equity issuances by TSUK to its parent company Corus Group Limited. In March 2024, BSPS transferred its anti-embarrassment interest to TSUK's parent company Corus Group Limited though the Scheme retains an economic interest in the value of those shares. No value has been included in the BSPS's assets as at March 31, 2024 (2023: Nil) for its interest in TSUK.\n\nAs at March 31, 2024 the Scheme had an Ind AS 19 surplus of Nil (March 31, 2023: 6,965.10). The surplus as at March 31, 2024 includes an asset ceiling of H 715.15 crore in order to restrict the surplus to Nil as TSUK no longer has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus from the Scheme.",

Employee bene/fits (Contd.)\n\nAs at March 31, 2021 valuation was agreed between TSUK and the BSPS Trustee on January 21, 2022. This was a surplus of H 5,176.70 crore on a Technical Provisions  (more  prudent)  basis  equating  to  a funding ratio of 105%. The agreed Schedule of Contributions  confirmed  that  neither  ordinary nor de/ficit recovery contributions are due from the Company. The next triennial valuation of the Scheme, which will take place as at March 31, 2024 is expected to show that the Scheme is fully funded on a solvency/buy-out basis and that no contributions are due from TSUK.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the scheme's liabilities as at March 31, 2024 was 11 years (March 31, 2023: 11 years).\n\n## (e) Other de/fined bene/fits\n\nOther bene/fits provided under unfunded schemes include  pension  payable  to  directors  on  their retirement, farewell gifts, post-retirement lumpsum benefit  and  reimbursement  of  packing  and transportation charges to the employees based on their last drawn salary.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit plans expose the Group to a number of actuarial risks as below:\n\n- (i) Investment  risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government/high quality bond yields. If the return on plan asset is below this rate, it will create a plan de/ficit.\n\n- (ii) Interest  risk: A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability. However, this will be partially o/ffset by an increase in the value of plan's debt investments.\n- (iii) Salary  risk: The present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (iv) Longevity  risk: The  present  value  of  the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by  reference  to  the  best  estimate  of  the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.\n- (v) In/flation risk: Some of the Group's Pension obligations are linked to in/flation, and higher in/flation will lead to higher liabilities although, in most cases, caps on the level of in/flationary increases are in place to protect the plan against extreme in/flation.",

The base table assumption is reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial funding valuations of the individual pension and post-retirement plans. For the BSPS the liability calculations as at March 31, 2024 use the Self-Administered Pension Schemes 3 (SAPS 3) base tables, S3PMA\\_M/S3PFA/S3DFA with the 2020 CMI projections with a 1.25% p.a. (2022-23: 1.25% p.a.) long-term trend applied from 2013 to 2021 (adjusted by a multiplier of 1.03 p.a. (2022-23: 1.03 p.a.) for males, 1.03 p.a. (2022-23: 1.03 p.a.) for females and 1.04 p.a. for female dependents (2022-23: 1.04 p.a). The future mortality improvements assumptions are typically updated with each release of an updated model. Future mortality improvements from 2021 onwards are allowed for in line with the 2022 CMI Projections with a long-term improvement trend of 1% (2023: 1%) per annum, a smoothing parameter of 7.0 (2023: 7.0), an initial addition parameter of 0% (2023: 0%) and a 0% (2023: nil) weight on mortality experience allowance for adopting w2020, a 0% (2023: 10%) weight on mortality experience allowance for adopting w2021 and a 25% allowance for adopting the w2022 parameter for excess deaths in the UK in the COVID-19 a/ffected years. This indicates that today's 65 year old male member is expected to live on average to approximately 86 years (2022-23: 86 years) of age and a male member reaching age 65 in 15 years' time is then expected to live on average to 86 years (2022-23: 87) of age.\n\n- (iv) Weighted average duration of the pension obligations is 11 years (March 31, 2023: 11 years).\n- (v) The Group expects to contribute Nil to the plan during the /financial year 2024-25.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As per the amended provision, stamp duty is levied equal to 15% of the average royalty that would accrue out of the highest annual extraction of minerals under the approved mining plan multiplied by the period of such mining lease.

The application for renewal was submitted by the Company within the stipulated time, but it remained pending consideration with the State and the mining operations were continued in terms of the prevailing law.\n\nBy a judgement of April 2014 in the case of Goa Mines, the Supreme Court took a view that second and subsequent renewal of mining lease can be e/ffected once the State considers the application and decides to renew the mining lease by issuing an express order. State of Jharkhand issued renewal order to the Company on December 31, 2014. The State, however, took a view on interpretation of Goa Mines judgement that the mining carried out after expiry of the period of second renewal was 'illegal' and hence, issued a demand notice of \u20b93,568.31 crore being the price of iron ore extracted. The said demand has been challenged by the Company before the Jharkhand High Court.\n\nThe mining operations were suspended from August 1, 2014.

This category consists of investments in quoted equity shares and mutual funds.\n\nValuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices). This level of hierarchy includes the Group's over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.\n\nValuation techniques with signi/ficant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes /financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. This level includes investment in unquoted equity shares and preference shares.",

Investments in equity and preference shares included in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have been valued using the cost approach to arrive at their fair value. Cost of unquoted equity instruments has been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value because of a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.\n- (iv) Fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price which is categorised as Level 1. Fair value of borrowings which do not have an active market or are unquoted is estimated by discounting the expected future cash /flows using a discount rate equivalent to the risk-free rate of return adjusted for credit spread considered by lenders for instruments of similar maturities which is categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n- (v) Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its /financial instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all /financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Group could have realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, fair value of /financial instruments subsequent to the reporting dates may be di/fferent from the amounts reported at each reporting date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## (d) Transfer of /financial assets\n\nThe Group transfers certain trade receivables under discounting  arrangements  with  banks/financial institutions. Some of such arrangements do not qualify for de-recognition due to recourse arrangements being in place. Consequently, the proceeds received from transfer are recorded as short-term borrowings from banks and /financial institutions. As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, there has been no such transfer of trade receivables.\n\n## (e) Financial risk management\n\nIn the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to /fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity  prices,  interest  rates,  equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely impact  the  fair  value  of  its  financial  instruments. Entities within the Group have a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the /financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of  Directors  of  the  respective  companies.  The  risk management framework aims to:\n\n- (i) create a stable business planning environment by reducing the impact of currency, commodity prices and interest rate /fluctuations on the entity's business plan.\n- (ii) achieve  greater  predictability  to  earnings  by determining the /financial value of the expected earnings in advance.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realisable fair values or in future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,  commodity  prices,  equity  price  fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with reasonable accuracy.\n\n## (a) Market risk - Foreign currency exchange rate risk:\n\nThe fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may  have  potential  impact  on  the  consolidated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstatement of profit and loss and equity, where any transaction  references  more  than  one  currency  or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective consolidated entities.\n\nConsidering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from /fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate to /fluctuations in US Dollar, Great British Pound, Euro, Singapore Dollar, and Thai Baht against the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nEntities as per their risk management policy, use foreign exchange forward and other derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. Any weakening of the functional currency may impact the respective entities' cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently may increase the cost of /financing the Group's capital expenditures.\n\nA 10% appreciation/depreciation of foreign currencies with respect to the functional currency of the entities within the Group would result in a decrease/increase in the Group's net pro/fit and equity before considering tax impacts by approximately H 2,179.34 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024, (2022-23: H 4,502.57 crore).\n\nThe foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by assuming a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the entities within the Group.\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  has  been  based  on  the composition of the Group's /financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 excluding trade payables, trade receivables, other derivative and nonderivative financial instruments not forming part of debt and which do not present a material exposure. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (b) Market risk - Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by using the cash /flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates. Any movement in the reference rates could have an impact on the Group's cash /flows as well as costs.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES\n\nforming part of the consolidated /financial statements\n\n## 40. Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\nThe Group is subject to variable interest rates on some of its interest bearing liabilities. The Group's interest rate exposure is mainly related to debt obligations.\n\nBased on the composition of debt as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would increase the Group's /finance costs (before considering interest eligible for capitalisation) and thereby consequently reduce net pro/fit and equity before  considering  tax  impacts  by  approximately H 425.09 crore  for  the  year  ended  March  31,  2024 (2022-23: H 340.60 crore).\n\nThe risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.\n\n## (c) Market risk - Equity price risk:\n\nEquity price risk is related to the change in market reference price of investments in equity securities held by the Group.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments held by the Group exposes the Group to equity price risks. In general, these investments are not held for trading purposes.\n\nThe fair value of quoted investments in equity classi/fied as fair value through other comprehensive income/pro/fit and loss as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 was H 1,999.94 crore and H 995.64 crore respectively.\n\nA 10% change in equity prices of such securities held as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 would result in an impact of H 199.99 crore and H 99.56 crore respectively on equity before considering tax impact.\n\n## (ii) Commodity risk\n\nThe Group makes use of commodity futures contracts and options to manage its purchase price risk for certain commodities. Across the Group, forward purchases are also made of zinc, tin and nickel to cover sales contracts with /fixed metal prices.\n\nThere was no significant market risk relating to the consolidated  statement  of  profit  and  loss  since  the majority of commodity derivatives are treated as cash /flow\n\nhedges with movements being re/flected in equity and the timing and recognition in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss would depend on the point at which the underlying hedged transactions are recognised.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of /financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of credit worthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nEntities  within  the  Group  have  a  policy  of  dealing only with credit worthy counter parties and obtaining su/fficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of /financial loss from defaults.\n\nFinancial instruments that are subject to credit risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade receivables,  loans  receivables,  investments  in  debt securities and mutual funds, balances with banks, bank deposits, derivatives and /financial guarantees provided by the Group. None of the /financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.\n\nThe carrying value of /financial assets represents the maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk was H 16,419.15 crore and H 24,760.25 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank deposits, investments in debt securities and mutual funds, loans, derivative assets and other /financial assets net of insurance cover, wherever applicable.\n\nThe risk relating to trade receivables is presented in note 15, page F191.\n\nThe Group's exposure to customers is diversi/fied and there is no concentration of credit risk with respect to any particular customer as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.\n\nIn  respect  of  financial  guarantees  provided  by  the Group to banks and /financial institutions, the maximum exposure which the Group is exposed to is the maximum amount which the Group would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at the end of the reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.",

Disclosures on /financial instruments (Contd.)\n\n## (iv)  Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet its /financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain su/fficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements.\n\nThe Group has obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks. Furthermore, the entities within the Group have access to undrawn lines of committed and uncommitted borrowing/facilities, funds from debt markets through commercial paper programs, non-convertible debentures and other debt instruments. The Group invests its surplus funds in bank /fixed deposits and in mutual funds, which carry no or low mark to market risk.

The Board of Directors of the Company at its meeting held on November 1, 2023, considered and approved the amalgamation of Bhubaneshwar Power Private Limited ('BPPL'), wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, into and with the Company, by way of scheme of amalgamation.\n- The scheme has been /filed with the Hyderabad bench of the NCLT and sanction is awaited, /filing of the scheme with the Mumbai bench of the NCLT has been dispensed with.\n- 49. Tata Steel Europe Limited ('TSE'), a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of the Company, is exposed to certain climate related risks which could a/ffect the estimates of its future cash /flow projections. The cash/flow projections include the impact of decarbonisation given that both the UK and Tata Steel Netherlands (TSN) businesses within TSE have stated their plans to move away from the current production process and to transition to electric arc based production. Decarbonisation as a whole is likely to provide signi/ficant opportunities to TSE as it is likely to increase the demand for steel as it is crucial as an infrastructure enabler for all technological transition within the wider economy ( e.g. wind power, hydrogen, electric vehicles, nuclear plants etc.) and compares favourably to other materials when considering the life cycle emissions of the material. The technology transition and investments are dependent on national and international policies and would also be driven by the government decisions in the country of operation. Management's assessment is that generally, these potential carbon reduction-related costs would be borne by the society, either through higher steel prices or through public spending/subsidies.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, Tata Steel UK Limited ('TSUK') which forms the main part of the UK Business, announced a joint agreement with the UK Government on a proposal to invest in state-of-the-art electric arc furnace ('EAF') steelmaking at the Port Talbot site with a capital cost of \u00a31.25 billion inclusive of a grant from the UK Government of up to \u00a3500 million, subject to relevant regulatory approvals, information and consultation processes, and the /finalisation of detailed terms and conditions. The proposal also includes a wider restructuring of other locations and functions across TSUK.\n\nConsequent to the announcement, during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company had assessed and concluded that it had created a valid expectation to those a/ffected and a constructive obligation existed. Accordingly, on a prudent basis, the Company had recorded a provision of H 2,425 crore towards such restructuring and closure costs (including redundancy and employee termination costs) and H 2,631 crore towards impairment of Heavy End assets which were not expected to be used for any signi/ficant period beyond March 31, 2024, in the consolidated statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\nAs per local regulations in the UK, the National Consultation between TSUK and the UK multi trade union representative body (UK Steel Committee) on the asset closure plan has now been concluded. Under the proposed re-structuring programme, Port Talbot's two blast furnaces (No.5 and No.4) would get closed by end of June 2024 and latest by the end of September 2024 respectively. Following the closure of Blast Furnace No. 4, the remaining heavy end assets would wind down and the Continuous Annealing Processing Line (CAPL) would close in March 2025. TSUK has also agreed that it would continue to operate the hot strip mill through the proposed transition period and in future.\n\nGiven the risks, challenges and uncertainties associated with the underlying market and business conditions including higher in/flation, higher interest rates and supply chain disruption caused by the war in Ukraine, the uncommitted nature of available /financing options and pending the /finalisation of funding support from the UK Government for the proposed EAF investment, there exists a material uncertainty surrounding the impact of such adversities on the /financial situation of TSUK.\n\nWith respect to Tata Steel Netherland operations (TSN) which forms main part of the Mainland Europe (MLE) business, discussions with the government on the proposed decarbonisation roadmap have been initiated. The transition plan considers that the policy environment in the Netherlands and EU is supportive to the European steel industry and a level playing /field would be achieved by, either one or a combination of: a) Dutch Policy developments, b) Convergence with EU on (/fiscal) climate measures, enabling EU steel players to pass on costs and c) tailor made support mechanisms. In relation to the likely investments required for the de-carbonisation of TSN operations driven by regulatory changes in Europe and\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has assessed its ability to meet any liquidity requirements at TSE, if required, and concluded that its cash/flow and liquidity position remains adequate.\n\nWithin the European Operations, wherever impairment triggers existed, the recoverable amount of the CGUs have been assessed based on fair value less costs of disposal, which inter-alia considers impact of switching the heavy end and other relevant assets to a more 'Green Steel' capex base. The fair value computation uses cash /flow forecasts based on most recent /financial budgets, strategic forecasts and future projections taking the analysis out into perpetuity based on a steady state, sustainable cash /flow re/flecting average steel industry conditions between successive peaks and troughs of pro/fitability. Key assumptions for the FVLCTS model relate to expected changes to selling prices and raw material & conversion costs, EU steel demand, energy costs, exchange rates, the amount of capital expenditure needed for decarbonisation, changes to EBITDA resulting from producing and selling steel with low embedded CO 2 emissions, levels of government support for decarbonisation, phasing of decommissioning of legacy assets as well as the commissioning of new low CO 2 production facilities, tari/ff regimes and discount rates. The projections are based on both past performance and the expectations of future performance and assumptions therein. The Group estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that re/flect the current market rates adjusted to re/flect the way the European Union steel market would assess the speci/fic risk. The weighted average post-tax discount rates used for discounting the cash /flows projections is in the range of 8.20% - 9.11% (March 31, 2023: 7.90% to 8.80%). Beyond the speci/fically forecasted period, a growth rate in the range of Nil - 2.00% (March 31, 2023: 1.70% - 2.00%) is used to extrapolate the cash /flow projections. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.\n\nThe Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of the carrying value in respect of Group's CGUs and property, plant and equipment including sensitivity in respect of discount rates. If any of the key assumptions change, there is a risk that the headroom in the model would reduce and that the reduction in the headroom could lead to impairments of carrying amount of property, plant and equipment. However, the Group believes that key assumptions represent the most likely impact from decarbonisation at this point in time. Going forward, the key assumptions would be kept under review for changes, if any, based on the progress of the discussions with the government and regulators on the decarbonisation plan.\n\n50. Consequent to the whistle-blower complaint in the Company's Graphene Business Division, the Company has carried out a detailed assessment and review of the matter and made the accounting adjustments/provisions, as appropriate, in the books of account, which were not material to the /financial statements. Based on the assessment(s) and review, it has been concluded that there has not been any fraud under Section 447 of the Companies Act, 2013. A report under sub-section (12) of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 has been /filed by the statutory auditors in Form ADT-4 as prescribed under Rule 13 of Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014 with the Central Government.",

With e/ffect from April 1, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate A/ffairs (MCA) has made it mandatory for every company incorporated in India, which uses accounting software for maintaining its books of account, to use only such accounting software which has a feature of recording audit trail of each and every transaction, creating an edit log of each change made in books of account along with the date when such changes were made and ensuring that the audit trail cannot be disabled.\n- The Company uses multiple accounting software including SAP HANA Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software to maintain its books of accounts. Implementation of the above noti/fication to ensure enabling appropriate audit log on /financial tables in aforesaid SAP HANA, which have high frequency database operations would lead to a severe system performance degradation thereby adversely impacting business operations and users, besides requiring signi/ficant additional storage and supporting infrastructure.\n\nWith a view to address the above challenges while ensuring compliance with the MCA noti/fication and mitigate the risks involved therein, the Company has appropriately designed and implemented alternate mitigating controls over direct change at database level.\n\n## 52.
