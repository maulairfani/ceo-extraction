Li\u00e8s\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe world around us continues to undergo dramatic change with risks becoming more complex and unpredictable.\n\nThe social, economic and environmental challenges we all face are being exacerbated by greater geopolitical turmoil - and war. And this year, with almost half the world's population set to vote in elections, there may be more uncertainty as new governments, new leaders and a new set of policies are potentially ushered on to the world stage.\n\nThe world is a volatile place. But Zurich has shown time and time again - that we prosper during periods of volatility. Our business has endured world wars, natural disasters, financial crises and pandemics, yet we have continued to thrive.\n\n9\n\n## Adapt and grow\n\nThe ability to adapt is essential if you want to continue to grow during these challenging times. This requires building resilience in your business and leveraging the strength, flexibility and resourcefulness of your people.\n\nAt Zurich, thankfully, we are risk specialists with great expertise and experience in resilience. We are committed to enhancing the resilience of our customers and the communities we serve, too. We gladly share our risk expertise, contribute to fostering an understanding of risks among the public, businesses and governments, and actively collaborate on preventive measures with these stakeholders.\n\nTo adapt and grow during periods of volatility also requires responding positively to challenges. I said this in my message last year, but it is worth repeating in the current global context: you can find strength in adversity and opportunity within risk.\n\nAnd in times of adversity, you will also find us. We know that our customers look to us during turbulent periods. One thing that you can be certain of during uncertain times is that Zurich will be here to support you, to guide you and to protect you.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichel M.

The actions are paying off, with natural catastrophe losses within the guided range for the full-year 2023, despite severe flooding and hailstorms in Europe during the third quarter.\n\nThe first year in Zurich's 2023-2025 financial cycle has yielded exceptional results: our highest ever business operating profit (BOP) of USD 7.4 billion.\n\nThis strong set of results was driven by all of Zurich's businesses. Zurich's Commercial Insurance business has made great strides in improving its profitability, by focusing on underwriting discipline, ensuring a balanced portfolio, and simplifying customer and broker interactions through enhanced connectivity and data analytics capabilities. Zurich's Retail business continues to improve as the 2023 accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved. In Retail, Zurich's customer retention rate has remained stable over the past years, with customer loyalty improving despite rate increases. Zurich has also improved its brand consideration ranking in eight markets since 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese results are a testament to the strength of our strategy.\n\nMario Greco Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Property & Casualty (P&C)\n\nP&C business operating profit (BOP) of USD 3.9 billion rose 7 percent in U.S. dollars compared with the prior year. This was mainly driven by the increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the investment result. The combined ratio remained stable year-over-year at 94.5 percent as Commercial maintained strong returns.\n\n## Life\n\nThe Life business delivered a very strong performance in the year, with an all-time high BOP of USD 2.1 billion, 39 percent higher than in the prior year in U.S. dollar terms, with top-line growth across all parts of the business. The excellent results reflect the ongoing successful execution of the Group's Life strategy that focuses on protection and capital-light savings business. Top-line growth was strong in all parts of the business, contributing to profit growth.\n\n10",

The baseline for the 2023-2025 EPS growth target was the assured achievement of the 2020-2022 target of a compound earnings per share growth rate of 5% (i.e. EPS of USD 32.1).\n\n## Farmers\n\nFarmers achieved strong growth, reflecting successful management actions in 2023. Farmers BOP rose 10 percent to USD 2.3 billion. Farmers Management Services BOP grew 10 percent compared with the prior year. Farmers Exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders, 1 achieved 5 percent growth in gross written premiums on an underlying basis, excluding the commercial rideshare business. Rate actions have contributed to growth in most books of business. The combined ratio for the fourth quarter was better than expected, falling to 89.8 percent.\n\n## Enhancing customer experience\n\nOver the last three years, Zurich has invested USD 1.8 billion on technology, mostly focused on digitalizing the business and improving efficiency and customer experience.\n\n## Employee satisfaction surges in Germany\n\nIncluding employees in shaping strategy and culture has helped Zurich Germany boost its employee satisfaction scores. The country's leadership team earned the lowest overall score on the employee net promoter score (ENPS) survey of the whole Group in 2017, with an ENPS of -62. By October 2022, employee satisfaction jumped 126 points to +64, compared with the\n\n2017 score. Listening to employees and giving them the chance to help shape new attitudes, a leadership code of conduct as well as decision-making processes helped to create the turnaround.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor instance, 89 percent of Zurich's retail quotes are now digitalized. Zurich is also leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in more than 160 use cases providing advanced data insights to help underwriters, risk engineers and claims adjusters take better-informed decisions. Zurich strengthened its workforce with digital capabilities through an extensive upskilling program and the recruitment of more than 1,000 digital technology specialists with critical skills, in areas such as data analytics, AI, cyber security and cloud computing.\n\n## Industry-leading shareholder return\n\nThis result puts Zurich in an excellent position for further growth and is a testament to the strength of its strategy, which allows the Group to return more than USD 5 billion to its shareholders.\n\n- 1  Zurich Insurance Group has no ownership interest in the Farmers Exchanges. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as its attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services.\n- 2  Total shareholder return in U.S. dollars (from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2023). Peers include Allianz, AXA, Chubb, Generali, Travelers (unweighted average). Source: Datastream.\n- 3  Based on year-end exchange rates, i.e., 1 CHF = 1.1874 USD as of Dec.31, 2023 and 1 CHF = 1.0813 USD as of Dec. 31, 2022.\n\n11\n\n## Serving customers with Zurich One\n\nZurich One is a mobile-first customer portal that redefines the customer experience. Customers have access to features for managing personal data, policies, filing claims and tracking their status. The portal has been developed centrally, is customized to local needs and is being rolled out to retail customers across the Group, beginning with Italy and Switzerland in 2023.\n\nGenerating industry-leading shareholder returns is one of Zurich's key ambitions, which is evidenced by its attractive dividend policy. Since 2016, Zurich has generated a shareholder return of 16 percent per annum. This compares favorably with the 9 percent annual shareholder return delivered by leading peers during the same period. 2 In light of these record results and strong capital position, Zurich proposes an 8 percent dividend increase to CHF 26, a 19 percent increase in U.S. dollars. 3 Zurich plans to supplement the ordinary dividend with a share buyback of up to CHF 1.1 billion.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nCustomer focus, simplification and innovation will be a compass for the business through our 2023-2025 financial cycle, which aims to deliver our most ambitious targets yet. It was this strategy which enabled Zurich to set - then exceed ambitious financial targets in 2017-2022, and it is this strategy which will serve us in years to come.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMario Greco\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer",

This includes commercial auto, property, liability, specialty, and workers' compensation products, as well as personal lines insurance, such as motor and home coverage. We receive premium payments and pay claims. Additionally, we invest the premium payments to generate returns and further support our insurance operations.\n\nOur Life business offers life insurance products that provide financial protection to individuals and their families in the event of the policyholder's death or other specified events. We receive premium payments and when required pay out a predetermined sum of money to the designated beneficiaries.

That is why we manage our assets responsibly and do this by integrating environmental, social and governance factors in our investment decisions.\n\nAs trusted long-term partners, we stay close to our customers to better understand their individual needs and, where possible, equip them with the right tools to navigate any challenges they face. We have deployed technology throughout the organization to improve how we engage with our customers and support our underwriters in providing a superior service.

Depending on the market, our presence stretches back for decades, or more than 100 years, or even for the entire length of our 150-year history!\n\n## What are you aiming to achieve across the region?\n\nAM: Our EMEA priority is to serve more customers across a broader range of their needs, outperforming market growth profitably, of course. That's true for all our segments, whether that's commercial insurance, mid-market, retail personal lines, small-medium enterprises, life protection or any other line of business.\n\n## How are you going to do that?\n\nAM: A big focus is on continuously taking actions to increase our relevance for customers and enhance their overall experience. I'm very proud of the improvements we've made, which we measure through the transactional net promoter score (TNPS), currently standing at almost 61 1 across the region.\n\nAnd we don't stop at improving customer experience, we're focused on increasing our distribution capacity and effectiveness by transforming our agents' capabilities, broadening our broker networks and growing our partnerships. Our distributors are often the first line of delivery for our customers, so we do everything we can to ensure they have the tools and capabilities they need to succeed.\n\n## Increasing customer satisfaction in Switzerland and Germany\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Transactional net promoter system (TNPS) scores provide us with feedback on our performance from the viewpoint of our customers and deliver insight on how specific interactions affect their experience\n\n## What do you think is key to that delivery?\n\nAM: Our people. They are the heart and soul of how we support and protect our customers and are the greatest asset we have. Ensuring we provide our people with a top-class employee value proposition, including great career opportunities, enables us to have more confidence in our execution. Our use of technology is another critical factor - whether simplifying activities for our employees, enabling better risk insights with artificial intelligence (AI), or improving our customers' or distributors' experience through automation.\n\n## How do you help customers be more sustainable?\n\nAM: We're committed to supporting our customers on their sustainability journeys, whether individuals or companies. For example, Zurich Resilience Solutions helps commercial customers and public authorities understand what longer-term investment decisions they need to mitigate physical risks, build resilience and manage the transition of their business model to be more sustainable. These services are highly valuable for our customers as they build future resilience in their businesses. Another example is providing opportunities for customers to invest in sustainable funds, enabling them to save for the future in a way aligned to their own values and interests.\n\n19",

As a premier commercial carrier with strong market positioning, we have continued to see good growth in our National Accounts business, and we see clear opportunities in our Canada, Middle Market, and Accident & Health businesses. The distributor landscape also continues to transform in this region. This puts Zurich North America (ZNA) in a position to closely align with national and regional distribution partners. We've spent the last several years reshaping and balancing a diverse portfolio ZNA aims to continue this momentum for long-term profitable growth.\n\n## What is ZNA doing to help customers protect themselves from natural disasters?\n\nKT: We've conducted numerous post-event reviews of weather-related disasters ranging from hurricanes to wildfires around the world, as well as in the U.S. and Canada. To study these events, we use our Post Event Review Capability approach, an open-source methodology designed to evaluate how natural hazard events turn into community disasters and to provide practical recommendations that promote community resilience.\n\nZurich Resilience Solutions continues to protect clients by prioritizing core services and expanding new ones - including cyber resilience, carbon advisory, business and workforce resilience, and supporting the global expansion of ESG services.\n\nFinally, we continue to make investments in our underwriters and underwriting expertise - realized through strong training fundamentals, remarkable talent, and technology capabilities.\n\n## What new products and innovations have entered the market?\n\nKT: Parametric insurance is an innovative type of insurance contract that insures a policyholder against the occurrence of a specific event by paying a set amount based on the magnitude of the event, as opposed to the magnitude of the losses in a traditional indemnity policy. Zurich's Construction Weather Parametric Insurance provides non-damage business interruption coverage to financial/economic losses due to weather-related events during the construction of a property. This protects the construction industry from changes in climate that can impede construction.\n\nZurich Brio, a recently launched partner-toconsumer retail model, uses distribution partnerships to access individual customers, to whom we can deliver a suite of propositions to better protect their health, family, and the things that matter most to them. Through 2024-2025, our primary focus will be customers who are burdened by the rising cost of healthcare due to lack of affordable access of high deductible major medical plans. Over time, Zurich Brio is expected to evolve and grow as new solutions are added from a variety of our business units.\n\n## What is ZNA doing to promote and manage a diverse talent pool?\n\nKT: We're doing a number of things. One of our most successful initiatives is apprenticeships. They create new, more inclusive career pathways and bring great value to our business and customers. Of all of Zurich's talent channels, the apprenticeship program attracts the most diverse talent in terms of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Successful apprentices at Zurich have included veterans of the armed forces, people who want to move from a service sector job to an in-service career, parents returning to the workforce after a hiatus and high school graduates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping businesses prevent cyber threats with SpearTip\n\nZurich expanded its cyber risk mitigation services through the acquisition of SpearTip, a cyber counterintelligence firm that helps protect clients against cyber threats through proactive and response services.

The key to success is to embrace the uniqueness of each market while fostering strategic alignment and a shared purpose.\n\nOur markets are empowered to do what's right for our customers, employees, communities and other local stakeholders. I spend a lot of time articulating the Group's strategy to colleagues and stakeholders in the region, providing context for individual markets and identifying synergies that allow us to accelerate across the businesses.\n\n## How are you realizing the opportunities that Asia Pacific presents for Zurich?\n\nTN: Asia Pacific is characterized by large markets with strong economic growth and significant middle-class expansion, which contribute to a higher demand for insurance. Coupled with this, the region is witnessing rapid urbanization and technological development which intensifies the need for diverse risk management offerings and solutions - from retail consumers to large corporates.\n\nBy leveraging digital technologies and innovating our offerings, we can reach untapped markets and segments, including underserved or unserved populations. As part of Zurich, we have the advantage of learning from other global markets and benefit from Zurich's unparalleled breadth and depth in terms of leading insurance solutions and prevention services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Entering Indian general insurance market with Kotak Mahindra Bank\n\nZurich announced a strategic alliance with Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited, India's third largest private sector bank by market capitalization, through the proposed acquisition of a 70 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra General Insurance Company Limited, subject to regulatory approval. Zurich's global scale and expertise, combined with Kotak Mahindra Group's deep knowledge of the Indian market and leading financial services platform, will accelerate the development of the business to build a premier Indian general insurer.\n\n## How is digitalization and AI impacting your region?\n\nTN: Technology is fundamentally changing the way we conduct business. This is particularly true in Asia Pacific, which comprises some of the most advanced digital societies in the world.\n\nDigitalization and AI will be key drivers of growth, competitiveness and innovation. We are streamlining our processes, making operations more efficient and using data to improve risk selection and pricing - but the real battleground for the next few years is customer experience. It's very exciting to think about opportunities to increase the relevance and awareness of insurance by transforming the quality, accessibility and affordability of the products and services we offer.\n\n## What's the vision for Zurich's presence in the region?\n\nTN: We see the region as offering significant long-term opportunity and are focused on building reach and scale across Asia Pacific to make it a key growth engine for the Group over time. Zurich is already established as one of the biggest foreign insurers in the region servicing more than 10 million customers. We see strong opportunities to grow our platform in both Property & Casualty (P&C) and Life. Building on previous acquisitions in Australia and Indonesia, we recently announced our intention to enter the Indian P&C market, which is a key strategic step in building our franchise in the region. Ultimately our ambition is to be the insurer and employer of choice in the markets we operate in.\n\n21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We see significant long-term opportunity.\n\nTulsi Naidu CEO Asia Pacific\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insurance penetration stands at only 3.1 percent of GDP, compared to 10.5 percent in the U.S.\n\n## Rewarding customer loyalty\n\nOur new loyalty program, Mundo Zurich, represents Zurich's commitment to the physical, emotional and financial wellbeing of its communities. Policyholders now enjoy complimentary access more than 20 tailored solutions, including telemedicine, simplified quoting for healthcare and exclusive discounts.\n\nIn 2023, our thriving community surpassed 185,000 users, with a robust 23% monthly engagement rate reflecting the impact of free benefits offered by Mundo Zurich.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis potential is coupled with a mature and developed insurance environment across the region, including a robust legal and regulatory framework and a strong mix of distribution channels, including agents, brokers, partners, banks and affinities. This makes Latin America an exciting region full of opportunity for Zurich.\n\n## Where do you see growth opportunities for the current cycle?\n\nLM: We are the third largest insurance player in the region, but there are further opportunities for growth. The Retail segment offers significant potential as we can increase our footprint across all geographies through our agent and broker channels. Our strong track record in Brazil's affinity channel can be rolled out across the region, while there's potential through non-traditional channels that target new customer segments.\n\nIn Commercial Insurance, we're focused on protecting our existing leadership position, pursuing selective growth opportunities and improving the customer value proposition. Through Zurich Resilience Solutions, we're also providing these customers with a range of services to support them in their business and transition challenges.\n\nIn Life, we are leveraging our expertise in Argentina and Chile to accelerate growth and development in other parts of the region. Meanwhile, in the Corporate Life & Pensions segment, we're adding new services and developing B2B2E platforms to improve the benefits provided to employees covered by our policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Latin America is an exciting region full of opportunity.\n\nLaurence Maurice CEO Latin America\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How do you engage customers and build loyalty in a highly intermediated market?\n\nLM: Most of our customer acquisition is intermediated by banks, affinities, brokers and partners. But we manage all other key steps in the customer journey, including post sales services, renewals and claims.\n\nWe are digitizing all these touchpoints to allow our customers and intermediaries to choose their preferred method of communication and servicing. Marketing campaigns are tailored to cater to the unique needs, demands and preferences of our customers. In Chile, for example, 185,000 customers have signed up to our new loyalty program, Mundo Zurich. This has all contributed to a 16-point increase in our customer TNPS over the past two years.\n\n## How are you supporting customers to achieve their sustainability goals?\n\nLM: We are developing sustainable products and services to help our customers in their transition and sustainable journeys. We launched 15 new sustainable offerings across Property & Casualty and Life during 2023. For instance, Seguro Planeta is a new specialist cover for hybrid and electric vehicles we launched in Ecuador; and Zurich Eco Cargo was introduced in Colombia for freight transporters, it compensates for CO2 emissions by planting trees in the Colombian Amazon. We also rolled out Property Solar Panels and Property Renewables coverages in Brazil, and nomADN in Argentina, which insures sustainable urban mobility - from bicycles to skateboards.",

With the installation of an innovative ground water harvesting system, ZNA is using far less water from the municipal water supply in addition to cutting costs. The cooling towers use 5 million gallons of water annually to cool the 783,000-square-foot facility. In order to reduce the amount of purchased water used in the cooling process, Zurich needed to harvest a significant amount of groundwater and used a sump located under ZNA's parking structure to channel groundwater through a storm sewer system. The result is an estimated daily saving of 14,400 gallons of treated water, or the equivalent of the annual water consumption of 45 households.\n\n## 14,400 gallons\n\nof treated water saved every day\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Case study\n\n## Putting hydrogen on the road\n\nZurich Switzerland is the insurance partner of H2Energy and supports the company's goal of establishing hydrogen produced from renewable energy as a cornerstone of the energy system.

These actions have led to four consecutive quarters of combined ratio improvement and an improved capital position of the Exchanges through improved organic surplus generation. To help foster a stronger Exclusive Agent channel, FGI acquired three brokerages from the Exchanges and introduced Farmers \u00ae Choice, a new initiative that gives consumers more coverage options while providing additional revenue opportunities for agents. Farmers Group, Inc. also agreed to reinsure the in-force individual life insurance book of Farmers New World Life Insurance Company with a third-party insurer.\n\n- 1  Zurich has no ownership interest in the Farmers Exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders.

Yet many businesses fail to attract autistic talent, or have recruitment processes that exclude them. In Austria and the UK, Zurich has made adjustments to the job interviewing process to attract neurodivergent talent. And in 2021, Zurich signed a global service agreement with auticon, a social enterprise and IT/ data consultancy, which exclusively recruits autistic consultants.

In the past four years alone it has transformed the lives of more than 15 million people. 1\n\nTo coincide with its 100th anniversary, Zurich created the Zurich Jubilee Foundation in 1973, formalizing its charitable work via a main vehicle. The Zurich Jubilee Foundation was renamed the Z Zurich Foundation in 2008 and has expanded over the years to respond to the growing needs of society worldwide. This could not have been done without the commitment of Zurich employees to their communities.\n\nThe 2023 anniversary was therefore a special year for the Z Zurich Foundation. It built on this milestone by launching special engagement initiatives for Zurich employees worldwide. To recognize the positive actions they undertake around the world, the Z Zurich Foundation recognized 50 individuals who are going above and beyond to support their communities through its Community Hero Award scheme. Each winner received a charitable donation to give away to increase their impact.\n\n- 1  The final and audited 2023 figures will be disclosed in the Z Zurich Foundation's Impact Report, which will be published in June 2024. You can already find more information about Z Zurich Foundation's work in 2023 in our Sustainability Highlights (www.zurich.com/sustainability/highlights-2023).\n\nIn 2023, Zurich employees' community support reached unprecedented levels. Employees recorded more than 146,000 hours of volunteering, up nearly 20 percent compared with 2022, and raised CHF 4.8 million (including matching from the Z Zurich Foundation) to help causes worldwide.\n\nThe year was also marked with significant developments of the strategic pillars of the Z Zurich Foundation, with about 50 new multi-year programs across the globe approved, some of which will start in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, the Z Zurich Foundation's Board of Trustees also approved the acceleration strategy of the Z Zurich Foundation for the next 12 years, starting with an initial four-year plan from 2024 to 2027.

Even when floods cannot be prevented, their impact can be significantly reduced. In Central Java, Indonesia, together with Mercy Corps and the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance, the Z Zurich Foundation is making a tangible difference in communities - supporting them in safeguarding lives and livelihoods and working together to build a more resilient future.

We are convinced that prevention campaigns for mental wellbeing can benefit hundreds of thousands of people worldwide by focusing on promoting positive mental health and wellbeing practices, educating individuals about self-care and stress reduction and building resilience. In 2023, as part of a broader collaboration with UNICEF, the Z Zurich Foundation continued to support the OnMyMind global campaign, which launched new content, such as a video by young influencer and spoken word poet Taz.

As a result, the Z Zurich Foundation provides tailored immediate support and also considers the evolution of the needs of those affected. For example, when earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria, the Z Zurich Foundation worked with local Zurich teams and existing collaborators to launch mental wellbeing assistance. This has helped address young people's mental wellbeing following the disaster.\n\nWith the launch of its next strategy cycle in 2024, the 'responding to crisis' activities of the Z Zurich Foundation will be part of its core thematic pillars, alongside 'adapting to climate change,' 'improving mental wellbeing' and 'enabling social equity.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n29",

It is no surprise that the Global Risks Report 2024 developed by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with Zurich - ranks 'adverse outcomes from AI technologies' among the top risks that concern the world.\n\nAt Zurich, we believe AI, like many emerging and fast-moving technologies, poses both significant opportunities and risks to our business and to our customers. We are already leveraging the benefits by using AI to improve claims processing, risk modeling and customer service and have plans to introduce new generative AI technologies to further enhance underwriting, risk engineering and agent support.\n\nBut there are also potential risks that may have profound impacts across all sectors of society. It means the response to these risks cannot only be led by technologists but shaped by everyone. It is why the Board considers the business opportunities and risks of AI carefully. AI poses a threat to data privacy and security, it could cause societal issues through job displacement, and there are ethical concerns that need to be thoroughly examined.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Zurich has introduced technical controls and an AI Assurance Framework that is aligned with the OECD AI Principles and built on the foundations of transparency, fairness and accountability.\n\n## Future-proofing our governance and reporting\n\nThe AI Assurance Framework further strengthens our governance and along with our recently updated sustainability framework, ensures we have a long-term view of the emerging risks that may impact our business and customers.\n\nBesides the future of AI, climate change remains perhaps the most complex risk society is facing today. For the first time, our shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on our sustainability report at our next annual general meeting (AGM) on April 10, 2024. This new requirement under the Swiss Code of Obligations will strengthen shareholder rights. But it also meets our goal to further improve transparency and to demonstrate the importance of sustainability reporting.\n\nTo ensure the Board continues to have the skills necessary to anticipate the risks and opportunities in today's ever-changing global environment, succession planning is a key consideration. This is why, following a thorough selection process, the Board proposes to shareholders that they elect John Rafter as a new Board member. John will contribute to the Board's diverse skill set with his background in finance and accounting and in-depth knowledge of the insurance industry.\n\nMeanwhile, after 12 years on the Board of Directors, Dame Alison Carnwath will not stand for reelection at the next AGM. On behalf of the Board and the Zurich management team, I would like to thank Alison for her dedication to the role. Throughout her mandate, Alison has shaped Board discussions as Audit Committee Chair and as a valued Board member.\n\n## Board changes\n\nAfter 12 years on the Board, Dame Alison Carnwath will not stand for reelection at the next AGM on April 10, 2024. The Board proposes to shareholders the reelection of all other current members, and the election of John Rafter as a new Board member.\n\n## Geopolitical uncertainty\n\nAt this moment in time, it is impossible to ignore the increasingly precarious geopolitical landscape. Russia's war in Ukraine appears to have no end in sight, while turmoil in Israel and Gaza has the potential to further escalate across the Middle East with global ramifications.\n\nThe year 2024 will also be a year of key elections, including those in India, the UK, the EU, South Africa and then the U.S. presidential election in November. The outcomes will shape the geopolitical and economic environment throughout the second half of the decade and have a huge impact on global issues such as climate change and the future of AI. In fact, AI has the potential to influence the results of these elections through disinformation using the mass production of false messaging and the creation of fake images and videos. It further highlights how risks are interconnected.\n\nThe global risk landscape continues to become more complex and unpredictable. But we excel at managing risk during periods of volatility. Our customers will look to us to protect and guide them through these uncertain times. And our sound corporate governance frameworks, combined with good decisionmaking, will ensure we remain a beacon of stability.\n\nThank you for your continued trust, support and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichel M.

        "page_content": "## Group governance\n\n## Our commitment to effective corporate governance\n\nThe Zurich Insurance Group, consisting of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (ZIG) and its subsidiaries (the Group or Zurich), is committed to effective corporate governance for the benefit of its shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders based on the principles of fairness, transparency and accountability. Structures, rules and processes are designed to enable proper conduct of business by defining the powers and responsibilities of its corporate bodies and employees. Our structures provide for checks and balances and institutional separation between the Board and the Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) as well as the Executive Committee (ExCo) which together are responsible for managing the Group on a day-to-day basis.\n\nZurich's corporate governance principles are described in a number of corporate documents, in particular in ZIG's articles of association (Articles of Association) and ZIG's organizational rules (Organizational Rules) (www.zurich.com/about-us/ corporate-governance/corporate-documents). Zurich also complies with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance (Swiss Code of Best Practice) issued by economiesuisse. The Board's Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee (GNSC) regularly reviews the Group's corporate governance against best practice standards.\n\nEffective corporate governance is complemented by a remuneration system that fosters the right behaviors. Information on remuneration, shareholdings and loans to Board and ExCo members is contained in the remuneration report (see pages 76 to 113).\n\n## Supervision\n\nZurich is subject to insurance group supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). The Swiss insurance regulation requires Swiss insurance companies and groups to establish and maintain strong governance and risk management systems, as well as effective internal control systems appropriate to their business activities. It prescribes the calculation of a risk-based solvency margin on a Group-wide basis and at legal entity level pursuant to the Swiss Solvency Test (SST). Amongst others, all material intra-group transactions must be reported to FINMA. In addition to the group supervision exercised by FINMA and its insurance supervision of the legal entities Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, Zurich Life Insurance Company Ltd, Zurich Reinsurance Company Ltd and Orion Legal Expenses Insurance Ltd., the insurance and other financial services subsidiaries of the Group are subject to the respective local financial market regulations.\n\n## Operational Group structure\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd, the Group's listed holding company, is a corporation organized under Swiss law with registered offices at c/o Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, Mythenquai 2, 8002 Zurich. Zurich's business is focused on providing best-in-class property and casualty, and life insurance products and services to individuals, small businesses, mid-sized and large companies.\n\nThe operational structure reflects the businesses operated by the Group and how these are strategically run to offer different products and services to specific customer groups.

Further information on ZIG's shares can also be found under: www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares.\n\n## Capital band and contingent share capital\n\nOn April 6, 2023, the AGM approved a capital band to replace the authorized share capital. Until and including April 6, 2028, the Board is authorized under the capital band to conduct one or more increases and/or reductions of the share capital within the upper limit of CHF 18,917,751.50, corresponding to 189,177,515 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, and the lower limit of CHF 13,541,415.00, corresponding to 135,414,150 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each (art. 5 bis of the Articles of Association). The upper limit of the capital band corresponds to about 129.3 percent and the lower limit of the capital band corresponds to about 92.5 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2023. Share issuances from capital band where the shareholders' subscription rights are restricted or excluded are limited to 14,600,000 shares (i.e., about 10 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2023).\n\nFurthermore, the share capital of ZIG may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 2,992,160 by issuing up to 29,921,600 fully paid-in registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each by the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion and/or option rights, which are granted in connection with the issuance of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'financial instruments') by ZIG or one of its group companies, or by mandatory conversion of financial instruments issued by ZIG or one of its group companies, that allow for contingent mandatory conversion into shares of ZIG, or by exercising option rights which are granted to the shareholders (art. 5 ter para. 1a). This contingent share capital corresponds to about 20.4 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2023.\n\nUntil and including April 6, 2028, the total number of new shares which could be issued from (i) the capital band under art. 5 bis para. 5 where the subscription rights are restricted or excluded, and (ii) the contingent share capital in connection with financial instruments under art. 5 ter para. 1 where the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded is limited to 14,600,000 shares (i.e., about 10 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2023).\n\nMoreover, there is an additional contingent share capital (art. 5 ter para. 2a) of CHF 409,509.20, representing 4,095,092 fully paid-in registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, which may be issued to Group employees.

For information on employee share plans, see the consolidated financial statements, note 20 on pages 373 to 374.\n\n## Cross-shareholdings\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, ZIG had no cross shareholdings in excess of 5 percent of share capital, or voting rights with any other company.\n\n## Limitations on transferability and nominee registrations\n\nThere are no limitations on transferability except for the following:\n\nRegistration as a shareholder requires a declaration that the shareholder has acquired the shares in his or her own name and for his or her own account (art. 7 para. 2 of the Articles of Association, www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/ articles-of-association). Nominees holding ZIG shares may for the benefit of, or as nominee for another person, be registered for up to 200,000 shares with voting rights, notwithstanding that the nominee does not disclose the identity of the beneficial owner. A nominee, however, is entitled to be registered as a shareholder with voting rights of more than 200,000 shares if the nominee discloses the identity of each beneficial owner and informs the beneficial owners about corporate actions, consults as to the exercise of voting rights and pre-emptive rights, transfers dividends and acts in the interests of and in accordance with the instructions of the beneficial owners.\n\nThere are special provisions relating to the registration and exercise of rights attached to shares held by BNYM in connection with the ADR program.\n\n## Close periods\n\nUnder Zurich's Group Policy on Dealing in Securities (the Policy), persons qualifying as Group insiders are prohibited from dealing in Zurich securities during periods Zurich has designated as 'close periods'. Close periods are those periods (of a minimum of 30 days) leading up to and including the trading day of the announcement of the Group's quarterly, half-year and annual results. In practice, close periods last approximately 40 days with a longer time span over year-end.\n\nIn addition, dealing restrictions during prohibited periods apply to insiders who are involved in (potentially) pricesensitive projects. Outside of close and prohibited periods, Group insiders may deal in Zurich securities with prior clearance from Group Compliance.\n\n## Persons in scope\n\nSenior executives (such as e.g. ExCo members, head of certain Group functions) and the members of the ZIG Board and of certain significant subsidiaries are deemed Group insiders by reason of their positions.\n\nAdditional persons can be designated as Group insiders based on the persons' exposure to potentially price-sensitive information regarding Zurich securities. Zurich keeps a list of these individuals.\n\nFurthermore, Group insiders must take reasonable steps to facilitate compliance by their connected persons (such as spouse, life or civil partner, minor child, financial adviser, affiliated company, etc.) with the Policy, including communicating the dates of the close periods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders\n\n## Securities in scope\n\nZurich securities are securities of ZIG or of its subsidiaries worldwide. The term 'securities' includes:\n\n- - Securities admitted to trading (or for which a request for admission has been made) or which are traded on a stock exchange, a regulated market, a multilateral trading facility, an organized trading facility or over-the-counter market, in and outside Switzerland.\n- - Securities traded on the primary (e.g., initial public offering) market and over-the-counter on the secondary market.\n- - Over-the-counter (OTC) financial instruments (e.g., derivatives).\n- - Financial instruments deriving from securities whose price is materially dependent (i.e., Zurich securities weigh more than 20 percent) on the underlying security, including debt instruments or derivatives.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nDuring a close or prohibited period, clearance to sell can be granted to the Group insider if the Group insider is not in possession of inside information about Zurich and there is an exceptional circumstance (such as a personal or family emergency involving a health matter or legal or financial emergency) in which selling Zurich securities is the only reasonably available course of action for the Group insider. The determination whether circumstances are deemed exceptional is made by the Group Chief Compliance Officer and the Chairman of the ZIG Board. In 2023, no such exceptions were granted.\n\nFurthermore, provided the requirements of the Policy are met, periodic investments based on a pre-defined trading plan do not require clearance and may continue during close and prohibited periods. As of December 31, 2023, no pre-defined trading plans were in place.\n\n## Significant shareholders\n\nAccording to the rules on disclosure of significant shareholdings in Swiss listed companies, a shareholding has to be disclosed if certain thresholds starting at 3 percent are reached, exceeded or if the shareholding subsequently falls below those thresholds. ZIG is obliged to announce third party shareholdings upon receipt of a notification that the shareholding has reached, exceeded or fallen below the relevant thresholds. During 2023, the Group received notifications from:\n\n- - UBS Fund Management (Switzerland) AG, Basel, whose shareholding crossed the 3 percent threshold.\n- - The Capital Group Companies, Inc., Los Angeles, whose shareholding fell below the 5 percent threshold.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, ZIG was not aware of any person or institution, other than BlackRock, Inc., New York (> 5 percent), The Capital Group Companies, Inc., Los Angeles (> 3 percent) and UBS Fund Management (Switzerland) AG, Basel (> 3 percent), which, directly or indirectly, had an interest as a beneficial owner in shares, option rights and/or conversion rights relating to shares of ZIG reaching or exceeding the relevant thresholds.\n\nThe announcements related to these notifications can be found via the SIX Disclosure Office's platform: www.ser-ag.com/en/resources/notifications-market-participants/significant-shareholders.html#/.\n\nZIG is not aware of any person or institution which, as of December 31, 2023, directly or indirectly, alone or with others, exercised or was a party to any arrangements to exercise control over ZIG.\n\n## Duty to make an offer\n\nThe Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association) do not provide for opting out or opting up in the meaning of the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act. Therefore, mandatory offers have to be submitted when a shareholder or a group of shareholders acting in concert exceeds 33 1/3 percent ownership of the issued and outstanding share capital of ZIG.\n\n## Clauses on changes of control\n\nThe employment agreements with ExCo members are subject to a maximum notice period of 12 months. The regulations for the Group's share-based long-term incentive plan, which apply to all of the plan's participants including ExCo members and a defined group of senior managers, provide that in case of a change of control, the plan administrator may at its discretion either roll over existing share obligations into new share rights or provide for consideration in lieu of share obligations, or provide for accelerated vesting and removal of sales restrictions.\n\nThere are no further clauses pertaining to change of control that would benefit Board members, ExCo members, or other members of senior management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders (continued)\n\n## Shareholders' rights\n\n## Overview\n\nPursuant to art. 14 of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association), each share whose owner or usufructuary is entered in the share register as shareholder with voting rights entitles its holder to one vote at shareholders' meetings and to exercise all other shareholder rights in respect of that share. Each share (excl. treasury shares) further entitles all shareholders to dividend payments. The Board will propose to the shareholders at the AGM on April 10, 2024 a gross dividend of CHF 26 per share (excl. treasury shares).\n\n## Voting rights restrictions and representation\n\nThere are no voting rights restrictions (other than set out under 'Limitations on transferability and nominee registrations', see page 38).\n\nA shareholder with voting rights can attend shareholders' meetings in person or may be represented by his/her legal representative or, by means of a written authorization, by another person who need not be a shareholder. A shareholder may also appoint the independent voting representative to represent him/her. Shareholders can order their admission card or authorize a representative either in writing or via the online platform of Computershare Switzerland Ltd.\n\nThe AGM elects the independent voting representative for a term of office until conclusion of the next AGM. The independent voting representative may be reelected.\n\nZIG generally informs the shareholders at the beginning of the shareholders' meeting of the aggregate number of shares represented by shareholders or their representatives physically attending the meeting and the number of shares represented by the independent voting representative.\n\n## Statutory quora\n\nPursuant to art. 15 of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association), the AGM constitutes a quorum irrespective of the number of shareholders present and shares represented. Resolutions and elections generally require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes represented, unless respective provisions in the Articles of Association (of which there are currently none) or mandatory legal provisions stipulate otherwise. Art. 704 of the Swiss Code of Obligations provides for a two-thirds majority of votes represented and a majority of the nominal value of shares represented for certain important matters, such as e.g., a change of the company's purpose or domicile and the dissolution of the company.\n\n## Convening of shareholders' meetings\n\nShareholders' meetings are convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor and other bodies in accordance with the provisions set out in art. 699 and 700 of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Shareholders with voting rights representing at least 5 percent of the share capital or votes in ZIG may call a shareholders' meeting, indicating the items to be discussed and the corresponding proposals. The invitation to shareholders is published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce at least 20 calendar days before the meeting. In addition, the invitation is published on our website (www.zurich.com/agm) and may be sent by email or unregistered mail to registered shareholders.\n\nThe Board may convene shareholders' meetings as in-person, hybrid or virtual meetings. In the case of hybrid or virtual meetings, the Board must ensure that the shareholders can exercise their rights by electronic means (art. 11 para. 4 of the Articles of Association, www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association).\n\n## Agenda\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the agenda. Shareholders with voting rights who together represent shares with a nominal value of at least CHF 10,000 may at the latest 45 days before the day of the meeting request in writing that:\n\n- - items be included on the agenda, at the same time stating the proposals; or\n- - proposals concerning agenda items are included in the notice convening the shareholders' meeting.\n\n## Registrations in the share register\n\nTo ensure an orderly process, the Board determines the date on which a shareholder needs to be registered in the share register in order to attend the shareholders' meeting. That date is published, together with the invitation to the shareholders' meeting, in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n41",

Zurich's independence criteria comply with applicable laws and reflect best-practice standards such as the SIX Exchange Regulation Directive on Information relating to Corporate Governance and the Swiss Code of Best Practice. The GNSC reviews Board members' independence status annually and reports its findings to the Board for final determination. The GNSC checks the independence criteria before recommending a Board candidate for election and, thereafter, for reelection on an annual basis. Board members are not deemed independent, if they (or if an immediate family member of a Board member), during the tenure as Board member, but at least within the past three years:\n\n- - Receive or have received, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from the Group other than in their capacity as Board or committee members.\n- - Own or have owned more than 10% of the shares of ZIG.\n- - Are or have been employed or affiliated with the external auditors.\n- - Have or have had a material direct or indirect relationship with any member of the Group.\n- - Are or have been an employee of the Group (or in case of immediate family members, are an executive officer of the Group).\n\nUpon the recommendation of the GNSC, the Board determined that, as of February 21, 2024, all Board members were non-executive and independent from management. For further information on the independence policy, please see section VII (B) (3) of the Annex I (Committees Charter) to the Organizational Rules (www.zurich.com/about-us/corporategovernance/corporate-documents). Board members are also subject to rules and regulations to avoid conflicts of interest and misuse of insider information.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nIt is a key consideration for the Board to ensure that it continues to act as a strategic asset enabling anticipation of risks and opportunities as well as providing oversight and control particularly by preserving and increasing the Board's diversity.\n\nTo achieve this, the Chairman, supported by the GNSC, on a yearly basis leads a structured succession planning process involving an assessment of the Group's challenges and opportunities and the evaluation of skills, knowledge and expertise needed at present and in the foreseeable future. During succession planning discussions, the Board focusses on: skills, expertise, diversity and background, interplay of a candidate's individual personality, expertise and experience with that of incumbent Board members, high values and integrity and ability to commit adequate time (for further information, see section VII of the Annex I (Committees Charter) to the Organizational Rules under www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents).\n\nIn 2023, the GNSC had regular discussions on Board succession as some Board members approach the end of their tenure in coming years. In addition, the Board and Committee composition and desired skills have been discussed in detail.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n45",

Mandates in different legal entities of the same group (including asset management structures in accordance with art. 33 para. 2 lit. d) and mandates in legal entities closely associated with the group (such as pension funds and joint ventures) are deemed one mandate.

These include:\n\nThe Asset/Liability Management Investment Committee, chaired by the Group CIO, acts as a cross-divisional body and has primary responsibility for monitoring and reviewing the Group's asset/liability management and the strategic asset allocation of Zurich's invested assets.\n\nThe Group Pensions Committee, chaired by Gary Shaughnessy, is responsible for developing, reviewing and advising on the Group governance framework in matters related to pension and post-employment benefit arrangements. It provides oversight and guidance in the areas of market, demographic and reputational risk. It reports to and makes recommendations to the GBSC on material, pension-related matters, and reports regularly to the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee, chaired by the Head of Group Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), is responsible for reviewing all external communications and disclosures that contain information material to the financial and capital position and/or performance of the Group. In particular, it reviews half-year and year-end financial results based on IFRS Accounting Standards as well as the updates for the first three and nine months of the Group and related documents, e.g., related news releases and analysts' information. It reviews other external communications that contain information or guidance regarding earnings in respect of either current or future reporting periods as well as external documentation required under applicable laws and regulations in relation to public financing transactions or publicly announced share buy-back programs as well as non-financial reports. It also reviews controls and procedures regarding the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting.

Various governance and control functions help to ensure that risks are identified and appropriately managed and that internal controls are in place and operating effectively. The Board is ultimately responsible for the supervision of these activities. The Board supervises management and monitors its performance through reporting and controlling processes. It receives regular and timely information on developments relevant to the Group as further described in this section.\n\nAlthough each governance and control function maintains its distinct mandate, the functions are closely aligned and cooperate with each other through a regular exchange of information, planning and other activities. This approach supports management in its responsibilities and provides confidence that risks are appropriately addressed.\n\nZurich uses a model of three lines of defense in its approach to enterprise risk management. This model runs through Zurich's governance structure, so that risks are clearly identified, assessed, owned, managed and monitored.\n\n## Three lines of defense at Zurich Insurance Group\n\nas of December 31, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First line: business management\n\nThe first line of defense consists of business management and all functions except Group Risk Management, Group Compliance and Group Audit. The first line takes risks and is responsible for day-to-day risk management (i.e., risks are identified and monitored, mitigation actions are implemented and internal controls are in place and operating effectively).\n\nThe Group CEO and other executives inform the Chairman and the Board through regular reports, including on key performance indicators and other Group-relevant financial data, existing and emerging risks, mitigation measures for such risks, important market developments, industry peers and other significant issues and events. The Group CEO is generally invited to attend Board meetings. ExCo members are regularly invited to Board or Board committee meetings, while other executives attend these meetings from time to time. Most Board and Board committee meetings include closed sessions without management participation.\n\nDuring 2023, the Chairman regularly met with the Group CEO. The Chairman meets from time to time with other ExCo members and management outside regular Board meetings. The other Board members do so as well, including meetings with the Group CFO and the Group CRO, in particular.\n\nThe Group has an information and financial reporting system. The annual plan for the Group, which includes a summary of financial and operational metrics, is reviewed by the ExCo in detail and approved by the Board. Full-year forecasts are revised, if necessary, to reflect changes in sensitivities and risks that may affect the results of the Group. Action is taken, where appropriate, when variances arise. This information is reviewed regularly by the ExCo and the Board.",

The Group CRO regularly reports risk matters to senior management committees, the Group CEO and the Board's Risk and Investment Committee (e.g., in the form of quarterly risk reports and updates). For more information, see the risk review on pages 220 to 251. The Group no longer separately describes this information in this corporate governance report.\n\n## Group Compliance\n\nGroup Compliance enables business management to manage its compliance risks by providing compliance solutions and independent challenge, monitoring and assurance related to relevant processes and controls, new business opportunities and complex transactions. The Group Compliance mandate includes:\n\n- - Enabling the business to manage its compliance risks.\n- - Being a trusted adviser.\n- - Providing independent challenge, monitoring and assurance.\n- - Assisting management to promote compliance culture and ethics.\n\nGroup Compliance is vertically integrated to support a global framework and is led by the Group Chief Compliance Officer who reports directly into the Group CEO while maintaining functional independence as second line of defense. The Group Chief Compliance Officer has direct access to the Audit Committee Chair and appropriate access to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nGroup Compliance provides an independent view on the key compliance risks to the business and performs independent risk-based monitoring and assurance activities, while also challenging the business operations. Group Compliance performs its activities according to the Global Annual Compliance Plan. Each Annual Compliance Plan (global, regional, local) is a risk-based plan and must be prepared on the basis of an independent forward-looking compliance risk assessment, considering both internal and external key risk drivers.\n\nGroup Compliance also provides compliance risk insight through relevant and targeted reporting. It provides the ExCo and the Audit Committee with insights into key compliance trends, issues and risks as well as on progress against the Global Annual Compliance Plan through quarterly reporting to enable the members of the respective bodies to take informed business decisions. The equivalent regional and local governance bodies receive insights into relevant compliance topics, including progress against the respective risk-based plans. These reporting flows ensure that the organization at all levels embeds the findings and activities of Group Compliance to safeguard against regulatory and business risk exposure.\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer defines and issues compliance policies relevant to the Group and establishes appropriate processes and guidance. Group Compliance supports a strong compliance culture across the Group via training and awareness initiatives and maintains the global integrity concerns reporting mechanism. Zurich encourages its employees to speak up and report improper conduct that they believe is illegal, unethical, or violates the Zurich Code of Conduct or our Group's policies. Employees are free to report their concerns to management, Human Resources, Group Legal, Group Compliance, or through the Zurich Ethics Line (or similar service provided locally), a phone and web-based service run by an independent external provider. Zurich does not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports concerns in good faith.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group Audit has no operational responsibilities for the areas it reviews and, to ensure independence, all Group Audit staff ultimately report to the Group Chief Auditor. In some instances, local heads of audit for subsidiaries also have a reporting line to the local CEO and/or subsidiary audit committee chair to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nGroup Audit develops a risk-based plan and continuously updates it as the risks faced by the business change. The plan is based on the full spectrum of business risks including issues raised by the Audit Committee, management and other stakeholders. The Audit Committee approves the plan annually and any changes to the plan are reviewed and approved quarterly. The audit plan for 2023 comprised 466 audits, addressing key risks and regulatory requirements, across the Group.\n\nGroup Audit is authorized to review all areas of the Group and has unrestricted access to all Group activities, accounts, records, property and personnel necessary to fulfill its duties. Group Audit coordinates its activities with Group Risk Management, Group Compliance and the external auditors, sharing risk assessments, work plans, audit reports and updates on audit actions.\n\nGroup Audit executes its plan in accordance with defined operating standards, which incorporate and comply with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). Group Audit ensures that issues identified by Group Audit are brought to the attention of appropriate levels of management and that timely follow-up action occurs. The Group Chief Auditor meets monthly with the Group CEO. The Audit Committee and audit committees of subsidiary companies are informed at least quarterly of important audit findings, including adverse opinions and status of mitigation actions by management. This is supported by the Group Chief Auditor's attendance at each Audit Committee meeting and monthly meetings between the Group Chief Auditor and the Audit Committee Chair and with the Chairman of the Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the independence of Group Audit and reviews its activities, plans, organization, work quality and its cooperation with the external auditors. As required by IIA Standards, the internal audit function's quality is reviewed at least every five years by an independent qualified assessor. This review was conducted most recently in the second half of 2021 and reported to the Audit Committee in February 2022. The results confirmed that Group Audit's practices are generally conforming to the Institute of Internal Auditors Code of Ethics and International Standards, and guidance prepared by the European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n72",

EY has been ZIG's external auditors since the financial year 2021.\n\nEY assumes all auditing functions which are required by law and the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investorrelations/our-shares/articles-of-association). EY is responsible for auditing ZIG's and the Group's financial statements and for auditing Zurich's compliance with specific regulatory requirements.\n\nIsabelle Santenac of EY is the global relationship partner and lead auditor. Thomas Fiepke, audit engagement partner, co-signs the auditors' report for 2023. Both of these partners took up office in 2021. Philip Kirkpatrick is the auditor in charge of the regulatory audit work since 2022. The Group together with EY ensures that the roles are rotated at least every five years.\n\nThe AGM elects the external auditors annually. The Board proposes to reelect EY at ZIG's AGM on April 10, 2024 as external auditors for the financial year 2024. EY fulfills all necessary requirements under the Swiss Federal Act on the Admission and Oversight of Auditors and is admitted as a registered auditing company by the Federal Audit Oversight Authority.\n\n## Audit fees\n\nTotal audit fees (including expenses and value added taxes) charged by EY in the year 2023 amounted to USD 46.7 million. This includes the audit of the Group's consolidated, sub-consolidated and statutory financial statements globally. It also includes any fees for interim reviews, assurance and attestation services related to any regulatory filings of the Group and its subsidiaries. Audit fees are approved annually by the Audit Committee and any unplanned overruns are reviewed and agreed with management.\n\n## Non-audit fees\n\nTotal fees (including expenses and value added taxes) in the year 2023 for non-audit services, such as tax advice, audit-related services and other services were USD 6.4 million.\n\nThe Audit Committee has approved a comprehensive policy for non-audit services, which defines allowable and non-allowable non-audit services as well as approval limits for non-audit service mandates at the local and Group level. Allowable non-audit services may include tax advice, comfort and consent letters as well as certifications and attestations, to the extent that such work complies with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and does not compromise the independence or objectivity of EY. To avoid conflicts of interest, all allowable non-audit services need pre-approval from the Audit Committee Chair, the Group CFO, the Head of Group FAR or the local CFO, depending on the expected fee. The policy further requires, among others, an engagement letter specifying the services to be provided.\n\nEY also tracks non-audit services and reports quarterly to the Head of Group FAR and the Audit Committee the extent of non-audit services provided worldwide.\n\nThe audit and non-audit fees of EY for 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total audit fees  1                  |   46.7 |   51.7 |\n| Total non-audit fees  2              |    6.4 |    5.4 |\n| - Tax advice                         |    1.2 |    1.6 |\n| - Audit-related services  3          |    4.8 |    3.1 |\n| - Other services  4                  |    0.4 |    0.7 |\n\n- 1   The total audit fees include one-time audit fees for the auditors' additional work related to the Group's adoption of IFRS 17 in 2022 and IFRS 9 in 2023, the statutory adoption of these standards by the subsidiaries in 2023, as well as recurring scope changes resulting from M&A activities.\n- 2   Rounded individual amounts may not always add up to the rounded total.\n- 3   Primarily for attestation and assurance services (e.g., agreed upon procedures, service organization control reports) and limited/reasonable assurance for ESG/sustainability reporting.\n- 4   In 2023, this primarily related to cyber crisis simulation, review of compliance and IT assessment.\n\n## Audit and non-audit fees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2023, the Audit Committee met with EY seven times. The external auditors regularly have private sessions with the Audit Committee without management present. Based on written reports, the Audit Committee and the external auditors discuss the quality of the Group's financial and accounting function and any recommendations that they may have. Topics considered during such discussions include strengthening of internal financial controls, applicable accounting principles and management reporting systems. In connection with the audit, the Audit Committee obtains from the external auditors a timely report relating to the audited financial statements of the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees external auditor's work. It reviews, at least annually, the external auditors' qualification, performance and independence and reviews any matters that may impair their objectivity and independence. The review is based on a written report by EY describing the firm's internal quality control procedures, any material issues raised and all relationships between EY and the Group and/or its employees that could be considered to bear on their independence. The Audit Committee evaluates the external auditors' performance during their audit examination. It elicits the comments of management regarding the auditors' performance (based on criteria such as their understanding of Zurich's business, technical knowledge and expertise, etc.) and the quality of the working relationship (responsiveness to the needs of ZIG and the Group and the clarity of communication). The Audit Committee reviews, prior to the commencement of the annual audit, the scope and general extent of the external audit and suggests areas requiring special emphasis.\n\nThe Audit Committee proposes the external auditors to the Board for (re)election by the AGM and is responsible for approving the audit fees (see page 73 for further information).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n74",

The past year has shown the continued commitment of our people to act upon the Group's values, make a positive impact on the lives of those we serve and seize new opportunities. Our remuneration framework plays a vital role in encouraging our employees by aligning rewards with performance and stake holder interests.\n\nZurich's achievements on the financial and strategic metrics relevant to the incentive plan awards are outlined in this report on pages 99 to 100 for the short-term incentive plan (STIP) and on page 101 for the long-term incentive plan (LTIP). These include a business operating profit (BOP) of USD 7.4 billion, a 21 percent increase on the prior year, and an increase in the customer transactional net promoter score (TNPS) of 4.3 points across the Group compared with the prior year.\n\nShort-term incentive plan (STIP)\n\n109%\n\nSTIP pool achievement level for the ExCo based on the business performance outcome for 2023 expressed as a percentage of target (2022: 107%) 1\n\n- 1  The STIP pool achievement level for the ExCo is based on the Group BOP achievement against the BOP target set for the year. The overall amount awarded across all of the Group's STIP pools can be found on page 81.\n\nAs part of our commitment to transparency and accountability, you can read more on stakeholder engagement and changes made to Zurich's remuneration approach or disclosures for 2023 on page 82. We value the input received from our shareholders, employees and other stakeholders and have carefully considered their perspectives in the preparation of this remuneration report. In terms of disclosures for 2023 and in line with the Swiss Code of Obligations and the articles of association, the external mandates of the Board of Directors (Board) and the Executive Committee (ExCo) are newly included in the remuneration report on pages 108 to 109.\n\nAn outlook for 2024 is also provided on page 110, highlighting certain intentions in terms of our remuneration framework for the coming year. Our remuneration philosophy and system will continue to incentivize and reward contributors who play a pivotal role in supporting the Group to achieve its strategic targets.\n\nLong-term incentive plan (LTIP)\n\n150%\n\nVesting in 2024 as a percentage of target following the 2021-2023 performance period (2023: 155%)\n\nIn closing, we are looking forward to welcoming you to our upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2024. The AGM is an important forum for shareholders to express their views on the remuneration report, as well as vote on the maximum total amounts of remuneration for the Board and the ExCo. Further information can be found in the invitation to the AGM 2024 (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/ shareholder-area/annual-general-meeting) and in this report on page 96 for the Board and page 103 for the ExCo.\n\nWe appreciate your support and trust as we continue on this journey together.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristoph Franz\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\nTotal variable remuneration\n\n## CHF 842m\n\nAmount of variable remuneration awarded or allocated across the Group for 2023 (USD 986m) (2022: CHF 818m/USD 885m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n77",

The remuneration system is embedded in the Group's Enterprise Risk Management framework and is designed to remunerate without encouraging or rewarding inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors (Board) receive fixed remuneration as an annual fee, of which the basic fee is paid half in cash and half in five-year sales-restricted shares which are not subject to the achievement of any specific performance conditions. Total remuneration for employees, including members of the Executive Committee (ExCo), comprises fixed remuneration consisting of base salaries, pensions and other remuneration including employee benefits, as well as variable remuneration consisting of short- and long-term incentive awards as applicable for an individual's role. The Group's short-term incentive plan (STIP) and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) aim to align remuneration with the achievement of the Group's key financial and strategic targets, the Group's Enterprise Risk Management framework and operational plans, while considering the interests of key stakeholders.\n\n## Read more on the remuneration framework:\n\nu Pages 83-89\n\nThe illustration below shows a greater emphasis on variable remuneration elements, with a higher weighting on average towards the long term for our most senior employees.\n\n## 1\n\n## 2023 remuneration structure %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  At target, as a percentage of total remuneration.\n- 2  Considering ExCo members that were active for the full year, including the Group CEO.\n\n## Remuneration safeguards\n\nZurich's remuneration system and practices are embedded in the Group's Enterprise Risk Management framework and include key safeguards, in particular:\n\n- - Emphasis on longer-term, deferred remuneration for the most senior positions and Group key risk-takers.\n- - Risk-based performance assessment for the ExCo, members of the Group leadership team and Group key risk-takers.\n- - Variable remuneration of employees in control and assurance functions is structured to avoid conflicts of interest by linking to Group metrics, rather than the metrics of the businesses they oversee.\n- - Ability to apply risk adjustments and exercise malus (all participants) and clawback (ExCo and some additional participants) for variable remuneration.\n- - Minimum share ownership requirements for the Board, Group CEO and other members of the ExCo.",

The sales commission plans of employed agents are not considered part of the profitability-based incentive plans. Sales commissions, like the commissions paid to a broker or other external distributors, represent a distribution cost. The employed sales agents do not generate financial risks as they are not involved in establishing the price levels for the products they sell. With regards to operational and reputational risks, in particular due to potential mis-selling, the control of these risks is addressed by the mandatory Group-wide adherence to the Zurich Enterprise Risk Management framework and the Group's code of conduct.\n\nIn determining the amount of total variable remuneration awarded or allocated, the Board considers the long-term economic performance of the Group as well as other relevant factors. The average economic profit is calculated by subtracting the required return on economic capital, based on the weighted average cost of capital, from the adjusted BOP (the amount before interest and variable remuneration) after tax. In this respect, the Group has continued to generate economic profit over the long term which exceeds the amount of variable remuneration awarded or allocated.\n\n- 1  Zurich defines sign-on payments as payments (whether paid immediately or over time) that are agreed on the execution of an employment contract. Sign-on payments may include compensation made prior to a person joining the company and providing any services (payments in advance) or compensation for benefits foregone with a previous employer (replacement payments). Payments in advance are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n- 2  Zurich defines severance payments as payments that are provided in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. Zurich does not include under the term severance payments, garden leave or similar payments for employees in jurisdictions where such payments are required by applicable law, or where they are based on contractual notice periods which conform with recognized market practice, or where they are non-contractual, but in line with recognized market practice. However, Zurich does include garden leave or similar payments that go beyond recognized market practice, irrespective of whether these are provided pursuant to an agreement or are ex gratia. Severance payments are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n\n## Key financial figures 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the performance year 2023, based on the business performance achievements across all STIP pools, the Board approved funding of 114 percent of target (108 percent for 2022) for all participants.\n\n## STIP funding 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe primary business metrics used to determine the STIP pool achievement level and the respective funding for most STIP pools are:\n\n| The relevant BOP or other profitability metrics                                                                     | 80%   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| The relevant customer satisfaction achievements using  the transactional net promoter score (TNPS) where applicable | 20%   |\n\nMore than 90 percent of STIP participants are in a STIP pool which incorporates customer metric outcomes to determine the STIP pool achievement level. For ExCo members, where only the Group BOP outcome determines the STIP pool achievement level, customer metrics are instead included in the individual goals of the ExCo members with a 40 percent weight to emphasize the personal responsibility each member has on customer focus.\n\nAn overall qualitative assessment of business performance is also carried out, including a risk-based review, which the Board considers when determining the final level of STIP funding.\n\nThe final STIP award for an individual is based on the business performance and resulting achievement level of the STIP pool they have been allocated to, as well as individual performance assessed against personal goals and behaviors in line with the Group's code of conduct and Zurich's purpose and values.\n\n## Read more on the Group's STIP:\n\n- u Pages 85-87\n\nRead more on the STIP metrics and outcomes for the ExCo:\n\n- u Pages 99-100\n\n## Long-term incentive plan\n\nThe LTIP links remuneration with future performance and risk, thereby aligning participants with the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders and encouraging them to operate the business in a sustainable manner. The vesting level in 2024, based on the achievements of the predefined metrics for performance in the period 2021 to 2023, was calculated as 150 percent of target (155 percent in 2023). The Board did not exercise any discretion when determining the final vesting level.\n\n## LTIP vesting level 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPerformance metrics and weights for the 2021-2023 LTIP:\n\n- Relative total shareholder return (TSR) position\n\n1/3\n\n- Average net income attributable to shareholders' return on common shareholders' equity (NIAS ROE) 1\n- Cumulative net cash remittances\n\n1/3\n\n- 1  Following the transition to the IFRS 17 and 9 accounting standards as of 2023, an adjusted NIAS ROE for the 2023 performance year was used to determine the vesting level.

As part of this dialogue, the Chairman of the Board met investors representing approximately 38 percent of voting shares in 2023. The enhanced disclosures in the remuneration report 2022, particularly the increased clarity on STIP awards for the Group CEO, were well received and are included again in this report. Support on the consultative vote for the remuneration report at the AGM 2023 subsequently increased to 82.1 percent from 73.9 percent in the prior year.\n\nFollowing reviews of our remuneration system and practices, the following additional enhancements were made to our remuneration approach in 2023 and to our disclosures in this remuneration report.\n\n| Topic                                            | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Read more                                                                            |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LTIP metrics for 2021  and 2022 in-flight  plans | As communicated in the remuneration report 2022, the implications of the  IFRS 17 and 9 accounting standards on the metrics of the 2021 and 2022  in-flight long-term incentive plans, were assessed in 2023.

Zurich's remuneration philosophy is an integral part of our overall offer to employees and supports them in making a positive contribution to the success of the company. Based on established remuneration principles, the Group operates a balanced and effectively managed remuneration system providing competitive total remuneration opportunities to attract, retain, motivate and reward employees. The remuneration system and practices are embedded in the Group's Enterprise Risk Management framework and consider legal and regulatory requirements, as well as market developments.\n\n## Guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy\n\nThe guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy, aligned to Zurich's remuneration rules, are as follows:\n\n- - The remuneration architecture is simple, transparent, applied effectively and considers the interests of key stakeholders such as customers, shareholders and employees.\n- - Reward decisions are made on the basis of merit - performance, skills, experience, qualifications and potential - and are free from discrimination toward or against particular diverse backgrounds. These principles ensure all employees have equal opportunities.\n- - The structure and level of total remuneration are aligned with the Group's risk policies and risk appetite.\n- - The elements of remuneration for each individual reflect appropriate internal and external factors and are tied to long-term results for individuals who have a material impact on the risk profile of the Group.\n- - A clearly defined performance and development approach guides employees throughout the year to achieve personal goals and exhibit behaviors in line with the Group's code of conduct, purpose and values, and this can be used to support remuneration decisions.\n- - Variable remuneration awards are linked to key performance factors which can include performance of the Group, countries, business units, functions, as well as individual achievements.\n- - The Group's STIP and LTIP, used for variable remuneration, are linked to appropriate performance criteria that are selected to support the execution of the Group's strategy. The total variable remuneration is considered in connection with the Group's long-term economic performance.\n- - The design of the LTIP links remuneration with the future development of performance and risk by including features for deferred remuneration, thereby encouraging participants to operate the business in a sustainable manner.\n- - Employees are provided with a range of benefits based on local market practices.\n\n## Equal pay for equivalent work\n\nAt Zurich we believe it is important for every employee to be treated in an inclusive and equitable way. The methodology we use to track our progress on achieving equal pay for equivalent work has been aligned with EDGE certification requirements. We conduct equal pay analyses on an annual basis in the majority of our businesses that have 100 or more employees. In addition, business units may choose to review remuneration across additional parameters such as ethnicity, LGBTQ+, disability, or full- and part-time work arrangements.\n\nRead more on our approach to pay equity:\n\nu www.zurich.com/en/careers/deib/equity\n\n## Elements of remuneration\n\n## Total remuneration\n\nTotal remuneration for an individual employee and its composition may be influenced by factors such as the scope and complexity of the role, level of responsibility, risk exposure, business performance and affordability, individual performance, professional experience, internal relativities, external competitiveness, geographic location and legal requirements. Remuneration is benchmarked around the relevant market median in clearly defined markets which can be local, regional or global, and can reflect practices in insurance, financial services or general industry, depending on the role and market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration framework (continued)\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nFixed remuneration encompasses base salaries, pension benefits and other remuneration including employee benefits.\n\nThe Group provides a range of pension benefits to employees, which are designed to reflect local market practices. Overall benefit offerings are positioned around the relevant market median. The Group Pensions Committee provides oversight and a point of focus and coordination at the Group level in relation to the long-term financial and reputational risks relating to the Group's pension arrangements. Almost all new employees are offered defined contribution or cash balance type arrangements.\n\nThe Group also provides a range of other relevant employee benefits in line with the local market. These could be life insurance, medical coverage and flexible benefits, and may also include distinctive Zurich components. Furthermore, the Group operates several mobility-related policies to facilitate the movement of people across the organization.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nIncentive plans are designed to provide a range of award opportunities linked to levels of performance. Business and individual performance may result in remuneration levels above target for superior performance, and reduced levels that are below target for performance below expectations. Variable remuneration opportunities are provided to motivate employees to achieve key short-term and long-term business goals that support the execution of the Group's strategy. The incentive plans are discretionary and are regularly reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and the Board. Further information on the Group's STIP and LTIP is set out below.\n\n## Short-term incentives\n\n## Short-term (one-year) incentives are performance-driven based on the following design for 2023:\n\nShort-term cash incentives support employees to focus their performance on the achievement of key financial, customer and individual goals set at the beginning of the year. They are delivered primarily through the Group's STIP, although there are local plans in some countries.\n\nThe Group's STIP is utilized across the organization and in many countries covers all employees. In some countries, based on market practice in that location, only the most senior individuals participate. Determination of the final individual STIP award for the year ending December 31, 2023, is based on an individual's STIP target amount, the performance of the business in line with the pool to which an individual has been allocated, and an individual's personal achievements in terms of goals and behaviors. An overview of the approach is set out on the next page. For employees below a certain job level, markets also have the option to base the award solely on an individual's STIP target amount and the achievement level of the relevant pool to which they have been allocated, provided minimum standards of individual performance and expected behaviors have been demonstrated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This can vary between 0 and 175 percent of the total target amount for the relevant STIP pool.\n\nKey metrics for the STIP pools:\n\n- -  ExCo: Group BOP\n- -  Other Group pools 2 : Group BOP and the overall customer TNPS\n- -  Investment Management: Investment results\n- -  Countries: Relevant BOP and customer TNPS as applicable\n- - Farmers 3 : Growth, profitability and customer metrics\n- -  Joint ventures: Relevant profitability metrics\n- 1  The transactional net promoter score (TNPS) is a global best practice standard for measuring customer experience and one of the key measures (20 percent weight) used to determine the business performance in markets where there is sufficiently robust data. Over 90 percent of STIP participants are in a pool where funding is impacted by customer satisfaction achievements.\n- 2  Other Group pools include the wider leadership team, employees in control functions, and employees in Group and regional roles.\n- 3  Includes a separate pool for Farmers New World Life. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services. The Farmers Exchanges are owned by their policyholders.\n\nIndividual performance\n\n## Individual goal achievements\n\nAn individual's achievements considers performance against goals, as well as the behaviors demonstrated. Behaviors are guided by the Group's code of conduct, purpose and values.\n\nAt year-end, a performance category is assigned with differentiated award levels which can vary between 0 and 185 percent of an individual's target amount: Partially met (0% to 75%) Fully met (80% to 120%) Exceeded (125% to 185%)\n\n=\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Resulting STIP award\n\nDepending on business and individual performance achievements, the participant's final STIP award can range from 0 percent up to a maximum of 200 percent of an individual's STIP target amount. The award is capped at 200 percent of the STIP target amount, irrespective of the STIP pool achievement level and individual performance award level. The resulting STIP award is paid in cash.",

In addition to the actual business performance achieved versus the targets set, the Board considers factors such as the quality of earnings, unusual or one-off items affecting results, market conditions, performance relative to peers, as well as a review of risk considerations and input from other assurance functions, provided by the Group Chief Risk Officer. The qualitative assessment ensures that award levels are consistent with the guiding principles of Zurich's remuneration philosophy, including supporting the execution of the Group's strategy, considering the interests of key stakeholders and alignment with risk policies.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\n## Long-term (three- to six-year) incentives are performance-driven based on the following design for the performance period 2023-2025:\n\nIn order to support the achievement of the Group's longer-term goals, long-term incentives are utilized for a defined group of the most senior positions in Zurich, those that have a significant influence on the risk profile of the Group, and individuals considered suitable for participation, for example, due to market competitiveness given their skills and areas of expertise. This group generally includes the individuals with the highest levels of total remuneration. The LTIP aligns the incentives and behaviors of participants with the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders. To further support this purpose, the individual hedging of any shares of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd is prohibited.\n\nIn alignment with the Group's risk profile and business strategy, and considering established best practices, long-term incentives are provided with a deferral element that takes into account material risks and their time horizon. Such deferred remuneration is structured to promote the risk awareness of participants and to encourage participants to operate the business in a sustainable manner. An overview of the LTIP for the performance period 2023-2025 is set out on the following page.\n\nDetails of the LTIP relevant for the 2024 vesting decision following the performance period from 2021-2023 can be found in the remuneration report 2021 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/results-and-reports) and the performance outcomes are detailed in the remuneration and shareholdings section of this report on page 101.\n\nDetails of the LTIP for the next performance period beginning in 2024, can be found in the outlook section on page 110.\n\n87",

An adjustment of +/-25 percentage points to the calculated vesting level may be applied. No discretionary adjustment was made to the calculated vesting level for 2024 following the 2021-2023 performance period.\n\nThe right to modify awards to reflect individual circumstances is reserved for the Group CEO, except for modifications regarding members of the ExCo where this right is reserved for the Board based on a recommendation by the Remuneration Committee. An adjustment of +/-25 percentage points to the calculated final vesting level may be applied on an individual basis prior to vesting. However, if performance under exceptional or unusual circumstances warrants it, exceptions to the +/-25 percentage points adjustment may be made. In this respect, Zurich reserves the right to adjust and even set the vesting level to 0 percent for an individual to reflect specific circumstances (for example, in connection with a breach of internal or external rules) during the period prior to vesting. Any such adjustment is reserved exclusively for the Board based on a recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Clawback and malus conditions for variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration is subject to clawback provisions for members of the ExCo and also for additional participants in some jurisdictions as required by local laws and regulations, to allow for the recovery or forfeiture of awards. Malus conditions to reduce or eliminate awards are applicable to all STIP and LTIP participants. Clawback or malus conditions may apply for example, in cases of misconduct, violation of the Group's code of conduct or applicable laws, or where there has been a material financial restatement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n89",

In addition, shareholders are invited to express their opinion on the remuneration report through an advisory vote. Details on the votes can be found in the AGM invitation 2024 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/shareholder-area/annualgeneral-meeting) and in the respective sections of the remuneration report for the Board (page 96) and for the ExCo (page 103). Art. 18, 28, 32 and 34 of the articles of association outline the approach regarding the votes on pay, supplementary amounts for any new members of the ExCo during a period for which the remuneration for the ExCo has already been approved, performance-related remuneration for the ExCo, allocation of shares, contracts with Board and ExCo members, and loans.\n\n## Remuneration and risk\n\nThe Remuneration and the Risk and Investment Committees meet jointly once a year to discuss a risk review of the remuneration architecture and the remuneration governance framework. The assessment of risk in making reward decisions, and the ability to apply risk adjustments and exercise malus and clawback, if required, are features of Zurich's remuneration framework. Group Risk Management evaluated the remuneration architecture in 2023 and reported that the remuneration architecture does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking that exceeds the Group's risk appetite and tolerance.\n\nIn order to help align remuneration with the Group's risk appetite and tolerance, Group Risk Management consults with other control, governance and assurance functions to provide the Group CEO with a review of risk factors to consider when assessing overall performance for the annual funding of incentive awards. The Group CEO considers Group Risk Management's assessment, amongst other factors, when proposing the funding for the STIP pools to the Remuneration Committee, which in turn makes its recommendation to the Board for final approval. The Group Chief Risk Officer is available to discuss these findings with the Remuneration Committee and the Board.\n\nAll Group leadership team roles, which includes ExCo roles, are considered key risk-taker positions. The remuneration for key risk-taker positions has a greater emphasis towards long-term incentives and therefore, deferred remuneration. Group Risk Management, together with other control and assurance functions, provide risk, compliance, and audit information about each key risk-taker as part of the annual individual performance assessment of the Group leadership team, including the ExCo. This is considered when assessing performance and making reward decisions.\n\nThe variable remuneration of employees in control and assurance functions is structured to avoid conflicts of interest by linking to Group profitability metrics rather than the profitability of the business controlled by such functions.\n\nAt reasonable intervals, Group Audit assesses the operational implementation of Zurich's remuneration rules to verify that the remuneration architecture is adhered to across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n91",

In the remuneration report 2022, these contributions were disclosed in aggregate in a footnote accompanying the table.\n\nIn 2023, 12 members served for the full year.

In order to assist with decisions regarding the remuneration structure and the mix of the individual remuneration elements for ExCo members, the Board conducts benchmarking studies on a regular basis, taking into account relevant market practices within peer groups, as well as internal relativities.\n\nThe remuneration structures and practices of a core peer group, consisting of the following insurance and reinsurance firms in 2023, were analyzed:\n\nAIG, Allianz, Allstate, Aviva, AXA, Chubb, Generali, Legal & General, Manulife Financial Corp., MetLife, Munich Re, Progressive Ohio, Prudential Plc, QBE, Swiss Re, The Hartford and Travelers Cos. Inc.\n\nThe core peer group is regularly reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and the analysis is further supplemented by additional benchmarking studies as appropriate, for example, reviewing practices of large SMI companies in Switzerland or companies of a similar size in other countries.\n\nThe distribution of the individual elements making up the total remuneration of the ExCo in 2023 is set out in the following chart. The variable performance-related remuneration is based on target values. It shows an appropriate balance of remuneration elements, with a significant emphasis on performance-related remuneration (STIP and LTIP), and particularly long-term, deferred remuneration.\n\n## 2023 remuneration structure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  At target, as a percentage of total remuneration.\n- 2 Considering ExCo members that were active for the full year, including the Group CEO.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

One-off remuneration amounts, such as replacement payments for new ExCo hires, and the amounts of contractually agreed remuneration after stepping down from the ExCo and during the notice period, are shown below the total amounts.\n\nRegarding the remuneration of the Group CEO, an adjustment was made to his annual base salary effective as of April 2023 following the successful close of the 2020-2022 strategic cycle. Total remuneration for all ExCo members in 2023 remained similar compared with the prior year. There was no change to the overall remuneration structure of the ExCo, although specific remuneration components were adjusted for certain members to reflect performance and support the execution of strategic objectives. The level of short-term incentive awards corresponds to performance outcomes against the targets set and the decrease in other remuneration in 2023 compared with 2022 considers costs relating to expatriates which is explained further in footnote 6 of the table.\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31                    | in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31                    | Highest-paid individual   | Highest-paid individual   | Highest-paid individual   | Highest-paid individual   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                     |                                                                     | (Group CEO)               | (Group CEO)               | ExCo                      | ExCo                      |\n|                                                                     |                                                                     | 2023  2                   | 2022  2                   | 2023  2,  3               | 2022  2,  4               |\n| Fixed                                                               | Base salaries                                                       | 1.76                      | 1.70                      | 11.69                     | 11.34                     |\n| remuneration                                                        | Pension benefits  5                                                 | 0.47                      | 0.45                      | 3.08                      | 3.40                      |\n|                                                                     | Other remuneration  6                                               | 0.06                      | 0.07                      | 3.30                      | 5.29                      |\n| Variable                                                            | Short-term incentives                                               | 3.55                      | 3.37                      | 18.68                     | 16.63                     |\n| remuneration                                                        | Long-term incentives  7                                             | 3.99                      | 3.82                      | 19.16                     | 19.06                     |\n| Total in CHF                                                        | Total in CHF                                                        | 9.83                      | 9.41                      | 55.91                     | 55.72                     |\n| Total in USD  8                                                     | Total in USD  8                                                     | 11.16                     | 10.10                     | 63.41                     | 59.56                     |\n| in CHF million, for the years ended December 31                     | in CHF million, for the years ended December 31                     | 2023  9                   | 2022  9                   | 2023  3,  9               | 2022  4,  9               |\n| Other payments and share allocations  10                            | Other payments and share allocations  10                            | -                         | -                         | -                         | 0.65                      |\n| Contractual remuneration after stepping down until  termination  11 | Contractual remuneration after stepping down until  termination  11 | -                         | -                         | -                         | -                         |\n\n- 1   In addition, Zurich also paid employer contributions to social security systems for current and former members of the ExCo as required by the applicable laws where the executives are employed. These amounted to CHF 2.50 million in 2023 and CHF 4.19 million in 2022. As of 2023, the disclosure of employer contributions to social security systems relates to the remuneration paid or allocated in the respective year based on best estimates. Applying this methodology for 2022 would result in an amount of CHF 2.67 million. Since the contributions are based on full earnings, whereas benefits are capped, there is no direct correlation between the costs paid to social security systems and the benefits received by the executives.\n- 2   Amounts are gross for the time employees are members of the ExCo during the year and do not include any business-related expenses incurred in the performance of the members' services.\n- 3   On the basis of 12 members of the ExCo, all of whom served in the ExCo during the full year in 2023. See the corporate governance report for details on the ExCo members in 2023.\n- 4   On the basis of 12 members and former members of the ExCo, of whom 11 served in the ExCo during the full year in 2022.\n- 5   The total value of pension benefits accruing to ExCo members during the year, calculated on the basis of company contributions and actuarially assessed company costs of accruing benefits.\n- 6   ExCo members receive other remuneration in relation to employee benefits, perquisites, benefits-in-kind, expatriate allowances and associated costs including tax equalization in line with the Group's global mobility policy, and any other payments due under each member's employment contract. Benefits-in-kind have been valued using market rates. As of 2023, the disclosure of tax equalization relates to the remuneration paid or allocated in the respective year based on best estimates. Using the same approach in 2022 would have amounted to CHF 3.02 million of other remuneration.\n\n7   The target allocation of PSUs made in 2023 using the closing share price of CHF 440.10 on the day prior to the allocation (second working day in April).\n\n- 8   The amounts have been translated from CHF to USD at the relevant exchange rates throughout the year and the cash incentive to be paid in 2024 has been translated at the year-end rate in 2023.\n- 9   Amounts are gross and do not include any business-related expenses incurred in the performance of the members' or former members' services.\n- 10  These are extraordinary and include payments and share allocations to compensate incentive plan forfeitures with previous employers.\n- 11  Relates to contractually agreed remuneration for leavers for the period of employment in 2023 or 2022 as applicable, after stepping down from the ExCo and during the notice period. Such remuneration may include pro rata base salaries, short-term incentives, LTIP target allocations, pension costs, employee benefits, expatriate allowances and associated costs, including tax equalization. Severance payments are not paid to ExCo members.\n\nBased on these figures, total ExCo remuneration for 2023 consists of 32 percent in fixed remuneration, comprising base salaries, pensions and other remuneration including employee benefits, as well as 68 percent in variable remuneration, comprising short-term and long-term incentives (36 percent and 64 percent, respectively, in 2022).\n\n## Audited\n\nRemuneration of the highest-paid individual and all ExCo members (including the highest-paid) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The performance of the Group CEO is assessed by the Remuneration Committee without his presence.\n\n## STIP award\n\nSTIP awards for each member of the ExCo are determined and approved by the Board.

The corresponding total number of performance share units (PSUs) allocated for the three-year performance period 2023-2025, was 43,531. The PSUs are valued using the closing share price of CHF 440.10 on the day prior to the allocation (second working day in April), and will be assessed for vesting in 2026 based on the metrics and targets outlined in the vesting grid on page 88. Dividend equivalent units (DEUs) may accrue during the vesting period.\n\nThe individual LTIP targets for ExCo members for the allocation made in 2023 varied between 125 percent and 225 percent of annual base salary. The final vesting level will be assessed in 2026 and cannot exceed a maximum of 200 percent of the aggregate number of target shares (PSUs and DEUs).\n\nThe LTIP vesting level in 2024 for target shares allocated in 2021 is 150 percent. This was determined against the vesting grid set for the 2021-2023 performance period outlined below and disclosed in the remuneration report 2021.

Further information can be found on page 82.\n- 2  Vesting grid for the 2020-2022 performance period applies.\n\n## Replacement payments\n\nReplacement payments are only made to new ExCo hires to compensate for a verifiable financial disadvantage in accordance with Swiss law. In extraordinary circumstances where payments are made to new hires to replace forfeitures under the incentive plans of the previous employer, the payments tend to mirror the type and timing of the forfeited payments and can include cash payments and/or awards of restricted share units (RSUs) or PSUs. Where payments are made in cash, there is typically a clawback period if the employee leaves the company voluntarily during the first two years of employment. RSUs typically vest over three to five years following the date of allocation and are also credited with DEUs during the vesting period to compensate for any dividend paid. RSUs and associated DEUs are typically forfeited if the holder of such allocations leaves the company before the vesting date and the employment relationship terminates.\n\nThere were no replacement payments made in 2023. In 2022, replacement payments amounting to CHF 0.65 million were made to a new ExCo member who took up employment with the Group during the year and comprised cash payments in 2022 and 2023, as well as RSUs vesting in 2023 and 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n101",

The benchmarking analysis is mainly carried out and approved at a local level. The Group had 59,593 full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2023 (59,498 in 2022).\n\nThe following section shows the total remuneration of employees across the Group (including ExCo members) for 2023 and 2022. The amount of short-term incentives includes, among others, the awards across all pools in the Group's STIP. The performance achievements against the predefined metrics for the STIP pools resulted in an overall funding level of 114 percent of the target amount for 2023 across the Group (108 percent for 2022). The value of long-term incentives includes the target shares allocated under the LTIP in 2023, which will be assessed for vesting in 2026, as well as other deferred remuneration allocated during the year.\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31   | in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31          | 2023         | 2022         |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Fixed                                              | Base salaries, pension benefits and other remuneration  1 | 5,460        | 5,303        |\n| remuneration                                       | remuneration                                              | remuneration | remuneration |\n| Variable                                           | Short-term incentives  2                                  | 675          | 653          |\n| remuneration                                       | Long-term incentives  3                                   | 167          | 165          |\n| Total remuneration                                 | Total remuneration                                        | 6,302        | 6,121        |\n\n- 1   Service costs for pension benefits represent the present value of the defined benefits from pension and post-retirement benefit plans, plus employers' contributions to defined contribution plans, arising from employee service over the accounting period. The amount included in this figure for defined benefit plans is calculated using actuarial factors and can vary year-on-year as economic conditions change. These numbers are explained in greater detail in note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. Other remuneration includes amounts for employee benefits and any other payments due under employment contracts.\n- 2   Comprises cash incentives earned for the year, including the amounts under the Group's STIP and other local short-term incentive plans which may be subject to approval by the applicable local boards. Payments such as sign-on and severance payments in cash are also included.\n- 3   Comprises deferred equity or cash-based allocations made during the year, as well as sign-on payments in shares and other equity-based remuneration. This includes performance share unit allocations made under the Group's LTIP which will be assessed for vesting in 2026. Of this amount, CHF 166 million were share allocations and CHF 1 million were cash allocations in 2023. The value of equity-based long-term incentives considers the share price used to determine the number of share units that were allocated.\n\n## Value of outstanding deferred remuneration\n\nThe Group's remuneration system includes instruments for the deferral of remuneration. The following table provides an overview of the overall value of outstanding equity-based deferred remuneration as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition, the total amount of outstanding deferred cash allocations under local long-term incentives or to meet local short-term incentive deferral requirements for selected roles in some jurisdictions, was CHF 3 million as of December 31, 2023 (CHF 1 million as of December 31, 2022) considering the relevant year-end exchange rates.\n\n## Total remuneration for all employees\n\nValue of outstanding equity-based deferred remuneration for all employees 1\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31                |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Unvested target shares under the LTIP  2                        |    470 |    454 |\n| Unvested RSUs  2                                                |     21 |     20 |\n| Vested but sales-restricted shares                              |    177 |    244 |\n| Overall value of outstanding equity-based deferred remuneration |    668 |    718 |\n\n- 1   As of 2023, the deferred and unvested remuneration is valued considering the year-end share price for the relevant year. The 2022 amounts consider the relevant share price used to determine the number of share units at the original date of allocation. If the year-end share price was applied in 2022, the total outstanding equity-based deferred remuneration for that year would amount to CHF 835 million.\n- 2   DEUs are credited during the vesting period and included in these amounts where they have already accrued.

Differences in value between the initial estimated amount expensed in the income statement for the LTIP and the actual shares vesting in 2024, are reflected in the 2023 consolidated income statement in line with accounting principles. For the 2021 plan with shares vesting in 2024, there was an increase of USD 44 million in the expense recognized in the 2023 income statement to reflect actual performance to date compared with original estimates. In 2022, there was an increase of USD 30 million to the expense recognized in the income statement to reflect adjustments due to actual performance for the 2020 and 2021 plans.\n\n## Sign-on and severance payments for key risk-takers\n\nThe following definition and principles for sign-on and severance payments apply:\n\n- -Sign-on payments are payments that are agreed on the execution of an employment contract (whether paid immediately or over time). Sign-on payments may include compensation made prior to a person joining the company and providing any services (payments in advance) or compensation for benefits foregone with a previous employer (replacement payments). Payments in advance are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo. Any replacement payments for members of the ExCo, including the Group CEO, must be approved by the Board based on a proposal by the Remuneration Committee.\n- -Severance payments are provided in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. Zurich does not include under the term severance payments, garden leave or similar payments for employees in jurisdictions where such payments are required by applicable law, or where they are based on contractual notice periods which conform with recognized market practice, or where they are non-contractual, but in line with recognized market practice. However, Zurich does include garden leave or similar payments that go beyond recognized market practice, irrespective of whether these are provided pursuant to an agreement or are ex gratia. Severance payments are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n\nThe Group as a principle does not make any sign-on or severance payments. If circumstances in the Group's interest warrant such payments, these can be approved through a clear governance process. Any such payment with a value of CHF 1 million or more is approved by the Chair of the Remuneration Committee prior to the time the employment offer is made or prior to the time the severance payment is committed to.\n\nThe following table discloses sign-on and severance payments committed to key risk-takers. Key risk-takers are incumbents of Zurich's most senior positions, as well as positions that have a significant influence on the risk profile of Zurich. All Group leadership team roles, which includes ExCo roles, are considered key risk-taker positions. For key risk-taker roles where the incumbent is a member of the ExCo, no payments in advance and/or severance payments have been made. Replacement payments for the ExCo in 2023 and 2022 are included where such payments were made.\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31   | 2023            | 2023                      | 2022 Number of   | 2022 Number of   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                    | Amount  (CHF m) | Number of   beneficiaries | Amount  (CHF m)  | beneficiaries    |\n| Sign-on payments                                   | 3.99            | 11                        | 2.21             | 3                |\n| Severance payments                                 | 0.00            | -                         | 3.93             | 2                |\n\nSign-on and severance payments for key risk-takers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n107",

The audit was limited to the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) in the tables marked 'audited' of the Remuneration Report.\n\nIn our opinion, the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO in the attached Remuneration Report complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of association.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Remuneration Report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables marked 'audited' in the Remuneration Report, the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Remuneration Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Remuneration Report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the Remuneration Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibilities for the Remuneration Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Remuneration Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of association, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable\n\nPhone:\n\n+41 58 286 86 86\n\nwww.ey.com/ch",

The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the remuneration system and defining individual remuneration packages.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Remuneration Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Remuneration Report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf084 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Remuneration Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf084 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \uf084 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nErnst & Young Ltd\n\nIsabelle Santenac\n\nLicensed audit expert (Auditor in charge)\n\nYana T\u00f6ngi Licensed audit expert\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our shareholders also take sustainability seriously, requiring us to deliver growth and profits all the while advancing our sustainability priorities.\n\nThat's why we continue to focus on sustainability as a vital part of our business strategy.\n\nDuring the 2023-2025 financial cycle, we will be accelerating innovation in products and services offered to customers, and delivering on our sustainability targets in the areas of Planet, Customers and People.\n\n## Planet Sustainability\n\nBy Planet Sustainability, we mean our focus on achieving net-zero outcomes. A lowcarbon economy will positively impact climate and society. Reducing emissions lies at the heart of our efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs an investor, since 2019, we have achieved a reduction in emission intensity of 43 percent. Zurich's absolute financed emissions declined over the same period by 52 percent, mainly driven by portfolio activities and structural emission reductions of our investee companies.\n\nIn 2023, our impact investing portfolio of USD 7.9 billion helped avoid a total of 4.5 million metric tons of CO2e emissions and benefited 4.6 million people.\n\nBesides our focus as an investor, we also work with suppliers who share our values, outlined in our supplier code of conduct. As of the end of 2023, 52.1 percent of our procurement spend 1 was with suppliers that have set science-based emission reduction targets and 49.4 percent of our spend was with suppliers who have set net-zero targets.\n\n- 1 Managed procurement spend (MPS) is the spend of approximately USD 2 billion annually managed centrally by Zurich's Procurement and Vendor Management function according to the 2022 baseline on goods and services that are required to enable Zurich to maintain and develop its operations, excluding suppliers no longer active in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## Introduction :\n\n## Sustainability is a long-term endeavor.\n\nAs an insurer, trust is vital to our success, built through doing the right things in the right way and being open about the impacts of our actions. We 1 continue to embed sustainability across our business through accountable, transparent, measurable initiatives and incentivize sustainable actions alongside financial performance. One of the ways we demonstrate that is with the inclusion of sustainability targets in management target cards and variable remuneration for the Group's senior positions, including the Executive Committee (ExCo).\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability is key to our continued long-term success. We have set ourselves ambitious targets and are making tangible progress. Measuring and transparently reporting on our progress against these targets demonstrates our commitment to being a responsible business and creating long-term value for all the stakeholders.\n\nGeorge Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn reporting, we strongly believe in the need to disclose clear, comprehensive, and high-quality information on our performance against key sustainability indicators, 2 and have called for harmonization and rationalization of sustainability reporting frameworks. 2023 has seen significant developments in this area, moving from industry-led voluntary initiatives to more standardized frameworks, regulatory requirements and governmental actions. The implementation of new legal requirements in Switzerland under the Swiss Code of Obligations and the publication of the IFRS S1 and S2 standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) are noteworthy milestones. Additionally, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as part of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will impact some entities within our Group from 2024.\n\nWhile these are welcome developments, the challenge now is to ensure interoperability between different standards in various jurisdictions and crucially for companies to strike a balance between resources allocated to reporting and taking concrete actions towards sustainability. Reporting can be a valuable catalyst, but it is the synergy between reporting and action that paves the way for a sustainable future, where transparency fuels progress and tangible results become evident. For that, we continue to be guided by our refreshed Sustainability Framework 3 focussed on our customers, our planet and its people as the cornerstones to build a resilient organization that responds to the needs of our time.\n\nSustainability Framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Comprising Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries, the Group or Zurich.\n- 2 www.zurich.com/sustainability/reporting/sustainability-report\n- 3 www.zurich.com/sustainability/strategy-and-governance/strategy\n\n119\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In line with previous cycles, analysis outcomes suggest that our customer-focused approach and diversified portfolios, supported by strong risk management practices, continue to provide the resilience and flexibility necessary to be able to adapt to the climate change impacts observed. The outcomes of these analyses are used to determine appropriate responses and confirm the resilience of our strategy.\n\n## A focus on our climate resilience offering\n\nIn 2023, Zurich Resilience Solutions (ZRS) expanded the reach of its Climate Resilience offering and started a collaboration with KPMG to offer advisory services to address physical and transition risks, associated with climate change. 1 In Germany we published an entrepreneur's guide for the installation of photovoltaics systems. The German government's new solar package is designed to accelerate the expansion of photovoltaics. To support customers from mid-sized companies and small businesses with this 'energy transition on the roof', the ZRS team in Germany has published a white paper to help risk managers identify potential hazards and take precautionary measures. 2 ZRS provides risk assessment services, plans review services and recommendations for risk improvement for the customer to achieve a 'risk neutral' exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 This advisory service builds on more than a decade's experience in Zurich's natural hazards assessment methodology, expanding to climate change and addressing needs beyond immediate insurance requirements.\n- 2 www.newsroom.zurich.de/documents/white-paper-photovoltaik-anlagen-434350\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Endorsing proposals from shareholders our voting\n\nDuring AGM Season 2023, we analyzed and voted on more than 50 climate-related proposals submitted to shareholder votes, endorsing proposals driving sustainable practices and reducing carbon emissions. For instance, we used our proxy voting rights during the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of a major fossil fuel production company to extend our support to a shareholder proposal demanding the establishment of Scope 3 targets. This proposal stressed the critical necessity for the energy company to implement a mediumterm emission reduction target specifically addressing greenhouse gas emissions stemming from the utilization of its energy products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, Zurich Santander 1 launched a new Talent Acquisition Hub in 2023. The Hub focuses on making it easier for employees to move to new roles internally as part of their personal development and growth ambitions. This is possible thanks to a continuous effort in communication, both from our internal channels like intranet, mailbox and periodic talent newsletter, but also through communication between HR teams and managers.\n\n- 1 A joint venture between Zurich Insurance Group and Banco Santander.\n- 2 CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for individuals and organizations to manage their environmental impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Broadening the support to our customers\n\nDuring 2023 we increased the number of hubs authorized to write renewable energy from four to ten. Each hub supports renewable energy customers based on local market requirements and bundles the required underwriting expertise. To broaden the support we can provide to our customers, we also introduced a new offshore wind proposition. We continue to upskill and cross train underwriters and recruit additional expertise as needed, including a green graduate program to further build our talent pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## Basis for presentation\n\nThe sustainability report is based on good practices, emerging regulations, standards and reporting frameworks, providing insights into the most material topics for our business and stakeholders. In 2023, we are reporting on the requirements from the Swiss Code of Obligations for the first time and continue to disclose on existing frameworks, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), the 21 core World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the insurance industry. The report adheres to the 'disclose or explain' approach, presenting all significant indicators directly in the sustainability report, labeled by the corresponding sustainability focus areas and reporting standard.\n\nThis year's report includes enhancements such as improved reporting on employee-led fundraising and volunteering, updates on progress towards sustainability targets, and a new section on respecting human rights.\n\nThe report covers data from January 1 to December 31, 2023, unless stated otherwise, with some data collected and reported earlier in the year. Where data is extrapolated to produce an annualized view (based on Group's internal methodology), this is indicated by footnotes in the respective tables. We provide detailed index tables 1 related to SASB, WEF and the planet chapter, on our website along with references to GRI. In addition we showcase our position against Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index in the respective index table, newly added. Lastly on the same webpage we include a link to our key metrics from the sustainability report.\n\nIndicators discussed in this report are labeled to identify the sustainability focus area and framework or standard to which the reporting is linked. Please note that indicators might impact several areas across environment, social and governance. In this case, we highlight the most relevant impact area or areas as in some cases more than one of the impact areas will have the same level of importance and relevance.\n\n## Legend of icons used\n\n## External frameworks and our standards\n\n## Impact area\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal Reporting Initiative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nZurich Sustainability Framework\n\nTCFD\n\nWEF IBC\n\nSASB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironmental impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSocial impact\n\nGovernance impact\n\nThe release of the reporting requirements from the International Sustainable Standards Board in 2023, which built on the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and industry-based SASB Standards, as well as the World Economic Forum's Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics, means we have started reviewing how our own sustainability report will change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For us, sustainability is a business opportunity as well as an urgent global imperative. That is why we have integrated sustainability across our business, both globally and locally. We will continue to use the levers we have as a global insurer to make a positive impact in the world. Sustainability is about how we do business.\n\nSustainability reporting captures our progress toward our qualitative ambitions and quantitative targets. Based on our Sustainability Framework, we cluster our reporting into three main focus areas: Planet, Customers and People reflecting the fact that we aim to achieve outcomes that benefit the planet, customers and people in the long term.\n\n## 2.1.1 Our purpose\n\nFigure 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLiving up to our purpose, create a brighter future together, will strengthen our core business and have a positive impact on our performance as an underwriter, investor and employer. With changing customer expectations and an increasing demand for social and environmental engagement, sustainability is increasingly becoming a driver for value creation. Our purpose\n\ninspires us to leverage our business model 1 to scale positive impact for the planet, customers and people, and to build partnerships that can drive transformative change.\n\n## 2.1.2 Assessing materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the field of sustainability continues to evolve rapidly, we strive to have a clear view on our most material issues going forward and a deeper understanding of their risks and opportunities. Therefore, we conduct a full materiality assessment every three years ahead of the next financial cycle. 2 To ensure the ongoing relevance of our materiality matrix in years where we do not do a\n\nfull data-driven update, we undergo a yearly qualitative review together with our Sustainability Leaders Council 3 to determine how some issues may be becoming more important. This enables us to better inform how to adjust our Group-wide approach given the rapid evolving nature of sustainability issues.\n\nThese materiality results were critical inputs for refreshing our Sustainability Framework, including numerous strategic foresight interviews with key leaders across the organization that helped translate specific materiality issues into the priorities and targets underpinning our overall approach to sustainability.\n\n## Materiality matrix 2023\n\nOur materiality matrix including highlighted topics seen as more important developments in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 External view (2022) based on stakeholders' expectations for Zurich and their own perceived importance of the topic.\n- 2 Internal view (2022) based on surveys and interviews with Zurich leaders and employees.\n- 1 For more information on our business model, please refer to the Group overview on page 12.\n- 2 The last full materiality assessment was conducted in 2022.

We define sustainability risks as those risks which arise from events or conditions related to topics or trends relevant to our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability Framework and which adversely impact the achievement of our business strategy or targets.\n\nTo carry out effective sustainability risk management, we follow our ERM framework and select different approaches to identify, assess, respond to and report on those risks according to their perspective and time horizon. In terms of perspective, sustainability risks are managed using the concept of 'double materiality' (outside-in perspective and inside-out perspective). Regarding time horizon, sustainability risks can be current or emerging, the latter referring to when risk-based strategic insight is required over a time horizon extending beyond the financial cycle. Examples include risks associated with climate change and societal topics, such as human rights (child labor and forced labor) or banned weapons. Sustainability risks are also drivers of other risks in Zurich's risk taxonomy.\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework\n\nFollowing key risk management steps are covered by our ERM framework applied in the context of sustainability risks:\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nFor each of our Sustainability Framework's focus areas (Planet, Customer and People), we identified the risks and opportunities to set priorities during the current financial cycle. For example, the risks and opportunities associated with the focus area Planet include natural catastrophe modeling to efficiently manage our exposure to physical risks, 3 such as flood, wind storm and wildfires. For transition risks, 4 we monitor loss trends associated with electrical vehicles to reflect appropriate pricing in order to optimize our claims network for emerging technologies.\n\nEmerging sustainability risks are identified and assessed at least annually through the update of the Zurich Emerging Risk Radar. For key risks that extend beyond the financial cycle, scenario analysis highlighting both risks and opportunities is performed. For further information on scenario-based climate risk analysis, see the Planet chapter (pages 145 to 161). The identification and assessment of current sustainability risks is done in line with the Total Risk Profiling TM methodology standard (TRP), which considers the frequency and severity of risks in terms of impact on earnings, capital, reputation and liquidity.\n\n## Risk response\n\nFor emerging risks, risk response can include sustainability risk positions, which describe Zurich's appetite for a particular sustainability risk. These positions may also trigger the development of new policies (see Group-wide exclusion policies, page 130), guidelines, products and services 5 (for example, enabling our customers to manage their sustainability risks), processes, projects or other management actions depending on the kind of risk response (e.g., risk transfer, risk mitigation or acceptance of the risk).\n\nFor current risks, the risk response could entail a new sustainability priority. Another example of a risk response is the ESG integration in our investment management activities. We believe that proactively integrating sustainability risks and opportunities in our investment decisions across asset classes alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-theart risk management practices will support us to achieve superior, risk-adjusted and long-term financial returns.\n\nFor more information on risk monitoring, please refer to our risk review on page 225.\n\n- 1 For further information on Zurich's risk taxonomy, see our risk review on pages 233 to 251.\n- 2 The diagram illustrates the double materiality perspective, as introduced by the European Commission in the 'Guidelines on reporting climate-related information', https:// ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/policy/190618-climate-related-information-reporting-guidelines\\_en.pdf\n- 3 To learn more on physical risks, see section 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks, page 139.\n- 4 To learn more on transition risks, see section 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks, page 140.\n- 5 Read more about our sustainable solutions in section 5.1 Customer experience and customer-centric solutions, pages 181 to 186.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Using our proprietary risk-profiling methodology, we have prioritized key areas of concern on the Group level. This prioritization takes into account our overall Sustainability Framework and the Zurich Code of Conduct. 1\n\nIn addition, we have an underwriting-specific policy in place to avoid being complicit in potential adverse impact on human rights by identifying and excluding customers who have a verified record of human rights violations without evidence of remedial actions, such as the use of forced or compulsory labor or child labor, bribery or corruption.\n\nFor projects in mining, oil and gas and hydroelectric dam construction, sectors, which have been identified as carrying particularly high sustainability risks, underwriters have to perform dedicated screening for environmental impacts on protected areas and specific human rights abuses, such as relocation of local communities without due process.\n\nSpecifically our policy prohibits us to insure oil and gas drilling and production in the Arctic 2 due to the environmentally sensitive nature of the local ecosystem. Furthermore we do not insure new greenfield oil exploration projects unless meaningful company net-zero transition plans are in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

During that period, we will neither quote new business nor increase direct investments in the company. We will stop business dealings in a phased way if a customer has not committed to stopping the activity after one year. Business dealings include the provision of insurance products and services and direct investments.\n\n## Thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale\n\nThe most carbon-intense fossil fuels (thermal coal, oils sands and oil shale) create a particular challenge for global greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we have focused on reducing our exposure to these fossil fuels in particular and therefore will not underwrite or invest in companies that:\n\n- - Generate more than 30 percent of their revenue from mining thermal coal, or produce more than 20 million tons of thermal coal per year.\n- - Generate more than 30 percent of their electricity from coal.\n- - Are in the process of developing any new coal mining or coal power infrastructure.\n- - Generate at least 30 percent of their revenue directly from the extraction of oil from oil sands.\n- - Are purpose-built (or 'dedicated') transportation infrastructure operators for thermal coal or oil sands products, including pipelines and railway transportation.\n- - Generate more than 30 percent of their revenue from mining oil shale, or generate more than 30 percent of their electricity from oil shale.\n\nWhile the implementation of the policy for our existing portfolio is completed, we continue to screen new clients and investee companies and will only consider new clients or investee companies that are already below those limits or have near-term commitments in place to bring them below the limits.\n\nThis position does not apply to workers' compensation, other employee protections, or considerations, which have a positive impact on human health and the environment. It also does not affect green bonds that support the transition. On thermal coal, in our insurance and underwriting and investment management activities, we also engage with companies on the phase out of thermal coal production and use in OECD and EU-27 countries by 2030 and the rest of the world by 2040. 2 In addition we will phase out thermal coal completely from our underwriting portfolio by 2030 in OECD and EU-27 countries and 2040 in the rest of the world.\n\nOur sustainability in business transaction process is embedded in our underwriting process and guidelines. It is also subject to the same governance and assurance procedures as Zurich's underwriting guidelines to maintain policy documentation and to track process adherence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Introduction\n\nFigure 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our process to manage sustainability risks in underwriting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderwriters are required to perform sustainability assessments where customers are identified as having a high risk of violating one of Zurich's policies, based on company level third-party information and guidance on sensitive industry and country combinations where third-party information is not available.\n\nWhile these inputs provide the first materiality assessments, decisions on how to proceed with a customer rely on individual assessments by the relevant underwriters, with support from the global Underwriting sustainability desk, if required. These assessments leverage both customer information, such as sustainability reports and policies, as well as external media reporting on negative environmental and human rights-related impacts associated with the customer.\n\nBased on the assessment outcome, the customer will either be cleared for business, restricted for business or, if more information is needed, temporarily cleared under the condition of ongoing engagement. Assessment outcomes are recorded in Zurich's Customer Relationship Management tool to make those decisions available for other underwriters within Zurich working on the same customer.\n\nSustainability assessments depend on the customer's disclosure of issues or on coverage of sustainability issues through media reporting. New sustainability issues and new relevant information can emerge over time. Sustainability assessments are therefore required for new business but also for existing customers, so potential issues can be addressed as soon as relevant information becomes available.\n\n## 2.3 Involving our stakeholders\n\nThe success of our approach to sustainability greatly depends on the willingness of our stakeholders to be involved in, and contribute to, our ambitions. For further details on our interactions with customers and employees, please see pages 180 to 191 and 192 to 204, respectively. In addition, we strive to involve our investors, suppliers and vendors, as well as the communities in which we operate in diverse ways. We frequently interact with groups such as regulators, NGOs and industry associations.\n\n## 2.3.1 Investors\n\nA demonstrable commitment to sustainability is of critical importance to many of our investors. We are proactive in developing and communicating our Sustainability Framework, particularly on the topics that are most material to investors, such as climate resilience and adaptation, decarbonization, business ethics and conduct, and Board leadership and effectiveness.\n\nWe articulate clear, qualitative ambitions and quantitative targets for each of our three sustainability focus areas (Planet, Customers and People) and report progress towards them on an annual basis.\n\nWe engage consistently and openly with investors, analysts, rating agencies and proxy advisors. As part of our outreach, we have established dedicated annual interactions between our Board and investors to explain our approach to sustainability and performance.\n\nThis engagement gives us invaluable insights into investors' rapidly developing expectations and supports the development of our strategy toward a more sustainable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 2.3.2 Supply chain\n\nFigure 7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to the nature of our business, we are predominantly a consumer of services. Compared with other industry sectors such as manufacturing, the risks associated with the environmental, social, human rights 1 , and\n\ngovernance impact of our supply chain are low. Nonetheless, we are committed to effectively managing such issues. As part of this, we have established a sustainable sourcing program 2 , which aims to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, supports our commitment to net-zero and creates a positive social impact.\n\nIt comprises three pillars, which address environmental, social and ethical factors. Its objective is to embed these factors throughout the sourcing cycle, align suppliers with our values and be transparent about our expectations. We have developed a supplier code of conduct (SCOC) 3 to lay a clear foundation for systematically integrating responsible business conduct in our supply chain\n\nSustainable sourcing program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand provide online training videos for suppliers to familiarize themselves with our expectations.\n\nWe aspire to use our influence as a buyer of goods and services to accelerate the adoption of sustainable business practices among our suppliers by asking them to comply with this code. The SCOC has been integrated into our thirdparty governance framework (TPGF), which provides a framework of minimum standards that apply to the onboarding and management of third parties with which we work, including suppliers. The TPGF adopts a risk-based approach to establish onboarding and management measures, such as third-party due diligence processes, that are relevant and proportionate to the nature and risk of any particular transaction.\n\nWe consider supplier alignment with the SCOC as part of our due diligence processes and request selected suppliers to complete a self-assessment. We review the self-assessment results and internally audit a sample of the responses. As of the end of 2023, we confirmed that 72.2 percent 4 of our managed procurement spend (MPS) 5 is with suppliers that meet or exceed the key expectations of our SCOC, following a self-assessment.\n\nIn April 2023, we took a significant step to support our suppliers improve their sustainability performance by publishing tools and resources for suppliers to use within their own businesses. This included a carbon emissions calculator, training videos and policy statement templates. The tools are designed to address common areas in which multiple suppliers fall short of our expectations and support us to drive up supply chain standards. We will continue to work with our suppliers to address these areas in the short to medium term. Where our engagement fails and suppliers cannot or refuse to embed the minimum standards, we will review the relationship and examine appropriate measures, including phasing it out to protect our commitment to doing the right thing.\n\nIn 2023, we published a new learning academy for our Procurement & Vendor Management colleagues to ensure they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully engage suppliers on sustainability topics. The content includes internally produced online courses covering climate change, human rights and social procurement. We also published a course covering the supplier due diligence processes (including in relation to human rights) that have been implemented under the TPGF. The completion rate of the supplier due diligence training for calendar year 2023 is 100 percent.\n\n## Net-zero supply chain\n\nTo complement, our net-zero goals for our own operations, we are looking to our supply chain to set emissions reduction and net-zero targets. Our goal is for 75 percent of our MPS to be with suppliers that have science-based emissions reduction targets by 2025 and net-zero targets by 2030. As of the end of 2023, 52.1 percent 6 of our MPS is with suppliers who have set science-based targets and 49.4 percent 7 of our MPS is with suppliers who have set net-zero targets. We aim to use our influence and press for change, expecting suppliers to set their own targets. In 2023, we were one of only five insurance companies to be recognized with Supply Chain Engagement Leader status by CDP. 8 CDP recognizes us among the top 8 percent of companies for supplier engagement on climate change.\n\n## 2.3.3 Responsible tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe strive to manage the costs and risks associated with tax for the benefit of our customers, employees, shareholders and for society as a whole. This is reinforced by our ambition to be a responsible corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate.\n\n- 1 For more information on our commitment to human rights, including human rights due diligence and human rights risk assessment, please see 6.3 Respecting human rights on pages 201 to 203.\n- 2 www.zurich.com/sustainability/planet/sustainable-sourcing\n- 3 www.zurich.com/en/sustainability/governance-and-policies/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/sustainable-sourcing-supplier-code-of-conduct-2021.pdf?v=4\n- 4 According to the 2022 baseline of managed procurement spend, excluding suppliers no longer active in the year of reporting.\n- 5 Managed procurement spend (MPS) means the spend of approximately USD 2 billion annually managed centrally by Zurich's Procurement and Vendor Management function on goods and services that are required to enable Zurich to maintain and develop its operations.\n- 6 We consider a supplier to have science-based targets when their emission reduction targets are approved by the SBTi, a similar scientifically accredited body or otherwise require a reduction of at least 42 percent in scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n- 7 We consider a supplier to have net-zero targets when their net-zero target is approved by the SBTi, a similar scientifically accredited body or otherwise has a public target to neutralize any residual scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n- 8 CDP is a not-for-profit charity that runs the global disclosure system for individuals and organizations to manage their environmental impacts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We consider tax compliance to be a key objective and allocate significant resources to ensure that the tax affairs of the Group are managed in a sustainable, well-governed and transparent manner.\n\nWe are subject to tax in countries in which the Group operates according to local laws and regulations. The location of our subsidiaries and branches is driven by business reasons. We do not engage in aggressive tax planning or artificial structuring that has no business purpose or economic substance. In our consolidated financial statements, we only include a small number of companies operating in jurisdictions with low or nil tax rates, all of which are engaged in insurance, reinsurance, and asset management activities. We are committed not to use so-called 'tax havens' or secrecy jurisdictions for tax planning purposes and therefore do not transfer value created elsewhere to non-cooperative jurisdictions.\n\nOur approach to tax is defined through our Group tax strategy, 1 which is guided by the Zurich Code of Conduct 2 and is supervised by the Board and executed by members of the Executive Committee (ExCo).\n\n## 2.3.4 Community investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur community investment activities 3 are mainly delivered through the Z Zurich Foundation (the Foundation), a charitable organization funded by various members of our Group. Its purpose is to create a brighter future for vulnerable people. Its ambition for the past strategic cycle was to positively impact at least 11 million people worldwide by 2024, which was achieved in\n\nmid-2023. In 2023, the Foundation celebrated its 50 th anniversary, using the occasion to launch its acceleration strategy for the next 12 years. To support this, the Foundation unveiled an initial four-year plan from 2024 to 2027. Over its next strategic cycle, the Foundation has the ambition to create brighter futures and more opportunities for 25 million vulnerable people.\n\nThe Foundation's highlights for 2023 include:\n\n- - Significant developments of the Foundation's three strategic pillars: 'adapting to climate change', 'improving mental wellbeing' and 'enabling social equity'. The Foundation approved and launched new multi-year programs to assist communities across the globe alongside like-minded organizations such as Junior Achievement in the U.S., ICLEI Local Governments for Sustainability in Turkey, and the Mental Health Association of Hong Kong.\n- - Over USD 31.7 million 4 investment in community programming across the Foundation's strategic areas of work. This includes 20 donations to local disaster relief initiatives across the globe. An example are the earthquakes which shook southeastern Turkey and northwestern Syria. In addition to immediate relief efforts, the Foundation has worked with our local team and the charity organizations it already collaborates with in Turkey to address mental wellbeing needs in the mid and long term.\n- - The presentation of 50 Community Hero Awards to recognize Zurich employees who go the extra mile to support their communities.\n\n## Employee-led fundraising and volunteering\n\nTable 1\n\n|                                                        | 2023    | 2022    | Difference   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------------|\n| Fundraising and donations (USD millions) 1             | 3.0     | 3.3     | (9) %        |\n| Total time volunteered by workforce                    | 146,433 | 123,490 | 19%          |\n| Workforce actively volunteering (% of total headcount) | 20%     | 20%     | 0%           |\n\n- 1 Includes fundraising and donations of our employees but excludes Z Zurich Foundation matching.\n\n2023 was a record year for us in terms of employees volunteering their time. The increase in volunteering was driven by increased employee engagement across all regions. In 2022, a significant amount of employee donations were driven to the Foundation's specific appeal to assist people affected by the situation in Ukraine. As of 2023, we closed the time gap on reporting employee-led fundraising and volunteering numbers. Last year, we reported these numbers with a year's delay i.e., for 2021 but we are now able to report on 2023 together with the previous year's figures.\n\nWhile the Foundation is the main vehicle by which we deliver on our global community investment strategy, our local business units also drive community support actions and actively engage with charity organizations to address local needs and priorities.\n\n- 1 To find out more about our Group tax strategy, please visit www.zurich.com/en/sustainability/strategy-and-governance/policies-and-frameworks/being-a-responsible-taxpayer 2 www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct\n- 3 Our Group and employees contribute through fundraising, volunteering and cash contributions whereas the Foundation carries out community investment activities.\n- 4 The final and audited 2023 figures will be disclosed in the Foundation's Impact Report, which will be published in June 2024.

The donations are made by various members of our Group.\n\nThe decrease in charitable contributions by our business units to charitable initiatives and organizations in 2023 compared with 2022 is mainly explained by a one-off donation of USD 10 million to the Zurich Forest Project 1 in 2022. We have decided to increase our financial support to the Foundation in order that it can adapt its response to those most in need in our societies, as those needs have grown significantly across all three of the Foundation's focus areas in 2023. The rise in our contributions is reinforced by foreign exchange rate effects due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A stable climate and healthy, diverse natural environment are critical to continuing human and economic development. As such, our revised Sustainability Framework expands our environmental focus beyond climate. Environmental challenges including nature loss and climate change can impact all sectors of the real economy which we insure and invest in, and ultimately can have significant impacts on a company's long-term value. Understanding, measuring and managing these impacts - while seizing the opportunities that arise from the transition to a net-zero world - is essential to creating sustainable value for our stakeholders. We aim to use our underwriting and investment activities, our operations, the collective skills and experience of our workforce and an engaging, collaborative approach with our stakeholders to address these challenges and create long term value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen integrating sustainability into our business, we see mitigation and adaptation to climate change as one of our key priorities.\n\nLinda Freiner\n\nGroup Head of Sustainability\n\n- 4.1   Strategy\n- 4.2   Governance\n- 4.3   Risk management\n- 4.4   Metrics and targets\n\n## Scenario-based climate risk analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResilient strategy confirmed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reduction of financed emissions\n\n%\n\n:\u0116\u0115\u017c\u01c9\n\n## Share of total assets in impact investment %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n:\u0113\u0114\u017c\u01c9\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n202\u0117\n\nTarget\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n:\u0114\u0117\u017c\u01c9",

Independent assurance report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis section presents our disclosure in line with the recommendations of the TCFD. It outlines our understanding of the potential impacts of climate risk to our underwriting, investment activities as well as our own operations including supply chain. It represents our assessment of the resilience of our strategy to climate change risk. Also outlined is the governance we have\n\nestablished to make climate and sustainability an executive-level responsibility, our climate risk management processes and finally the metrics and targets we have implemented to track delivery of our stated targets. While climate change is the focal point of this section, we are dedicated to environmental aspects in a broader sense, e.g., revenues resulting from sustainable solutions, see Chapter 5. Our customers: Their needs are at the heart of everything we do (pages 180 to 191).\n\n## 4.1 Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy and financial planning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur approach to climate change focuses on supporting companies and people through the transition to a net-zero economy and demonstrates our commitment to using every lever of our business, from underwriting and investments to our operations, to accelerate this transition.\n\n## 4.1.1 Our approach to climate change risk\n\nUnderstanding and managing the impact of climate change is an important aspect of maintaining our short- and longterm profitability. Our approach to climate risk is part of our risk management process. It is managed in a way that is consistent with other risks to which the Group is exposed. Our approach acknowledges that while some impacts of climate change are felt today, others may take decades to manifest. We therefore employ a number of approaches and tools to achieve a holistic understanding of potential impacts. Assessments of the evolving physical and transition risk landscape are integrated into our underwriting and investment strategies.\n\n## Natural catastrophe modeling\n\nTo manage our short-term climate risks more effectively, we are investing in improving our understanding of them. Modeling the effects of physical risk on our portfolios is a key focus. We combine global circulation models and natural catastrophe models to provide a forward-looking view of the impact of changing natural catastrophes on our portfolios at the spatial resolution required for integration in our accumulation-risk and peril-region modeling. Based on our work so far, it has become clear that model adjustments are required in some peril regions to reflect the impact of climate trends on physical risk today.\n\n## Read more about natural catastrophe modeling:\n\n- u 4.1.3 Natural catastrophe modeling: current exposure to physical risk, pages 141 to 144.\n\n## Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis\n\nOur annual scenario-based climate risk analysis is our most prominent and detailed outside-in risk evaluation. Leveraging scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and considering our core underwriting and investment portfolios, this analysis allows us to better understand potential risks associated with the transition to a net-zero economy over time horizons extending beyond the financial cycle horizon, something fundamental to formulating appropriate strategic responses and evaluating the resilience of our strategy. This analysis also helps us identify the lines of business in which we have an opportunity to support certain industries in their transition to net-zero. We employ a static balance sheet approach, fully recognizing that the analysis is a theoretical 'what if' exercise, which is useful to stretch management thinking about the medium to long-term outlook, but not to inform insights from an immediate solvency, financial or capacity management perspective.\n\nRead more about portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis:\n\n- u 4.1.4 to 4.1.9 pages 145 to 161.\n\n## 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks\n\nWe broadly categorize climate-related risks as physical and/or transition risk and outline below the potential impacts of these risks on our business. In sections 4.1.5 to 4.1.9 (pages 148 to 161) we discuss our own assessment and the expected impact from climate-related physical and transition risk. We outline our understanding of how climate change risk could impact our business activities, mainly focusing on the impact on demand (revenues) and losses (claims) from an insurance perspective and on assets from an investment perspective.\n\nThe section below should be read as an overview of expected effects of both physical and transition risks, while the scenario analysis provides more details on how each of these risks is expected to unfold and impact our business under different scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes in extreme weather events can be attributed to humaninduced increases in global surface temperatures with research suggesting continuing trends in emissions will further exacerbate the situation.\n\nThese developments will bring negative economic and societal impacts as extreme weather events increase in severity and frequency or undergo geographic shifts. The scientific understanding of how weather events will respond to climate change varies greatly, but we assume that further temperature increases will accelerate sea-level rise due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets. It will also lead to more extreme temperatures, heatwaves and droughts, impacting agricultural production and human productivity. 1 As the warming atmosphere will also intensify evaporation, more extreme precipitation and variability in the global water cycle is seen as highly likely.\n\nThere is less certainty around how other weather events will react to climate change, such as tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, severe convective storms and hail. Secondary effects of climate change can also have negative impacts, such as extreme heat and drought leading to more wildfires, or the combination of sea-level rise and changes in hurricane intensity or tracks leading to higher storm-surge damage.\n\n## Impact to demand and loss profiles\n\nUp to 2030, we expect changes driven by climate change to become increasingly relevant. However, these changes stop short of becoming a dominant loss driver over and above what is currently embedded into our risk appetite. We expect the inherent volatility and natural variability of extreme weather events and socioeconomic trends will continue to have a stronger influence on loss experience. Natural variability comes both from random fluctuations of extreme but rare events and multi-year variations in regional climate systems, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation or AtlanticMultidecadal Oscillation. This variability is also embedded in historic loss trends and taken into account in our pricing and capital management.\n\nSocioeconomic trends, such as an increase in asset values and accumulation through population growth and concentration in urban areas, also contribute to increases in losses over time. The impact of such trends is considered in pricing and modeling, such that annual policy renewals provide mitigation against increasing physical risks for short-tail business and mitigate transition risk to the underwriting portfolio.\n\n## Liabilities (insurance)\n\n- - Changes in and shift of demand for products and services across geographies/ sectors/ lines of business\n- - Changes in loss ratios and profits\n- - Changes in loss frequency\n- - Changes in loss severity\n\n## Assets (investments)\n\n- - Valuation changes\n- - Changes in default rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks (continued)\n\nThrough certain lines of business, we can be directly impacted by the changes in physical risk caused by climate change, particularly through increases in severity and frequency of natural catastrophes, such as tropical cyclones, flood or hail, which can lead to higher losses by customers covered by our property policies. Other lines are less sensitive to physical risk and, within these, only a minority of our losses are driven by natural catastrophes (see section 4.1.3 Natural catastrophe modeling: current exposure to physical risk, pages 141 to 144).\n\n## Impact through valuation changes\n\nBuildings may be at risk, due to their fixed locations, of suffering significant damage costs from the impact of climate change. We are currently exploring ways to assess physical risks for properties using our risk model on catastrophes and by integrating data into our central portfolio management system. The valuation of assets in our investment portfolio can also be affected by direct and indirect exposure to physical risk.\n\nBusinesses will be directly affected by impact on costs and revenues and the potential for supply chain disruptions and asset write-offs. The vulnerability of countries to physical risk, including costs associated with infrastructure and adaptation measures, disruptions and vulnerability to extreme weather events, may also have an impact on the valuation of sovereign debt.\n\n## Transition risks\n\nFigure 9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate-related transition risk\n\n## Climate transition risk\n\n## Impact channels\n\n## Economic Impact\n\n## Impact to insurers' balance sheet\n\n## Policy and legal\n\n- - Increased pricing of GHG emissions and removal of subsidies\n- - Enhanced reporting requirements\n- - Restrictions on products and technologies\n\n## Technology\n\n- - New low-carbon technologies\n- - New energy efficiency technologies\n\n## Market and sentiment\n\n- - Changing customer behavior and consumer preferences\n- - Stigmatization of sectors and technologies\n- - Changed cost of production inputs\n\n## Changes in demand\n\n- - Increasing demand for lowcarbon products and materials\n- - Reduced demand for carbon-intense technologies and products\n\n## Changes in costs\n\n- - Direct carbon costs\n- - Changes in operating costs (supply chain, commodity costs, compliance, new production processes)\n- - Abatement\n\n## Competition and pass-through effects\n\n- - Shifts in market share\n- - Passing costs through to end customers\n- - Products and services with low price elasticity\n\nIf society moves to limit global warming in line with the Paris Agreement to below 2\u00b0C, and optimally to 1.5\u00b0C, the required decarbonization of the global economy will bring its own set of risks. The legal, policy, technological and market changes necessary for the transition will lead to significant shifts in economic activity and asset valuation.\n\n## Impact to demand and loss profiles\n\nThe expected steep rise in carbon prices and the removal of subsidies on carbon-intensive resources and activities in this transition could lead to reduced profitability, stranded assets and impairments in sectors that are difficult to decarbonize and where additional costs cannot be passed on to customers. This will, in turn, affect demand for insurance from shrinking sectors.\n\nFor example, the transition will shift demand for insurance toward low-carbon technologies and products, creating opportunities for companies that provide new solutions or are able to reduce their emissions more efficiently than competitors.\n\nThe aggregate effect of transition risk will vary greatly across individual actors, depending on their detailed business models, assets and transition strategy. This complicates the assessment of aggregate transition impacts.\n\n## Individual companies\n\n- - Lower product margins\n- - More operational breakdowns\n- - Early write-offs and stranded assets\n- - Changes in borrowing costs\n- - Higher sales volumes and profits for companies providing low-carbon products and services\n\n## Macroeconomy\n\n- - Changes in GDP and growth rates\n- - Changes in borrowing costs\n- - Changes in interest rates\n\n## Liabilities (insurance)\n\n- - Changes in, and shift of, demand across geographies/sectors/lines of business\n- - Changes in loss frequency\n- - Changes in loss severity\n\n## Assets (investments)\n\n- - Valuation changes\n- - Changes in default rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.2 Introduction to climate-related risks (continued)\n\nThere will also be aggregate macro effects arising in a transitioning scenario, including the impact on economic activity, inflation and, potentially, government borrowing costs.\n\nAs new policy measures and technologies are rolled out, uncertainties around their effectiveness and unintended consequences are likely to increase, with higher market volatility and uncertain loss ratios among possible outcomes. Transition risk will be highly dependent on how predictable policy responses are and the time available for the economy to decarbonize. More disruptive impacts can be anticipated with a faster transition.\n\n## Impact through valuation changes and other drivers\n\nIn the commercial real estate sector, transition risk will manifest from the need to adhere to tighter policies, carbon and energy costs, market preferences and challenges to achieve energy efficiency, and may impact asset values. The transition will also bring legal or litigation risks. Carbon-intense energy producers are already defending lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for their alleged historical contribution to CO2e emissions. This current litigation could expand to other industries whose operations contribute to CO2e or other climate-impacting emissions. Companies may be sued for failing to disclose climate-related risks, for failing to mitigate the impact of their activities on climate change, for allegedly misrepresenting their level of climate impact, or for failing to adapt to the changing climate. Asset managers could be sued for financing climate change-inducing activities, or for inadequately driving emission reductions in their portfolios.\n\nThe global transition to a low-carbon society will also bring with it new and emerging technologies. These could also present new opportunities as well as unanticipated risks and new environmental concerns from both a resourcing and disposal aspect. Extreme weather events could present new risks to employers regarding worker safety or to companies engaged in building design, engineering and construction. Governments could enact laws seeking to hold companies accountable for the climate impact of their supply chains.\n\n## 4.1.3 Natural catastrophe modeling: current exposure to physical risk 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Approach\n\nCurrent exposures to physical climate risk are expressed through Annual Expected Loss (AEL) and Probable Maximum Loss (PML). Modeled exposures are shown below. 2 Our approach to modeling is discussed further in the section on managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes (page 163). We highlight how various drivers including exposed insurance portfolio and vulnerability changes, model updates, exposure data quality, foreign exchange rates and reinsurance can influence natural catastrophe modeling output (e.g., AEL, PML) over time.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe climate risk assessment is applied to our portfolios, namely the exposure of our Property and Casualty business to natural catastrophe perils, impacted by climate change that could materially impact us.\n\n## Quantification\n\n## AEL\n\nAEL provides a view on the expected loss due to natural catastrophes per year, averaged over many years.\n\n## PML\n\nPML is a tail metric that looks at severe, unexpected but still possible outcomes of natural catastrophes at a defined probability of occurrence.\n\n## Monetary losses\n\nAmount of monetary losses attributable to insurance payouts from natural catastrophes.\n\n- 1 Results from the Q4 2023 Group Catastrophe Model are presented in the analysis shown below. There are timing differences in the underlying exposures considered in this analysis (underlying exposures by peril region are generally as of June or September 2023, and in exceptional cases as of September or December 2022). See also 4.3.2 Managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes on page 163.\n- 2 Countries comprising the peril regions referred to here are as follows:\n- - Central Europe hail: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n- - Europe wind: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.\n- - Europe flood: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the UK, and including others like Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, San Marino and Vatican.\n- - CB, MX and U.S. hurricane: Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The AEL analysis above reflects our current top five peril regions, net of reinsurance, before tax and excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses.

The term 'catastrophe' in the context of the CRG covers both man-made and natural catastrophe peril events that are relatively infrequent or are phenomena that produce unusually large aggregate losses.\n\n## Total amount of net losses 1\n\nTable 3\n\n| Event name (by event and region)    |   Total net losses in USDm (2023) |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| European hail events (hail, Europe) |                               310 |\n| Total                               |                               310 |\n\n- 1 Only events above USD 200 million are reported.\n\nAn important aspect of our proprietary view on natural catastrophe risk is the evaluation of patterns and trends in catastrophe activity with time. Natural variability of event activity is an integral part of our view on natural catastrophe risk, as are statistically significant trends that may be detectable in our claims experience or credible, conclusive modeling of past, present and future climate as a driver of loss activity. We regularly revisit our risk views and underlying models on climate-related perils in order to reflect trends in the hazard, whereas exposure trends are naturally captured by exposure data updates. Natural variability is at the same time evaluated and kept up-to-date as part of the regular reviews of our natural catastrophe risk view, which underpins the structuring and purchase of reinsurance along with the profitability assessment and strategic capacity allocation for risk assumed from customers.\n\nWe follow a gross-line underwriting strategy and focus substantial time and resources on ensuring risk-adequate underwriting and pricing of the business we assume up-front, including consideration of potential climate change induced trends. Reinsurance is used as a means to maximize diversification of net retained risks and to protect shareholders against earnings volatility. We engage with a core panel of reinsurance partners to secure the required capacity at sustainable pricing over the medium term. Given our financial strength, we have the option to weigh the benefits and cost of reinsurance against other forms of risk financing and thus adapt to supply-side changes in the reinsurance market as a potential consequence of the macroeconomic response to climate change adaptation.\n\n- 1 Our disclosure shows our efforts to provide additional details, however it is acknowledged that full compliance is not envisaged e.g., due to our reporting standards (no disclosure of gross losses), or our industry's catastrophe modeling standards. There are generally no catastrophe models available for example, for chronic diseases, droughts and extreme heat and therefore no PMLs can be provided. Tsunami risk is correlated (and modeled) with seismic risk and therefore cannot be reported on a stand-alone basis as part of insured products from weather-related natural catastrophes, which are the scope of the standard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such  time horizons are well suited to certain long-term risks such as real-estate  investments and life assurance risks. |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.4 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis (continued)\n\n## Scenarios used\n\nThe scenarios used to analyze our underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios are drawn from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) suite, with scenarios chosen to cover a relevant set of emissions pathways. The emissions pathways of the selected scenarios correspond broadly to representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 6.0. 1\n\nNet-zero 2050 limits global warming to 1.5\u00b0C through early adoption of stringent climate policies and innovation. Net-zero emissions reached around 2050, giving at least a 50 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century, with no or low overshoot (<0.1\u00b0C) of 1.5\u00b0C in earlier years.\n\n## NGFS scenario framework\n\nFigure 13\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDelayed transition assumes no new climate policies until 2030 with high regional variation in policy implementation. Emissions exceed the carbon budget temporarily and decline more rapidly to ensure a 67 percent chance of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C.\n\nCurrent policies assume that only currently implemented policies are preserved, leading to high physical risks. Emissions grow until 2080 leading to about 3\u00b0C of warming and severe physical risks.\n\nThe scenarios underpinning the analysis of our underwriting and investment activities are chosen to allow us consider a broad range of risks and opportunities of varying degrees of physical and transition risk.\n\nThe scenarios used to understand physical risk impacts to our own Operations are broadly aligned with those used for our insurance and investment analysis in terms of the RCPs assumed (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). 2 Our scenario analysis leverages a third-party model and associated data to assess both our insurance and investment businesses. A highlevel overview of the model, data sources and key assumptions are provided in the risk management section (pages 162 to 164).\n\nOur disclosure focuses on both net-zero 2050 and current policies scenarios to demonstrate the resilience of our strategy in both net-zero aligned and high physical risk future states.\n\n- 1 As described by NGFS, 'the RCPs are greenhouse gas concentration scenarios that are commonly used in the climate modeling community. They were officially adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and provide a basis for the projections and predictions of the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC.' The correspondence between NGFS scenarios and RCP pathways is based on the emissions trajectory in those scenarios over time. The correspondence is not exact, but NGFS net-zero 2050 and disorderly scenario temperature pathways fall in the range of RCP 2.6, and current policies fall in the range of RCP 6.0. (More details available in the NGFS technical documentation).\n- 2 These correspond to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, according to the new designations from the IPCC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our planet: Drive positive impact (continued)\n\n## 4.1.4 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis (continued)\n\n## Quantification\n\nGiven the differing nature of the underlying activities, we employ different approaches to understand and quantify potential impacts of climate risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting\n\nQuantification is performed to underpin our medium-term assessment (to 2030). This approach is reasonable for determining how to manage identified risks due to the flexibility of the annual policy renewal cycle. Outcomes of our mediumterm analysis are used to inform strategic and risk responses. Impacts to 2050 are analyzed qualitatively.\n\nTwo metrics have been chosen to quantify scenario-based impacts of climate risk on our insurance business:\n\n- - Percentage change in demand is the estimated impact on size and composition of demand for insurance products due to the drivers of physical and transition climate risk in each scenario, compared with a 2030 baseline.\n- - Percentage change in expected losses is the estimated impact on claims due to the drivers of physical and transition climate risk in each scenario, compared with a 2030 baseline.\n\nFor both metrics, the baseline does not take into account any further climate action or climate change relative to present-day levels but reflects modeled impacts on demand (or losses) from GDP changes and industry sector growth or decline.\n\n## Scope 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting\n\nThe analysis of our Group portfolio uses third-party modeling to understand the potential relationship between key climate drivers and insurance demand and loss experience. The scope of the analysis was determined as follows:\n\n## Analysis of the Group by:\n\nLines of business\n\nRegion\n\nIndustry/sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet of nine clusters with potentially high exposure to physical and transition risk representing:\n\n64% of P&C\n\n84% of Life protection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Each cluster was analyzed in depth for:\n\nImpact on demand\n\nImpact on losses\n\n- 1 Altman (2019): 50 Years of Altman Z-score: what have we learned and the applications in financial and managerial markets, see: www.systemicrisk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/images/Evolution%20of%20Altman%20ZScore.lse.pdf\n- 2 Frye (2013), see: www.chicagofed.org/~/media/others/people/research-resources/frye-jon/frye-lgd-as-a-function-of-the-default-rate-091013-pdf.pdf\n- 3 For more details on the NiGEM model, see: https://www.niesr.ac.uk/nigem-macroeconomic-model\n- 4 For more details concerning the scenario analysis performed on our own operations, please see pages 160 to 161.\n\n## Investment Management\n\nTo allow us to better understand potential future impacts of climate risk on key asset classes, we conduct quantitative analyses for 2050.\n\nThe valuation of equity in the scenarios involves discounting future revenues and costs to arrive at a net present value of future cash flows.\n\nCorporate credit impact is estimated by translating changes in equity valuations to changes in fixed-income instrument default risk and associated loss, using a ratings-based Altman Z-score 1 model and the Frye-Jacobs PD-LGD relationship, 2 respectively.\n\nReal estate impairments due to transition and physical risk are estimated by country and property type. Transition risks are based on country level emissions data for residential and commercial real estate (scope 1 and 2). For the physical risk impacts to real estate, a third-party risk model is used, including coastal flooding, river flooding and tropical cyclones. The combined impact of transition and physical risks is calculated by multiplying the reduced valuation associated with impacts from transition and physical risk.\n\nSovereign bond impact reflects the macroeconomic shocks arising from changes in energy consumption, energy costs and the physical risks of climate change, as well as the response of governments and central banks to those shocks. The model uses macroeconomic outputs from NiGEM 3 to calculate changes in nominal forward interest rates and changes in default risk premia per risk scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment Management\n\nThe scenario-based assessment of our proprietary investment portfolio considers listed equities, corporate credit, real estate and a separate analysis of sovereign debt. Listed equities, corporate credit and real estate cover 36 percent of our proprietary investment portfolio and make a significant contribution to our investment-related market risk position as of 2022.\n\nWithin each asset class, the third-party model covers between 70 and 100 percent of investment management holdings based on number of securities. The coverage is higher if based on market values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

No material changes in response are deemed necessary and we continue to execute against previously identified priority areas.\n\nSierra Signorelli CEO Commercial Insurance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis performed\n\nMonitoring of our P&C business focused on identifying material shifts 1 in business mix (e.g. changes in line of business, industry and region mix) that may indicate a potential change to currently understood impacts. Revised natural catastrophe exposures based on updated catastrophe model results are considered part of monitoring.\n\nThe scope of the P&C analysis remained unchanged from previous cycles with focus on Europe and North America, reflecting the footprint of our business. The scope of our Life protection analysis was increased to include APAC in addition to our most significant exposures across EMEA and LATAM.\n\n## Analysis findings\n\nNo material shifts in the P&C underwriting portfolio industry or line of business mix were\n\nobserved, with key drivers of change identified as increased rates, changing commodity\n\nprices and inflation (e.g. costs of construction) rather than increases in exposure or coverage.\n\nOverall impacts to Group level P&C demand in 2030 under the scenarios modelled and with no change in assumptions are estimated to be of low materiality . For the net-zero 2050 scenario, the impact of rate change in construction and property as well as a higher growth rate in renewable energy that offsets a decline in premiums from the fossil fuel industry could drive increased upside opportunities. However, given the nature of rate change and commodity prices, we believe the impact would not be material when fully modeled. Note that where growth opportunities highlighted in the current policies scenario relate to the increase of fossil fuel supply, we expect to forgo opportunities that are not aligned with our net-zero commitments.\n\nIn both scenarios, impacts to Group-level P&C loss experience are observed to be more pronounced before mitigating actions are considered, due to the potential negative impact of physical losses related to weather events.\n\nEstimated impacts to demand for Life protection policies in 2030 are observed to increase to medium under the current policies scenario and just above the threshold for high under the net-zero 2050 scenario. These increases were driven by the inclusion of higher levels of physical risk assumed in underlying NGFS scenarios and the addition of acute physical risk. Corporate risk business continues to be well diversified across industry sectors.\n\nOur medium-term risk profile is presented below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, we are seeking to optimize claims networks for emerging technology and expanded focus on technological advancements in driving and vehicles.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAmong the changes affecting mobility, from a climate perspective the transition from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to alternatively fuelled vehicles, mainly EVs, is most relevant. As overall motor insurance premium volume and the proportion of EVs continue to grow in many of our markets, the risk of a shrinking premium pool can be mitigated by harnessing these new technologies and their implications for the insurance industry. While the share of EVs in new vehicle registrations is already increasing considerably, even in high-income economies, it will take at least a decade until EVs represent half or more of cars driven on the roads. Such a gradual change over a decade and longer can be deceptive as impacts can go unnoticed without dedicated monitoring. Therefore, we are actively monitoring market developments and claims experience to explore new ways to evolve our propositions and capture transition opportunities.\n\n## Progress\n\nOur share of EVs in the overall motor portfolio is consistent with our footprint and local EV market trends, showing that our evolving motor propositions adequately capture the growing EV penetration. However, expertise is required to understand claim trends considering conflicting factors such as rapidly evolving vehicle technologies (EVs and advanced driver assistance systems to name but two), but also an increasing average age of vehicles on the road overall. Separating individual technological and behavioral factors will result in better predictions of future claims experience.\n\nTelematics and ADAS can effectively contribute to preventing and mitigating the impact of road accidents within motor fleets and we work with a panel of selected telematics providers to provide independent advice on the best telematics solutions for any organization.\n\n## Ongoing focus\n\nWe will continue our focus on e-mobility in four key areas:\n\n- 1 Portfolio (e.g., overall market growth and adoption of EVs in fleets, other fuel alternatives).\n- 2 Pricing and profitability (ADAS, telematics and other risk differentiators).\n- 3 Performance (e.g., understanding of specific claims trends).\n- 4 Proposition (especially in high EV growth markets and segments).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our sustainable energy strategy is built on three layers:\n- - Engagement and review of transition plans.\n- - Upskilling and cross-training in sustainable energy within underwriting, risk engineering and claims.\n- - Continued development of solutions to address emerging technologies in this area.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe future of energy depends on power generation transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. This transition will require traditional energy and power companies to decarbonize their business model and should also bring business opportunities for new, dedicated low-carbon energy companies. To reflect the transition requirements of existing energy customers, we restructured our team of experts, blending the old world of energy with the new to mirror our customers and better help them accelerate the energy transition. To adapt to this rapidly evolving market we continue to review our sustainable energy offerings and risk appetite. We have built further knowledge and expertise by developing skills in-house as well as hiring industry experts where needed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.5 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - Underwriting (continued)\n\n## Progress\n\nIn 2023, we further developed dedicated teams, or 'energy hubs', so that the required expertise is available for all written transactions. Our integrated approach to energy allows us to access traditional power and fossil fuel customers that are transitioning to sustainable energy. The world's largest wind power owners, for example, are mostly traditional power companies or integrated energy companies. Globally, we increased the number of hubs authorized to write renewable energy from four to 10. Each hub supports renewable energy customers based on a local underwriting authority that is tailored to market requirements and underwriting expertise. In particular we introduced a new offshore wind proposition. Offshore wind turbines are considered to be a particularly challenging technology, as they often utilize prototypical equipment and operate in harsh environments. While mindful of those challenges, we are providing services in a way that allows us to gain experience of a rapidly evolving technology, develop a solid foundation for the long-term profitability of our energy business and remain a consistent partner for our customers during their energy transition. We are also working with a broker to provide a facility for hydrogen customers which will serve customer needs across our lines of business in this crucial area of the energy transition.\n\nTo increase and maintain the appropriate talent for our energy strategy, we continue to upskill and cross-train underwriters and recruit additional expertise as needed. We have established a green graduate program in order to further build our talent pipeline. In 2023, participants who focused on sustainable energy rotated through Claims, Underwriting and Risk Engineering roles as part of the program.\n\n## Ongoing focus\n\nWe are continuing disciplined and cautious growth of our sustainable energy business, focusing on areas where we have expertise and where we see opportunities for profitable business in a difficult market. We will continue to monitor new opportunities in emerging technology in this area and continue to revise our risk appetite as appropriate.\n\nWe are applying our alignment, commitment, delivery and communication (ACDC) approach to key transition-related\n\nengagements. This provides us with a consistent methodology to structure our discussions across all industries.\n\nTransition assessment framework\n\nFigure 15\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes in materials and construction methods will be essential if the economy is to successfully decarbonize. Understanding how the use of those materials and methods will change underwriting risk will be a prerequisite to maintaining profitability in this changing market. We focus on growth and innovation in our construction business line through talent acquisition and new product development, with a heavy focus on the U.S. market as a first step.\n\n## Progress\n\nPremium from our proprietary policies for mass timber master builders risk and project builders increased to USD 6.3m compared to 2022. These policies offer customized coverage and market-leading capacity of up to USD 50 million for qualified risks using mass timber, a low-carbon alternative to concrete and steel. Zurich construction in North America also continues with its weather parametric product which provides non-physical damage coverage for perils including rain, wind, heat, cold and snow accumulation. With this being a unique product in the market, we continue work on product awareness and applicability of the product solution for our customers.\n\nWe are actively working on the portfolio analysis of the current in force sustainable energy construction business with the object to continue to refine our go-to market strategy.\n\n## Ongoing focus\n\nAlternative construction methods still represent only a small part of the overall market, however we will continue to gather experience through our existing products and will continue to monitor the market to adapt propositions and risk appetite as needed.\n\n## Strategic implications for overall underwriting portfolio\n\nThe extent to which the risks and opportunities identified in our scenario assessment will materialize over time depends on the development of the global economy. We continue to hone our skills and build experience for emerging risks and technologies, while underwriting in areas where we already have expertise. In this way, we can capture emerging opportunities, as outlined above, and are well placed to react to any potential further acceleration in the transition of the economy.\n\nMaintaining portfolio profitability is also core to our approach to insuring the net-zero transition. We will continue to selectively accelerate growth or adapt risk appetite based on the growth prospects and profitability of the individual business opportunities, while taking cue from our net-zero underwriting ambition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our strategic response to climate change related risks that we observe, is our long-term commitment to decarbonize our investment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. To support the net-zero commitment, we have set interim targets for engagements, financing solutions and emission reductions.\n\nProprietary investment portfolio analysis\n\nStephan van Vliet Group Chief Investment Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis performed\n\nA model-based assessment was performed to understand potential climate change-related impacts to asset valuations of our capital positions. The third party model used integrates reliable physical and transitional climate-related risk variables under a number of climate scenarios as outlined in section 4.1.4 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis (see pages 145 to 147). Our analysis considers key asset classes, including listed equity, corporate credit, sovereign bonds and real estate. Impacts to our listed equity and global corporate portfolios are assessed in comparison with broad market benchmarks.\n\n## Analysis outcomes\n\nIn line with previous cycles, analysis indicates that climate change-related risk to asset valuation would not pose a major risk to our capital position . Our methodology considers a major risk as one that can have a negative impact on capital in excess of USD 5 billion. This\n\nconclusion considers equity, credit and real estate, which represent approximately 36 percent of our assets under management (AuM). Changes in observed impacts are attributable to changes in modeling methodology, input data and the composition of Zurich's proprietary investment portfolio.\n\nUnder the current policies scenario, we observe low or moderately low physical risks for our portfolios. The model simulates high physical exposures for a few sectors, such as agriculture and activities in tropical areas, to which we currently have limited exposure. Further, physical risks are estimated to mature and impact the asset valuation more profoundly further out in the future compared with the maturity patterns of transitional risks.\n\nUnder the net-zero 2050 scenario, the accumulated impact for our portfolios is limited. However, we observe elevated transition risk levels and thus higher modeled impact on valuation for carbon-intensive sectors. The higher climaterelated impacts for carbon-intensive sectors can be explained by several potential market changes such as regulatory changes, carbon pricing, technological changes, climate abatement costs, increase in demand for low-carbon products and services and reduced demand for fossil fuel-related products and services. The future development of each factor is uncertain and we monitor them closely to be able to timely react to impacts and risks.\n\nOur sovereign bond analysis suggests mildly inflationary outcomes for both current policies and net-zero 2050 scenarios, Under the current policy scenario, interest rates rise somewhat due to a negative effect on the economy caused by the physical impact of climate change. Negative effects include decreased labor productivity under warmer weather conditions. For the net-zero 2050 scenario, price pressures may arise due to the rising cost of carbon and stronger investment demand, spurred by the transition. This will result in moderately higher sovereign bond yields and lower bond prices. The impact on inflation and interest rates is estimated to be higher in the net-zero 2050 scenario than in the current policies scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.6 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - Investment Management (continued)\n\n## Listed equities: a closer look\n\nOverall, the impacts on our global equity portfolio are slightly smaller than those of a broad market benchmark. This can be explained by several factors, including geographic exposure, different sector weighting and specific security exposure.\n\nUnder the net-zero 2050 scenario, we generally observe high transition risk levels and thus higher modeled impact on valuation for carbon-intensive sectors (including energy, non-energy materials and consumer cyclicals), which compared with lower-emitting sectors can be profoundly impacted by higher carbon costs and regulatory changes. Opportunities are identified for sectors that can benefit from, and contribute to, a decarbonization of the economy. This is especially applicable to utilities that can benefit from renewable energy solutions and the development of new technologies. Compared with previous assessments, we generally notice lower asset valuation impacts, which apply both to the benchmark and to our equity portfolio. The overall driver for lower asset valuation impact levels is an update to the NGFS scenario variables, wherein carbon pricing and abatement costs have both decreased. A reduction in carbon prices and abatement costs reduces the competitive advantage of low-carbon intensity players and decreases the costs to high-carbon intensity players. Such a decrease results in lower valuation impacts for carbon-intense sectors, such as energy, and less opportunity impact for sectors such as utilities. Further, NGFS expects a slower EV demand compared with previous scenario iterations. Slower EV demand results in a reduced climate-related benefit for EV manufacturers, causing higher impacts on asset valuation for the consumer cyclicals sector (which includes auto manufacturers) compared with previous years and the benchmark.\n\nFor low-carbon sectors, including service sectors, finance and healthcare, we observe low impacts on asset valuations. This is a realistic assumption given the limited direct exposure to climate-related transitional risks. However, for finance, the indirect exposure via the financing of higher-emitting sectors is not captured within the modelling of the asset class valuation. In a scenario with increased carbon pricing, stricter climate-related regulations and/or low-carbon technological advancement, the finance sector could face more material climate transition risks which would require mitigation actions. Further, if a rapid transitioning of the economy led to energy scarcity, increased energy prices and bottlenecks in the economy, all sectors could potentially be severely impacted. Such market developments and the potential impacts on our portfolio require careful monitoring.\n\nPhysical climate-related risks anticipated under the current policies scenario are estimated to have a low to moderately low impact on the asset valuation, in contrast to the transitional risks emerging under the net-zero 2050 scenario. This is because most physical impacts of climate change are considered or modeled to be less impactful for the time span of the model as they materialize further out in the future compared with transitional risks. However, the impact on valuation from physical risks is higher across most sectors compared with previous assessments for both our equity portfolio and the designated benchmark.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.6 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - Investment Management (continued)\n\n## Corporate credit: a closer look\n\nThe outcome of the model shows that our corporate credit portfolio has lower impact levels than the benchmark in general.\n\nWe also see substantially lower climate-related impacts for our global credit portfolio relative to our listed equity portfolio. This can be explained by the shorter maturity of the credit portfolio, where bonds tend to mature before the strongest climate-related risks materialize. Further, risks associated with refinancing of debt are not considered in the model, which potentially leads to an underestimation of the true climate-related exposure. Compared with 2022 reporting, we observe only minor changes to the asset valuation of the portfolio.\n\nCompared with our listed equity portfolio, finance has a higher weighting in our corporate credit portfolio. The model only addresses direct climate risks for finance and not the indirect impacts through portfolio-related activities, which could potentially be material. The indirect risks of finance will therefore be closely monitored to ensure that potential impact on valuation is adequately addressed over time.\n\nUnder the net-zero 2050 scenario, we see the same patterns for corporate credit as for listed equity, wherein carbonintensive sectors experience higher transition risks and thus higher modeled impact on valuation compared to low carbon-intense sectors. For utilities, our corporate credit portfolio has a relatively higher weighting toward climate transition laggards compared with our listed equity portfolio, which has higher exposure to climate transition leaders. This difference can explain the big divergence in impact on asset valuation between the equity portfolio (estimated to benefit from opportunities in a net-zero 2050 scenario) and the credit portfolio (estimated to face moderate impacts in a net-zero 2050 scenario). Further, the benchmark has a higher exposure to utilities than the credit portfolio, which can explain higher impacts compared with our credit portfolio. For business services and industrials, slightly higher transition risks are anticipated for our corporate debt portfolios compared with the benchmark. This is because our portfolio has a relatively high exposure to entities within those sectors offering services associated with higher GHG emissions-and thus higher transition risks-such as waste management and environmental services. However, those sectors have a low overall weighting in our portfolio.\n\nUnder the current policies scenario, we observe low impact levels on asset valuation. The bonds in our corporate credit portfolio tend to mature before the strongest climate-related risks materialize.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This finding is similar to 2022 reporting. Compared with 2022, we see only a minor reduction in the impact on asset valuations. Given the almost unchanged regional and sectoral diversification for 2022 and 2023, the changes in impact on valuation compared with previous reporting is mainly driven by changes in the model variables. Due to a decrease in marginal abatement costs and carbon pricing as model input variables, impact valuation levels have decreased for the real estate portfolio, with the biggest impact in the net-zero 2050 scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.6 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - Investment Management (continued)\n\nMore than 80 percent of our direct real estate investments are in Europe with an overweight in Switzerland and Germany. Under all the climate scenarios, our portfolio is most exposed to rising temperatures in Southern Europe,\n\nOur main focus is the rapid decarbonization of our Swiss portfolio, which still uses mostly oil and gas for heating and producing warm water in residential buildings. To transform this portfolio, we have initiated several strategic investment programs to achieve our 2025 emission reduction target. In addition, we are continuing with our energy optimization project in Switzerland. The project, which started in 2014, has already led to a reduction in carbon emissions of more than 20 percent, compared with our 2010 baseline.\n\n## Conclusions and responses\n\nUnder the current assumptions from our climate scenario model simulation assessment, we observe that climate change-related risk to asset valuation would not pose a major risk to our capital position . The assessment shows that climate-related risks appear well diversified through our listed equity, corporate credit and real estate portfolios. However, as climate change-related risks can rapidly evolve and materialize faster than expected, we will conduct regular monitoring and active management of the risks. Our assessment shows that the most material climate-related risks-and thus higher modelled impact on valuation-appear for carbon-intensive sectors. We are already addressing these risks through a bottom-up approach with our emission reduction targets and coal, oil sands and oil shale exclusion policies.\n\nWe believe that our multi-faceted responsible investment strategy is adequately flexible to adapt to climate-related risks highlighted by this analysis and will continue to strengthen our practices to help us remain resilient to emerging risks. As a part of our responsible investor approach and our long-standing practice of ESG integration, we apply a specific security selection process, which takes into account good ESG practices and climate risks in the investment decision process. With respect to our exclusion policies, we have divested from equity holdings by December 2021, stopped investing in new debt and run-off existing holdings of companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues from mining or extracting thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale, or that generate more than 30 percent of their electricity from thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale.\n\nOur structured and disciplined investment management approach is carefully crafted to match liabilities, minimize unrewarded risks and remain stable throughout the macroeconomic cycle. The resulting portfolio is highly diversified across asset classes, sectors and geographies. On an issuer level, both transition risks and opportunities are reflected through thorough ESG integration.\n\n## Strategic implications for overall investment management portfolio\n\nOur strategic response to the climate change-related risks we observe is our long-term commitment to decarbonize our investment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. To support our net-zero commitment, we have set interim targets for engagements, financing solutions and emission reductions and have further strengthened our policy toward high emitting sectors.\n\nTo reach our interim targets for 2025, our near-term priorities include:\n\n- - Engaging with companies which have not yet set science-based emission reduction targets and convince them to do so and set up credible transition plans,\n- - Urge companies to exit coal-based business models by 2040 (2030 for OECD countries) at the latest.\n- - Enhancing our systematic approach to investee, asset manager engagement and policy advocacy.\n- - Following the TCFD recommendations to help us to better understand the climate-related risks of our portfolios and thus improve our ability to appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nTo strengthen the decarbonization path of our investment portfolio, we have implemented an oil and gas policy for private debt investments in 2023. In addition to the group-wide exclusion on thermal coal, oil sand and oil shales, Zurich will not provide private debt financing of projects in the Arctic 1 and in new oil and gas upstream projects. We further specified investment boundaries for mid- and downstream projects, subject to local governance. Please see more details on sustainability risk on www.zurich.com/sustainability/strategy-and-governance/sustainability-risk.\n\nWhile i ncreasing the resilience of our portfolio against climate transition risks , our decarbonization strategy also contributes to limiting the physical climate risks showcased in the current policies scenario, which may materialize in our portfolio over the long-term. In addition to our emissions reduction target, we mitigate climate-related risks with our additional commitment of investing in climate solutions (our 5 percent impact investing target).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.7 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - own Operations and supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Own Operations and supply chain\n\n- In 2023, we conducted an additional assessment to consider climate risks for our offices, data centers and critical suppliers around the world. 1 The results of this analysis show that remediating strategies currently in force are sufficient to mitigate climate risk.\n\n## Analysis scope and approach\n\n## Approach\n\nWe performed a scenario-based assessment of physical and transition risks with quantification performed for 2030 and 2050. The assessment of physical risks utilized a third-party model and data. 2\n\n## Scenarios used\n\nWe conducted an assessment of physical perils and transition risks to understand exposure level and criticality under two scenarios; net-zero 2050 and current policies.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe assessment considered:\n\n- - Offices with current lease terms greater than 10 years (13 locations).\n- - All strategic data centers (10 locations).\n- - Suppliers performing services with the highest level of criticality (according to internal supplier criticality classification system) for the Group, or for multiple business units (138 supplier locations).\n\n## Quantification\n\nThe physical risk assessment compared the variation in exposure levels between 2030 and 2050, with a focus on the degree of change. For supplier locations, an additional review was conducted on concentration risk identified in India. The qualitative hazard levels are based on specific physical parameters for each peril and include flood, wind, temperature, drought, hail, wildfire, precipitation, thunderstorms (lightning) and coastal flooding. The transition risk assessment involved the quantification of potential operational costs we are likely to incur as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nIn 2023 our assessment focused on leased offices with a term greater than 10 years and also included ongoing monitoring of our strategic data center locations. We refreshed the supply chain assessment with higher quality supplier address data. This data came from the implementation of the Group Third-Party Governance Framework (TPGF).\n\nThe monitoring work confirmed results noted in previous years' assessments: Severity of hazard exposure is not expected to drastically change from current levels.\n\nAll critical processes performed at these office locations are included in business continuity plans , which contain appropriate recovery strategies aligned to a 'loss of premises' scenario. These plans are reviewed and updated on an annual basis to address any changes in the threat landscape (e.g., energy crisis, pandemic, etc.). Based on the severity of threats highlighted and the fact there is little change to these threats over the evolving time periods, it is expected that these mitigation measures will continue to provide operational readiness of critical processes during disruptive events.\n\nBackup data centers provide resilience for all regional strategic data centers. 3 Based on the current trend of moving applications from centralized data centers owned by the organization to cloud-based solutions, it could be assumed that the risk relating to the loss of strategic data centers may reduce over time as services become more decentralized.\n\nCertain supplier locations (especially in India) are already exposed to high and very high physical risks and have shown high levels of resilience without directly experiencing any material service outages. While the analysis shows that the number of locations at high and very high risk is likely to increase, this risk is already actively managed by us and our suppliers. Measures including hybrid working practices, the adoption of 'software as a service' and cloud technologies by us and our suppliers, reduces the potential impact of property unavailability due to physical risk.\n\nWe evaluate supplier business resilience measures for suppliers of critical services as part of its ongoing due diligence and monitoring processes under the TPGF. Where required and relevant, plans are tested and periodically reviewed. Contracts often include specific clauses regarding business continuity and disaster recovery.\n\n- 1 The risk assessment of our own operations excludes certain businesses such as Farmers Group, Inc., Cover-More, Joint Ventures and other small subsidiaries. The supply chain assessment includes the spend of approximately USD 2 billion annually managed centrally by Zurich's Procurement and Vendor Management function on goods and services that are required to enable us to maintain and develop our operations.\n- 2 Climate data sourced from Jupiter Intelligence, ClimateScore Global v2.3, Oct. 2021.\n- 3 Large range impacts affect cities, regions or countries; distance between data centers >500km.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.1.7 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - own Operations and supply chain (continued)\n\nIt is acknowledged that we have a degree of concentration risk due the number of locations operated by suppliers providing critical services and there is a requirement for our functions and countries to evaluate this under our internal policy framework and implement any reasonable mitigation actions. We use a software tool that employs artificial intelligence to screen news reports, social media posts and weather forecasts/reports to identify and monitor potential interruptions in the supply chain.\n\nTransition risk exposure was also evaluated in 2023. This involved an evaluation of the potential operational costs we may incur as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy to mitigate climate change. We don't believe that any of the identified transition risks with relevance to our operations, such as risks arising from the introduction of global carbon taxes or the development of new low-carbon technologies, are likely to have a material impact on us given the lowcarbon intensity of the operations of the insurance sector and our approach to continuously improve the way we manage operational sustainability risks and opportunities.\n\n## 4.1.8 Other climate risk assessment outcomes\n\nOur climate risk assessment includes consideration of both litigation and reputational risks.\n\nLitigation risk: Though not a focus of our scenario analysis, some current litigation drivers were considered in specific areas of our in-depth analysis. None were identified as a material risk driver in the medium term. We closely monitor developments potentially impacting litigation-related risks and take actions to address them proactively.\n\nReputational consequences: We recognize the heightened public scrutiny that accompanies our climate-related ambitions and that any failure (real or perceived) to deliver on our objectives and targets could have an impact on our reputation. We believe a strong internal focus on delivery, coupled with monitoring through the governance structures described in Chapter 3 (see pages 135 to 136) and transparent public disclosure on progress, mitigate this risk.\n\n## 4.1.9 Portfolio level scenario-based climate risk analysis - conclusion\n\nOur annual portfolio-level scenario-based climate risk analysis considers our operations and material business activities across underwriting and investments.\n\n- - Overall, our P&C portfolio demonstrated relatively little movement compared with 2022, with no material shifts observed in industry or line of business mix. Consequently, modeled medium-term impacts are contained to the property and fossil fuel lines of business, with aggregate impacts across in-scope line of business considered to remain low. With our portfolio mix remaining stable, no broad adaptations are required to in-force responses which we can adapt to balance near-term market movements against the mid-term strategic scenario expectations.\n- - The scope of our Life protection analysis was increased and although medium-term impacts to demand were noted to be more material than previous assessments, increases were not sufficient to warrant additional responses.\n- - Similar outcomes are noted across our proprietary investments where analysis of key asset classes demonstrates a largely unchanged risk profile with physical risk having impact in few sectors to which we have limited exposure, and where transition risk primarily impacts carbon intensive sectors.  In line with 2022, observed impacts do not suggest material risk to our capital position.\n\nAnalysis of our operations suggests existing business continuity planning for critical processes are sufficient to address observed physical risk impacts while transition risk analysis does not suggest material financial impacts under the scenarios considered.\n\nIn line with previous cycles, analysis outcomes suggest that our customer-focused approach and diversified portfolios, supported by strong risk management practices, continue to provide the resilience and flexibility necessary to be able to adapt to the climate change impacts observed.\n\nWe caveat these conclusions by acknowledging the hypothetical nature of the underlying scenarios, the uncertainty inherent in scenario modeling over the timeframes considered and the somewhat conservative modeling of physical and transition risk. As the effects of climate change gradually increase over the coming decades, adaptation efforts at the individual, company and state level will increase and provide resilience against expected impacts. This is likely to reduce societal and economic losses, however the details heavily depend on uncertain societal and technological developments. On the other hand, exceeding tipping points, such as accelerated melting of Antarctic ice sheets or permafrost thawing, could lead to large-scale discontinuities in the global climate systems and accelerate the impacts from physical climate risk. We believe our strategy of continually analyzing changing risk profiles and retaining customer focus gives us the flexibility required to maintain our resilience and continue to meet the needs of our customers as climate-related risk profiles evolve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Sustainability ExCo Sponsor is responsible for monitoring progress with respect to sustainability priorities and targets and reporting thereon to the Board's GNSC, the Group CEO and ExCo.\n\nThe GNSC has been mandated by the Board to oversee the Group's approach and conduct with regard to sustainability. Oversight with respect to sustainability risks, including risks associated with environmental topics such as climate change and nature loss, is achieved through regular updates from the Sustainability ExCo Sponsor and the Group Head of Sustainability, who present updates on material topics to the GNSC on a quarterly basis. The GNSC receives regular performance updates on climate-related targets, while the ExCo sponsor for Sustainability confirms the consolidated set of material actions arising from scenario-based climate risk analysis with the Group ExCo for Group CEO approval, and reports same to the Board's GNSC. In addition to this, the GNSC was engaged on several strategic topics throughout 2023, including operational emissions and our approach to both transition planning and sustainability performance management.\n\nWithin their assigned function or business, each ExCo member and CEO direct report is also accountable for sustainability, including climate and nature. Responsibilities for such a role include contributing to the development and implementation of the Group's climate-transition planning, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, managing progress against climate-related corporate targets and value chain engagement on climaterelated issues. Furthermore, environmental topics, including climate change, are considered as part of merger, acquisition and divestment due diligence and decision-making processes.\n\nOversight regarding the implementation of climate-related objectives in the business, functions, regions and countries is facilitated through the SLC. Further, progress toward climate-related targets across regions and countries is discussed at least annually as part of regular business performance review meetings. This is in addition to regular monitoring performed at Group level across key business functions.\n\nFurther information on sustainability risk and its governance is set out in the risk review (see pages 250 to 251). Further information on our metrics and targets is available in section 4.4 Metrics and targets of this report (see pages 164 to 179).\n\n## 4.3 Risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The processes used by the organization to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks\n\nPeter Giger Group Chief Risk Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3.1 Integration of climate risk within the overall risk management framework\n\nWe consider impacts from climate change to be drivers for other risks, such as market or natural catastrophe risks, which are managed within our existing risk management framework. Our approach to managing climate risk is embedded in our multi-disciplinary, Group-wide risk management framework, following the same objectives of informed and disciplined risk taking. The risk management framework is based on a governance process that sets forth clear responsibilities for taking, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. These responsibilities are:\n\n- - To identify, assess, manage, monitor and report risks including (but not limited to) climate change, that can have an impact on the achievement of our strategic objectives, we apply a proprietary Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology standard (TRP). This assessment\n\nconsiders our planning horizon and allows us to classify risks according to their materiality based on the estimated severity and the likelihood of the risk materializing. This creates a relative rating for all risks, including specific aspects of climate risk (e.g., physical and transition risks), and, by definition, the prioritization of risk mitigation. Further, it supports the definition and implementation of mitigating actions. At Group level, this is an annual process involving senior management, followed by regular reviews and updates by management.\n\n- - To take the longer-term nature of climate change into account, we complement our TRP with portfolio-level scenariobased climate risk analysis. This provides an outlook on long-term risk developments relevant to our underwriting and investment portfolios, as outlined in the strategy section (see pages 138 to 161). The details of our risk management framework and risk type are outlined in the risk review (see pages 225 to 226).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.3.2 Managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes\n\nAs outlined in the strategy section (see pages 138 to 161), changes in physical risks related to long-term 1 climate change could, over time, impact us through the property-related business via affected severity and probability of climate-related natural catastrophes. This is, in part, mitigated by the flexible nature of our underwriting portfolio, with contracts that are typically renewed annually. We recognize that the climate has been changing already in the past decades with impacts such as land-ice melt and rise in sea levels, that need to be considered in our assessment of physical risk. It is, however, clear that climate science indicates the greatest changes in physical risks related to climate change will occur over the longer term. We have established sophisticated natural catastrophe modeling capabilities to manage our underwriting selection, so that accumulations stay within intended exposure limits. The resulting view of natural catastrophe risk also underpins profitability assessments and strategic capacity allocation and guides the type and quantity of reinsurance we buy. To be globally consistent, natural catastrophe exposures are modeled centrally.\n\nThird-party models provide a starting point for the assessment of natural catastrophe risk. However, they are generally built for the market average and need validation and adjustment by specialized teams to reflect the best view of risk. We have been a leader in natural catastrophe model validation since 2005 when we developed our proprietary 'Zurich View' of risk. This gives us nearly two decades of experience in applying a structured and quantitative approach to optimize our risk view. To arrive at the 'Zurich View', which also aims to reflect the impact of potential climate change that happened until today already, models are adjusted in terms of frequency, severity and event uncertainty.\n\nAdjustment factors address potential losses from non-modeled, property-related exposures or secondary perils to the extent not covered by the third-party models. Every catastrophe event provides an opportunity to learn from our own claims experience and the modeling framework provides a place to capture the new insights. We constantly review and expand the scope and sophistication of our modeling and strive to improve data quality by leveraging technology.\n\nWe supplement internal know-how with external knowledge (e.g., the Advisory Council for Catastrophes). We are a shareholder in PERILS AG, Switzerland, a catastrophe exposure and loss data aggregation and estimation firm. We are also a member of the open-source initiative Oasis Loss Modeling Framework and rejoined the Global Earthquake Model Foundation as a governor sponsor in 2023.\n\nCatastrophe models based on historical data do not capture potential, much longer-term shifts of extreme weather events related to climate change. However, when combined with general circulation models (GCMs), which build representations of the Earth's physical climate systems, catastrophe models can help us understand the risk of future climate conditions. The quality of GCMs continues to evolve as scientific understanding of the Earth's climate systems increases and as progress is made in computing power and artificial intelligence. This science is evolving, and we have strengthened our catastrophe modeling team with dedicated resources to create methodologies to integrate forwardlooking aspects into our modeling approach.\n\n## 4.3.3 Portfolio level, scenario-based climate risk analysis\n\nAssessments of the resilience of our business model to potential climate risks over time periods extending beyond the financial cycle are performed using scenario analysis. To achieve a consistent Group view on potential climate change pathways, scenarios selected for this analysis underpin all assessments Group wide, unless other local regulatory requirements exist. Assessment granularity and timeframes can be tailored to the specific requirements of the assessment.\n\nAn integrated modeling approach, leveraging a third-party model, is adopted for the analysis of our underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios to ensure, as much as possible, the consistent use of assumptions. To quantify impacts on Group assets, the model adopts a bottom-up approach to analyze the exposures of businesses and industries to physical and transition risk. To provide a map of vulnerabilities, it uses asset-level data on relevant risk drivers, including carbon emissions, abatement options, exposure to physical risks (including location-based exposure to acute physical risks), exposure to the greening of the economy, dependency on fossil fuels and competitiveness.\n\nThe strength of this bottom-up approach is that it provides a coherent framework for analyzing climate change-related risk at the industry and corporate sector level. Given the flexibility of our business model, in both our underwriting and asset portfolios and the static balance sheet approach adopted, scenario-based climate risk analysis is performed in the full recognition that it represents a theoretical 'what if' analysis. It is a useful approach which can serve to stretch management thinking about the much longer-term outlook and to address consistency of disclosures expected through the TCFD framework, but it does not provide insights from an immediate solvency, financial or capacity management perspective.\n\nData underpinning the assessment of impacts on group assets are used in conjunction with premium and loss data to model impacts on our insurance business in a bespoke process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This implies quantified impacts assume no strategic reaction from us to the risks identified, and no movements in pricing to adapt to changing conditions.\n- - Scenario analysis is performed using year end 2022 financial data supplemented with latest available emissions data.\n- - Modeled impacts of acute physical risks on expected losses are, to every extent possible, based on our own natural catastrophe modeling. We work with a third-party model which enables us to search publicly available hazard data by type of hazard. We will expand our in-house modeling to cover a wider range of physical risks and this will be included in our own catastrophe modeling results.\n- - While the bottom-up approach adopted by the underlying model facilitates granular analysis of climate changerelated risk, the model depends on certain assumptions, namely:\n- - The assumption of smooth transitioning, as capital moves from carbon-intensive to low-carbon activities without bottlenecks or frictions (e.g., costs are passed to consumers), leads to a muted 'cost of transition', despite the carbon prices assumed in the underlying scenarios.\n- - The assumption of perfect information, where action is only taken once new policies are in place, omits an important uncertainty effect.\n- - Complex hazards such as inland floods, severe convective storms, tropical and extra-tropical storms including coastal flooding are assessed by catastrophe models that rely on simplified assumptions.\n- - For our own Operations, internal physical risk analysis of proprietary and third-party data was used.\n\n## For further details on our risk management process and supporting committees:\n\n- u See the risk review on pages 225 to 226.\n\n## 4.4 Metrics and targets\n\nWe use numerous indicators across our underwriting and investment activities, as well as our own operations, to monitor, assess and manage climate-related impacts to, and of, our business. This section outlines the main targets underpinning our climate strategy and lists the key performance indicators (KPIs) we track.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n## 4.4.1 Our targets\n\nOur commitment to net-zero focuses primarily on supporting emissions reduction in the real economy. We believe we can best achieve this by focusing our approach on engagement with customers and investees and accompanying their transition. This reflects our principle, which holds that the private economy's most effective contribution to fighting climate change derives from assisting, incentivizing, and asking our investee companies, insurance customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to embark on their own decarbonization pathways. We hold ourselves accountable to the same expectations through leading by example with our own operations.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- - Assess impact on underwriting volumes of key sectors, lines of business and geographies due to climate risks in 2030 (relative to the baseline scenario)\n\n## Method\n\n- - Impact on demand due to change in climate-related exposure\n- - Impact on expected losses arising from transition and physical risks\n\n## Conduct portfolio level risk assessment\n\n## Objectives\n\n- - Identify key risks and opportunities (for risk management framework and disclosure)\n- - Quantification of portfolio level impact on underwriting\n\n## Method\n\n- - Building on analysis in steps one and two, quantify impacts on underwriting volumes in 2030 (relative to baseline) due to climate risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They represent a combination of metrics derived from the SASB and WEF IBC standards expanded with further metrics of our own, in line with guidance from the TCFD.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon intensity\n\nLeveraging the accounting method for insurance associated emissions, published by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) in November 2022, we have already performed a first analysis of our insurance-associated emissions. This work will also form the\n\nbaseline for our future targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revenues from energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies 1\n\nOur products related to energy efficiency and low-carbon technology, separately priced, amounted to USD 424 million in 2023 (USD 155 million in 2022). This was mainly driven by the uptake of a new solution in 2023 on portable electronics insurance with premiums of USD 132 million where\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrepair is the priority, in the case that damage has occurred, the device is repaired almost all of the time. Owing to a shift from ICE to EV solutions from existing and new customers across the market we saw an increase in revenues of USD 77 million. We have also seen an increase in renewable energy solutions premium providing for USD 20 million of the movement in 2023.\n\nFor more information on all our sustainable solutions, please see section 5.1.1 Revenues from sustainable solutions on pages 182 to 185.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Underwriting and Investment Management\n\n## Thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale\n\nOur thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale engagement campaign officially ended after a two-year period in June 2021. Our restricted equity exposure had been divested by end of 2021 across all local entities (monitored and reviewed periodically), while our corporate credit was either sold or these securities were allowed to mature. Where we were aware of relevant exposure in our underwriting portfolio, those companies have been assessed and relationships exited in line with our exclusion policy. 2\n\nIn line with our thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale policy, we continue to screen new investments and potential customers for involvement in policy-relevant activities. We will not insure or invest in companies that exceed our thresholds and do not have near-term commitments in place to bring themselves below these limits. As such, companies will be added to our exclusion screen before any business relationship has been established. This will not impact the amount of divestments or phased-out insurance premiums.\n\nExisting customers and investee companies have the potential to become relevant for our exclusion policy through mergers or divestments. We will continue to monitor for such developments using third-party data sources but we will not separately report on such cases due to their low impact on our portfolio.\n\nIn line with our overarching net-zero targets for our insurance and investment portfolios, our performance management focus will move from individual sector exclusions to tracking our overall portfolio decarbonization and engagement targets. We monitor the progress of customer and investee companies against our thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale thresholds through third-party data and direct engagements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement for the transition\n\n## Company engagement\n\nEngagement is a key mechanism for investors seeking to mitigate systemic climate risks and work towards net-zero.\n\nIn 2023, we advanced our bilateral net-zero engagement campaign (as illustrated below in Table 4 on page 168). We focused on companies with heavy emissions to understand the company's current emission intensity and their transition plans . In cases where the company has not yet established such a plan, we will work with the company to set up a transition plan with preferably externally validated targets.\n\n- 1 Revenues capture gross written premiums and other fee services.\n- 2 For further information, see section 2.2 Managing risks and opportunities or visit our website: www.zurich.com/sustainability/strategy-and-governance/sustainability-risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company embarked on a journey towards sustainability and decarbonization.\n\nIt acknowledged the challenges in scope 3 emissions accounting for utilities and grappled with the complexities of long-standing gas power plants. Despite these challenges, its ambition to set emission targets and invest in green hydrogen showcased its determination to lead in sustainability and renewable energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This applies to asset managers investing on our behalf in both public and private markets. Asset managers consistently represent the long-term interests of their asset owner clients in their climate-related engagements, particularly when those clients have made their own ambitious climate commitments. This is a key aspect of alignment in the asset manager-owner relationship.\n\nTo ensure alignment between our investment philosophy and our asset managers, we are strengthening our asset manager engagement process to systematically address climate-related stewardship. The aim of our engagement is to:\n\n- 1 Increase asset manager ambition and accountability : We evaluate the strength of asset managers' systematic stewardship efforts related to climate and we integrate that evaluation into our ongoing selection, appointment and monitoring processes. Our annual ESG questionnaire, which includes specific climate-related topics, and review meetings provide input for our internal scoring system . Where we identify areas that do not meet our expectations, we engage on those particular topics and ask for specific commitments to implement improvements . Our aim is to get asset managers to a transparent and consistent reporting.\n- 2 Encourage asset managers to act systemically on our behalf : Asset managers often have long-standing and strong relationships with companies in their portfolios and hold more concentrated positions in companies than us. This gives clear weight and influence to any messaging that asset managers deliver to companies on the need to manage systemic risks. Furthermore, through thought leadership, public discourse and policy engagement, asset managers can help encourage the development of the policy frameworks and economic incentives that are needed to catalyze the systemic shifts that would limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| l EMEA     | 49%   |\n|------------|-------|\n| l Americas | 5%    |\n| l APAC     | 46%   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since the announcement, we have been working on local objective setting, implementation and data improvements. We have broken down the global portfolio target by local business unit and region. This allows us to capture factors such as local market considerations, sector diversification and past and projected pathways of emissions.\n\nWe strongly believe that simply divesting from companies with carbon-intense footprints is less effective than engaging with them to support the shift to sustainable practices. The findings from our engagement efforts, as described above, will help guide us through portfolio construction and rebalancing actions, benchmark changes and, where relevant and as a last resort, divestments. We aim to reach our targets by phasing out exposures to already restricted names under our thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale policy, and active portfolio management. We are taking portfolio construction actions that allow for potential switches to issuers with a lower CO2e footprint and potential divestments for those cases where no valid transition plans are in place and hence where engagement fails.\n\n## Assets under Management: corporate portfolio 1\n\nTable 5\n\n|                              | In scope AuM (USDbn)   |      |            |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|------|------------|\n|                              | 2023                   | 2019 | Difference |\n| Zurich Corporate portfolio 2 | 49.6                   | 58.5 | (15) %     |\n| By investment asset class    |                        |      |            |\n| Listed equity                | 6.7                    | 10.6 | (37) %     |\n| Corporate bonds              | 43.0                   | 47.9 | (10) %     |\n| By region                    |                        |      |            |\n| APAC                         | 5.3                    | 4.5  | 19%        |\n| EMEA                         | 32.0                   | 38.2 | (16) %     |\n| Americas                     | 12.4                   | 15.9 | (22) %     |\n| By sector                    |                        |      |            |\n| Utilities                    | 4.0                    | 4.4  | (8) %      |\n| Government-owned company     | 1.9                    | 2.7  | (28) %     |\n| Energy                       | 1.8                    | 2.1  | (16) %     |\n\n- 1 AuM covers companies listed equities and listed corporate credit.\n- 2 Between 2019 and 2023 the total AuM dropped by 16 percent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

to provide a comprehensive overview, details incl. prior year data are shown in the appendix on pages 206 and 209.\n- 2 Financed emissions cover scope 1 and 2 of underlying companies (listed equities and listed corporate credit) attributed with enterprise value methodology and matched based on most recently available emission data.\n- 3 Emission reporting for Zurich-validated green bonds in the Utility and Energy sectors was refined in 2022 to reflect the nature of the financed projects. Please see the green bond validation methodology in our white paper: www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/responsible-investment-at-zurich.pdf\n\nSince 2019, we have achieved a reduction in the emission intensity of 43 percent . Zurich's absolute financed emissions declined over the same period by 52 percent. This reduction in financed emissions was mainly driven by i) changes in portfolio composition and ii) structural emission reductions of our investee companies .\n\nThe majority of emission intensity reduction since the baseline year 2019, is driven by changes in the investment portfolios due to active decisions on reinvesting matured bond proceeds or new investments into lower emission intensive companies. We also observe an expected further meaningful drop in emissions from companies in run-off under the thermal coal/oil sands policy due to maturing assets in 2023.\n\nAnother large part of the achieved emission intensity reduction is driven by the reduction in emissions reported by the underlying portfolio companies. Our achieved emissions reduction in the energy and utility sectors are mainly driven by emission reduction (scope 1 and 2) by the companies since the 2019 baseline year.\n\nPrevious years have demonstrated the need to consider both absolute and relative indicators when measuring the emission performance of portfolios. Relative indicators are sensitive to changes in company valuation, whereas absolute emissions are sensitive to strategic shifts in asset allocation. Capital market price changes have a significant impact on reported financed emissions based on the formula applied, resulting in the sensitivity of reported targets. In the long run, it remains our view that alignment with the NZAOA methodology will provide us with a stable and robust metric describing the trajectory of our emission reduction pathway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.4.2 Our performance metrics (continued)\n\nFor our direct real estate portfolio, we are aiming to reduce our relative emission intensity by 30 percent by 2025, from a 2019 baseline. Our target includes scope 1 and 2 emissions, the so called 'operational emissions. 1 Carbon emissions intensity has shown a reduction by 6 percent year-on-year and by 25 percent when compared to the baseline year of 2019. Most countries have been actively working towards reducing their emissions, and in 2022, Americas have stood out with year-on-year reductions by 19 percent. These reductions are driven by the implementation of an AI program at two of our office properties. This innovative program utilizes AI technology to optimize the operations of building systems, resulting in a significant reduction in energy consumption . Both buildings witnessed almost a 40 percent overall reduction. The portfolio also benefited from LED retrofit programs and mechanical upgrades at various properties. The completeness of our emission data - measured by the coverage ratio 2 - increased from 65 percent for 2021 to 82 percent for 2022.\n\nEmission reduction target-setting methodology and scope\n\n## Absolute emissions 1\n\n## Relative emissions (intensity)\n\n## Key\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we announced our initial set of interim targets (2025). The targets cover the following:\n\n- - Listed equity, listed corporate debt and direct real estate.\n- - Thirty-six percent of our assets under management in the baseline year of 2019.\n\nWe chose to calculate corporate-financed emissions and the resulting relative emissions intensity using the protocol's preferred approach, which is based on enterprise value, not revenue.\n\nWhile a revenue-based carbon intensity measure is a good way to compare companies based on their size and underlying technology, in line with the NZAOA methodology, we believe the enterprise value approach is a better way to convert a corporation's operational emissions (scope 1+2) into the 'financed emissions.' This can be attributed to company's underlying equity and/or debt investors, who are ready to take additional responsibility for the emissions. To calculate corporate financed emissions, we use the following methodology:\n\n- - Scope 1+2 emissions in line with the GHG protocol are provided by S&P Trucost.\n- I: Current value of investment on issuer i\n\nEV: Enterprise value of issuer i\n\n- C: Carbon emissions* of issuer i\n- * Carbon emissions = scope 1 and scope 2 emissions\n- - Enterprise value is defined as the sum of market capitalization of common stock at fiscal year end, the market capitalization of preferred equity at fiscal year end, and the book values of debt and minorities' interests minus the cash and cash equivalents held by the enterprise. When enterprise value is not available (for example for financial companies) it is substituted with market capitalization. Enterprise value data is provided by S&P Trucost.\n\nMarket value is defined as the market value of listed equities and listed corporate debt at fiscal year end. While all financial data (enterprise value and market value) is calculated as of December 31 of the reporting year, we use the latest available corporate emission data available as of January each year, when portfolio level financed emissions are calculated on an annual basis. This means that emissions data is systematically lagging. For example, financed emissions for 2023 will be largely based on full-year 2022 emissions data, as full-year 2023 emissions data will only be made available by investees in H1 2025, and tends to flow to data providers via CDP submissions in the fourth quarter of a given year.\n\n- 1 In line with PCAF Global GHG Standard, see: carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/PCAF-Global-GHG-Standard.pdf\n\n## Green certified buildings\n\nTo increase transparency and improve the quality of our real estate portfolio, we are aiming to increase the share of green certified buildings in our global real estate portfolio to 30 percent by 2025.\n\n- 1 Scope 1 emissions, also known as direct emissions, are defined as emissions from sources that exist 'on site' of an asset. These include primarily emissions from onsite heating systems. A common example of scope 1 emissions for real estate is natural gas and oil burned onsite. Scope 2 emissions are defined as emissions that are related to purchased electricity, heat, steam or cooling. This energy is consumed by the assets but generated offsite.\n- 2 The coverage ratio is the gross floor area (GFA) in square meters (m2) of completed properties for which data is collected as a percentage of the total GFA area in m2 of all completed properties in the portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are solutions that reduce greenhouse gases by avoiding emissions and/or by sequestering carbon dioxide already in the\n\natmosphere. Further examples of solutions include investments in climate change adaptation that contribute to enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change.\n\nOur targets for financing climate solutions enhance our existing long-term engagement to provide green financing solutions under our impact investing strategy and also count investments in green certified buildings.

As part of this approach, we expect and monitor our asset managers that they integrate ESG factors i.e. to fully reflect the risks and opportunities associated with ESG factors when choosing assets for our\n\nportfolios. We have implemented a global set of policies and investment processes across our entities to ensure a consistent approach to the integration of ESG topics. Through ESG integration we price and manage financially material sustainability risks and opportunities. Investments may also enable economic activities that can have positive impacts on our environment and society. We use various third-party data providers that provide information on the most material ESG risks and opportunities, as well as adverse impacts and ongoing controversies per company in the context of the sector they operate in. We have integrated ESG information, including climate data, into our systems and have information about the environmental, social and governance performance of our portfolios.\n\n- 1 Due to a reevaluation of Austrian assets from green building certification to energy performance certifications the share in 2022 is 22 percent, 3 percent lower than stated in last year's report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsible investment strategy is aimed at successfully managing Zurich's proprietary investment assets, while mitigating costs to the environment and delivering benefits to society. Our strategy is based on three pillars:\n\n- -ESG integration: integrate ESG factors into the investment process - across asset classes and alongside traditional financial metrics while generating superior risk-adjusted, long-term financial returns.\n- -Impact investing : build an impact investing portfolio that makes a positive contribution to the environment and society, to improve the lives of 5 million people and to help avoid the emission of 5 million metric tons of CO2e per year.\n- -Advancing together : make responsible investment mainstream through interaction with other industry participants and engaging with policy makers to build markets in which ESG risk is priced efficiently and decarbonization is incentivized.\n\n## Investment portfolio managed by responsible investors\n\nTable 12\n\n|                                           | Change (2023 to   | Change (2023 to   | Change (2023 to   | Change (2023 to   | Change (2023 to   | Change (2023 to   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                           | 2023              | 2022              | 2022)             | 2021              | 2020              | 2019              |\n| Assets managed by responsible investors 1 | 99.8%             | 99.6%             | 0.3 pts           | 99.6%             | 99.6%             | 98.2%             |\n| Total amount of impact investments        |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| (USD millions)                            | 7,882             | 6,328             | 24.6%             | 7,037             | 5,770             | 4,555             |\n| % of Investment portfolio                 | 4.6%              | 3.8%              | 0.8 pts           | 3.3%              | 2.5%              | 2.2%              |\n| Investment portfolio (USD millions) 2     | 171,200           | 168,478           | (2) %             | 211,334           | 226,389           | 204,803           |\n\n- 1 A United Nations supported PRI signatory or asset manager that fulfills our minimum requirements for ESG integration.

For our in-house asset management, we seek that outcomes of engagements are linked to the proxy voting process to form a consistent active-ownership approach. This means that where engagement as part of our net-zero program fails and companies refuse to set targets after due dialogue, we will vote against board members at shareholder meetings.\n\nProxy voting\n\n## Our voting activities\n\n## Our voting behavior\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVotes cast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVoted with management\n\nl\n\nVoted against management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNo votes cast\n\nl\n\nNo votes cast\n\n86%\n\n14%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n74%\n\n12%\n\n14%",

Planet\n\n- 4.1  Strategy\n- 4.2  Governance\n- 4.3  Risk management\n\n## 4.4  Metrics and targets\n\n- 5. Customers\n- 6. People\n- 7. Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 4.4.2 Our performance metrics (continued)\n\nIn 2023, we voted 86 percent of our in-scope equity. Approximately 80 percent of our equity investments are in scope for proxy voting. 1 The share of voted equity remains stable over the past years, reflecting the successful full rollout of proxy voting to Zurich's externally managed equity portfolios. We measure the votes we cast based on assets under management. Reasons for votes not cast are a combination of portfolio turnover, cost/benefit considerations and voting restrictions (such as demands to vote in person, share blocking or requirements that increase the cost of voting).\n\n## Case study\n\nDuring AGM Season 2023, we analyzed and voted on more than 50 climate-related proposals submitted to shareholder votes, endorsing proposals driving sustainable practices and reducing carbon emissions.\n\nFor instance, we used our proxy voting rights during the Annual General Meeting of a major fossil fuel production company to extend our support to a shareholder proposal demanding the establishment of Scope 3 targets. This proposal stressed the critical necessity for the energy company to implement a medium-term emission reduction target specifically addressing greenhouse gas emissions stemming from the utilization of its energy products.\n\nThe decision to lend our support to this proposal was motivated by the notable absence of progress exhibited by the energy company in the realm of climate mitigation, particularly when compared to its peers in the industry. We firmly maintain that companies involved in fossil fuels should have a credible and ambitious transition strategy and should commence this transition without delay to realign their actions with global climate objectives in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n## Impact investing\n\nImpact investments are investment opportunities that allow us to intentionally target a specific and measurable social or environmental impact. Zurich has set a target to help avoid 5 million metric tons of CO2e emissions per year, and, separately, make a positive contribution to the lives and livelihoods of 5 million people through its impact investing portfolio. We also committed to investing 5 percent of our proprietary investment portfolio to impact investments by end 2025, which will help grow our allocation to climate solutions and investments benefiting society.\n\nWe are proud that our impact investment approach won two awards in 2023, recognizing our thought leadership as institutional investor in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, our impact investing portfolio of USD 7.9 billion helped avoid a total of 4.5 million metric tons of CO2e emissions and benefited 4.6 million people . 2 As in the previous year, we see the majority of 'avoided emission' coming from our green, social and sustainability bond portfolio, while private equity is also a large contributor to 'people benefited'.\n\nAfter engaging in impact reporting for several consecutive years, we have witnessed positive changes in the landscape, including a notable increase in standardization and clarity. The dedication to precision in both reported and actual impact measures reflects heightened efforts by impact managers, particularly in measuring the real impact post-project development. Additionally, we have noticed a growing trend where impact managers exercise conservatism in defining the scope of reported projects.\n\nFurthermore, our own impact portfolio has undergone transformations due to bond maturities and exits in portfolio companies. These shifts have contributed to the fluctuation in impact numbers on a portfolio level from year to year. Despite this volatility, we view these developments as positive news for the industry, recognizing that enhanced measurement practices lead to more effective impact management.\n\n- 1 Please see proxy voting policy for further details: www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/zurich-proxy-voting-policy-and-guidelines.pdf\n- 2 Please see www.zurich.com/sustainability/customers/investing-responsibly/impact-investment for more details on impact investing approach.

An illustrative example is Zurich's investment in a private equity fund that holds equities in NG Group (NG) since 2017.\n\nNG is an enterprise contributing to sustainable development by repurposing waste from household and industries. Its services extend from waste sorting to mass recycling, including separating contaminated and dangerous waste in order to provide appropriate treatment. Such services are essential to ensure that potentially heavy polluting waste is safely processed and is not discarded in a harmful way to people or the environment. At the other end of its processing line, NG also acts as a market for recovered resources including plastic and other materials linked to the extraction of natural resources. This service is core to its mission of abolishing waste and is a major step towards the circular economy. Zurich's investments helped to avoid approximately 12,000 metric tons CO2e through NG Group recycling activities, such as sending waste to material recycling compared to extracting virgin materials.\n\nWe employ private equity investments to foster a positive impact in supporting NG's mission to advance the circular economy. Zurich's investment in NG is aimed at facilitating innovative business models that enable the repurposing, reutilization and repair of materials already in circulation for a transition to the low carbon economy.\n\n## Advancing together\n\nResponsible investment will only have an impact if this approach becomes mainstream. Supporting collaborative initiatives and joining member-led organizations to advance responsible investment practices forms an integral part of our approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| l Green, Social and Sustainability bonds   | 53.7%   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|\n| l Impact private equity                    | 45.7%   |\n| l Impact infrastructure private debt       | 0.7%    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.6 million people benefited by positive contribution to their lives and livelihoods",

The framework follows four core principles:\n\n## Transparency:\n\nWe report on the carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) of the following sources of emissions to track progress towards our science-based targets for reducing emissions, in line with efforts to cap global temperature rise at 1.5\u00b0C: 1\n\n- - Scope 1 emissions from fleet and onsite heating in our workplaces.\n- - Scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity, heat and steam in our workplaces.\n- - Scope 3 emissions from air, rental and rail business travel, employee commuting, strategic data centers, printed paper and waste, as well as indirect energy impact.\n\n## Accountability:\n\nWe set clear targets to demonstrate accountability for our operational footprint. 2 See our operational emissions reduction targets and our performance in the table below.\n\nWe have been carbon neutral since 2014 through the use of high quality offsets, which we apply only after prioritizing emissions reductions. In 2021 we launched our path to net-zero operations with our first carbon removal purchases. 3\n\nZurich also has set an internal price on carbon. In 2023 the price was USD 50 per metric ton. The price is applied to actual emissions to determine the value of our carbon fund which supports our carbon neutrality and net-zero carbon commitments, and other innovative solutions to drive down emissions from operations, as well as those from other sources related to our business. The fund is governed by the SLC.\n\n## Collaboration:\n\nWe can only be successful if we address sustainability risks and opportunities together. In addition to cross-functional collaboration, which is required internally to deliver our operational sustainability agenda, we focus on: employee engagement including raising awareness of the importance of making responsible and sustainable choices, engagement with our supply chain, and other external stakeholders such as universities, and NGOs to share knowledge, promote research and improve our own understanding of evolving operational sustainability risks and opportunities.\n\n## Continuous improvement:\n\nZurich's operational sustainability is based on a model of continuous improvement of processes: we focus on increasing the quality of our engagement, data transparency, and data coverage.\n\n- 1 Cover-More, Farmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and third party vendors are out of scope.\n\n2 See 3. Governance: embedded in our governance framework on pages 135 to 136.\n\n- 3 For further details about our approach to net-zero in our operations, visit our website: www.zurich.com/sustainability/planet/net-zero-in-operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Final data will be published in Q2 2024 on our website.\n- 4 DEFRA emissions factors for air travel have not been updated to reflect the 2023 revision considering DEFRAs application of 2021 load factors in their most recent calculations. This would have inflated air emissions by an estimated 20% and would not reflect an accurate view of Zurich's travel activity.\n\nIn 2023, we announced the inclusion of an operational emissions target within the LTIP for the Group's senior positions, including the ExCo. The 2023 data still includes an estimation for employee commuting emissions (which are part of the LTIP scope) and facilities data. Further information can be found in the remuneration report on pages 88 and 110.\n\nWe have included estimated emissions for the purpose of presenting a total operational footprint for 2023, 2 comparable to previous years' performance. 3\n\nAs anticipated, we continued to transition to the post pandemic world, hence emissions increased compared to 2022. This was mostly driven by increases to commuting emissions as workers spent more time in the office, and increases in business travel occurred. While we maintain our ambition to keep air emissions 70 percent below 2019 levels in the long run, prioritizing the needs of our customers and partners has resulted in a reduction in air travel emissions of 66 percent. We are watching developments in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market to understand if, in the future, we can supplement minor shortfalls to our ambition with SAF purchases. We continue to make progress towards emissions reductions in our car fleet as we work towards our goal to fully electrify our car fleet by 2029, per our EV100 commitment. 4\n\n- 1 Zurich's environmental reporting methodology follows the GRI Standard, which is based on the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting Standards.

We also defined the experience that we want our customers to have. In 2022, we launched our new customer experience vision: 'Build a meaningful relationship', which aims to transform our transactional sales process and provide a more personalized approach.\n\nIn 2023, we have made visible progress on all our strategic priorities by delivering on our Brand Strategy and our Customer Experience Strategy, enhancing customer capabilities with our employees through structured training programs delivered group-wide, and delivering value to our customers from the optimal and responsible use of customer data, insights and analytics.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.1 Customer experience and customer-centric solutions\n\nTo provide our customers with the experience that we want them to have, we defined the Zurich Customer Experience Standards (Zurich CX Standards), for Retail (2021) and Commercial Insurance (2022) that our entire organization can strive towards. These standards aim to go above and beyond local laws and regulations to address our customers' evolving needs. They cover a range of touchpoints throughout the customer journey and are set at three different levels of ambition to 'meet customer expectations' beyond regulatory requirements, to 'exceed their expectations', and ultimately to 'make us unique in their eyes'.\n\nThese standards inform initiatives at both Group and local level, including the development of sustainable options or alternatives throughout our retail products and services, as well as foster behaviors that consider customers' physical, mental, financial and social wellbeing at all times. We periodically assess each business unit to evaluate our progress against these standards, set targets for improvement and define actions to be taken - obtaining a global view on how our customers experience our brand to date.\n\nInitiatives that help improve performance to meet Zurich's CX Standards are centrally recorded, tracked and mapped against customer KPIs, notably through transactional Net Promoter Score (tNPS) 1 and verbatim, and relational Net Promoter Score (rNPS). Our commitment to providing exceptional customer experiences has led to significant improvements in speed, responsiveness, and empathy across multiple geographies and customer journeys, reflected in a global tNPS increase of 13 points since 2019.\n\nAs an example of how Zurich CX Standards are applied, in 2023, we launched Zurich One: a customer portal and app designed to meet multiple Zurich CX standards, including, for example, digitalizing all customer documents and giving customers the ability to know the status of a process (e.g. a claim) at any given time. The first version of the portal was launched in Italy in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we also expanded to a total of 5 countries and accelerated the implementation of our Customer Centricity Program, successfully introduced in 2022, which aims to meet our promise to our customers by shifting our relationships from transactional to deeper and more meaningful ones that increase loyalty. It is a customer-focused distribution and sales approach based on extensive customer data analytics and improved understanding of customer needs, supported by our centralized Customer Intelligence Platform, where we report and analyze customer data. The program helps inform the development of better and more targeted propositions and campaigns.\n\nWe acknowledge that customers can be exposed to different triggers at different stages of the customer journey which can hinder our ability to deliver on our customer promise. By understanding and anticipating their needs and delivering relevant, personalized propositions and seamless experiences, we contribute to mitigating the risk of designing products, services and experiences that do not meet the needs of our customers.",

A solution must undergo a thorough assessment and meet our stringent criteria to be included and reported as sustainable revenue. Any\n\nnew solutions brought forward by the countries are approved on a quarterly basis by our dedicated advisory group.\n\n## Internal definition of revenues from sustainable solutions\n\nThe term sustainable solution refers to insurance products, add-on coverages, investment products and advisory services that are designed or adapted to support activities that generate a positive environmental or social impact and contribute to the mitigation of climate risks.\n\nThe table below provides detailed examples of revenues from sustainable solutions across three categories (environmental, social and investment).\n\nTable 15\n\n| Revenues from sustainable environmental solutions   | Solutions related to technologies and/or  activities that have an impact on reducing  greenhouse gases, preserve or enhance  biodiversity as well as enable the  responsible use of natural resources.  These solutions aim to mitigate and  support resilience against the adverse  impact of environmental-related risks on  our customers.   | Examples include: -  Insurance coverage for electric  vehicles. - Insurance coverage for carbon  mitigation solutions. - Risk prevention services that contribute  to more customer awareness and  resilience to the adverse impacts of   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues from sustainable social solutions          | Solutions that enhance the social or financial inclusion of socially  disadvantaged people, or are designed to  incentivize healthy lifestyles and safe  behavior.                                                                                                                                                                              | Examples include: - Life protection for customers with  existing chronic diseases such as  diabetes or cancer.                                                                                                                            |\n| Revenues from sustainable investment solutions      | Investment products with a focus on  sustainability both specific, and not- specific, to environmental and social  aspects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Examples include: - Unit-linked products investing in funds  focused on sustainable environmental  and social factors, e.g., ESG funds.                                                                                                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSeveral products incentivize health, safety, and/or environmentally responsible actions/ behaviors for our customers. Here are some examples:\n\nAs part of our workers' compensation proposition in Australia, we assess all physical injury\n\nclaimants for mental health risk factors. If the assessment shows the possibility of poor mental health, we proactively link our customers with support services to help them cope and address any potential mental health issues. This aims to provide assistance to customers who may not have recognized or sought mental health support before.\n\nIn North America, Zurich Resilience Solutions (ZRS) helps customers to have the programs and training they need, to effectively spot potential human trafficking exposures. We also acknowledge that human trafficking is not limited to sex trafficking and provide guidance on how to spot potential exposures in their supply chains.\n\nZRS in the UK offers a service that reviews new build designs and considers property-related issues. These include overall:\n\n- - construction type and system\n- - fire performance from a property protection perspective\n- - flood resilience and resistance measures\n- - potential security exposures and protections and other perils such as escape of water vulnerabilities and suitable prevention measures",

Encouraging this behavior reduces the need to buy new which saves resources and reduces additional carbon generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable solutions meeting our internal criteria generated USD 1.4 billion (1.7 percent of our total gross written premiums, fees and net flows) in revenues during 2023 (USD 801 million in 2022).

This is mainly driven by increased revenues generated from our existing approved sustainable investments solutions category, at USD 129.9 million from unit-linked manged accounts and individual funds, coupled with the contribution from the environmental category (USD 20.9 million mainly through electric vehicle (EV)) solutions from Germany. Switzerland also contributes with an increase in revenues from existing approved EV solutions of USD 20.0 million. This is offset by a reduction in revenues from existing approved solutions in Italy of USD 68.1 million (ESG unit-linked).\n\nNorth America contributes USD 426.4 million (31.4 percent) an increase of USD 189.0 million. The increase from North America is mainly driven by a newly approved environmental solution in 2023 for portable electronics (USD 131.7 million), an appliance warranty product that is a service contract, where repair has priority over replacement. In almost all cases the devices are repaired. We have also seen an increase in the revenue generated from existing, approved renewable energy solutions (USD 24.0 million) and EV solutions (USD 15.2 million).\n\nAPAC region has seen a large increase of USD 237.4 million from our social solutions and is driven by two newly approved solutions in 2023, coming from Japan in personal accident coverage, both for the elderly (USD 196.2 million and low income individuals (USD 70.0 million), with a combined revenue of USD 266.2 million. This has been slightly offset by the sale of some of our business.",

Repair vs replace solutions contribute USD 131.7 million, and renewable energy solutions (USD 81.9 million) provide liability cover for large scale production of renewable energy, i.e. hydro-electric, wind, geothermal and solar, as well as the installation of small photovoltaic systems mounted on balconies to support the power generation on property.\n\nSocial solutions, our biggest contributor with at total of USD 538.9 million, are providing affordable accident and health cover to more exposed individuals i.e., they find it difficult to obtain insurance owing to the nature of their work (gig and truckers) and households with low income (those earning less than the national average in some countries) standing at USD 408.4 million. Our approved Life protection solutions are following the same approach as the accident and health category by providing cover to those who could not ordinarily afford it and contribute USD 79 .0 million.\n\nSustainable investments solutions coming from our ESG unit-linked products are contributing USD 342.2 million to our total sustainable revenues for 2023. These solutions are mainly coming from EMEA region with Germany's savings and pension plan providing for USD 285.3 million, Italy's ESG unit linked pension products contributing USD 38.7 million and Switzerland providing USD 15.0 million from its Green bonds and Zurich Carbon Neutral World Equity Fund. 1",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.1.1 Revenues from sustainable solutions (continued)\n\n## Case study\n\n## Repair vs replace solutions\n\nIn our North America commercial business there are two new solutions for warranties, one an appliance warranty product that is a service contract, where repairing the product has priority over replacement. In the case of damage almost all the time, devices are repaired, thus reducing the electronic waste going to landfill sites. In case of inability to repair, a new device of like kind is used as a replacement.\n\nA second solution specifically focuses on home appliances. Home warranty uses the most resource-efficient (e.g., energy star rating) appliances to replace broken ones. When a replacement is necessary, within the cover there is a directive to source the most energy efficient models or party, therefore encouraging customers to change their behavior.\n\n## Innovative home solution\n\nIn 2023, Hong Kong developed a new home solution in its retail market. The home insurance plan takes a holistic approach to making your property more sustainable by:\n\n- - Providing a referral service to help recycle home electronic goods\n- - Encouraging recycling by incentivizing repair instead of replace with additional claim quotas.\n- - Including the installment of solar panels into the building cover to support the use of renewal energy.\n- - Incentivizing saving electricity with an e-voucher for year-on-year electricity savings.\n\n## 5.1.2 Innovating for our customers\n\nWe believe insurance can make a significant contribution to the change required to achieve the low-carbon transition. We work with customers and collaborate with public and private organizations to develop innovative solutions that enhance resilience and help prevent or minimize damage and harm from climate-related perils. Our insurance and risk management solutions are developing with the release of new technologies, business models and approaches that are needed to achieve a climate-neutral economy. Our expertise helps with the management of the associated risks during implementation. We use capital markets to search for and fund solutions to many pressing social or environmental issues. Our sustainable revenues provide our customers with innovative solutions, for example, one life insurance solution includes additional services to promote a healthy lifestyle, such as an active health program, nutritional consultation, health check, and second medical opinion without any extra cost to the customer.\n\n## Climate Resilience offering\n\nZurich Resilience Solutions advisory service builds on more than a decade's experience i n Zurich's natural hazards assessment methodology, expanding to climate change and addressing needs beyond immediate insurance requirements.\n\nOur dedicated Climate Resilience team brings together experts in multiple disciplines, all of which are needed in order to assess the impact of climate change on a customer's operations and propose adaptation measures. From climate data, data analytics, mathematics, atmospheric and environmental science, to engineers specialized in climate change and natural hazards resilience assessments - we put our knowledge and data to work to assist customers in their climate adaptation journey. The output of our service helps businesses better understand how climate change risk may affect their operations, strategy and financial position. It also helps them complete their climate disclosure requirements (i.e. TCFD, EU-mandated disclosures and other relevant frameworks) and ultimately strengthen their resilience to climate risks.\n\n2023 was another year where many more organizations had additional requirements to act on climate risk, motivated by climate-related losses, disclosure requirements or stakeholder demands. In response to this need, we have expanded our offering in the following ways:\n\n- - We enhanced our capabilities and increased the range and diversity of expertise and skill sets in our team.\n- - Our climate resilience portal evolved further, to meet customer demand and needs. It reflects the needs of a wide range of stakeholders in our customer organizations who are using our portal to better visualize and communicate climate risks, leading to a clearer strategy on implementation of adaptation measures. The output of the climate resilience portal maps the evolution of elements critical to business under different climate scenarios and time horizons. Part of the output is also the prioritization of high-risk sites, for a deeper analysis of their vulnerabilities, allowing the development of a climate adaptation plan.\n- - We served customers from multiple industries, extending our services from the corporate to the local government sector.\n- - We formed an alliance with an external consulting firm in order to provide customers with a holistic view of climate risk, both from a physical and a transition risk perspective.",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.1.2 Innovating for our customers (continued)\n\n## Unit-linked business\n\nWe continue our strong focus on responsible investment in the Life and Wealth Business. It is our ambition to provide each customer with a range of investment solutions that not only meet our high-quality standards, but also their sustainability preferences and beliefs. There is a combination of Group-wide and local initiatives underlining this effort.\n\nOur Zurich Carbon Neutral World Equity Fund is a strong example of our Group initiatives which was launched in 2021. The fund combines a well-diversified investment in global equities across developed markets with a low carbon investment strategy and carbon-offsetting. 1 The fund is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and is available in eight different countries. As of December 2023, the fund had net flows of EUR 267 million with Assets under Management reaching EUR 591 million.\n\nSince the fund's launch, we have received positive feedback from our customers and distributors, which has inspired us to expand and refine our offering. In May 2023, we introduced a revised benchmark for the Zurich Carbon Neutral World Equity Fund, adding a sustainable investment threshold at the benchmark level as well as requiring an increased share of green revenues from the fund's investment holdings. We also applied stricter exclusions related to controversial sectors. We implemented these tighter investment restrictions to further improve the sustainability profile of the fund. The fund's benchmark index is overseen by an external service provider.\n\nIn addition to the Group-wide initiatives, we are proud of local initiatives that further demonstrate our commitment. One example from Germany, is the Managed Accounts ETF Climate Focus, which received the Cash Financial Advisor Award in 2022. Building on this success, the proposition was onboarded in 2023 by Deutsche Bank, the largest distribution partner of Zurich Germany, and is included in the offerings to its customers.\n\n## Zurich Global Ventures\n\nFocused on innovating the customer experience, Zurich Global Ventures develops digital products and services to help individuals and businesses be better prepared for the future. Where insurance traditionally provides customers with risk transfer, Zurich Global Ventures also helps customers prevent risks. This includes supporting customers in their sustainability journeys to help them address expanded environmental and societal issues. Here are some key initiatives:\n\nLiveWell encourages users to improve their wellbeing through a behavioral science approach, spanning physical, mental, social and financial health, and enters partnerships to build a broad wellbeing and 'do good' ecosystem. In 2023, together with the Z Zurich Foundation and based on materials developed and field tested by UNICEF, it launched Connecting Generations, a new digital tool - available to anyone, at any time - to help caregivers better support their own mental wellbeing and that of the adolescents and the young people they care for.\n\nCover-More continuously innovates to help travelers stay connected, are protected and safe at every step of their journeys. In 2023, it established a third sophisticated Command Center in the UK, which together with the existing centers in Canada and Australia, give travelers unprecedented access to 24/7 travel risk management and assistance services. With its ability to provide travelers with real-time, proactive safety information and tap-to-call assistance at their fingertips, Cover-More's app for leisure travelers was awarded the prestigious 'Travel Insurance Product Innovation of 2023' 2 Another example is Cover-More's digital-first proposition, Freely, which allows travelers to tailor their policies on the go to ensure they are protected at all times. Equipped with motion detection functionality, the Freely app can sense when a customer gets, for example, on a motorbike. The customer is then prompted to ensure they have the right cover insurance for that activity, and if they don't, they can purchase it straight away through the app and get protection in minutes.\n\nBOXX, a cyber-security company which Zurich Global Ventures has invested in, has the purpose to make the digital world a safer place. Through its prevention, mitigation and recovery solutions, BOXX helps build more digitally resilient communities - supporting individuals, families, and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\n- 1 For the carbon offsetting, Zurich partners with one of the largest REDD+ peat swamp forest projects in the world. REDD+ is a United Nations-backed framework that aims to curb climate change by stopping the destruction of forests. REDD stands for 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation'; the '+' signifies the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.\n- 2 Travel Product Innovation award - Awarded by the International Travel & Health Insurance Journal (ITIJ).",

Customer retention rate for retail remains stable across most markets, despite economic pressure due to rate increases and a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we have accelerated our partnership building capabilities, broadened our access to large customer bases and enriched the experiences we deliver through them. This has resulted in strong acquisition rates through the growth of our core customer base as well as key partnership renewals in Germany, Spain, UK, Brazil and Chile.\n\nCommercial Corporate Life & Pensions (CLP) 2\n\nRetention rate 2023\n\n## 93.5%\n\nOur Corporate Life and Pensions (CLP) business has 51,594 customers globally 2 . CLP enjoys long-term relationships with customers due to its proven relationship management model, with dedicated specialists both locally and globally who focus on our strategic distributor and customer relationships. In 2023, we grew the customer base by 8.5 percent, primarily driven by innovative products and distribution channels in markets including Australia (Zurich Corporate Care product) and Italy (4care partnership), the successful launch of a digital SME portal in the UK, and growth in our employee benefits captive and Europe Freedom of Service businesses. CLP continues to invest in technology platforms so that it can both reach new customers and serve existing customers better and more efficiently.\n\nFigure 29\n\nCommercial Insurance - P&C 3\n\nPremium retention rate 2022\n\nPremium retention rate 2023\n\n## 87.8%\n\n## 88.6%\n\nIn Commercial Insurance, we have continued to execute our customer-focused strategy throughout 2023, successfully achieving customer growth and premium retention whilst maintaining underwriting discipline. Adoption and commitment to our Customer Experience Standards has reinforced our focus on the needs of both our existing and new customers. This has enabled us to achieve desired retention levels while attracting new customers to the portfolio. Our ongoing pursuit of success in maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty is a multifaceted approach and through the roll out of our Broker Experience Standards (Zurich BX Standards) we have continued to build upon the existing strong relationships with both our valued customers and trusted distribution partners. These partnerships extend across multiple geographies and segments, enabling us to effectively serve a diverse range of clients and seize opportunities for growth.\n\n- 1 The customer retention rate is calculated based on retail core customers, excluding our affinity partners in Brazil, Germany, Indonesia P&C, as well as the joint ventures in Banco Sabadell and Banco Santander due to the lower degree of operational control we have on the retention rate of these customers.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.3 Fair and transparent advice and engagement\n\nIn line with our Group's Code of Conduct, we strive to manage the risk of poor outcomes for our customers and conduct our business in a way that treats them fairly. We believe that clear and transparent communication is critical to mitigating the risks that our customers face throughout their journey with us and empower them to make informed decisions and choices for themselves. The Zurich Code of Conduct outlines key behaviors that guide and inspire us to work with the highest ethical, legal and professional standards. We have a Global Customer-Facing Conduct (CFC) framework 1 in place to support strong customer management, including fair communication practices, in all our business units.\n\nCFC refers to the activity undertaken to maximize the likelihood of fair and positive outcomes for our customers. The CFC framework at Zurich is designed to support business units in identifying, evaluating and mitigating the risks related to customer-facing conduct. It also supports in developing detective and preventive control activities in existing processes across the customer lifecycle. Group Compliance supports and advises the business to enable effective management of CFC risks in alignment with the changing needs of our customers, new business models and the continued evolution of expectations from regulators and other stakeholders.\n\n## Listening to our customers\n\nWe continue to evolve our customer experience by listening to and acting on customer feedback through our tNPS programs. We surveyed around 1.25 million customers in 2023 across our business and acted based on their feedback. Actions ranged from local optimizations of processes to more sizeable and Group-led measures. One example is the improvement of customer experience at our Retail Protection service call center in the UK, which piloted our new Customer Empathy Training program to empower call handlers to tailor the call experience to the customer, embedding our Customer Experience Standards around delivering personalized experiences and leading with empathy. This resulted in an improvement of +22.8 points in our tNPS score for this touchpoint over a period of six months. Global and targeted actions to improve the customer experience across the Group resulted in continued high levels of customer satisfaction, achieving a 4.3 point increase in our overall tNPS score 2 in 2023.\n\n## 5.3.1 Customer communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur products and services are provided in more than 200 countries and territories. Our local businesses strive to align our approach to informing customers about our products with both regulatory and customer expectations. Our customers have access to detailed information about our products and services, including but not limited to policy coverage, cost structures, exclusions,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproduct suitability etc. Information on our products and services is available through several channels, including our website, intermediaries, email, social media, television, press, digital and print advertising. The introduction of the Zurich One customer portal in 2023 is simplifying access to information for our customers including an on-demand overview of the products they hold, available services to them, and suitable suggested products.\n\nIn 2023, we developed a new 'Tone of Voice' framework which redefines the way we communicate with our customers, rooted in our purpose to 'create a brighter future together'. The framework provides a set of rules and guidance which will provide increased warmth, clarity and conciseness in our communication with our customers about what we offer and any actions a customer needs to take. In addition we launched a new Customer Empathy training program. The program helps mitigate the risk of selling products and services that are not appropriate for our customers' needs, and the risk of failing to exhibit skill and care in the provision of services to our customers.\n\n## 5.3.2 Continuously measuring and improving claims management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers purchase insurance to mitigate risks. Empathetic and competent claims management is critical to providing first-class customer service. We strive to put the customer at the heart of everything we do and to make the claims experience as transparent, personal and responsive as possible.\n\nWe consider the management of claims to be one of the most important customer experiences and, in 2023, we won awards in more than 10 countries recognizing our market-leading claims services.\n\nIn 2023 the claims tNPS score improved by 1.2 points. There has also been a 18.9 percent increase in the number of responses provided by our customers, showing both that we are increasing the opportunity for customers to provide feedback and more than ever customers want to tell us about their claims experience.",

An example of this is our Japanese Accident & Health claims team, that developed and implemented a Vulnerable Customer Training Program to complement their Senior (over 65) Personal Accident Product. 1 This training has been rolled out to over 80 staff members and has helped embed an empathetic claims service, that is tailored to the individual needs of the 28,000 customers supported in 2023. Using vision impairment goggles and noise-reducing headphones during their training, they put themselves in a position to understand their customers' specific challenges. This initiative contributed to high tNPS scores for the senior personal accident product and contributed to an increase of 2.8 points in the Zurich Japan claims score during 2023.\n\nWe have also established a strong claims sustainability framework across all countries, where claims are processed and handled, which includes defined best practices to support and align with our sustainability focus areas. Every country has a three-year action plan to achieve the desired benchmark set out by the framework. The best practices range from loss prevention and mitigation, to reskilling our workforce, as well as making sustainability a major determining factor in developing future relationships with our key third party service providers. We are committed to creating and working with all our providers to deliver innovative sustainable solutions ranging from growing the circular economy to providing extra support and care to our customers. For example:\n\nIn Brazil, we have continued our partnership with our motor repair body shops that have been certified with an independently accredited 'Green Seal'. This arrangement supports local businesses, enables more sustainable practices, and raises awareness of sustainable measures that can be put in place, such as reducing water consumption and safe handling of waste. In 2023, we now have 221 'Green Seal' certified body shops in Brazil, an increase of 39 percent from 2022. This has resulted in 63 tons of metallic waste, 8.2 tons of cardboard/plastic waste, and 1,648 litres of liquid waste being disposed sustainably.\n\n## 5.4 Digital confidence and trust\n\nOne of our goals is to make people and organizations more resilient by fostering confidence in a digital society. We aim to use this goal to improve customer experience. We are determined to be transparent about data management and Zurich's data protection and privacy policy, as this is a critical factor for customer trust.\n\nDuring the past year, we have strengthened our privacy management capabilities, further developed our artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, with particular focus on generative AI, as well as our AI Assurance Framework, and invested in a digital platform that enhances our business impact analysis (BIA) and business continuity planning (BCP) globally, in line with our customer promise.\n\nWe frequently educate our employees and senior management on our data privacy policy and Zurich's data commitment. Our annual data privacy training was assigned to all employees 2 in 2023, with a global completion rate of 99.96 percent. The completion rate was above 99.9 percent in all regions. The training highlights the importance of observing privacy rights and using personal data in a legal and transparent manner.\n\nIn addition, our annual information security awareness training covers a wide range of information security topics and behaviors relevant to all employees 2 , with a completion rate of 99.6 percent. This annual education is supported throughout the year with smaller, supplemental offerings in the form of tip sheets, bite-sized learning campaigns and more. Topics include, working remotely and securely, creating strong passwords, social engineering and the many forms of phishing, including how employees can spot and report phishing attempts. Information security awareness training is reviewed and updated annually to remain on top of the latest developments with cyber threats and Zurich policies and controls.\n\n- 2 Excludes employees on a long-term leave during the training window, new joiners who joined after the cut-off date for the annual training assignment and employees who left the company before the assignment due date.",

Where areas for improvement have been identified, actions have been taken so that all our businesses are meeting the standards and guidelines in terms of transparency ahead of 2024.\n\nMoreover, we have implemented more sophisticated data privacy, data discovery, data security, and consent management technologies, and strengthened governance and oversight across the three lines of defense. Our transformation and digitalization initiatives further support:\n\n- - Proactive customer engagement, informing customers about how their personal data is being used and how consent is being obtained;\n- - Enhancement management and fulfillment of customer rights;\n- - Mitigation of risk of a potential misuse of personal data.\n\nAs a result of the improvement actions taken in 2023, the strengthening of all aspects of data privacy and security will have a positive impact on customers' right to privacy and/or customers' trust in Zurich's privacy management practices.\n\n## 5.4.2 Cybersecurity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, cyber crime and increased cyber risk due to geopolitical instability continued to be major concerns. International law enforcement and government agencies intensified efforts to combat cyber criminals and dismantle their infrastructure, resulting in some success in slowing down the spread of ransomware. Nevertheless, the growth of cyber threats due to the commoditization of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmalicious cyber capabilities, the relatively low barrier to entry, and continued investments and activities led by highly skilled threat actors, necessitates robust measures to protect valuable data.\n\nWe are addressing these evolving challenges through substantial investments to strengthen our cyber defenses and data protection strategies. In 2022, we expanded our multi-layered defensive approach, incorporating industry best practices and recognized frameworks, such as the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. This approach, coupled with our continuous improvement strategy, has proven effective in safeguarding Zurich's data in accordance with its data commitment. In 2023, we further increased our focus on the protection of unstructured data and managing third-party risk, as well as developing our understanding of the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) as both a threat to cyber defense and as a tool for increasing it.\n\nEnhancing cyber defenses and data protection has been the focus of several key initiatives in 2023:\n\n## Harnessing the power of automation and AI\n\nWe deployed highly automated threat detection systems to respond to issues more rapidly. This significantly increased the capacity of our cyber teams and allowed them to meet the challenges of ever-increasing volumes of cyber threats. Additionally, we are embracing AI-enabled systems and have several AI initiatives underway to allow us to rapidly identify and mitigate potential cyber threats, enhancing our ability to protect Zurich's data from evolving risks.\n\n## Managing third-party risk\n\nRecognizing the potential vulnerabilities associated with external business partners and suppliers, we have developed a comprehensive third-party risk management program, that addresses multiple risk areas, including cyber. This program incorporates a scalable platform to assess and monitor the cybersecurity practices of our partners,\n\n## Addressing unstructured data risk\n\nThe increased adoption of collaborative, cloud-based unstructured data management platforms has made data protection a top priority. As such, we have introduced stringent governance standards, as well as technical controls, to manage sensitive data, detect and prevent data loss and meet data privacy commitments.\n\n## Managing data incidents\n\nAt Zurich, we remain committed to transparency and accountability. We have implemented a new data incident management process that allows us to track, assess the impact of, and respond to, incidents that may compromise customer data while meeting all associated regulatory notification requirements.\n\nAs the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, we are dedicated to staying at the forefront of emerging risks. By embracing new technologies, focusing on efficiency through automation and employing industry-recognized frameworks and best practices, we aim to strengthen our cyber defenses, detect and respond to threats more effectively and enhance our overall resilience in the face of evolving cyber threats.",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.4.3 Business resilience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we focused our efforts on mitigating the risk from the energy crisis namely, the potential impacts of widespread power outages. We developed plans to provide a response capability for both expected and unexpected power outage events in Switzerland, the location of our headquarters. These plans, which were aligned with recommendations from local\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nauthorities, aim to ensure communication (e.g., phone, email) for key decision-makers remains possible even during power outages.\n\nIn parallel, we deployed a digital platform that enhances our business impact analysis (BIA) and business continuity planning (BCP) globally, thereby standardizing our resilience approach and tools across the organization. The platform supports the identification of critical processes and their key dependencies (such as systems, people, third parties), allowing recovery strategies to be developed in the tool for the purposes of BCP. The platform has been implemented in all entities across the organization and in all our corporate functions.\n\nIn 2023, we developed a framework to meet new operational resilience regulations, which were released for Ireland in 2021 and the UK in 2022, and which were required to be implemented by 2023 (Ireland) and 2025 (UK). This framework will allow Zurich to address key regulatory requirements in a consistent way.\n\nTesting and drills remain key to ensuring crisis management readiness. We have focused on enhancing our responsive and recovery capabilities through multiple tests and scenario exercises conducted at different levels of the organization and across the various corporate functions.\n\n## 5.4.4 Responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, we made significant progress on implementing our global AI Assurance Framework (AIAF) to promote and ensure the responsible use of high-quality AI solutions across our businesses in line with OECD AI principles, centered around transparency, fairness and accountability, including the review and incorporation of emerging regulations. We continued expanding our AI capabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nalong the insurance value chain, including product development, marketing, sales and distribution, insurance fraud detection, and operations. We are leveraging AI in more than 160 use cases, providing advanced data insights to help underwriters, claims adjusters and risk engineers make better informed decisions. In the field of generative AI, we started exploring and developing new capabilities and solutions in a controlled environment to build comfort and trust with this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nExamples where we leveraged AI technology included improving customer quote and claimant journeys through the automation of medical evidence reviews for life assurance and medical claims, improved assessment of fire risk using individual property attributes and data direct from the fire service, and using speech analytics to better address customer concerns in contact centers. Using AI technology in this manner helps us to further improve our customers' digital experiences and drive operational efficiency.\n\nIn view of the growth of generative AI, we strengthened our AI Assurance Framework to address the new and shifting risks and opportunities in relation to technological advances, specifically generative AI and large language models (LLMs). In particular, we set up a centralized LLM facility, including an application that provides all employees with the opportunity to use this technology as an assistant for daily business tasks as well as a platform for data scientists to develop LLM-based use cases, current explorations include underwriting and risk engineering as well as agent support. A centralized approach means, we are in a position to effectively manage the risks associated with generative AI through technical controls, and to promote LLM-driven innovation in a safe, compliant, protected and responsible environment. In order to explore and mitigate the risks that are specifically related to Generative AI, Zurich is a founding member of the international GenAI Red Teaming Network that work on advancing AI safety and governance for all our customers and operations.\n\nTo strengthen the governance and oversight of our AI operations overall, we have further refined and built out our global AI inventory, our AI risks and impact assessment methodology and operationalized governance processes and technical controls for AI solutions in support of our responsible AI principles of fairness, Transparency and Accountability. We have established a network of AI Champions globally and delivered responsible AI trainings across the organization. Taking this approach to prioritizing digital trust and the use of AI for the benefit of our customers, through sustainable and innovative solutions, builds upon our Data Commitment launched in 2019.",

Entry-level roles (career level A) remain excluded from 'external hires' as these positions are, by nature, filled by external career starters.\n- 2 Excludes unranked employees who are not assigned to any career level (12.5 percent of our workforce), comprising of employees in Germany (not ranked due to locally applicable restrictions preventing the use of this data, 8.6 percent of our workforce) and sales force teams (due to their higher volatility, 2.4 percent of our workforce).\n- 3 2022 is based on the previous definition and does not reflect the extension to include Farmers Group, Inc. and Cover-More, which have been included in 2023.\n- 4 'Other' refers to employees with no declared gender.\n\nWe continue to prioritize internal over external hires, whenever possible, having a clear commitment to 'internal first'. By promoting accelerated internal mobility among our employees, we support their continuous upskilling, re-skilling and career diversification. Our promotions reflect an equal gender split i.e., 50.0 percent of all promotions were women . Our approach contributes to our people remaining employable for the long-term, irrespective of their seniority, gender, age, or any other personal characteristics.\n\nAt a senior level, we have also strengthened our internal leadership pipeline to support career growth through vertical, lateral or international moves. This is reflected in our internal hire rate of 84.3 percent for the senior management population. External hires at this level aim to bring in people with critical skills and are an opportunity to increase the diversity of our employee population globally.\n\nAs an example of investing in employees long-term employability, Zurich Santander launched a new Talent Acquisition Hub in 2023 to foster internal movement and encourage talents to reach for growth within the company. The business is committed to publishing all positions across the Zurich Santander geographies and prioritizing internal candidates. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) for the process will be introduced in 2024. In the meantime, the business has seen a higher participation of internal candidates in the recruitment process and more interest from employees in applying to different functions in the company.\n\n- 1 The NextGen population refers to individuals born after 1981, comprising both Gen Y Millennials (born between 1981-1996) and Gen Z (born in 1997 and after). 2 The NextGen population share of new hires in 2022 was recalculated to 68.1 percent to include Farmers Group, Inc. and unranked employees, while Cover-More is excluded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our global learning platform, MyDevelopment offers more than 28,000 courses, including the full library of LinkedIn Learning. Through technical academies we aim to build capabilities that are core to our business. In 2023, we enhanced the Digital and Customer Academies, deployed programs such as Brand Mastery, Customer Empathy and Customer Experience to build customer capabilities across the organization. In 2023, we also developed the Zurich Sustainability Academy , which curates learning focused on our Sustainability Framework. Additionally, we maintain local academies. In the UK, for instance, through the Future Skills academies we upskilled and re-skilled around 180 employees in areas such as Data Science, DevOps, Automation, Coaching, and Leadership, leveraging the Apprenticeship Levy.\n\nOur Commercial Insurance Academy offers unique and interactive courses tailored to meet the needs of our customers, brokers and employees. In 2023, we rolled out externally awarded global technical training programs, which include Property Business Interruption 1 and International Program Business. 2 We also prepared our employees for the future of work by refining their professional skills through our Winning in the Market branded programs, or by developing their business and communication skills to further their career as highlighted in our 'Grow your Impact' program, launched as a collaborative effort between CI Germany and CI Switzerland in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Average learning hours 1, 2\n\nTable 18\n\n|                                                      |   Average learning  hours 2023 (# hours) |   Average learning  hours 2022 (# hours) |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Female                                               |                                     21.4 |                                     28.4 |\n| Male                                                 |                                     18.9 |                                     24.2 |\n| Other 3                                              |                                     22.7 |                                     57.3 |\n| Baby boomers and prior generations (1964 or earlier) |                                     14.7 |                                     20.7 |\n| Gen X (1965 - 1980)                                  |                                     18.9 |                                     24.6 |\n| Gen Y Millennial (1981-1996)                         |                                     20.7 |                                     27.5 |\n| Gen Z (1997 and after)                               |                                     28.8 |                                     39.4 |\n| Career level A                                       |                                     22   |                                     27.6 |\n| Career level B                                       |                                     18.7 |                                     24.6 |\n| Career level C                                       |                                     21   |                                     24.4 |\n| Career level D                                       |                                     14.1 |                                     21.7 |\n| Career level E                                       |                                      9.3 |                                     19.1 |\n| Senior Management                                    |                                     13.9 |                                     21.7 |\n| Unranked 4                                           |                                     16.9 |                                     22.6 |\n| Total Learning Hours                                 |                                     20.2 |                                     26.4 |\n\n- 1 Hours tracked on our global learning platforms (i.e., physical, digital as well as mandatory and voluntary training sessions).\n- 2 Reporting on learning hours excludes Farmers Group, Inc. and Cover-More.\n- 3 'Other' refers to employees with no declared gender.\n- 4 'Unranked' refers to those employees who are not assigned to any career level (12.5 percent of our workforce), comprising of employees in Germany (not ranked due to locally applicable restrictions preventing the use of this data, 8.6 percent of our workforce) and sales force teams (due to their higher volatility, 2.4 percent of our workforce).\n\nIn 2023, our employees dedicated over 1.1 million hours to online learning, compared to 1.2 million hours in 2022. 3 This translates to an average of 20.2 hours per employee, a decrease from 26.4 hours in 2022.

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.1.3 Engagement\n\nIn 2023, we launched our new Group-wide Zurich Experience Survey (ZES). 1 This allows us to collect richer insights about employees' perceptions of their experience at Zurich, as well as better understand their levels and drivers of engagement. The 2023 response rate was 82 percent, in line with typical practices of our external provider's highperforming client companies.\n\nWe scored positively in all categories of the ZES 2023, with results particularly strong for Leadership, Strategy & Values and DEIB & Wellbeing. Globally, the drivers of our employee engagement are linked to career and personal development opportunities and an effective work environment where people feel they belong. The engagement score, including measuring pride in the organization, referral behavior, intent to stay and intrinsic motivation, was 2 percentage points better than those in high performing companies and 4 percentage points better than other global finance and insurance peers working with the same provider. 2 Employees' willingness to recommend Zurich as a great place to work is 5 percentage points better than those in high performing companies and 8 percentage points better than other global finance and insurance peers.\n\nA number of regional and local initiatives, certifications and awards support our employees' perceptions, for example:\n\n- - The #APACMovesTogether regional year-long initiative brought together our employees across the region to align their individual actions and accelerate their impact in support of our sustainability ambitions. Around 50 events, activities, gatherings and volunteering opportunities made the People Month (March 2023) contribute to increasing levels of engagement and pride to work for Zurich. In Asia-Pacific, we have been awarded the Great Place To Work 2023 3 certification for five businesses (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore).\n- - In EMEA, we received or maintained employer awards and have been ranked as #1 employer in the insurance sector, for example, in Germany (Focus award as Top Employer 2023), 4 Italy (Top Employers Italia 2023), 5 Ireland (EDGE Move), Spain (Top Employer Espa\u00f1a 2023, 6 re-certified for EDGE Move, 7 #1 insurer on Glassdoor), Switzerland (Top Employer 2023), 8 Turkey (Great Place to Work 2023, Best Workplaces for Millennials 2023), 9 or the UK (Best Insurance Employer 2023). 10\n- - In Latin America, we are also an employer of choice in most of our business units, for instance, in Brazil (EDGE Move, Great Place to Work), 11 Columbia or Mexico (EDGE Move, Great Place to Work).\n- - In North America, Canada was recognized as one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers, 12 and ZNA features on Forbes' list 13 of America's Best Employers By State 2023 as well as on the lists of America's Best Employers for Women 2023 and America's Best Employers for Diversity 2023.\n\n## 6.1.4 Retention\n\nEmployees' intention to stay working for Zurich, as measured in the ZES 2023, is better than the external benchmarks: 2 percentage points better than high performing companies and 3 percentage points better than other global finance and insurance peers. While the total employee turnover increased to 14.3 percent compared to 12.9 percent in 2022, the trend is significantly influenced by the increase in involuntary turnover as result of reorganizations in North America. Over the years, we observed minimal variance in the entry and exit patterns based on gender. In 2023, 53.6 percent of the individuals voluntarily or involuntarily departing our organization were female (compared to 51.9 percent in 2022).\n\nOur NextGen employees continue to have a higher voluntary turnover rate compared to other generations, in line with external market trends. As we remain focused on getting insights from various sources, our aim is to continuously improve, and remain an attractive employer for all who look to start and develop careers.\n\n- 1 The 2023 Zurich Experience Survey was done in May 2023 across the Group, excluding Farmers Group, Inc. and Cover-More.

Voluntary turnover refers to employees deciding to leave the company, e.g., for personal reasons. Involuntary turnover refers to cases where the decision to leave is not entirely made by the employee, e.g., retirement and mutual agreement. Reporting excludes temporary employees and interns.\n- 2 'Other' refers to employees with no declared gender.\n- 3 The high involuntary turnover for Baby boomers and prior generations is largely attributed to retirement.\n- 4 'Unranked' refers to those employees who are not assigned to any career level (12.5 percent of our workforce), comprising of employees in Germany (not ranked due to locally applicable restrictions preventing the use of this data, 8.6 percent of our workforce) and sales force teams (due to their higher volatility, 2.4 percent of our workforce).\n\n## 6.2 A positive work environment\n\nWe value diverse perspectives, aim to foster a sense of belonging and always look to uphold fairness. We prioritize the wellbeing of our employees, supporting their physical, mental, financial and social health through proactive guidance and resources. We encourage open communication and collaboration, creating a connected community where collective ideas flourish.\n\n## 6.2.1 Our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging\n\nWe strive to integrate diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) 1 into everything we do by taking targeted actions to increase and benefit from diversity within the workforce, to offer equal opportunities and to foster inclusion and belonging.\n\nWe continue to leverage and support our employee resource groups (ERGs) 2 across the organization, to foster exchange across functions, geographies, hierarchies and generations. We strive to raise awareness of and promote diversity and inclusion, cultivate a sense of belonging and create social networks to drive cultural change. Our ERGs provide thought-provoking and developmental programs throughout the year that everyone can benefit from. In ZNA, for instance, one out of every three employees is a member of at least one ERG. We encourage engagement in these groups in order to strengthen our Zurich community. Our women's innovation network (WIN) is our biggest ERG with several thousand members across all continents.\n\n- 2 Our Group-wide ERGs are: WIN (women's innovation network), ZurichNEXT (promoting intergenerational dialogue), Pride@Zurich (alliance of LGBTQ+ employee networks) and YouMatter (supporting employee wellbeing). Our business units have in addition several other local ERGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.2.1 Our commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (continued)\n\nIn 2023, we received a number of awards and certifications across the Group, recognizing our commitment to DEIB. Zurich UK, for instance, was recognized in 2023 as Stonewall's one of the Top 100 employers in workplace equality (with additional Gold award for UK's Pride network). It also received the 5-Star Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award from Insurance Business UK and won in four categories of the FT Advisor Diversity in Finance Award. 1 Zurich Canada received the 5-Star Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 2 award, and is actively partnering with organizations such as the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion, Pride at Work Canada, Canadian Association of Black Insurance Professionals, LINK Canada, Insurance Supper Club Group, or the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.\n\nWe continuously foster equal representation of all genders across the organization. As of the end of 2023, 52.0 percent of our employee population were female. In addition, we undertake targeted actions and monitor gender representation across multiple dimensions, including career levels and generations. As in previous years, we have been included in the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. 3 We continue to support the development of female talents to accelerate their readiness for leadership positions. A few examples:\n\n- - In Asia-Pacific, the Female Leaders Advocate Group (FLAG) was formed in March 2023 to identify key interventions to close the gender representation gap across Asia-Pacific. The three main region-wide initiatives (i.e., Gender Diversity Target Setting, Female Acceleration Program, and FLAG talk series) were being implemented throughout 2023. Asia-Pacific remains a signatory of the G20 Alliance for the Empowerment and Progression of Women's Economic Representation advocating women's advancement to leadership positions.\n- - In EMEA, UK is running a mid-level momentum talent program, as a result of which it registered moves for 42.5 percent of the cohort with females achieving more moves and more promotion. Switzerland is also running a third cohort of a NextGen talent program, with a purposeful 50/50 gender split.\n- - In Latin America, the Z-Women's Empowerment Program was established in Colombia, an all-female, high-potential program encompassing interviews, assessments, SWOT analysis and coaching to support participants to realize their career objectives. The talent retention of the participants is 90 percent, and 90 percent of the participants of the program are now on leadership succession plans, 20 percent of them leading a critical project.\n- - In North America, the ZNA Women's Senior Leader Program was developed with Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management for senior women leaders who aspire to increased impact and who would benefit from developing leadership and influencing skills, financial acumen as well as increased visibility. The first cohort of 29 completed the program in 2023 (NPS of 100), the second cohort has been selected and will kick off in early 2024.\n\nThese and other initiatives have helped drive improvements in gender balance between 2017 and 2023, 4 particularly in senior management (career levels D and E). In 2017, 22.4 percent of senior management were female. At the end of 2023, female employees represented a combined 30.3 percent in senior management (compared to 28.7 percent in 2022). Moreover, 42.5 percent of our people managers (compared to 41.3 percent in 2022) and 53.9 percent of our individual contributors are women (compared to 53.8 percent in 2022). We also have initiatives in place to develop women's STEM careers, with several senior IT appointments in 2023. Currently, 33.3 percent of our employees working in IT or Engineering roles are female (compared to 30.5 percent in 2022).\n\nWe also value generational diversity in our workforce by supporting the employability of individuals at all stages of their careers and providing flexibility for smooth transitions to new opportunities. Our early-in-career programs are successful in recognizing internal talent and developing employees' skills for the future needs of our organization via workshops, coaching sessions and experience-based project work. These prepare participants for leadership opportunities within the company. In Ireland, for instance, we had 18 employees participating in the Zurich Achieve early-in-career program in 2023; UK added a Sustainable Energy Graduate and Internship program to its early-in-careers offerings to address the gap for sustainable energy skills as we support and encourage global customers in the energy sector with their transition plans. 5\n\nZNA established a new program, Encore (Phased Retirement@Zurich) to support a collaborative and flexible transition when employees decide to retire and have unique and valuable skills, knowledge, and essential relationships to pass along to others. Feedback from participants and their managers has confirmed that both employees (via a smoother transition to retirement) and our company (via standardized knowledge transfer) are strongly benefiting from the program.\n\n- 1 www.zurich.co.uk/about-us/awards - Zurich UK won in four categories of the FT Advisor Diversity in Finance Award: Championing Gender Inclusivity 2023, Championing Women's Equality 2023, Diversity Marketing or Recruitment Initiative of the Year 2023, Trailblazing Company of the Year 2023. UK also partners with several other organizations to further our commitment to DEIB, e.g., The Valuable 500, ISC Group, Financial Services Skills Commission, Women in Finance Charter, Disability Confident, #10000 Black Interns and Bright Network.

Related to LGBTQ+, for instance, we have an active global employee resource group, and we have been recognized, for the sixth consecutive year, as a Top Global Employer for the LGBTQ+ community by Stonewall. In fact, we progressed to a silver award for 2023, on Stonewall's Global Workplace Equality Index, 1 a benchmarking tool for LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Zurich UK not only publishes its diversity policies 2 but also leads by example in publishing pay gap reports linked to gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ and disability. Additionally, ZNA earned the top score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2023-2024 Corporate Equality Index, 3 the USA's foremost benchmarking survey and report, measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In Chile, we participated at Expo Inclusion 2023, 4 a job fair for the inclusion of people with disabilities and older adults on the employment market, a demographic with occasional difficulties accessing employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Workforce composition 1\n\nTable 20\n\n|                              | Career Level (%)   | Career Level (%)   | Career Level (%)   | Career Level (%)   | Senior   | Senior   | Senior       | Senior       |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Dimension                    | A                  | B                  | C                  | D                  | E        | (%)      | Total % 2023 | Total # 2023 |\n| Female                       | 64.7               | 49.0               | 37.9               | 30.6               | 25.2     | 30.3     | 52.0         | 31,747       |\n| Male                         | 35.0               | 50.8               | 61.9               | 69.1               | 74.8     | 69.4     | 47.8         | 29,187       |\n| Other 2                      | 0.3                | 0.2                | 0.2                | 0.3                |          | 0.3      | 0.2          | 133          |\n| Baby boomers and prior       | 6.7                | 9.9                | 9.8                | 11.7               | 10.8     | 11.7     | 9.5          | 5,828        |\n| Gen X (1965-1980)            | 26.5               | 38.1               | 54.2               | 69.8               | 87.4     | 70.9     | 38.3         | 23,383       |\n| Gen Y Millennial (1981-1996) | 47.0               | 48.6               | 35.8               | 18.4               | 1.8      | 17.4     | 44.1         | 26,948       |\n| Gen Z (1997 and after)       | 19.8               | 3.5                | 0.2                | 0.1                |          | 0.1      | 8.0          | 4,908        |\n| National                     | 69.2               | 53.9               | 49.4               | 54.1               | 31.5     | 52.8     | 62.5         | 38,162       |\n| Non-national                 | 6.1                | 7.5                | 11.7               | 22.0               | 45.0     | 23.4     | 8.0          | 4,865        |\n| Undisclosed 3                | 24.7               | 38.6               | 38.9               | 23.9               | 23.4     | 23.8     | 29.5         | 18,040       |\n\n- 1 The data includes 'unranked' employees who are not assigned to any career level (12.5 percent of our workforce), comprising of employees in Germany (not ranked due to locally applicable restrictions preventing the use of this data, 8.6 percent of our workforce) and sales force teams (due to their higher volatility, 2.4 percent of our workforce).\n- 2 'Other' refers to employees with no declared gender.\n- 3 'Undisclosed' refers to employees for whom we do not hold nationality/citizenship information, mostly from North America.\n\nWe see a tendency for non-national employees to have greater representation at more senior career levels. This can be explained by the movement of experienced, internal talent to new opportunities across our organization.\n\n## Ratio of compensation to areas of equality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe actively promote equal opportunity and pay equity in all the markets we operate and continuously monitor to ensure that we meet this ambition. 5 As part of the annual remuneration cycle, the majority of our businesses with 100 or more employees 6 perform an equal pay analysis to ensure gender is not a factor when it comes to remuneration. This process has successfully\n\ngenerated engaged conversations across our organization, and our leaders are fully dedicated to promote pay balance across genders or any other demographic (which may apply locally).\n\nAs new legislation is being implemented related to pay equity and pay transparency, we are proactively responding to these new requirements. 7 Local entities publish the results externally in accordance with local laws and regulations. In 2023, we made progress in many markets with some of the examples cited below.\n\nIn Australia, we use an externally accredited tool to analyze both pay equity and gender pay gap. We identified where any inequities existed and made required adjustments accordingly to maintain gender pay equity for like-for-like roles. With a focus on increasing female representation in leadership roles, we reduced the gender pay gap by 5 percent over a 12-month period and we are now below the insurance industry average in Australia.\n\n- 1 www.stonewall.org.uk/top-global-employers/full-list-top-global-employers\n- 2 www.zurich.co.uk/sustainability/diversity-and-inclusion\n- 3 www.hrc.org/resources/corporate-equality-index\n- 4 www.expoinclusion.cl\n- 5 We pay 100 percent of our workforce, at all locations, at or above local minimum wage.\n- 6 Cover-More Argentina and Cover-More Australia will be onboarded in 2024.\n- 7 To find out more about equal pay for equivalent work, please see www.zurich.com/en/careers/deib/equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From early 2024, all employers in Australia with more than 100 employees will have their gender pay gap published by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). 1\n\nIn Spain, we are proud of being re-certified for the fourth time with EDGE and, in 2023 awarded EDGE Move and EDGEplus. 2 This is a result of our efforts monitoring employee experience from an intersectional perspective of gender, gender identity and age, as well as continuously improve policies and practices for our employees. The key highlights from this recertification are that 92 percent of our employees consider they achieve work-life balance, the results of our equal pay analysis position us within the tolerance range of below five percent and we have equitable recruiting practices related to gender (EDGE Move), sexual identity and age (EDGEplus).\n\n## 6.2.2 Our approach to wellbeing\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees is a cornerstone of our ambition to be a sustainable employer. We continue to strengthen our credentials in this space by providing guidance and solutions to cultivate a work environment in which employees can thrive. We have developed a global holistic wellbeing framework 3 that provides our people with tools and resources to stay healthy and empowered. We aim to support 4 measures that allow employees to grow in the four dimensions of wellbeing - physical, social, mental and financial - and be their best selves every day and everywhere.\n\n## Physical wellbeing 5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe support healthy lifestyles through health-promotion activities and competitions via health centers and sports clubs, or sponsor marathons. In Austria, for example, we received an award for workplace health promotion for the fifth time: with various workshops, seminars, lectures, preventive examinations and a broad-based network, Austria's Zurich Vital team received an\n\noccupational health award, 6 based on a comprehensive assessment of the company's internal health services, integrated into regular operations, and awarded for employee- and family-friendly companies.\n\nWe recognize that every family is unique and balancing responsibilities is important to all of us. We continuously evolve our policies to better reconcile work and family life, for instance, by supporting greater flexibility in childcare and eldercare. Our FlexWork@Zurich program serves as the basis of our commitment to fostering work-life balance and empowering our employees to optimize their productivity. Through this program, we offer flexible working arrangements that accommodate individual lifestyles. Furthermore, to support employees to reduce work-life pressures for working parents and carers, we have partnered in Australia with Parents@Work 7 to ensure we have a family-friendly work environment. In Australia, we also launched the Zurich Care Hub, which delivers training sessions, resources and additional wrap-around support such as our Parental Leave Transition Program.\n\n## Social wellbeing\n\nWe embrace a culture of dialogue and inclusion. Listening to employees and addressing concerns and needs is part of what we do. Our new yearly Zurich Experience Survey gives us actionable feedback (see also section 6.1.3 Engagement on page 196). Several of our countries engage in local programs designed to look after employees' social wellbeing. In Italy, for instance, we launched the program Action for Change (Azioni per il Cambiamento) as a result of which we analyzed more than 300 bottom-up ideas drafted to improve our ways of working.\n\n## Mental wellbeing\n\nOur global mental wellbeing program is focused on reducing negative stress and anxiety. Access to our health app LiveWell is becoming part of our Employee Benefits packages with big corporates, and we offer it to our employees across the Group. In addition to our employee program, in 2023, the Z Zurich Foundation, UNICEF and Zurich's LiveWell partnered up 8 to promote the mental wellbeing of young people and their caregivers worldwide.\n\nIn Switzerland, we engaged the workforce in a resilience and mental health training, based on leaders' and employees' requests to proactively manage the demands of a modern working environment. Using a variety of formats, we trained more than 150 employees in 2023, and achieved an average participant NPS of 71 points. In ZNA, we have 300 employees certified as Mental Health First Aid Champions. In Australia, we also partnered with SmartCulture to deliver the Respect at Work program, which aims to embed awareness, education and the prevention of all forms of bullying, harassment and discrimination.\n\n- 1 www.wgea.gov.au\n- 2 www.edge-cert.org/article/zurich-insurance-company-spain-attains-edge-move-recertification-and-edgeplus\n- 3 www.zurich.com/careers/wellbeing\n- 4 For example, ZNA has hosted more than 100 wellbeing touchpoints, including mindful moments and movements, which build physical and emotional healthy habits in the workplace and at home. Webinars, in person presentations, new joiner connections and quarterly wellbeing learning days have provided opportunities to connect with colleagues across ZNA. Zurich UK also re-launched its online Wellbeing Hub to simplify and increase accessibility, enabling employees and line managers to quickly find advice and support in one place across the pillars of physical, financial, social and mental wellbeing.\n- 5 For detailed health & safety KPIs, incl. number and rate of fatalities as a result of work-related injuries, please see the 2023 WEF index table on our website: www.zurich.com/en/ sustainability/reporting/sustainability-report\n- 6 www.gesundheitskasse.at/cdscontent/load?contentid=10008.776273&version=1680253735\n- 7 www.parentsatwork.com\n- 8 www.zurich.foundation/mental-wellbeing/global-program-with-unicef\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.2.2 Our approach to wellbeing (continued)\n\nFor its societal benefits as well as an impactful way to manage mental wellbeing, all our businesses actively encourage volunteering. 1\n\n## Financial wellbeing\n\nWe also offer support for financial wellbeing. For example, in the UK we introduced financial education, access to bespoke consultations to make homes more energy efficient, and interest and tax-free loans to fund home improvements. The UK also made one-off payments to employees to help with the cost of living, as well as access to emergency loans to cover unexpected expenses. Employees were also given access to a range of discount schemes, and advice and guidance on financial wellbeing and managing money.\n\n## 6.3 Respecting human rights\n\nWe respect the protection of international human rights within our sphere of influence and work hard to avoid being complicit in human rights abuses. When interacting with employees, customers, investees, shareholders, suppliers, the public at large or any other stakeholder, we aim to promote the following best-practice standards to manage potential adverse human rights impact:\n\n- - United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations 'Protect, Respect and Remedy' Framework'\n- - OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n- - United Nations Global Compact\n\nThese principles are embodied in our Code of Conduct, 2 which applies to everyone within the Group. All employees and board members receive mandatory training on the Code of Conduct annually. 3 We endeavor to work with third parties such as consultants, advisers, suppliers and agents who share our values, and we expect our business partners to adhere to the spirit of our code and embrace high standards of business conduct.\n\nWe assess possible adverse human rights impacts within our sphere of activity, which includes our role as employer, as an insurer, and as an investor as well as our own operations and supply chain and our position within society.\n\n## Our responsibility as an employer\n\nWe strive to maintain an environment free from all forms of discrimination and harassment. We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination or bullying in the workplace, whether based on race, ethnicity, color, age, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, or any other relevant characteristics protected under applicable law. This applies regardless of an individual's duties or positions within the organization.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to contact a people manager, Human Resources, Compliance, Legal or use the Zurich Ethics Line to raise any concerns regarding any instances of harassment, discrimination or bullying, or any other concern. These concerns can be raised anonymously. We do not tolerate retaliation against any employee or other person who reports a concern in good faith. 4\n\nWe understand the importance of fostering diversity in voices, promoting inclusive behaviors, driving equity, and cultivating a strong sense of belonging among our people. We offer unconscious bias training to all employees. We recognize the right of employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining and to freely form and join groups for the promotion and protection of employment interests.\n\nOur employees generally work in low-risk environments and are not exposed to significant health and safety hazards. Nevertheless, we adopt a systems-based approach to managing health and safety risks in a structured and consistent way across all our operations and have a global program in place to ensure we continually improve our health and safety performance. 5\n\n- 1 For more information, see section 2.3.4 Community investment on page 133.\n- 2 www.zurich.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct\n- 3 Excludes employees on a long-term leave during the training window, new joiners who joined after the cut-off date for the annual training assignment and employees who left the company before the assignment due date.\n- 4 More information in section 6.4.3 Protected advice on page 204.\n- 5 More information in section 6.2.2 Our approach to wellbeing on page 200.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## Our responsibility as an insurer\n\nOur approach to assess non-respect or potential adverse impacts on human rights in business transactions has a particular focus on avoiding child labor and forced labor, human trafficking or operations that could jeopardize health and safety, or offer unfair remuneration.\n\nThe business activities of our customers include many sectors of the economy. Hence we pay special attention to activities that could:\n\n- - Contribute to adverse human rights impacts such as relocation of local communities without due process, inappropriate use of force or adverse impacts on vulnerable indigenous people.\n- - Support regimes, governments, government officials or other politically exposed persons in countries with poor governance (for example failed states, conflict or war zones and ineffective rule of law) or poor human rights records.\n- - Enable harmful child labor, poor health and safety conditions and unfair remuneration.\n\nThrough Zurich's underwriting guidelines and checklists, we apply a clear guidance on underwriting decisions including clear referral processes.\n\n## Our responsibility as an investor\n\nWe implemented a global set of policies and investment processes across the organization, which aim at ensuring a consistent approach on the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') topics, as part of our responsible investment strategy. 1 We proactively integrate ESG factors in our investment decisions. Material ESG factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- - Climate change risks (transition risks, physical risks and litigation risks)\n- - Activities negatively affecting biodiversity\n- - Environmental and health impacts of hazardous chemicals, waste and pollution\n- - Resource inefficiency\n- - Deforestation, land degradation, and depletion of natural resources\n- - Exposure to controversial weapons\n- - Respect for human rights\n- - Corruption and Bribery matters\n- - Inadequate governance\n- - Tax evasion\n- - Breaches of regulation, international norms and conventions\n- - Inadequate handling of human capital or client relations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Working with suppliers\n\nWhen working with suppliers, 2 we apply our third-party governance framework (TPGF), which establishes a framework of Group minimum standards for onboarding and management of third parties we work with. The TPGF adopts a risk-based approach to human rights due diligence\n\nand is underpinned by an annual risk assessment. The first step is to analyze the human rights set out in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and seek to identify which, if any, of these fundamental human rights could be adversely impacted in our tier-one supply chain, i.e. those suppliers with whom we have a direct buying contract.\n\nOur initial and subsequent analysis identified a limited potential for non-respect or potential adverse impacts on human rights. We also concluded that our supply chain presents overall low exposure to non-respect or potential adverse impacts on human rights and that the labor standards and workplace practices operated by our suppliers are a critical factor in the likelihood of adverse human rights impacts occurring. In 2023, we also conducted a separate assessment in the context of child labor, 3 which resulted in the conclusion that there is no reasonable suspicion of child labor within our supply chain.\n\nTo support our risk assessment, we maintain a database of high-risk countries and high-risk goods and services based on data and reports from reputable NGOs and our own internal expert judgement. Our assessment of high-risk goods and services categories is based upon the prevalence of human rights issues reported and an assessment of working practices at industry or sector level.\n\n- 1 For further information on our approach relating to responsible investment, see www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/responsible-investment-atzurich.pdf\n- 2 For further information, see 2.3.2 Supply chain on page 132.\n- 3 Pursuant to the Swiss Ordinance on Due Diligence and Transparency in relation to Minerals and Metals from Conflict-Affected Areas and Child Labor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\nOur assessment of high-risk countries is based on:\n\n- - The reported prevalence of human rights issues.\n- - The degree of respect for worker rights, based upon local laws and actual practices.\n- - The extent of political freedom and civil liberties.\n- - The extent of corruption.\n\nThe aim of our human rights due diligence is to validate that the supplier has implemented measures to respect fundamental human rights. Accordingly we have a referral process in place to investigate or to resolve, as appropriate, any red flags identified during the due diligence process. We also use a software tool that uses artificial intelligence to screen news reports, social media posts and NGO reports to monitor potential ESG-related (including human rights) supply chain issues. We also published a course covering the supplier due diligence processes (including in relation to human rights) that have been implemented under the TPGF. The completion rate of the supplier due diligence training for calendar year 2023 is 100 percent.\n\n## 6.4 Prevention of bribery and corruption\n\n## 6.4.1 Group Policy Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe invest heavily in controls to prevent and detect, among other risks, any bribery or corruption. We have put in place strong and effective controls and we monitor financial, legal and regulatory developments to conduct business in an ethical and compliant manner.\n\nZurich takes a risk-based approach for the development and implementation of its Group Anti-\n\nBribery and Anti-Corruption Framework (the Framework). The Framework is designed to prevent and detect acts of bribery and corruption. The Group Policy Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (Group Policy ABC) 1 sets out the minimum requirements and obligations, with which our subsidiaries worldwide, including their board members 2 and employees, need to comply. It also provides related guidance regarding anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance that our business units should adopt.\n\nThe Group Policy ABC sets out minimum requirements in relation to the following topics, among others:\n\n- - Associated persons' due diligence\n- - Third-party payment due diligence\n- - Incentives\n- - Gifts, entertainment and other advantages\n\nWe perform due diligence in accordance with our Group Policy ABC before selecting a party to be an Associated Person. 3 The due diligence must be appropriate to the anti-bribery and anti-corruption risk the relationship with the Associated Person may present. Higher risk Associated Persons receive periodically recurring due diligence.\n\nOn third-party payments, our Group Policy ABC requires the establishment of documentation which provides, among other things, a business rationale for the relationship. Our Group Policy ABC requires Zurich employees to be alert to potential anti-bribery and anti-corruption 'red flags' 4 that may be associated with improper third-party payments. Such red flags are to be addressed through a so-called 'third-party payment due diligence process'.\n\nThe Compliance function is mandated to provide assurance to stakeholders (business management, board and audit committees) that compliance-related risks are managed effectively, and that controls are designed adequately and operating effectively. In addition, Compliance supports business units in managing compliance-related risks appropriately and remediating gaps in operative compliance controls. It is important to note that anti-bribery and anticorruption is part of the 'compliance risk universe' 5 and subject to independent assurance by Group Compliance in accordance with the Zurich Compliance Charter and Zurich Compliance Program.\n\nAssurance activities conducted by Group Compliance and Group Audit in 2023 confirmed the overall assessment that the Group's controls around ABC are well designed and working effectively.\n\n- 1 The Group Policy ABC requires the appointment of an anti-bribery and corruption officer (ABCO) for each business unit. The ABCO's duty is to monitor compliance with the Group Policy ABC and the applicable local anti-bribery and anti-corruption framework. The ABCO also supports business management in maintaining the local anti-bribery and anticorruption framework and reviewing it regularly to ensure that it appropriately addresses bribery and corruption risks in the business unit.\n\n- 3 Associated Persons are individuals or entities who perform services for, to, or on behalf of, an organization and may include: brokers, insurance agents and intermediaries, distributors, sub-contractors, employees of outsourcing partners, employees of Zurich, Group entities or subsidiaries, independent non-executive directors, joint venture partners, outsourcers, including external asset managers, other consortia members, other (non-insurance) agents in the process of conducting business, suppliers and service providers (e.g., property management companies).\n- 4 Anti-bribery and anti-corruption 'red flags' include, but are not limited to, the following: The recipient of the payment is a public official or a close relative of a public official, the transaction value appears to be high in relation to the goods or services provided, the payment is being made to a country that is different to the country in which the recipient is located or the services are/were rendered, etc.\n- 5 The 'compliance risk universe' captures common global compliance risk themes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n- 8. Independent assurance report\n\n## 6.4.2 Training and awareness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFostering a culture of compliance among all our employees is important. To achieve this, it is critical to encourage general awareness and understanding of potential areas of bribery and corruption risk, applicable laws, and our policies.\n\nWe frequently educate our employees and Board members on topics related to compliance and\n\nethics. This begins with mandatory Code of Conduct training. 1 This annual training raises awareness of what it means to do the right thing. It helps employees and managers feel more confident in making ethical decisions in their day-to-day work. It also helps employees to spot and report possible bribery and corruption incidents. In 2023, almost all our employees and senior management 2 completed the training, resulting in a global completion rate of 99.99 percent. The completion rate was above 99.9 percent in all regions. 3 In addition, all 12 members of our Group Board completed the training. Employees whose roles expose them to potentially greater bribery and corruption-related risks are also required to undergo enhanced training on how to identify and respond to potential bribery and corruption risks.\n\nGroup Compliance develops the training in line with the Group Policy ABC and in consideration of local risks, regulations and requirements for each jurisdiction. The training is reviewed on an annual basis to incorporate new developments and requirements. This keeps our employees and management at the forefront of the prevention of bribery and corruption and helps us fulfil our ambition of being a responsible and ethical business.\n\n## 6.4.3 Protected advice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption (ABC) is a risk which affects all business lines. Comprehensive regulatory requirements - some with extra territorial reach including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act - as well as a high level of regulatory scrutiny and extensive criminal enforcement with large penalties, fines or settlements drive up the inherent\n\nanti-bribery and anti-corruption risk for Zurich.\n\nAs outlined above, our employees are all subject to our Group Policy ABC 4 and Zurich Code of Conduct, 5 and we provide them with training and other resources which aim to prevent and detect potential misconduct. If employees suspect misconduct, we want them to feel comfortable reporting their concerns and feel supported by the organization when doing so.\n\nThere are multiple channels for our employees and other stakeholders to report alleged wrongdoing or suspected or actual illegal, fraudulent, improper or unethical conduct ('integrity concerns') to people managers, Compliance, HR and Legal. They can also use the Zurich Ethics Line (ZEL) to report integrity concerns anonymously, either via telephone or online via a web form. We do not tolerate retaliation against any employee or other person reporting an integrity concern with reasonable grounds to believe the information reported was true at the time of reporting.\n\nThe ZEL is available globally and offers support in a total of 25 languages. All integrity concerns are reviewed by a triage committee comprising representatives of Compliance, HR and Legal.\n\n- 1 The code of conduct training includes the topic of anti-bribery and anti-corruption.\n- 2 In 2023, the code of conduct training was also shared with various business partners depending on country requirements.\n- 3 Excludes employees on a long-term leave during the training window, new joiners who joined after the cut-off date for the annual training assignment and employees who left the company before the assignment due date.\n- 4 www.zurich.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct/we-care-about-business-integrity\n- 5 www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Entry-level roles (career level A) remain excluded from 'external hires' as these positions are, by nature, filled by external career starters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In cases where the data is available or properties use onsite/offsite renewable energies, the market based methodology is applied.\n- 4 The emission factors are retrieved from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020) with the  exception of Switzerland for local calculation references (Intep, REIDA 2022 and local authorities) which are aligned with IEA.\n- 5 The relative emissions intensity is calculated based on gross floor area (GFA) of the buildings.\n- 6 Real estate emissions are only available with a four-quarter lag. 2023 emissions will be reported in the 2024 report. Includes investment portfolio buildings only, as own-use buildings are part of our operational emissions target.\n- 7 Direct real estate holdings form the base for the emission reduction targets. There are no applicable figures for the APAC region available.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Managing risks has been at the center of this success, enabling the Group to adapt quickly to identify, assess and manage the threats arising from today's uncertain and rapidly changing world.\n\nThis foundational role has been attained by firstly providing all our employees with the right level of information to continue to take risks within the Group's appetite and tolerance, and secondly embedding a culture, driven by a deep understanding of risks, where riskreward trade-offs are transparent, understood and appropriately managed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our integrated Enterprise Risk Management framework, and in particular, the ongoing application of our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology preserves our focus on the risks that matter.\n\nWhile there are, and will continue to be, significant and unexpected external challenges, our proactive risk management is a solid foundation upon which the Group can continue to build on its success in the years to come.\n\n## Responding to uncertainty\n\nThe recent turmoil in the Middle East adds to an increasingly fraught geopolitical landscape already complicated by the ongoing war in Ukraine, rising tensions between the U.S. and China and the reawakening of frozen conflicts.\n\nThese deteriorations are interlinked with, and are exacerbating, existing problems such as social polarization and cyber warfare, as well as driving further uncertainty in the global economy.\n\nWhile central bank actions have helped to tame inflation somewhat, the impact of the unwind of expansionary monetary policy since the financial crisis on key economies remains unclear. Despite these policy reversals, inadequate preparation, competing interests and historic policymaking mean underlying challenges around high public debt and social imbalances remain largely unchanged.\n\nThe current uncertain and volatile environment means our expertise and tools, such as dynamic scenario and sensitivity analyses, to assess and proactively manage potential impacts, are more important than ever. We continue to use the output of scenario assessments, to develop, implement and monitor actions for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe interlinkages between the challenges highlighted thus far also feed through to the main long-term threat facing the world: climate change. Despite the current geopolitical, economic and social upheaval,\n\n## Development of Swiss Solvency Test ratio\n\n## Highlights by risk type\n\nThe Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio decreased to 233 percent 1 as of January 1, 2024 from 267 percent as of January 1, 2023. The development of the SST ratio in 2023 reflects strong underlying capital generation offset by portfolio management and capital actions including share buy back.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  The SST results as of January 1, 2024 are estimated and may differ from the final SST results, which will be presented in the Financial Condition Report at the end of April 2024.\n\n## Analysis of Group total risk capital\n\nin %, as of January 1, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nThe Group's insurance risk is diversified by geography, line of business, product and customer, supported by our centralized purchase of reinsurance which led to continued sound insurance outcomes in 2023 in the face of natural catastrophes and the inflationary environment.\n\n## Read more:\n\n- u Pages 233-239\n\n## Market risk\n\nRequired capital held by the Group for investment risk taking rose during 2023. This was largely driven by changed market conditions, including higher equity markets and a weaker USD against major currencies. Model changes contributed to the increase in risk. Market volatilities have remained relatively stable against the prior year.

Zurich takes risks in order to support the achievement of its strategy and serve its customers in global and local markets. Risk management contributes to enhancing the value of Zurich by embedding disciplined and conscious risk taking, where risk-reward trade-offs are transparent and understood, and risks are appropriately rewarded.\n\nThe Group's objectives in managing risks are to:\n\n- - Support achievement of its business strategy and objectives, protect capital, liquidity, earnings and reputation by identifying, assessing, responding to, monitoring and reporting risks in line with the Group's risk appetite and tolerance.\n- - Enable the Board of Directors (the 'Board'), senior management and other stakeholders charged with governance and oversight, to discharge their risk management responsibilities, including risk reporting and external disclosures.\n- - Support transparency in decision-making processes by providing consistent, reliable and timely risk information.\n- - Embed a culture of risk awareness and disciplined and informed risk-taking.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management framework\n\nTo achieve its risk management objectives, the Group manages risk according to an established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. The Group's ERM framework is the structure to manage risks within the organization. It is comprised of six components: risk governance and risk culture, risk appetite and tolerance, risk identification and risk assessment, risk response, risk monitoring, and risk reporting. The Group's ERM framework is documented by both policy and non-policy documents, including the Zurich Risk Policy (ZRP) and related risk policy manuals, and is complemented by training and guidance materials.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite and tolerance statement reflects Zurich's willingness and capacity to take risks in pursuit of value creation and sets boundaries within which the businesses act. Zurich protects its capital, liquidity, earnings, and reputation by monitoring that risks are taken within agreed risk appetite levels and tolerance limits. The Group regularly assesses and, as far as possible, quantifies material risks to which it is exposed.\n\nThe ZRP is a Group policy that articulates Zurich's approach to risks and sets mandatory requirements for risk management throughout the Group. The policy describes the Group's ERM framework and provides a standardized set of risk types. Risk-specific policy manuals provide requirements and procedures to implement the principles in the ZRP.\n\nThe Group identifies, assesses, manages, monitors and reports risks that have an impact on the achievement of its business strategy and objectives by applying its proprietary Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. The methodology allows Zurich to assess risks in terms of severity and likelihood, and supports the definition and implementation of mitigating actions. At Group level, this is an annual process, followed by regular reviews and updates by management.\n\nTo foster transparency about risk, the Group regularly reports on its risk profile at business, Group, and Board levels. The Group has procedures to refer risk topics to senior management and the Board of Directors in a timely manner.\n\nThe Group's solvency position is disclosed on the basis of the Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio. The Group's SST internal model is approved by the Swiss Financial Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Zurich's goal is to maintain capital consistent with a 'AA' financial strength rating for the Group, which translates into an SST ratio target of 160 percent or above.\n\nThe Group applies the Zurich Economic Capital Model (Z-ECM) as an internal metric. Z-ECM provides a key input into the Group's planning process as an assessment of the Group's economic risk profile.\n\n## Risk-based remuneration\n\nBased on the Group's remuneration rules, the Board of Directors approves the design and structure of remuneration arrangements that support the achievement of strategic and financial objectives, without encouraging inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nGroup Risk Management's role in respect of remuneration and its interaction with Board committees is described in the remuneration report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further adjustments to derive SST AFR typically include deductions for proposed dividends and share buyback, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as the market-consistent valuation of insurance liabilities, which includes market value margin (MVM) and the value of in-force business. The MVM, also known as risk margin, is the cost of future regulatory risk capital stemming from the present portfolio of assets and liabilities.\n\nZurich strives to simplify the Group's legal entity structure to reduce complexity and increase fungibility of capital.\n\nFrom January 1, 2023 the Group applies IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' and IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. For more information including the transitional effects on shareholders' equity from the transition to IFRS 9, refer to note 2 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Capital management framework\n\nThe Group's capital management framework forms the basis for actively managing capital within Zurich. The Group uses a number of different capital models, taking into account economic, regulatory, and rating agency constraints. The Group's capital and solvency position is monitored and regularly reported to the Executive Committee (ExCo) and Board of Directors.\n\nZurich's policy is to allocate capital to businesses earning the highest risk-adjusted returns, and to pool risks and capital as much as possible to operationalize its risk diversification.\n\nThe Group's executive management determines the capital management strategy and sets the principles, standards and policies to execute the strategy. Group Treasury and Capital Management executes the strategy.\n\n## Capital management program\n\nThe Group's capital management program comprises various actions to optimize shareholders' total return and to meet capital needs, while enabling Zurich to take advantage of growth opportunities. Such actions include paying and receiving dividends, capital repayments, share buybacks, issuance of shares, issuance of senior and hybrid debt, securitization and purchase of reinsurance.\n\nThe Group seeks to maintain a balance between returns for shareholders and the security that a sound capital position provides, also for our customers. Dividends, share buybacks, and issuances and redemption of debt have a significant influence on capital levels. During 2023, the Group:\n\n- - paid a dividend out of retained earnings,\n- - bought own shares, and\n- - repaid senior and hybrid debt to reduce financial leverage.\n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations stipulates that dividends may only be paid out of freely distributable reserves or retained earnings. Apart from what is specified by the Swiss Code of Obligations, Zurich Insurance Group Ltd faces no legal restrictions on dividends it may pay to its shareholders. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the statutory general legal reserve was more than 60 times the paid-in share capital. The ability of the Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends may be restricted or indirectly influenced by minimum capital and solvency requirements imposed by insurance and other regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. Other limitations or considerations include foreign exchange control restrictions in some countries, and rating agencies' methodologies.\n\nFor more information on issuances and redemptions of debt, see note 17 of the consolidated financial statements. For more information on acquisitions and divestments, see note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In each country in which the Group operates, the local regulator specifies the minimum amount and type of capital that each of the regulated entities must hold in addition to their liabilities. In addition to the minimum capital required to comply with the solvency requirements, the Group aims to hold an adequate buffer under local solvency requirements to ensure regulated subsidiaries can absorb a level of volatility and meet local capital requirements.\n\n## Regulatory solvency regimes\n\n## Regulatory requirements in Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss Solvency Test (SST) adopts a risk-based and total balance sheet approach. Insurance companies are required to provide a market-consistent assessment of the value of their assets and liabilities. Possible changes to these balance sheet positions are modelled over a one-year period to arrive at the total required capital.\n\nUnder the SST, insurance companies and insurance groups can apply to use company-specific internal models to calculate risk-bearing and target capital, as well as the SST ratio. The SST ratio must be calculated as per January 1 and submitted to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Zurich filed with FINMA an SST ratio of 267 percent (unaudited) as of January 1, 2023. Zurich met the regulatory solvency requirements in Switzerland throughout 2023.\n\nThe estimated SST ratio as of January 1, 2024 stands at 233 percent (unaudited). The final SST ratio as of January 1, 2024 will be filed with FINMA by the end of April 2024 and is subject to review by FINMA.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the European Economic Area (EEA)\n\nThe main regulatory framework governing the Group's subsidiaries in the EEA is Solvency II. This is a risk-based capital framework which covers capital requirements (pillar 1), governance and risk management (pillar 2) and reporting (pillar 3). All EEA-based legal entities of the Group use the Solvency II standard formula for their pillar 1 requirements with the exception of Zurich Insurance plc (Ireland) that applies an approved internal model.\n\nEffective January 2, 2024, Zurich Insurance plc moved to Germany, by means of a cross-border conversion under the European Directive on cross-border conversions, mergers, and divisions. In Germany, the company operates as Zurich Insurance Europe AG. The head office move had no material impact on ZIE's organization, customer facing and business activities in the local markets ZIE operates in.\n\nA scheduled review of the Solvency II framework is currently being conducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and will entail changes to the standard formula, reporting and introduces new rules around macro-prudential supervision and sustainability. The revised framework is expected to become effective in 2026.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the UK\n\nThe United Kingdom left the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020, meaning UK regulations can diverge from Solvency II regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2023 the UK regulations have not materially diverged. However, a review of the regulations (now called Solvency UK) was completed by the UK government in 2022, and this identified a number of areas where the regulations should be amended to better reflect the UK market. In 2023, the PRA and UK HM Treasury have worked to enable some of the UK government's proposals, with the rest of the implementation work expected in 2024.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., required capital is determined to be 'company action level risk-based capital' calculated using the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' risk-based capital model. This method, which builds on statutory accounts, measures the minimum amount of capital for an insurance company to support its overall business operations by taking into account its size and risk profile.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions\n\nEvery country has a capital standard for insurance companies. Several jurisdictions (e.g., Brazil and Mexico) have implemented approaches similar to Solvency II.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following the revision of the Swiss Insurance Supervision Ordinance in 2023, MVM is now part of the marketconsistent valuation of insurance liabilities and thus SST AFR. Market value margin, also known as risk margin, is the cost of future regulatory risk capital stemming from the present portfolio of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe SST ratio of 233 percent as of January 1, 2024, is well above the Group's SST target of 160 percent. The development of the SST ratio in 2023 reflects strong underlying capital generation offset by portfolio management and capital actions including share buyback. Market movements had a small adverse impact on the SST ratio.\n\nIn the SST ratio calculations as of January 1, 2024, no allowance has been made for the planned sale of the German traditional life insurance back book. For more information about the status of this transaction, see notes 4 and 28 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SST available financial resources (AFR)\n\nThe Group's AFR are derived from the SST net assets. The net assets represent the difference between the value of assets and liabilities according to the market-consistent valuation methodology under SST.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group's AFR reduced by USD 3.7 billion to USD 34.3 billion as of January 1, 2024, compared to USD 38.0 billion as of January 1, 2023. The main drivers of the AFR decrease in 2023 were capital actions related to the announced share buy back and reduction of subordinated debt, as well as impacts from portfolio management actions and M&A activities.\n\n## SST target capital\n\nThe Group uses an internal risk model to determine the required target capital (TC).\n\nThe Group's TC as of January 1, 2024 amounted to USD 14.7 billion, an increase of USD 0.5 billion compared to USD 14.2 billion as of January 1, 2023, driven by an increase in market risk and insurance risks following unfavorable market movements, and impact from a model change in market risk.

As of January 1, 2024, the largest components of total risk are market risk and premium and reserve risk, comprising 54 percent and 26 percent of the total risk capital, respectively.\n\nThe increase in total risk capital as of January 1, 2024 compared to January 1, 2023 is driven by an increase in market risk and insurance risks following unfavorable market movements and impact from a model change in market risk. Portfolio management actions partially offset the increase in total risk capital.\n\nThe contribution of market risk has increased to 54 percent as of January 1, 2024 compared with 50 percent as of January 1, 2023, following an increase in risk.

The SST AFR and solvency ratio sensitivities are presented before tax and net of external reinsurance.\n\nSST AFR and related sensitivities are evaluated as instantaneous market or insurance shocks. All elements of the economic balance sheet and the required capital sensitive to a market or insurance parameter shock are recalculated. For example, values of all balance sheet and risk components change when foreign exchange moves by 10 percent, however, in a shock to equity markets the P&C net insurance liabilities and risks remain constant.\n\nTo assess the SST AFR and ratio sensitivities, SST balance sheet positions are fully revalued under the given shock scenarios. Each instrument is revalued separately, taking relevant product features into account. Non-linear valuation effects, where they exist, are reflected in the calculations. Valuation of the insurance liabilities under the shock scenarios is based on the replicating portfolios representing the insurance liabilities in the SST Marker Risk model. The Life business replicating portfolios are portfolios of assets that replicate the cash flows or present values of the life insurance liabilities under stochastic scenarios from the local life valuation models, according to the methodology approved by FINMA. The replicating portfolios are calibrated to match dependencies of life insurance liabilities on financial market developments in respect of interest rates, equity and property. The options and guarantees of the underlying life insurance liabilities are captured through inclusion of options in the replicating portfolios. The P&C replicating portfolios are represented by zero coupon bonds and are sensitive to interest rate shocks.\n\n## January 1, 2023\n\nin %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sensitivities in the chart below capture impact on the Group SST ratio due to sensitivities to financial market movements.\n\nMarket risk sensitivities show the estimated impact on the Group's SST ratio of a half percentage-point (50 basis points, or bps) increase or decrease in yield curves, a 10 percent appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar, a 20 percent rise or decline in all stock markets, and a 100 bps increase in credit spreads, with and without eurodenominated sovereign bonds. The sensitivities are considered as separate but instantaneous shocks. They are a best estimate and non-linear, for example, a change to the size of the market movement could result in disproportionally higher (or lower) impact on the SST ratio depending on the prevailing market conditions at the time.\n\n## SST sensitivities\n\nas of October 1 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Base ratio and sensitivities as of October 1, 2023 are calculated reflecting the separation of the legacy traditional life back book in Germany.\n- Base ratio and sensitivities as of October 1, 2022 are calculated reflecting the Italian back book transaction completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. 2  Sensitivities are best estimate and reflect the impact on the pension plans in the UK.

        "page_content": "## Analysis by risk type\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of deviations in the timing, frequency or severity of insured events from that expected, leading to loss, including adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities (Life and Property & Casualty (P&C)). This may result from inherent uncertainty of insured events or losses, inadequate or ineffective underwriting or accumulation management, inappropriate product development, pricing, claims management, reserving or reinsurance. The profitability of insurance business is also susceptible to business risk in the form of unexpected changes in expenses, policyholders' behavior, and fluctuations in new business volumes. Zurich manages insurance risk through:\n\n- - Specific underwriting and claims standards and controls.\n- - Robust reserving processes.\n- - External reinsurance.\n\n## Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nP&C insurance risk arises from coverage provided for motor, property, liability, special lines and worker injury. It comprises premium and reserve risk, catastrophe risk, and business risk. Premium and reserve risk covers uncertainties in the frequency of the occurrence of the insured events as well as in the severity of the resulting claims. Catastrophe risk predominantly relates to uncertainty around natural catastrophes. Business risk for P&C predominantly relates to unexpected increases in the expenses relating to claims handling, underwriting, and administration.\n\n## Management of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nThe Group's underwriting strategy takes advantage of the diversification of P&C risks across lines of business, customers and geographic regions. Zurich defines Group-wide governance for insurance risk including for new products. Underwriting discipline is a fundamental part of managing insurance risk. The Group sets limits on underwriting capacity and delegates authority to individuals based on their specific expertise and sets appropriate underwriting and pricing guidelines. Technical reviews assure that underwriters perform within authorities and adhere to underwriting policies.\n\nP&C insurance reserves are regularly estimated, reviewed and monitored by qualified and experienced actuaries at local, regional and Group levels. To arrive at their reserve estimates, the actuaries take into consideration, among other things, the latest available facts, trends and patterns of loss payments.\n\nInflation levels remained elevated in 2023 after peaking in 2022 and continue to pose challenges globally, with various factors including supply chain constraints, components and labor costs, as well as social inflation having an impact on insurance losses, particularly on motor and property portfolios. Inflation is monitored with insights feeding into actuarial reserving models, and Zurich's underwriting processes and pricing, and the implications of a continuing high inflation environment and mitigating actions are a key focus area. The Group's existing risk management and governance processes continue to monitor and respond to the developing environment. Several actions related to inflation have also been included in the Group's Total Risk Profiling\u2122 and measures are being taken beyond rate changes, such as in claims and portfolio management.\n\nAdditionally, there is a concerted effort to foster communication between functions that extends beyond inflation challenges. To ensure a common understanding of business insights and new trends for reserve analysis, financial plans, underwriting and pricing decisions, the Group has established a culture of continuous cross-functional collaboration. For this, underwriting, actuarial (pricing and reserving), claims, finance, sales and distribution, risk engineering and risk management contribute to quarterly meetings at local and Group level.\n\nZurich's Emerging and Sustainability Risk Committee - with cross-functional expertise from core insurance functions such as underwriting, claims and risk management - identifies, assesses and recommends actions for emerging risks.\n\nGovernance is in place to ensure appropriate focus on top-line targets and profitability. Reinsurance is deployed to help manage insurance risk. Group Risk Management also provides independent assurance through risk reviews.\n\nThe Group is exposed to losses that could arise from natural and man-made catastrophes. The main concentrations of risks arising from such potential catastrophes are regularly reported to executive management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Natural catastrophes\n\nThe Group uses third-party models, adjusted to Zurich's view, to manage its underwriting, ensure accumulations stay within intended exposure limits and assess the capital requirement due to natural catastrophes. Consistent with this view on natural catastrophes, Zurich performs profitability assessments and strategic capacity allocations, and chooses the type and quantity of reinsurance it buys.\n\nTo ensure global consistency, exposures to natural catastrophes are modeled by a dedicated Group function. Potential losses from property, motor and marine policies with material exposure in hazard-prone geographical areas are probabilistically modeled, as well as worker injury policies with material exposure in U.S. seismic zones. Losses for other lines of business are estimated based on adjustments to these modeled results. Risk modeling mainly addresses weather-induced perils such as wind, flood, tornado, and hail, and geologically-induced perils such as earthquake. The most important peril regions for natural catastrophes are North-Atlantic hurricane, California earthquake and European windstorm. The Group has internal modelling capabilities for pandemics.\n\nZurich regularly reviews and expands the scope and sophistication of its modeling and strives to improve data quality. Zurich continues to invest in a diversified, multi-vendor-based catastrophe modeling ecosystem and in expanding its catastrophe research and development capabilities to complement existing expertise in natural catastrophe risk management (e.g., risks relating to climate change).\n\nZurich supplements internal know-how with external knowledge (e.g., the Advisory Council for Catastrophes) and is a shareholder of PERILS AG, Switzerland, a catastrophe exposure and loss data aggregation and estimation firm. Zurich is a governor sponsor of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation and is also a member of the open-source initiative, Oasis Loss Modelling Framework.\n\n## Man-made catastrophes\n\nMan-made catastrophes include events such as industrial accidents, terrorism and cyber attacks. For terrorism, worker injury and property risk exposures are analyzed to identify areas with significant risk concentration. Other lines of business are assessed, although the potential exposure is not as significant. A vendor-provided catastrophe model is used to evaluate potential exposures in every major U.S. city. The Group's analysis for the P&C business has shown that its exposures outside of North America are lower, in a large part due to government-provided pools. Outside the modeled areas, exposure concentrations are identified in Zurich's Risk Exposure Data Store (REDS). Exposure concentrations for location-based man-made scenarios, other than terrorism, are also identified in REDS, for example, industrial explosions at global ports.\n\nThe Group uses third-party models through a dedicated Group function to manage its underwriting and accumulations for cyber and casualty catastrophe risks. The Group actively monitors and manages its cyber exposure to ensure accumulations stay within intended limits and continues to refine products to ensure their appropriateness. Improving modeling capabilities and data quality for cyber and casualty catastrophe risks are key focus areas.\n\n## Concentration of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nThe Group defines concentration risk in the P&C business as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios. Concentration risk for a P&C insurer may arise due to a concentration of business written within a geographical area or of underlying risks covered.\n\nThe P&C business segment represents the largest concentration of risk, in terms of risk capital, with U.S. and Caribbean hurricane representing the largest concentration of risk in terms of SST ratio sensitivity.\n\nThe relative significance of premium and reserve risk (P&R) (unaudited) has increased slightly from 25 percent to 26 percent of the total SST risk capital as of January 1, 2023 and 2024, respectively, due to growth in net exposures primarily and foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe relative significance of natural catastrophe risk (unaudited) has decreased slightly from 7 percent to 6 percent of total SST risk capital as of January 1, 2023 and 2024, respectively, which has been driven by an increase in the contribution of market risk. Natural catastrophe risk itself saw continued increases in net exposures and small risk increases due to foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the Group's catastrophe reinsurance program, while a model update has led to a more favorable view on U.S.Hurricane.\n\nFor more information about the Group's concentration of risk within the P&C business by geographic region, using IFRS Accounting Standards as a basis, see the segment information in note 26 of the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The actual experience may differ to that expected at the time of writing the business. For example, mortality could be either higher or lower than expected due to an unexpectedly harsh or benign flu season.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of experience differing from expectations, Zurich uses models to perform sensitivity analyses. The impact of changing the assumptions is considered under different scenarios across the risk types and products. Changes relating to absolute level and trend development in assumptions are considered by product category. For example, Zurich looks at the impact of an increase in morbidity rates for protection products or changes in the level and trend of longevity for annuity products. These analyses assist in understanding how sensitive the business is to changes in various assumptions and where there are benefits of having a diversified portfolio of risks and products. Changes in the same assumption can have a positive impact on one product and a negative impact on another. For example, people living longer than expected may have a positive impact on products that offer life cover, as claims are then paid later than expected, but could have a negative impact on annuity products as payments are made for longer than expected. At Zurich, the Life liability risks are managed through established processes with requirements described in the Zurich Risk Policy.\n\nThe Group has local product development and approval committees and a Group-level committee to review potential new life products that could significantly increase or change the nature of the risks or introduce new risks. The Group also regularly reviews the continued suitability and the potential risks of existing life products open to new business to ensure sustainability of the business.\n\nProduct pricing involves setting assumptions relating to life insurance risks. Local teams have responsibility for the pricing of the products in line with the experience and emerging trends observed in each market. The emerging experience is regularly monitored and compared against expectations. Where permitted, premiums are adjusted for factors such as age, gender, and smoker status to reflect the corresponding risks. Policy terms and conditions and disclosure requirements are designed to mitigate the risk arising from non-standard and unpredictable risks that could result in a severe financial loss.\n\nThe underwriting process forms an important part of risk management and risk selection for life insurance risks. This process is supported through setting standards in the Zurich Risk Policy and providing support through additional underwriting guidelines.\n\nWhere required and appropriate, life insurance risks are also managed using reinsurance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\nAudited\n\nUnit-linked products are designed to reduce much of the market and credit risk associated with the Group's traditional business offerings. Risks that are inherent in these products are largely passed on to the policyholder, although a portion of the Group's management fees is linked to the value of funds under management, and hence is at risk if fund values decrease. Contracts may have minimum guaranteed death benefits where the sum at risk depends on the fair value of the underlying investments. Other life insurance liabilities include traditional life insurance products, such as protection and life annuity products.\n\nProtection products (including disability products) provide benefits linked to policyholders' life and health and mainly carry mortality and morbidity risks. Changes in, and availability of, medical treatments and lifestyle changes are among the most significant factors that could result in earlier or more claims than expected or customers claiming for longer than expected. The risk selection process is informed by medical, lifestyle and financial parameters of applicants. Access to health information can potentially be restricted through regulation or undocumented health results. Advancements in biological and genetic testing may give individuals health information inaccessible to insurers. This in turn could lead to an inability to reflect the true risk profile in pricing products, adverse claims experience and a reduced product offering. Disability, when defined in terms of the ability to perform an occupation, could also be affected by adverse economic conditions. This impact could come through, for example, an increase in claims relating to mental health conditions triggered by an economic downturn.\n\nLife annuity products provide benefits that are paid to the customer either for a selected number of years, or until they die. Therefore, these products carry longevity risk as people living longer than expected can have a material impact on these products. Medical advances and improved social conditions that lead to increased longevity are significant risk drivers for these products. Annuitant (beneficiary) mortality assumptions include allowance for future mortality improvements. The trends in mortality improvements are monitored to ensure that changes in experience are considered. The exposure to longevity risk at a Group level is measured regularly and compared against the limit set by the Group.\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks posed by policyholder behavior and fluctuating expenses. These are mitigated by designing products that, as closely as possible, match revenue and expenses associated with the contract.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to investment and surrender risks related to bank-owned life insurance contracts sold in the U.S. These risks have reduced significantly in recent years as several significant policies have switched into less risky investment divisions. See heading 'Other assets at amortized cost' in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\nIn the past, low interest rates have led to an increase in both Life business risks and Life liability risks (especially longevity risk). While interest rates have recently risen, the level of interest rates remains an important factor in the evaluation of insurance risks.\n\nFurthermore, interest rate guarantees (with concentration in traditional guaranteed business in Germany and Switzerland) expose Zurich to financial losses that may arise as a result of adverse movements in interest rates combined with potential increases in policyholders surrendering their policies. These guarantees are managed through a combination of asset-liability management and hedging.\n\nThe Group has a dynamic hedging strategy to reduce the investment risk associated with the closed book of variable annuities written by its U.S. subsidiary, Zurich American Life Insurance Company. This exposure has fallen substantially as a result of several policy buyback programs since 2015.\n\nHigher than expected inflation could affect Life insurance business through, for example, customer affordability issues and reduced demand. The expenses to administer Life insurance business could be higher than expected, leading to higher product expense loads. This could result in a combination of higher customer premiums and reduced profitability. Potential actions to manage the effects of higher-than-expected inflation include assumption updates, customer behavior monitoring, product reviews and design and customer retention initiatives.\n\nDiversification across regions and businesses, as further described, contributes to reducing the impacts of the risks associated with the Life business described above.\n\n## Concentration of Life insurance risk\n\nThe Group defines concentration risk in the Life business as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios of assets or obligations. Concentration risk for a life insurer may arise with respect to investments in a geographical area, economic sector, or individual issuers, or due to a concentration of business written within a geographical area, of a product type, or of underlying risks covered. The Group's exposure to life insurance risks varies significantly by geographic region and line of business and may change over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, it supports the Group Underwriting strategy and risk appetite. The Group follows a centralized reinsurance purchasing strategy for both P&C and Life, and bundles programs, where appropriate, to benefit from diversification and economies of scale. In support of the Group's empowerment-based management model and to align risk-bearing capacities between the Group and individual country operations, internal reinsurance applies to all externally reinsured lines of business. The Group has specific facultative property and casualty reinsurance facilities to actively manage and reduce potential claims-recovery risks on facultative cessions and to support the strategy on operational excellence.\n\nThe Group structures and aligns its external reinsurance protection to its capital position to achieve an optimal risk-return ratio. This includes participation in the underlying risks through self-retentions in line with the risk appetite of each line of business. The cession rate for P&C was 17.0 percent as of December 31, 2023 (12.3 percent excluding captives, unaudited) and 17.5 percent as of December 31, 2022 (12.5 percent excluding captives, unaudited). The cession rate for Life was 14.4 percent as of December 31, 2023 and 13.1 percent as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Group uses traditional and collateralized reinsurance markets to protect itself against extreme single events, multiple event occurrences across regions, and increased frequency of events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A global property catastrophe treaty was renewed on April 1, 2022, for a further three years.\n\nIn 2023, the Group purchased:\n\n- - Several regional catastrophe treaties.\n- - A new top layer catastrophe treaty for U.S. Hurricane and North American Earthquake.\n\nAll natural catastrophe reinsurance treaties are on a loss-occurrence basis.\n\nIn addition to these covers, the Group has two bilateral risk swaps, and various line of business-specific risk treaties. These covers are reviewed continuously and are subject to change in the future. To complement existing treaties, the Group purchases catastrophe reinsurance specific to life insurance for its exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes.\n\nThe reinsurance market continues to be challenging with reinsurers pursuing an increase in rates across most regions and lines of business. While property catastrophe and property per risk treaties are still facing pricing pressure, this has eased somewhat for property catastrophe treaties.\n\nTerms and conditions for Casualty, especially U.S. Casualty will be put to the test. While reinsurance capacity has broadly been available, reinsurers are actively differentiating the best and most sophisticated insurance companies through their deployment of capacity.\n\nStrategic partnerships and long-term relationships continue to provide an effective path for Zurich to execute on its reinsurance strategy.\n\nThe Group follows a strategy of diversification of reinsurance placements in order to manage its counterparty exposure.

Risk factors include:\n\n- - Equity market price changes.\n- - Real estate market price changes.\n- - Interest rate changes.\n- - Credit and swap spread changes.\n- - Defaults of issuers.\n- - Changes in currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Group manages the market risk of assets relative to liabilities on an economic total balance sheet basis. This is done to achieve the maximum risk-adjusted excess return on assets relative to the liability benchmark, while also taking into account the Group's risk tolerance and local regulatory constraints.\n\nThe Group has policies and limits to manage market risk and keep its strategic asset allocation in line with its risk capacity. Zurich centrally manages certain asset classes to control aggregation of risk and provides a consistent approach to constructing portfolios and selecting external asset managers. It diversifies portfolios, investments and asset managers, and regularly measures and manages market risk exposure. The Group defines limits on concentration of investments in single issuers and certain asset classes, as well as the degree to which asset interest rate sensitivities may deviate from liability interest rate sensitivities. The Group regularly reviews its capacity to hold illiquid investments.\n\nThe Asset/Liability Management Investment Committee reviews and monitors the Group strategic asset allocation and tactical boundaries, and monitors Group asset/liability exposure. The Group oversees the activities of local asset/liability management investment committees and regularly assesses market risks at both Group and local business levels. The economic effect of potential extreme market moves is regularly examined and considered when setting the asset allocation.\n\nRisk assessment reviews include the analysis of the management of interest rate risk for each major maturity bucket and adherence to the aggregate positions with risk limits. The Group follows processes to manage market risks and to analyze market risk hotspots. Actions to mitigate risks are taken, if necessary, to manage fluctuations affecting asset/ liability mismatch and risk-based capital.\n\nThe Group may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate market risks arising from changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, from credit quality of assets, and from commitments to third parties. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments mostly for economic hedging purposes and, in limited circumstances, the instruments may also meet the definition of an effective hedge for accounting purposes.\n\nIn compliance with Swiss insurance regulation, the Group's policy prohibits speculative trading in derivatives, meaning a pattern of so-called 'in-and-out trading' activity without any reference to an underlying position. The Group addresses the risks arising from derivatives through a stringent policy that requires approval of a derivative program before transactions are initiated, and by subsequent regular monitoring by Group Risk Management of open positions and annual reviews of derivative programs.\n\nFor more information on the Group's investment result, including the treatment of selected financial instruments, see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.

These could affect the Group's liquidity, reported income, economic surplus and regulatory capital position. Equity risk exposure includes common stocks (including equity unit trusts), private equity, common stock portfolios backing participating-withprofit policyholder contracts, and equities held for employee benefit plans. Exposure to real estate risk includes direct holdings in property and property company shares and funds. Returns on unit-linked contracts, whether classified as insurance or investment contracts, may be exposed to risks from equity and real estate, but these risks are borne by policyholders. The Group is however indirectly exposed to market movements from unit-linked contracts with respect to both earnings and economic capital; market movements affect the amount of fee income earned when the fee income level is dependent on the valuation of the asset base. Therefore, the value of in-force business for unit-linked business can be negatively affected by adverse movements in equity and real estate markets.\n\nThe Group manages its risks related to equity securities and real estate as part of the overall investment risk management process and applies limits as expressed in policies and guidelines. Specifically, Zurich limits holdings in equities, real estate and alternative investments. To realize an optimal level of risk diversification, the strategy for equities is defined through a composite of market benchmark indices. The Group has the capability and processes in place to change the exposure to key equity markets via the use of derivatives or purchase or sale of securities within a short time frame.\n\nFor additional information on equity securities and investment property, see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk from interest rates and credit spreads\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of an adverse economic impact resulting from changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Yield curve changes affect the value of interest rate-sensitive investments and derivatives as well as the fair value of insurance liabilities. Other balance sheet items, such as liability investment contracts, debt issued by the Group, commercial and residential mortgages, employee benefit plans, loans and receivables, are also affected.\n\nThe Group manages credit spread risk, which is the variation in economic value due to changes in the level or the volatility of credit spreads over the risk-free interest rate. Movements of credit spreads are driven by several factors including changes in expected default probability, default losses, risk premium, liquidity and other effects.\n\nReturns on unit-linked contracts, whether classified as insurance or investment contracts, are at the risk of the policyholder; however, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads insofar as they affect the amount of fee income earned if the fee income level is dependent on the valuation of the asset base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Default risk is controlled by Group counterparty concentration risk limits which aim to keep the size of potential losses to an acceptable level.\n\nExposure level limits are in place and are based on default and recovery rates. Limits tighten progressively for lower-rated exposures. Where the Group identifies investments that are expected to trigger limit breaches, appropriate mitigating actions are implemented.\n\nFor information on the Group's debt securities by rating of issuer and the corresponding allowance for expected credit losses, see note 23 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Debt securities - credit risk concentration by industry\n\n## in %, as of December 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest concentration in the Group's debt securities portfolio was government related at 51 percent of all debt securities.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nTo reduce credit concentration, settlement and operational risks, the Group limits the amount of cash that can be deposited with a single counterparty. The Group also maintains an authorized list of acceptable cash counterparties.\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to USD 7.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and USD 7.6 billion as of December 31, 2022. The risk-weighted average rating of the overall cash portfolio was 'A-' as of December 31, 2023 and 'A-' as of December 31, 2022. The ten largest bank exposures represent 50 percent of the total cash and cash equivalents amount, of which the risk-weighted average rating was 'A-' as of December 31, 2023 and 'A' as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Mortgage loans and other loans\n\nMortgage loans amounted to USD 4.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and USD 5.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Group's largest mortgage loan portfolios are held in Switzerland (USD 3.0 billion), in Italy (USD 0.5 billion) and in Germany (USD 0.5 billion); these are predominantly secured against residential property but also include mortgages secured by commercial property.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe replacement value of outstanding derivatives represents a credit risk to the Group. These instruments include interest rate and cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and purchased options. A potential exposure could also arise from possible changes in replacement values. The Group regularly monitors credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions. Outstanding positions with external counterparties are managed through an approval process embedded in derivative programs.\n\nTo limit credit risk, derivative financial instruments are executed with counterparties rated 'BBB' or higher as per Zurich Risk Policy requirements. The Group's standard practice is to only transact derivatives with those counterparties for which the Group has in place an ISDA Master Agreement, with a Credit Support Annex. This mitigates credit exposures from over-the-counter transactions due to close-out netting and requires the counterparty to post collateral when the derivative position exceeds an agreed threshold. The Group further mitigates credit exposures from derivative transactions by using exchange-traded or centrally cleared instruments whenever possible.\n\n## Risk from currency exchange rates\n\nCurrency risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in exchange rates. The Group operates internationally and therefore is exposed to the financial impact of changes in the exchange rates of various currencies. The Group's presentation currency is the U.S. dollar, but its assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in many currencies, with significant amounts in euro, Swiss franc, British pound and U.S. dollar. On entity balance sheets a currency mismatch may cause a balance sheet's net asset value to fluctuate, either through income or directly through equity. The Group manages this risk by matching foreign currency positions on entity balance sheets within prescribed limits. Residual entity mismatches are reported centrally to make use of the netting effect across the Group. Zurich hedges these residual entity mismatches within an established limit through a central balance sheet. For information on net gains/losses on foreign currency transactions included in the consolidated income statements, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The monetary currency risk exposure on entity balance sheets is considered immaterial.\n\nDifferences arise when functional currencies are translated into the Group's presentation currency, the U.S. dollar. The Group applies net investment hedge accounting to protect against the impact that changes in certain exchange rates might have on selected net investments.\n\nTable 6 shows the sensitivity of total equity based on IFRS Accounting Standards to changes in exchange rates for the main functional currencies to which the Group is exposed. Positive values represent an increase in the value of the Group's total equity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sensitivity analysis does not consider management actions that might be taken to mitigate such changes. The sensitivities do not indicate a probability of such events occurring in the future. They do not necessarily represent Zurich's view of expected future market changes. While table 6 shows the effect of a 10 percent increase in currency exchange rates, a decrease of 10 percent would have the converse effect.\n\nFor additional information about foreign currency translation and transactions, see notes 1, 3 and 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk associated with a loss or potential loss from counterparties failing to fulfill their financial obligations. See section 'risks from defaults of counterparties' for more information. The Group's exposure to other credit risk is derived from the following main categories of assets:\n\n- - Reinsurance assets.\n- - Receivables.\n\nThe Group's objective in managing credit risk exposures is to maintain them within parameters that reflect the Group's strategic objectives, and its risk appetite and tolerance. Sources of credit risk are assessed and monitored, and the Group has policies to manage specific risks within various subcategories of credit risk. To assess counterparty credit risk, the Group uses ratings assigned by external rating agencies, qualified third parties, such as asset managers, and internal rating assessments. If the ratings of external rating agencies differ, the Group generally applies the lowest, unless other indicators justify an alternative, which may be an internal credit rating.\n\nThe Group actively uses collateral to mitigate credit risks. Underlying credit risks are managed independently from the collateral. The Group has limits and quality criteria to identify acceptable letter of credit providers. Letters of credit enable Zurich to limit the risks embedded in reinsurance, captives, deductible programs, trade credit and surety.\n\nThe Group has counterparty limits which are regularly monitored. Exposure to counterparties' parent companies and subsidiaries is aggregated to include reinsurance assets, investments, derivatives, and certain insurance products. Group aggregate concentration limits and relevant exception approvals are monitored in line with risk policy requirements.\n\nOn-balance sheet exposures are the main source of credit risk. Off-balance sheet credit exposures are related primarily to certain insurance products, reinsurance and collateral used to protect underlying credit exposures on the balance sheet. The Group has no material amount of off-balance sheet exposures related to undrawn loan commitments as of December 31, 2023. See note 21 of the consolidated financial statements for undrawn loan commitments.",

The Group typically only cedes new business to authorized reinsurers with a minimum rating of 'A-.' Of the exposure ceded to reinsurers that are rated below 'A-' or are not rated, 60 percent was collateralized as of December 31, 2023 and 46 percent as of December 31, 2022. Of the exposure ceded to reinsurers that are rated below 'A-' or are not rated, 62 percent was ceded to captive insurance companies in 2023, and 57 percent in 2022.\n\nReinsurance assets included reinsurance recoverables (the reinsurers' share of reserves for insurance contracts) of USD 27.1 billion and USD 28.1 billion, and receivables arising from ceded reinsurance of USD 2.1 billion and USD 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, gross of allowance for impairment. Reserves for potentially uncollectible reinsurance assets amounted to USD 117 million as of December 31, 2023 and USD 130 million as of December 31, 2022. The Group's policy on impairment charges takes into account both specific charges for known situations (e.g., financial distress or litigation) and a general, prudent provision for unanticipated impairments.\n\nReinsurance recoverables in table 7 are shown before taking into account collateral such as cash or bank letters of credit and deposits received under ceded reinsurance contracts. Unsecured reinsurance recoverables shown are after deducting collateral. Bank issuing letters of credit for the benefit of Zurich are, on average, 'A' rated. The value of the collateral received amounts to USD 17.2 billion and USD 11.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nTable 7 shows reinsurance recoverables and unsecured reinsurance recoverables split by rating.\n\nTable 7\n\n| as of December 31   | 2023 2022                   | 2023 2022   | 2023 2022             | 2023 2022             | 2023 2022                   | 2023 2022   | 2023 2022                          | 2023 2022                          |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                     |                             |             | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance |                             |             | Unsecured reinsurance  recoverable | Unsecured reinsurance  recoverable |\n|                     | Reinsurance recoverable USD | % of        | USD                   | recoverable % of      | Reinsurance recoverable USD | % of        | USD                                | % of                               |\n|                     | millions                    | total       | millions              | total                 | millions                    | total       | millions                           | total                              |\n| Rating              |                             |             |                       |                       |                             |             |                                    |                                    |\n| AAA                 | 5                           | 0.0%        | -                     | 0.0%                  | 22                          | 0.1%        | 1                                  | 0.0%                               |\n| AA                  | 4,969                       | 18.4%       | 4,493                 | 29.4%                 | 7,278                       | 26.0%       | 6,610                              | 35.2%                              |\n| A                   | 14,669                      | 54.2%       | 7,804                 | 51.1%                 | 13,342                      | 47.6%       | 8,101                              | 43.1%                              |\n| BBB                 | 2,563                       | 9.5%        | 586                   | 3.8%                  | 3,912                       | 14.0%       | 2,566                              | 13.7%                              |\n| BB                  | 822                         | 3.0%        | 419                   | 2.7%                  | 528                         | 1.9%        | 226                                | 1.2%                               |\n| B and below         | 172                         | 0.6%        | 70                    | 0.5%                  | 184                         | 0.6%        | 75                                 | 0.4%                               |\n| Unrated             | 3,873                       | 14.3%       | 1,915                 | 12.5%                 | 2,764                       | 9.8%        | 1,207                              | 6.4%                               |\n| Total               | 27,073                      | 100.0%      | 15,287                | 100.0%                | 28,030                      | 100.0%      | 18,786                             | 100.0%                             |\n\n## Credit risk related to receivables\n\nThe largest amount of the Group's credit risk exposure to receivables is related to third-party agents, brokers and other intermediaries.\n\nReceivables are diversified across a large number of counterparties and do not pose significant single name concentration risk. The biggest individual exposures are related to the large global insurance brokers; however, exposure to these brokers is small if compared to total receivables, and these brokers are not among the top individual counterparties where the Group has significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nThe Group has policies and standards to manage and monitor credit risk related to intermediaries.\n\nThe Group strives to keep the balance of past-due positions as low as possible.\n\nReceivables from ceded reinsurance are part of reinsurance assets and managed accordingly. For more information about receivables see note 14 of the Group's consolidated financial statements and for more information about the calculation of expected credit losses see notes 3 and 23 of the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss, adverse reputational, legal or regulatory impact, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people, systems or from external events, including external fraud, catastrophes, or failure in outsourcing arrangements. Zurich has a framework to identify, assess, manage, monitor, and report operational risk within the Group. Within this framework, the Group:\n\n- - Uses a scenario-based approach to assess, model and quantify the capital required for operational risk for business units under extreme circumstances. This approach allows information to be compared across the Group and highlights the main scenarios contributing to the capital required under Zurich Economic Capital Model (Z-ECM).\n- - Documents and reviews operational events exceeding a threshold determined by the Zurich Risk Policy. Remedial action is taken to avoid the recurrence of such operational events.\n- - Conducts risk assessments where operational risks are identified for key business areas. Risks identified and assessed to be above a certain threshold must have a risk response. Risk mitigation plans are documented and tracked on an ongoing basis. In the assessments, the Group uses sources of information such as the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process, internal control assessments, and audit findings, as well as scenario modeling and operational event data.\n\nThe Group has specific processes and systems in place to focus on high-priority operational matters such as managing information security and business resilience, as well as combating fraud.\n\nPreventing, detecting and responding to fraud are embedded in Zurich's business processes. Both claims and non-claims fraud are included in the common framework for assessing and managing operational risks. For Zurich's internal model calculations, claims fraud is part of insurance risk and non-claims fraud is part of operational risk.\n\n## Group own insurance\n\nZurich sets up and maintains insurance programs to protect the Group from the risk of adverse financial consequences of insurable events. They comprise Global Insurance Programs and Local Insurance Policies.\n\nZurich Global Insurance Programs are managed centrally and cover risk exposures such as:\n\n- - Property damage and business interruption/terrorism and political violence.\n- - Commercial general liabilities including risks related to environmental accidents.\n- - Professional indemnity and commercial crime.\n- - Directors and officers liability.\n- - Cyber-network security and privacy insurance.\n\nLocal Insurance Policies are managed locally and include coverage to meet mandatory local requirements or for country-specific risks that are not part of the Global Insurance Programs.\n\n## Data risk\n\nThe strategic relevance of data as a business asset is rising at a rapid pace and the risks associated with data management are becoming more and more prominent. Preventing risks such as data losses and privacy breaches and assessing and monitoring the potential misuse of data and losses triggered by failures in data management remain in focus. Specifically, appropriate governance of data for business purposes and decision-making processes, including automation, machine-learning techniques and other advanced technologies, remains a priority. As Zurich strives to inspire confidence in a digital society with its data commitment, assurance on the ethical use of advanced technologies is provided from a risk management perspective for the protection and privacy of data of our customers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe relevance of technological risks, such as cyber risk, is rapidly increasing across all data-driven industries. Exposure to these risks has grown in lockstep with the significant rise in digital services provided directly to customers and the increasing prevalence of digital ecosystems and cloud solutions in today's interconnected world.\n\n## Third-party risk\n\nOutsourcing and engagement with third parties introduces risks relevant to the delivery of our strategy, such as data loss or disclosure, disruption to critical customer services and regulatory compliance. Digitalization has accelerated the complexity and changes to the Group's third-party ecosystem. The Group addresses risks associated with third-party engagements along its supply and value chain. Applying a consistent Group-wide approach to third-party governance is among Zurich's key priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, increasing automation of processes, development of advanced analytics capabilities, and fragmented supply chains have contributed to an increasingly complex operating environment. In response to these challenges, and to better protect the interests of stakeholders, the Group continues to evolve its business resilience capability through a number of ongoing initiatives in relation to the protection and recovery of critical services and enhancing transparency around any associated risks such as pandemics, technology failure, and potential supply chain/power interruptions.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nThe Group considers internal controls to be essential for managing operational risk. The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management and internal control frameworks. The objectives of the Group's internal control system are to provide reasonable assurance that Zurich's consolidated financial statements and disclosures are materially correct, support reliable operations, and ensure legal and regulatory compliance. The internal control system is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate risks that could impact the achievement of business objectives.\n\nThe Group promotes risk awareness and understanding of controls through communication and training. Risk management and internal control systems are designed at Group level and implemented across the Group. Management, as the first line of defense, is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risk, and designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls. Testing of the relevant internal controls also forms part of the control life cycle.\n\nKey processes and controls in the organization are subject to review and challenge by the second and third lines of defense. The second and third lines of defense regularly report on observations, conclusions and recommendations that arise from their independent examination of internal controls. Control issues of Group-level significance and associated mitigation actions are reported regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board. The Risk and Investment Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group's risk management system, including the Group's risk tolerance and enterprise-wide risk governance framework, in accordance with the charter for each committee.\n\nThe Group's Disclosure Committee, chaired by the Head of Group Financial Accounting and Reporting, reviews the accuracy, completeness and timeliness and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements of external disclosures and the effectiveness of the respective internal controls. The conclusions result in a recommendation to the Group Chief Financial Officer to release the disclosures to the Audit Committee of the Board, who may then challenge the disclosures further. The Board reviews and approves the announcement of the results and the annual report before they are made public.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich's policy is to maintain adequate liquidity and contingent liquidity to meet its liquidity needs under normal conditions and in times of stress. To achieve this, the Group assesses, monitors and manages its liquidity needs on an ongoing basis.\n\nGroup-wide liquidity management policies and specific guidelines govern how entities plan, manage and report their entity liquidity and include regular stress tests for all major legal entities and branches within the Group. The stress tests use a standardized set of internally defined stress events, and are designed to provide an overview of the potential drain on liquidity should the Group have to recapitalize entity balance sheets. Similar guidelines apply at the Group level, and detailed liquidity forecasts are regularly conducted, based on entities' input and the Group's forecasts. As part of its liquidity management, the Group maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents and high-quality, liquid investment portfolios to meet outflows under expected and stressed conditions.\n\nThe Group also maintains internal liquidity sources that cover the potential liquidity needs within the Group, including those that might arise in times of stress. The Group takes into account the amount, availability and speed at which these sources can be accessed. The Group has access to diverse funding sources to cover contingencies, including asset sales, external debt issuance and making use of committed borrowing facilities or letters of credit. The Group maintains a range of maturities for external debt securities. A potential source of liquidity risk is the effect of a downgrade of the credit rating of the Group. This could affect the Group's commitments and guarantees, potentially increasing liquidity needs. This risk - and mitigating actions that might be employed - are assessed on an ongoing basis within the Group's liquidity framework.\n\nThe Group regularly analyzes the liquidity of the investment assets and ensures that the liquidity of assets stays in line with liquidity requirements. In 2023, the Group's holdings in illiquid assets were within its capacity.\n\nFor more information on debt obligation maturities, see note 17 of the consolidated financial statements, and for information on commitments and guarantees, see note 21 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's ongoing liquidity monitoring includes regular reporting to the executive management and quarterly reporting to the Risk and Investment Committee of the Board, covering aspects such as the Group's liquidity, possible adverse scenarios that could affect the Group's liquidity and possible liquidity needs from the Group's main subsidiaries, including under conditions of stress.\n\nFor more information on the Group's other financial liabilities, see note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. See note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for information on the maturity of debt securities.\n\nThe Group has committed to contribute capital to subsidiaries and third parties that engage in making investments in direct private equity and private equity funds. Commitments may be called by the counterparty during the term of the investment (generally three to five years) and must be funded by the Group on a timely basis. See note 21 of the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Strategic risk is defined as the risk of the strategy, or parts thereof, being rendered sub-optimal or unachievable.\n\nStrategic risks can arise from:\n\n- - Internal triggers such as inadequate risk-reward assessment of strategic plans or changes to underlying assumptions.\n- - External triggers including macroeconomic or geopolitical events or trends, regulatory or legal changes, or developments in the competitor landscape.\n\nThe Group works to manage risks associated with strategic business decisions through its risk assessment processes and tools, including the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process. As part of the annual assessment of strategic risks, the Executive Committee assesses potential risks from both external and internal factors, looking at the current year and beyond. The Executive Committee members define actions to respond as appropriate and review changes to the key risks and their status of actions at least quarterly.\n\nThe Group evaluates the risks of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions both from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. The Group conducts risk assessments of M&A transactions to evaluate risks specifically related to integrating acquired businesses.\n\n## Risks to the Group's reputation\n\nMany factors can affect Zurich's reputation including the Group's market conduct, relationship with customers, brand image, workplace culture, corporate strategy, underwriting practices, marketing efforts, claims handling, corporate responsibility, regulatory compliance, financial performance, communications, and crisis management. Every risk type has potential consequences for Zurich's reputation. Effectively managing each risk type supports preventing adverse reputational outcomes.\n\nThe Group aims to preserve its reputation by:\n\n- - Adhering to applicable laws and regulations.\n- - Following the core values and principles of the Group's code of conduct that promote integrity and good business practice.\n\nThe Group centrally manages certain aspects of risk to reputation, for example, communications, through functions with the appropriate expertise. Potential risks to Zurich's reputation are included in its risk assessment processes and tools, including the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process.\n\n## Sustainability risk\n\nZurich defines sustainability risks as those arising from events or conditions related to topics or trends relevant to the Group's Sustainability Framework and which adversely impact the achievement of Zurich's business strategy or targets.\n\nIn terms of characteristics, sustainability risks often possess longer time horizons that extend beyond a strategic cycle, which results in a higher degree of uncertainty regarding their potential consequences. In terms of perspective, sustainability risks are managed using the concept of double materiality. Double materiality refers to when risks associated with sustainability issues and topics affect Zurich (so-called 'outside-in' risks) and the risks resulting when Zurich's own activities have an influence on those issues and topics (so-called 'inside-out' risks). The latter typically have reputational consequences. As such, a variety of risk management approaches is used to support identification, assessment and responses to these risks.\n\nThe selection of approaches is informed by whether the sustainability risk is:\n\n- - An emerging outside-in risk: e.g., risks associated with climate change.\n- - An emerging inside-out risk: e.g., risks associated with fossil fuels or deforestation.\n- - A current outside-in risk: e.g., risks associated with severe weather.\n- - A current inside-out risk: e.g., risks associated with thermal coal, human rights (child labor, forced labor), or banned weapons.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "251\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Analysis by risk type (continued)\n\nSustainability topics are often a driver for other risk types (e.g., sustainability topics with respect to underwriting or investment management risks) and these are managed in accordance with the principles and requirements of the relevant ZRP Chapters. For more information about sustainability risk, refer to the section 'Managing risks and opportunities' of the Group's sustainability report.\n\n## Sustainability risk approach\n\nTo carry out effective sustainability risk management, we follow Zurich's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework and select different approaches to support e.g., the identification, assessment and response to those risks according to their perspective and time horizon.\n\nOur ERM framework helps to protect our company against natural, societal, economic and financial risks, and supports the identification of potential business opportunities. The framework also helps us to recommend proper response strategies, which can include the development of new products and services that support our customers in managing their sustainability risks.\n\nRisk identification and assessment: emerging sustainability risks are identified and assessed at least annually through the update of the Emerging Risk Radar. For risks that extend beyond the strategic cycle, scenario analysis is performed. For current sustainability risks, the identification and assessment is done in accordance with the process defined by the Emerging and Sustainability Risk Committee (ESRC) and the potential impact to the Group in line with the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology.\n\nRisk response: for emerging risks, risk response can include sustainability risk positions, which describes Zurich's appetite for a sustainability risk, and may also trigger the development of new policies, guidelines, products, processes, projects or other management actions. For current risks, it can entail a new Group strategic sustainability priority in line with the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology.\n\nExamples of sustainability risk positions:\n\n- - Zurich will not enter into new business relationships with companies that produce, stockpile, distribute, market, or sell banned cluster munitions or anti-personnel landmines.\n- - Zurich will not underwrite or invest in companies that generate more than 30 percent of their revenue from thermal coal, oil sand and oil shale unless formally approved science-based targets are in place (and engagement on phase out of OECD and EU 27 by 2030 and rest of world by 2040).\n\nAnother example of a risk response is the ESG integration in our investment management activities. We believe that proactively integrating sustainability risks and opportunities - expressed in ESG factors in our investment decisions across asset classes and alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices - will support us in our mission to achieve superior risk-adjusted long-term financial returns.\n\nRisk monitoring: emerging sustainability risks are monitored at least annually through the emerging risk process, while current sustainability risks are monitored through the Group-mandated strategic TRP.\n\nRisk reporting: emerging and current sustainability risks are reported internally and externally as required.\n\nFor more information about the sustainability risk approach, refer to the section 'Managing risks and opportunities' of the Group's sustainability report.",

Insurance revenue grew 8 percent with strong growth in our Commercial and Retail insurance business supported by continuing price increases of 6 percent over the year.\n\nThe combined ratio remained at a strong level of 94.5 percent versus the prior year. Higher earned rate as well as lower catastrophe losses were offset by inflationary trends.\n\nFavorable prior-year development of 1.5 percent was well within the indicated 1 to 2 percent range, demonstrating the strength of the Group's reserves.\n\nThe Group's Life business delivered an excellent performance, reflecting the success of the Group's strategy to focus on protection and unit-linked business.\n\nLife BOP of USD 2.1 billion was an all-time high. All regions contributed to growth, driven by a combination of solid underlying performance and favorable experience for long-term insurance, as well as revenue growth for short-term insurance and investment contracts.\n\nFarmers BOP increased 10 percent over the prior year, supported by a higher earned premium base at Farmers Exchanges 2 and a Farmers Management Services margin of 7.0 percent. The Farmers Exchanges 2 continue to grow in most books of business following higher rates and have taken strategic actions to secure long-term profitability. Farmers Re results benefit from improved underwriting results at a higher reinsurance participation ratio. The Farmers Life BOP is 25 percent lower than the prior year, as Farmers Life entered into a reinsurance transaction with Resolution Life for its individual life in-force book. The transaction completed on August 1, 2023.\n\n## Robust balance sheet and higher cash generation\n\nDuring the year, the Group continued to focus on and optimize the use of capital. The Group's balance sheet remained very strong with the Swiss Solvency Test (SST) 3 ratio at an estimated 233 percent, well above the Group's target of 160 percent or above.\n\nThe Group successfully converted earnings into distributable cashflow with cash remittances back to the Group of USD 4.8 billion over the year driven by operational earnings and remittances of excess capital from previously retained earnings.\n\n## Dividend proposal of CHF 26\n\nIn line with our dividend policy, the Board proposes an 8 percent dividend increase to CHF 26 per share.\n\nGeorge Quinn Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1  In local currency and after adjusting for closed acquisitions and disposals. Due to change in accounting standards (IFRS 17) effective as of January 1, 2022, no growth information for 2022 can be calculated.\n\n2  The Farmers Exchanges are owned by the policyholders. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to\n\nthe Farmers Exchange as attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services.\n\n- 3  Estimated Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio, calculated based on the Group's internal model approved by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA.\n- The SST ratio as of January 1 has to be filed with FINMA by end of April each year and is subject to review by FINMA.",

All amounts are shown in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest million unless otherwise stated, with the consequence that the rounded amounts may not always add up to the rounded total. All ratios and variances are calculated using the underlying amounts rather than the rounded amounts. This document should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Annual Results of the Group and in particular with its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Group adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' retrospectively from January 1, 2022; therefore, the comparative figures as presented in this financial overview have been restated for the effect of the adoption of IFRS 17.\n\nIn addition to the figures stated in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, the Group uses business operating profit (BOP), new business metrics and other performance indicators to enhance the understanding of its results. Details of these additional measures are set out in the glossary. These should be viewed as complementary to, and not as substitutes for, the IFRS figures. For a reconciliation of BOP to net income attributable to shareholders (NIAS), see note 26 (table 26.4) of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nCertain comparatives have been revised as a result of reclassifications and other adjustments.

This improvement was due to earn-through of higher yields as well as realized capital gains of USD 225 million from the Group's hedge fund portfolio, which reported a loss of USD 21 million in the previous year.

This was partially offset by an increase of USD 26 million in the fee result compared with the prior year.\n\nBusiness operating profit increased 7 percent to USD 3.9 billion compared with the prior year, driven by higher insurance revenue and an increase of the investment result, which was partially offset by the absence of a non-recurring real estate transaction in the prior year.\n\nThe combined ratio of 94.5 percent in 2023 was flat compared with the prior year. The loss ratio improved by 0.9 percentage points to 66.2 percent.

These increases more than offset the adverse impact of lower sales volumes in Italy and Switzerland and higher discount rates in the region.\n\nIn North America, PVNBP was 36 percent lower on a like-for-like basis compared with the prior year, driven by lower sales in the corporate business.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, PVNBP grew 44 percent on a like-for-like basis. This was driven by higher protection sales in Japan, which rebounded from a low level in the prior year, as well as in Australia, which benefited from increased volumes of corporate business.\n\nIn Latin America, PVNBP increased 61 percent on a like-for-like basis, benefiting primarily from higher sales in Brazil through the Group's joint venture with Banco Santander.\n\nNew business written in 2023 added USD 1 billion of CSM, 5 percent more than in the prior year. This was due to higher sales volumes which more than offset the impact of reduced new business margin of 6.3 percent (compared with 7.5 percent in the prior year) due to a less favorable business mix.\n\nPVNBP and NB CSM do not include short-term life insurance or investment contracts, which are accounted for with the premium allocation approach (PAA) method and IFRS 9, respectively. Insurance revenues from short-term life insurance, which is mainly related to protection business in Latin America, grew 9 percent on a like-for-like basis. Fee revenues for investment contracts, which are mainly written in EMEA, grew 19 percent on a like-for-like basis compared with the prior year, which was affected by negative market performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These factors, including an increase in liabilities related to insurance reserves and redemption of debt, also drove an increase in the total liabilities for the Group to USD 335 billion in 2023 from USD 309 billion in 2022.\n\n## Group assets\n\n## Group liabilities and equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders' equity:\n\nThe Group's shareholders' equity was USD 24.9 billion compared to USD 26.2 billion (restated for impacts of IFRS 9 transition) in prior year, primarily driven by the payment of the Group dividend of USD 3.9 billion and USD 1.8 billion of treasury share transactions, mainly related to the completion of the share buyback program announced in August 2022. These impacts were partially offset by net income attributable to shareholders of USD 4.4 billion and a USD 0.7 billion net favorable movement in unrealized gains and losses.\n\n## Treasury and capital management\n\nThe Group's balance sheet remains very strong, as demonstrated by S&P and Moody's financial strength ratings for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd of AA with a stable outlook and Aa3 with a positive outlook, respectively (as of February 14, 2024). In addition, as of January 1, 2024, the Group's estimated SST ratio 1 remained very strong at 233 percent.\n\nDuring the year the Group saw net remittances of USD 4.8 billion.

The acquisition included access to the distribution networks of the Farmers Exchanges via an agency access agreement as well as the rights to renewal commissions on existing business.\n\nThe preliminary opening balance sheet is presented within note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Kotak Mahindra General Insurance Company Limited\n\nOn November 2, 2023, the Group entered into a strategic alliance with Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited, through the proposed acquisition of a 51 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra General Insurance Company Limited for USD 488 million, through a combination of fresh growth capital and share purchase. Furthermore, Zurich will acquire an additional stake of up to 19 percent over time.

At the same time, we have made considerable progress towards our interim 2025 climate targets.\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nIn 2023, the world grappled with tragic loss of life in conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Additionally, inflation remained a persistent challenge throughout the year, although we began to see encouraging signs that it had peaked and was coming under control. Dramatic policy tightening by global central banks left interest rates at levels not witnessed in decades and created challenges for corporate funding and for the real estate sector. The regional banks in the U.S. came under particular pressure, requiring swift and opportune intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve to restore order and avert a potential banking crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Although inflation fell significantly during the year, led by disinflationary energy, goods, and food prices, service and wage inflation remained elevated. Financial markets experienced a volatile 2023, but were lifted toward the end of the year as hopes that inflation had been tamed and policy rates would fall bolstered investor confidence.\n\n## Navigating with stability\n\nThroughout 2023, Zurich's investment portfolio displayed stability. It benefited from a risk taking approach of continued judicious risk versus reward, as well as from its defensive stance within credit risk taking. Our fixed income portfolio is composed of 95 percent securities with a rating of BBB- or higher. Notably, we navigated the U.S. regional and Credit Suisse banking crises in the first half of the year without any direct impact of note. Our investment portfolio remains purposefully well diversified, with our investments spanning across regions and industries and with a balanced approach to risk taking across asset classes.\n\n## Robust net investment income\n\nIn 2023, our net investment income increased to USD 5.4 billion, compared to USD 5.1 billion in the previous year. This increase was primarily driven by higher interest rates earned on debt securities and increased rental income from our real estate holdings, which supported our investment income throughout the year.\n\n## Total investments,\u00b9 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Credit, private debt                  | 43.0%   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Government and  government guaranteed | 33.0%   |\n| Real estate                           | 9.0%    |\n| Cash                                  | 6.0%    |\n| Equities                              | 4.0%    |\n| Mortgages                             | 3.0%    |\n| Hedge funds, private equity           | 2.0%    |\n\n- 1  Market value of the investment portfolio (economic view).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| AAA                  | 17.0%   |\n|----------------------|---------|\n| AA                   | 15.0%   |\n| A                    | 28.0%   |\n| BBB                  | 32.0%   |\n| Non-investment grade | 7.0%    |\n| Unrated              | 0.0%    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Non-financial credit                | 32.9%   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Financial credit                    | 25.3%   |\n| Municipals, agencies,  state credit | 16.8%   |\n| Other                               | 11.6%   |\n| Asset backed securities             | 8.0%    |\n| Covered bonds                       | 5.4%    |\n\nRealized capital losses and revaluations resulted in a net loss of USD 696 million, with the gains made from the equity portfolio offset by losses from debt securities held as fair value through profit and loss and the revaluations of real estate portfolio due to higher interest rates.\n\nOverall, our net investment result in the profit and loss statement for 2023 amounted to USD 4.7 billion. The total return of all Group investments, including changes in unrealized gains, was 6.3 percent. Additionally, the market risk capital required in support of our investments only increased slightly during 2023.\n\n## Delivering on our climate targets\n\nDuring 2023, our responsible investment strategy saw considerable progress toward our 2025 interim targets. Since 2019, the Group has achieved a 43 percent reduction in emission intensity in our listed equity and corporate bonds portfolios. These reductions were driven by changes in portfolio composition and structural emission reductions of investee companies. The energy and utility sectors saw emission reductions mainly driven by the companies themselves. We also saw a reduction in emissions intensity for our real estate portfolio, where changes in energy supply, modernization measures and building management resulted in a 25 percent reduction compared with the 2019 baseline year (based on 2022 figures).\n\n## Rating of credit, private debt securities, 2023\n\nWe further increased our share of investments in climate solutions, i.e. investments in economic activities that contribute to climate change mitigation (including enabling activities) or adaptation. The increase was mainly driven by additional investments in green bonds and investments in green certified buildings. The Group's impact investing portfolio of USD 7.9 billion helped avoid 4.5 million metric tons of CO2e emissions and benefited 4.6 million people in 2023.\n\nWe strongly believe that simply divesting from companies with carbon-intense footprints is less effective than engaging with them to drive the shift to sustainable practices. On that journey with our investee companies, we have engaged with 60 percent of emitters of financed emissions that have not yet set science-based targets.\n\nIn terms of ESG products, the Zurich Carbon Neutral World Equity Fund, launched in 2021, is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and had net inflows of EUR 267 million in 2023, with assets under management reaching EUR 591 million as of December 2023.\n\nStephan van Vliet Group Chief Investment Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Credit and private debt securities per segment, 2023",

The Group operates in Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific through subsidiaries, as well as branch and representative offices.\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd, a Swiss corporation, is the holding company of the Group and its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Zurich Insurance Group Ltd was incorporated on April 26, 2000, in Zurich, Switzerland. It is recorded in the Commercial Register of the Canton of Zurich under its registered address at Mythenquai 2, 8002 Zurich.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd authorized these consolidated financial statements for issue. These financial statements will be submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 10, 2024.\n\n## 1. Basis of presentation\n\n## General information\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and comply with Swiss Law. The accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards, including the adoption and implementation of new accounting standards and amendments for the financial year beginning January 1, 2023 as set out in note 2.\n\nThe Group adopted IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' retrospectively from January 1, 2022; therefore, the comparative figures as presented in this annual report have been restated for the effect of the adoption of IFRS 17. The Group also adopted IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' from January 1, 2023. As permitted by IFRS 9 transition provisions, the Group did not restate the comparative information for the effects of adoption of IFRS 9, except for the application of the classification overlay for certain financial assets backing participating insurance contracts. The effects of the application of these standards are significant to the Group and are discussed in note 2.\n\nThe accounting policies applied by the reportable segments are the same as those applied by the Group. The Group accounts for intersegment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices. Dividends and realized capital gains and losses, as well as gains and losses on the transfer of net assets, are eliminated within the segment, whereas all other intercompany gains and losses are eliminated at Group level. In the audited consolidated financial statements, intersegment revenues and transfers are eliminated.\n\nCertain amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management about insurance and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities, investment valuations, interest rates and other factors. For more information about significant judgments applied, please see note 3.\n\nAll amounts in the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated, are shown in U.S. dollars rounded to the nearest million, with the consequence that the rounded amounts may not add up to the rounded total in all cases. All ratios and variances are calculated using the underlying amounts rather than the rounded amounts.\n\nThe Group has no direct exposure to the armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip and does not anticipate any material effects on its financial position or performance. While the direct exposure is limited, conflicts of this nature can contribute to uncertainty in the financial markets, potentially affecting monetary policies, oil prices and inflation. As reported earlier, the Group's exposure to Russia and Ukraine is also immaterial.\n\nDuring 2023, though the rate of inflation slowed, most economies saw continued tightening of monetary policy through increasing interest rates by central banks. The bond markets improved, buoyed by rising yields and falling inflation and mixed experience in the equities market which generally remained flat. Investment valuation and interest rates incorporate these market conditions as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and recoverability of intangible assets has been tested where the value of these intangible assets, including goodwill, is sensitive to prevailing market conditions. For more information on investments and fair value, please see notes 5 and 23, respectively. For more information on intangible assets, please see note 13.\n\nEffective January 2, 2024, the registered head office of Zurich Insurance plc (ZIP) was moved from Dublin, Ireland to Frankfurt, Germany by means of a cross-border conversion under the European Directive on cross-border conversions, mergers and divisions. While ZIP has converted to a German AG known as Zurich Insurance Europe AG (ZIE), it has preserved its legal personality in the conversion (i.e., no transfer of assets, dissolution or winding up were involved in this move).",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Effect of regulatory frameworks\n\nThe Group endeavors to manage its capital so that its regulated entities meet local regulatory capital requirements. In each country in which the Group operates, the local regulator specifies the minimum amount and type of capital that each of the regulated entities must hold in addition to their liabilities. In addition to the minimum capital required to comply with the solvency requirements, the Group aims to hold an adequate buffer under local solvency requirements to ensure regulated subsidiaries can absorb a level of volatility and meet local capital requirements. In addition, the Group is subject to minimum capital requirements in Switzerland.\n\n## Hyperinflation and rates\n\nThe Group considers various factors to determine whether an economy in a country where a foreign operation is situated is hyperinflationary. Any material translation adjustments resulting from initial application of hyperinflationary accounting is recognized directly in equity.\n\nAs of January 1, 2023, the Group initially adopted hyperinflationary accounting for its operations in Turkey. For the effect of the adoption and current year effect of IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies,' please refer to the consolidated statements of changes in equity.\n\nTable 1.1 summarizes the principal exchange rates used for translation purposes. Net gains/(losses) on foreign currency transactions included in the audited consolidated income statements were USD (99) million and USD (57) million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Foreign currency exchange forward and swap gains/(losses) included in these amounts were USD (226) million and USD (398) million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n##

It has a significant impact on the measurement of these contracts and the presentation of the insurance revenue and insurance service result. The impact is more pronounced for long-duration life contracts, where the measurement under IFRS 17 includes the recognition of a separate component of the insurance liability, contractual service margin (CSM), representing unearned profits from in-force contracts. For short duration contracts, all the liabilities for incurred claims are discounted under IFRS 17, which allows for consistency in presentation of short- and long-tail businesses. IFRS 17 further introduces a risk adjustment for non-financial risk, a separate component of the liability covering the uncertainty in the amount and timing of future cash flows.\n\nIFRS 17 introduces different measurement models for (re-)insurance contract assets and liabilities reflecting the different extent of policyholder participation in investment performance or performance of the insurance entity: non-participating or indirect participating (general model or the building block approach (BBA)) and direct participating (the variable fee approach (VFA)). For short-duration contracts, IFRS 17 permits a simplified approach (the premium allocation approach (PAA)), which can be applied to contracts that have a coverage period of 12 months or less or for which such simplification would produce a measurement of the liability for remaining coverage that would not differ materially from the one that would be produced applying BBA.\n\nThe Group applied IFRS 17 to (re-)insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held retrospectively from January 1, 2022, in accordance with the accounting policies outlined in note 3. The 2022 comparative figures as presented in this annual report have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 17.\n\nIn October 2022, the IFRS Interpretations Committee published the final agenda decision clarifying the treatment of multi-currency groups of insurance contracts where the underlying cash flows are denominated in more than one currency. The Group amended its accounting policy to require each group of contracts to be denominated in a single predominant currency of the cash flows within the group of contracts, which is not necessarily the same as the functional currency of the reporting entity issuing such insurance contracts. The Group completed the implementation of the amended accounting policy as of December 31, 2023. The resulting impact was not material to the Group's financial statements and is therefore included in the current period profit or loss.\n\n## Summary of IFRS 17 transition approach and effect\n\nThe Group determined the transition approach for groups of insurance contracts, depending on the availability of reasonable and supportable historic information. The selected transition approach affected the measurement of the CSM on initial adoption of IFRS 17 as follows:\n\n- - Fully retrospective approach - the CSM is based on initial assumptions when groups of contracts were incepted and rolled forward to the date of transition as if IFRS 17 had always been applied;\n- - Modified retrospective approach - the CSM is calculated using modifications allowed by IFRS 17, taking into account the actual pre-transition fulfillment cash flows; and\n- - Fair value approach - the CSM at transition is calculated as the difference between the fair value of a group of contracts, without the consideration of the demand deposit floor requirement, and the respective fulfillment cash flows measured at the transition date.\n\n## Standard/ Interpretation",

The Group applied a retrospective transition approach whenever practical, resulting in a large proportion of CSM from groups of (re-) insurance contracts measured under either a fully retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.\n\nIn applying the modified retrospective and fair value approaches for certain groups of non-life and life (re-)insurance contracts prior to the transition date, the Group used the modifications allowed under IFRS 17, such as grouping contracts issued more than one year apart into a single group for measurement purposes or applying interest rates as of the transition date and setting the cumulative amount of (re-)insurance finance income or expense recognized in other comprehensive income to nil. All such contracts were accounted for under BBA. In addition, the Group applied a modification for certain groups of non-life insurance contracts with long-tail outstanding claims at the transition date. The unwinding of the discount on the liability for incurred claims was based on the locked-in discount rates as of the transition date instead of the locked-in accident year discount rates. Furthermore, where the Group applied a modification for certain groups of life direct participating insurance contracts that were accounted for under VFA where the Group holds the underlying items, the cumulative difference in OCI was set equal to the cumulative amount recognized in OCI on the underlying items as of the transition date.\n\nIn applying the fair value approach, the Group determined the fair value of a group of insurance contracts as the price that the Group would pay to (or receive from) an average market participant for transferring a group of insurance contracts at the transition date. The cost of capital within a range of 6 - 9 percent was used to determine the remuneration an average market participant would require to hold the required capital over the period of run-off of the insurance contracts in the group, depending on the appropriateness of the respective cost of capital for a specific portfolio or in a specific market. Other input parameters included the required capital and the target surplus, as well as non-attributable expenses from the perspective of an average market participant. The CSM for a group of contracts was determined as the difference between the fair value of the group of contracts and the fulfillment cash flows as of the transition date.\n\nFor the presentation of the effects from adoption of IFRS 17 as of the transition date (i.e., January 1, 2022), please refer to the 2022 Annual Report. Due to significant increases in interest rates during 2022 and other market movements, we observed a significant reduction in unrealized gains from debt securities, which contributed to the reduction in the Group's shareholders' equity as published in the 2022 Annual Report. The effect on shareholders' equity from applying IFRS 17 was much less pronounced due to offsetting effects between asset and liability valuations. Therefore, the difference in shareholders' equity reduced from USD 8.8 billion as of January 1, 2022 to USD 984 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe relevant disclosures for insurance and reinsurance contracts are presented in note 7.\n\n## IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'\n\nThe Group adopted the requirements of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments,' including all the relevant amendments, from January 1, 2023. The Group assessed the business model for managing financial assets based on facts and circumstances as of January 1, 2023. The contractual characteristics test (also referred as the 'SPPI test') was conducted based on the contractual terms at initial recognition of the financial assets. The classification, measurement and expected credit loss (ECL) requirements were applied retrospectively by adjusting the opening balance sheet at the date of initial application. The Group applies IFRS 9 for all designated hedge relationships. As permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has not restated comparative periods, and only applied the IFRS 9 classification overlay, a transition option available under IFRS 17 in the comparative period presented on initial application of IFRS 17. The Group applied the IFRS 9 classification overlay for selected asset portfolios backing direct participating insurance contracts. Furthermore, the Group discontinued certain cash flow hedges of reinvestment risk arising from assets backing direct participating contracts as these derivatives are part of the underlying items held for these contracts. With the adoption of IFRS 17, these derivatives are presented as trading derivatives with the unrealized gains/losses included in the measurement of direct participating contracts.\n\nThe accounting policies for the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities have been amended for the adoption of IFRS 9 and are presented in note 3 alongside comparative accounting policies.\n\nUpon the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group made other presentation changes, including the reclassification of certain commercial real estate loans from mortgage loans to other loans, with the measurement basis continuing to be at amortized cost, to better reflect the nature of the instrument and the way the exposure is managed by the Group.\n\nTable 2.2 below provides a summary of the effect of the adoption of IFRS 9, including presentation changes from 2022 impacted by the overlay approach and amended classification and measurement requirements on the Group's consolidated balance sheet.",

The impact was mainly driven by the reclassification of underlying debt investments from AFS to FVPL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main effects of transition to IFRS 9 for the Group were as follows:\n\n- - Available-for-sale (AFS) equity instruments with a carrying amount of USD 9.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 are measured at fair value through profit or loss on transition to IFRS 9, as the Group decided not to apply the option to irrevocably designate equity instruments at fair value through OCI (without recycling). This application did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2023.\n- - USD 84.3 billion of debt securities previously classified as AFS were determined to be managed under the core business model of the Group, 'held to collect contractual cash flows and for sale' (HtC&S). Debt securities previously reported as held-to-maturity (HTM) under IAS 39 with a carrying amount of USD 1.8 billion that passed the IFRS 9 contractual characteristics test were assigned to the HtC&S business model and were measured at fair value through OCI upon transition to IFRS 9. The fair value of the instruments was determined at the transition date and unrealized capital gains/(losses) of USD 101.0 million were recorded in other comprehensive income.\n- - Certain AFS private debt portfolios with a carrying amount of USD 4.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 (for example, commercial real estate, infrastructure and other private debt) originally measured at fair value through OCI that passed the contractual cash flows characteristics test were classified under the 'held to collect contractual cash flows' (HtC) business model, and accordingly, were measured at amortized cost upon adoption of IFRS 9. The cumulative unrealized capital gains/(losses) in the AFS reserve amounting to USD (480.3) million as of December 31, 2022 were reversed against the carrying value of the debt instrument.\n- - The Group has assigned the HtC business model to positions classified as mortgages, other loans and receivables, and other financial assets under IAS 39 with a carrying amount of USD 13.1 billion as of December 31, 2022. These positions met the contractual characteristics test, and therefore remain measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9.\n- - The Group has designated USD 122.6 billion of financial assets held for unit-linked investment and insurance contracts at fair value through profit or loss in order to eliminate or significantly reduce accounting mismatches that would arise from measuring assets and liabilities on different bases.\n- - Under the previous accounting policies, certain debt instruments were designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option (FVO) to eliminate or reduce accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets and insurance liabilities on a different basis. To the extent the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 resulted in the elimination of such mismatches, the Group has revoked the FVO designation of certain debt securities with a carrying amount of USD 3.2 billion. These securities are now predominantly managed under the HtC&S business model, and accordingly were measured at fair value through OCI if they pass the contractual characteristics test. The Group has also decided to revoke the FVO designation of certain debt securities with a carrying amount of USD 194.2 million as of December 31, 2022, as their business model was determined as HtC&S. For these securities, the reversal of cumulative unrealized capital gains/(losses) had a positive impact on the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2023 of USD 177.1 million.\n- - USD 6.0 billion of debt securities previously classified as AFS were newly measured at fair value through profit or loss upon transition to IFRS 9, either because their contractual characteristics do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding or as a result of FVO designation. Indeed, USD 4.0 billion of debt securities are designated with the FVO in order to eliminate or significantly reduce accounting mismatches that would arise from measuring assets and liabilities on different bases at transition to IFRS 9. For these debt securities previously classified as AFS, the fair value was determined as of January 1, 2023, reducing the opening balance of the retained earnings by USD 360.5 million.\n\n## Reconciliation from IAS 39 loss allowance to IFRS 9 ECL allowance",

Specifically, the reversal of loss allowances recognized as of December 31, 2022 amounted to USD 45.7 million, and USD 157.3 million of expected credit losses were recognized as of January 1, 2023.\n- - The Group retrospectively applied IFRS 9 requirements for recognition of modification gains/(losses) on the refinancing of some financial liabilities, which reduced the opening balance of retained earnings by USD 8.5 million.\n- - Derivatives assets/(liabilities) with a fair value of USD 202.7 million and USD (707.0) million, respectively, were reclassified to derivatives held for trading as a result of the discontinuation of hedging relationships. Under the amended accounting policies, equity instruments held by the Group, including fund investments, are generally accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. As a result, fair value hedges related to foreign currency exposure no longer require hedge accounting and are replaced with economic hedges, as both changes in the fair value of equity instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in profit or loss. The Group also discontinued certain cash flow hedges of reinvestment risk arising from assets backing direct participating contracts as these derivatives are part of the underlying items held for direct participating contracts.\n- - Upon transition to IFRS 9, deferred tax recognition impacted the opening balance of retained earnings by USD 5.9 million.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Tax'\n\nThe Group has adopted the amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' for the financial year beginning January 1, 2023, and has applied the exception to recognize and disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar II minimum income taxes proposed by the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).\n\nThe model rules and other documents issued by the OECD on the Pillar II of BEPS (BEPS-Pillar II) aim to ensure that large multinational groups pay a minimum amount of tax on income in each jurisdiction they operate. The minimum effective tax of 15 percent is based on a pre-defined tax basis (GloBE income) and the so-called covered tax, using IFRS Accounting Standards as a starting point with defined adjustments to achieve a uniform basis to derive the effective tax rate.\n\nThe BEPS-Pillar II requirements for the Group are applicable for fiscal years 2024 onwards; therefore, the impact, if any, will need to be reflected in the Group's consolidated financial statements starting from January 1, 2024. The Group's implementation efforts on the model rules are well progressed. While it is considered not practicable at this point to fully quantify the potential impact on the Group's financial position or performance, given the dependency on the future tax basis in each jurisdiction, changing tax laws and the continued need to interpret the BEPS-Pillar II rules, the Group expects, based on its analysis to date, that the implementation will not have a material adverse impact on the Group's financial position or performance. The selection of jurisdictions in which the Group's subsidiaries and affiliated companies operate is driven by business reasons and not the avoidance of tax. Only a very limited number of subsidiaries and affiliated companies are located in low or nil tax rate jurisdictions, some of which are in the process of implementing changes to their local corporate tax laws, and all of these subsidiaries and affiliated companies carry out operative insurance, reinsurance and asset management activities.\n\n## Standards, amendments and interpretations issued that are not yet effective or adopted by the Group\n\nTable 2.4 shows new accounting standards or amendments to, and interpretations of, standards relevant to the Group, which are not yet effective or adopted by the Group. These standards, amendments and interpretations are expected to have no impact on the Group's financial position or performance.\n\nTable 2.4\n\n|                   |                                                         | Effective date   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Amended standards |                                                         |                  |\n| IFRS 16           | Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback                 | January 1, 2024  |\n| IAS 1             | Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current | January 1, 2024  |\n| IAS 1             | Non-current Liabilities with Covenants                  | January 1, 2024  |\n| IAS 7/IFRS 7      | Supplier Finance Arrangements                           | January 1, 2024  |\n| IAS 21            | Lack of Exchangeability                                 | January 1, 2025  |\n\n## Standard/ Interpretation",

Summary of material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nMaterial accounting policies applied in these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated.\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group amended its accounting policies for Group investments, other financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting. The amended accounting policies applicable for the period ended December 31, 2023 and the comparative accounting policies applicable for the prior period ended December 31, 2022 are outlined below.\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 17, the Group amended its accounting policies for (re-)insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. The amended accounting policies are outlined below and replace the accounting policies within note 3 section c) of the consolidated financial statements in the 2022 Annual Report. The 2022 comparative figures as presented in this Annual Report have been restated, where indicated, for the adoption of IFRS 17. The relevant disclosures for (re-)insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held are presented in note 7.\n\nOther accounting policies are presented as part of the respective note disclosures.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires critical accounting estimates that involve discretionary judgments and the use of assumptions which are susceptible to change due to inherent uncertainties. Because of the uncertainties involved, actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions and estimates made by management.\n\nSuch critical accounting estimates are of significance to consolidation principles, measurement of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held, the determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities, expected credit losses, impairment of goodwill and attorney-in-fact contracts, employee benefits and deferred taxes.\n\n## a) Consolidation principles\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity that Zurich Insurance Group Ltd either directly or indirectly controls. Generally, control is achieved by holding the majority of the voting rights which allows the Group to control relevant activities of the subsidiary. The Group may hold significant interests in investment entities, where the voting rights are not the dominant factor of control. To the extent the Group is involved in the design and has significant exposure to the risks and variable returns from such investment entities, the Group is deemed to have control and consolidates such investment entities. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition or from the date on which control is obtained. The results of subsidiaries that have been divested during the year are included up to the date control ceased. All intraGroup balances, profits and transactions are eliminated.\n\nChanges in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a change in control are recorded within equity.\n\nNon-controlling interests are shown separately in equity, consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared as of December 31 based on individual company financial statements at the same date. In some cases, information is included with a time lag of up to three months. The impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFarmers Group, Inc. (FGI), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides non-claims services and certain ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services (see section g) for details). Farmers Exchanges are owned by their policyholders and directed by the Board of Governors. The Group does not consolidate Farmers Exchanges as the Group does not have control over the relevant activities of Farmers Exchanges.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## b) Foreign currency translation and transactions\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nDue to the Group's economic exposure to the U.S. dollar (USD), the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated financial statements is USD. Many Group companies have a different functional currency, being that of the respective primary economic environment in which these companies operate. Assets and liabilities are translated into the presentation currency at end-of-period exchange rates, while income statements, statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recorded directly in other comprehensive income (OCI) as cumulative translation adjustments (CTA).\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, for practical reasons, a weighted average rate, if exchange rates do not fluctuate significantly. Foreign currency monetary items and foreign currency non-monetary items that are carried at fair value are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recorded in income, except for the following:\n\n- - Foreign currency translation differences that are recognized in OCI in conjunction with the recognition of unrealized gains or losses on debt securities held to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, changes in the discount rate for insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts held, and changes in the fair value of underlying items for insurance contracts; and\n- - Foreign currency translation differences arising on monetary items that form part of net investments in foreign operations, as well as foreign currency translation differences arising from monetary items that are designated as hedging instruments in a qualifying net investment hedge relationship, are included directly in OCI as CTA.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nThe Group considers various factors to determine whether an economy in a country where a foreign operation is situated is hyperinflationary, including the cumulative three-year inflation rate. If an economy becomes hyperinflationary, the financial statements of foreign operations with the functional currency of the hyperinflationary economy are restated to reflect the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period using the official consumer price indices commonly used in the respective country. The restatement includes all balance sheet amounts that are not expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date and items of comprehensive income for the current year by applying the change in the price index from the dates when the items of income and expense were originally recorded. The restated financial statements of a foreign operation are translated into the Group's presentation currency at closing rates. Any translation adjustment resulting from initial application of the hyperinflationary accounting is recognized directly in equity. The Group applies hyperinflationary accounting to its foreign operations with the functional currency of Argentinian Peso (from January 1, 2019) and Turkish Lira (from January 1, 2023).\n\n## c) Insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held\n\n## Scope\n\nThe Group applies accounting policies outlined in this section to insurance contracts issued that transfer significant insurance risk from policyholders or other insurance companies to the Group and reinsurance contracts held that transfer significant insurance risk from the Group to third party reinsurers. The significant insurance risk transfer is determined by comparing the present value of benefits payable if an insured event occurred with the present value of benefits payable if the insured event did not occur. This assessment is made on a contract-by-contract basis at initial recognition and not subsequently reassessed unless the contract has been modified (see below). Investment contracts with discretionary participation features (DPF) are accounted for as insurance contracts if the reporting entity also issues insurance contracts. Furthermore, financial guarantee contracts and certain fixed-fee service contracts (e.g., roadside assistance) issued by the insurance entities in the normal course of business are also accounted for as insurance contracts.\n\n## Separating components\n\nThe Group assesses its insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held to determine whether they contain any of the following components which need to be separated and accounted for under another IFRS Accounting Standard:\n\n- - Derivatives embedded in insurance contracts where the economic characteristics and risks of the derivative contract are not closely related to those of the host contract, and a separate financial instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative;\n- - Investment components that are not highly interrelated with the insurance components and for which contracts with equivalent terms are sold, or could be sold, separately in the same market or the same jurisdiction are accounted for as investment contracts; or\n- - Distinct service components, such as unattached risk engineering service contracts, claims handling service contracts provided to policyholders within their layer of risk retention or captive fronting services are accounted for as service contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Level of aggregation\n\nGenerally, a single contract is the smallest unit of account. However, under certain circumstances, a single contract contains components that are separated and treated as if they were stand-alone contracts, provided the criteria below are fulfilled:\n\n- - The insurance components are priced separately and are, or could be, sold separately in the same jurisdiction;\n- - The substance of the contract to be separated is the same as issuing multiple separate contracts; or\n- - There is no interdependency between the different risks covered and a lapse or cancellation of one insurance component does not cause a lapse or cancellation of another insurance component.\n\nSimilarly, for insurance and reinsurance contracts entered into with the same counterparty, the Group makes an evaluation of whether they are designed to achieve an overall commercial effect and therefore need to be combined and treated as one contract. The Group combines certain captive arrangements, where the policyholder and the captive reinsurer are the same counterparty, that are designed to achieve an overall commercial effect, which results in the net retention by the Group presented both on balance sheet and in profit or loss.\n\nThe level of aggregation is determined by dividing the business written into portfolios comprising contracts subject to similar risks and managed together. Portfolios are further divided into annual cohorts with contracts issued no more than one year apart, which are divided into groups of contracts based on their expected profitability: (i) onerous contracts, if any; (ii) contracts with no significant possibility of becoming onerous, if any; and (iii) remaining contracts, if any. Depending on the characteristics of the portfolio, an annual cohort may consist of just one group. The Group chose to group together those contracts that would fall into different groups only because law or regulation specifically constrains its practical ability to set a different price or level of benefits for policyholders with different characteristics. The effect of such grouping is not material to the Group.\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nThe Group recognizes groups of insurance contracts it issues from the earliest of the following:\n\n- - The beginning of the coverage period of the group of contracts;\n- - The date when the first payment from a policyholder becomes due (or when the first payment is received, if there is no due date); or\n- - An earlier date, if facts and circumstances indicate that the group is onerous.\n\n## Contract boundary\n\nThe measurement of a group of insurance contracts includes all future cash flows within the boundary of each contract in the group. Cash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums, or in which the Group has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with insurance contract services. A substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when:\n\n- - The Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the particular policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks, or\n- - Both of the following criteria are satisfied: (i) the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the portfolio of insurance contracts that contain the contract and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects the risk of that portfolio; and (ii) the pricing of the premiums up to the date when the risks are reassessed does not take into account the risks that relate to periods after the reassessment date.\n\n## Insurance contract classification\n\nThe Group issues non-life products including a variety of motor, home and commercial products for individuals as well as small and large businesses on both local and global basis predominantly through its Property & Casualty (P&C) operations. The majority of such insurance contracts are short-term and either have a contract boundary of one year or less or qualify for the simplified approach (or the premium allocation approach (PAA)) because the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage under PAA does not deviate significantly from the measurement that would apply under the general model (or the building block approach (BBA)). Therefore, such contracts are measured under PAA. Some non-life entities also issue individual accident and health products with a long-term contract boundary which are accounted for under BBA. The proportion of contracts accounted for under BBA is not material in the context of P&C insurance contract assets and liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The majority of such insurance contracts are long-term and measured under BBA. Some life entities also issue short-term protection products that fulfill the eligibility criteria and are accounted for under PAA. The proportion of contracts accounted for under PAA is not material in the context of life insurance contract assets and liabilities. Unit-linked insurance contracts and some traditional savings contracts issued in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Austria include policyholder participation features. Such contracts are classified as direct participating contracts and measured under the variable fee approach (VFA) if, at inception, all of the following criteria are met:\n\n- - The contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- - The Group expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items; and\n- - The Group expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nSome participating contracts do not meet the above criteria to be measured under VFA because of either the Group's discretion over the cash flows to be paid to policyholders (either in their timing or in their amount), or absence of a clearly identifiable pool of underlying items. Those contracts are accounted for under BBA indirect participating and presented as contracts measured under BBA in note 7. Furthermore, the Group applies BBA indirect participating measurement to certain contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholders. For example, BBA indirect participating approach is applied to contracts where contractual cash flows are adjusted for inflation based on a market-observable index of prices or rates.\n\n## Insurance acquisition cash flows (IACF)\n\nInsurance acquisition costs are selling, underwriting and initiating costs typically incurred prior to or at the start of the coverage period of a contract that are directly attributable to the acquisition of portfolios of insurance contracts, including, for example, sales commissions, direct response marketing, premium taxes and in-house expenses directly attributable to sales and policy issuance activities.\n\nThe Group allocates IACF to groups of insurance contracts in a systematic and rational way, differentiating between groups of contracts that have been recognized as of the reporting date and groups of contracts that will be recognized in the future, including expected contract renewals. IACF allocated to groups of insurance contracts not yet recognized as of reporting date are recognized as an asset presented within the insurance contract asset or liability attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts until they are included in the measurement of the group of contracts recognized. At each reporting date, the Group assesses the recoverability of such assets for pre-coverage IACF based on the expected fulfillment cash flows of the related groups of contracts, if facts and circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.\n\nIACF are amortized in a systematic way over the coverage period using the same pattern as for insurance revenue recognition. For contracts accounted for under PAA, certain acquisition cash flows are expensed as incurred for contracts where the coverage period of each contract in the group does not exceed one year.\n\n## Insurance service expenses\n\nThese expenses consist of claims and other insurance service expenses that the Group incurs in order to fulfill its obligations toward the policyholders that arise within the contract boundary of the underlying (re-)insurance contracts. They also include amortization of insurance acquisition cash flows, changes in the fulfillment cash flows relating the liability for incurred claims (LIC), losses on groups of onerous contracts and reversals of such losses, and impairment and reversal of impairment of assets for pre-coverage insurance acquisition cash flows. Costs incurred that cannot be directly attributed to portfolios of insurance contracts (e.g., cost incurred in connection with future business opportunities) are excluded.\n\n## Investment components\n\nInvestment components that are not separated based on the requirements outlined above are accounted for as part of the underlying insurance contract. Such investment components, which are treated as non-distinct components, represent amounts that the Group is required to repay to a policyholder under the terms of the insurance contract in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs. For most life products measured under VFA, particularly for unit-linked insurance contracts, the Group defines the cash surrender value as the non-distinct investment component. Any cash flows related to investment components are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Measurement under PAA\n\nFor non-participating insurance contracts that are eligible for PAA, the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage (unexpired risk) is simplified as compared with the measurement under BBA and is accounted for separately from incurred claims (expired risk).\n\nThe liability for remaining coverage (LRC) is measured initially based on the premium received less any payments that relate to eligible IACF. Subsequently, the LRC is reduced by the amount recognized as insurance revenue for services provided in the period less any amortization of IACF recognized as an expense in the period. Insurance revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis, unless a different pattern represents a better approximation of the release from risk under the insurance contract. Certain insurance contracts (e.g., extended warranty contracts) may include a significant financing component when the premium from the policyholder is due more than 12 months before the Group provides insurance coverage. In this case, the LRC is adjusted for the time value of money.\n\nWhere facts and circumstances indicate that a group of contracts is onerous at initial recognition, the Group performs additional analysis to determine if a net outflow is expected. The net outflow is recorded immediately in profit or loss, resulting in the recognition of a loss component for the liability for remaining coverage and the carrying amount of the liability for the group of contracts being equal to the fulfillment cash flows.\n\nThe liability for incurred claims (LIC) reflects a current, explicit, unbiased and probability-weighted estimate of the present value of the expected future cash outflows considering all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of those future cash flows. It includes an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk (the risk adjustment, see below). The risk adjustment is recognized as and when the claims are incurred and subsequently released to insurance service expense as the uncertainty associated with the amount and timing of claim payments is resolved.\n\nGenerally, the LIC is adjusted for the effect of time value of money and financial risk, unless the respective claims are expected to be paid within one year of being incurred. The Group selected the accounting policy to disaggregate the movement in the LIC resulting from changes in discount rates and to present this in OCI. The unwind of the discount on the LIC based on locked-in accident year discount rates is presented in profit or loss.\n\nAny premium receivables or accrued premium or claims payables that remain outstanding as of the reporting date are presented as part of the insurance contract assets or liabilities.\n\n## Measurement under BBA (including indirect participating BBA)\n\nEach group of insurance contracts under BBA is measured as the sum of the fulfillment cash flows, comprising (i) estimates of future cash flows and (ii) risk adjustment for non-financial risk (see below), and the contractual service margin (CSM). The estimates of the future cash flows represent a current, present value, probability-weighted estimate that is consistent with observable market information and is adjusted to reflect financial risk. The CSM represents the margin the Group is charging for the service it provides in addition to the compensation it requires for bearing risk.\n\nOn initial recognition, the CSM is measured as the difference between the expected present value of cash inflows and cash outflows, after adjusting for uncertainty and any cash flows received or paid before or on initial recognition.\n\nSubsequently, at the end of each reporting period, each group of insurance contracts is measured as the sum of (i) the liability for remaining coverage reflecting the fulfillment cash flows related to future service; (ii) the CSM; and (iii) the liability for incurred claims reflecting the fulfillment cash flows related to past service. The liability for incurred claims is created when the Group has an obligation to pay valid claims for insured events that already occurred and other amounts related to past service.\n\nThe Group recognizes income and expense for the following changes in the carrying amount of the LRC:\n\n- - Insurance revenue - for the reduction in the LRC due to services provided in the period, excluding any investment components (see note 9 for the composition of insurance revenue recognized in the period);\n- - Insurance service expenses - for losses on groups of onerous contracts, and reversals of such losses; and\n- - Insurance finance income or expense - for the effect of the time value of money and financial risk.\n\nThe Group recognizes income and expense for the following changes in the carrying amount of the LIC:\n\n- - Insurance service expense - for the increase in the liability because of claims and expenses incurred in the period, excluding any investment components;\n- - Insurance service expense - for any subsequent changes in fulfillment cash flows relating to incurred claims and incurred expenses; and\n- - Insurance finance income or expense - for the effect of the time value of money and financial risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group selected the accounting policy of disaggregating the movement in fulfillment cash flows between profit or loss and OCI; and\n- - Changes in estimates that arise as a result of changes in the application of discretion for groups of BBA indirect participating contracts, such as changes in the crediting percentage for policyholder participation, affect the future consideration that the Group will receive from the contract and adjust the CSM.\n\nThe CSM at the end of the reporting period is allocated over the current and remaining coverage period based on the coverage units. The coverage units represent the quantity of insurance contract services provided by the contracts in the group, determined by considering for each contract the quantity of the benefits provided under the contract and its expected coverage period. The Group has determined the sum assured (or annuity) in force as the main driver of coverage units for insurance contract service for non-participating contracts. The CSM allocated to coverage units provided in the period is recognized in profit or loss as insurance revenue.\n\nThe Group may provide an investment-return service in addition to insurance contract service under some traditional savings insurance contracts without direct participating features (e.g., endowment contracts). Such service is deemed to exist only if such contracts involve an investment component or the policyholder has a right to withdraw an amount. The Group expects the investment component or amount the policyholder has a right to withdraw to include an investment return and the Group expects to perform investment activity to generate that investment return. Whenever the Group provides both insurance contract and investment-return services to the policyholder, the coverage units are appropriately weighted to reflect both services to allocate the CSM over the current and remaining coverage period. The Group has determined the assets under management (or equivalent) as the main driver of coverage units for investment-return service.\n\nThe risk adjustment is released as part of insurance revenue as the uncertainty associated with the amount and timing of benefit payments is decreased or resolved.\n\n(Re-)insurance finance income or expense recognized in profit or loss are determined by a systematic allocation of the expected total finance income or expense over the duration of the group of insurance contracts. Depending on the nature of the insurance contracts, it reflects the effect of time value of money and financial risk as follows:\n\n- - For groups of contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk do not have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholder (e.g., term life contracts), the systematic allocation is determined using a risk-free rate, plus an illiquidity premium that is locked at the inception of the group of contracts; and\n- - For groups of contracts for which changes in assumptions that relate to financial risk have a substantial effect on the amounts paid to the policyholders (e.g., savings contracts with policyholder participation based on an index or a rate or other indirect participating contracts), the systematic allocation is determined using a rate that allocates the remaining revised expected insurance finance income or expense over the remaining duration of the group of contracts at a constant rate (effective yield).\n\n## Measurement under variable fee approach (VFA)\n\nInsurance contracts that fulfill all the participating contracts criteria specified above are measured under VFA. These criteria ensure that insurance contracts with direct participation features are contracts under which the Group's obligation to the policyholder is the net of:\n\n- - The obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items; and\n- - A variable fee that the Group will deduct from the above in exchange for the future service provided by the insurance contract, consisted of the amount of the Group's share of the fair value of the underlying items less fulfillment cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items.\n\nThe underlying items for unit-linked insurance contracts are the unit-linked assets typically held in pooled investment vehicles that meet the specific investment objective of the policyholders, who fundamentally bear the credit, market and liquidity risk of the related investments. The underlying items for traditional savings contracts issued in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Austria are the net assets, or a specified subset of the net assets, of the issuing insurance entity. The net assets, or a subset of the net assets, typically include financial instruments held in the Group investment portfolio (debt securities, equity securities, investment properties, mortgage loans and other assets).",

The coverage units are appropriately weighted to reflect both services to allocate the CSM over the current and remaining coverage period. For these direct participating contracts and other savings contracts, sum assured in force and assets under management (or equivalent) are included to reflect the weighting for insurance and investment services and the pattern of delivery of those services.\n\nMeasurement under VFA reflects the nature of participating contracts; therefore, changes in the amount of the entity's share of the fair value of the underlying items relate to future service and adjust the CSM. Similarly, the change in the effect of time value of money and financial risks not arising from the underlying items (for example, the effect of financial guarantees) relates to future service and adjusts the CSM, except where risk mitigation applies.\n\nRisk mitigation applies in limited circumstances where the Group hedges the risks associated with such financial guarantees using derivative financial instruments or reinsurance contracts held under a documented risk management objective and strategy. In such cases, the changes in the effect of financial guarantees are recognized immediately in profit or loss in the same way as the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments. Other changes in the fulfillment cash flows are treated consistently with BBA measurement, i.e., they adjust CSM if related to future service, or are recognized immediately in profit or loss if related to current or past service. However, as opposed to BBA, all the adjustments are measured using current discount rates.\n\nWhere the underlying items are the net assets or a specified subset of the net assets of the issuing insurance entity, in addition to the participation in the returns from underlying financial assets, the policyholder participates in the risk and/ or expense results. While the risk and expense results are included within the insurance service results, the policyholder participation thereon is included within the insurance finance income or expense.\n\nChanges in the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items do not relate to future service and do not adjust the CSM.\n\nFor all contracts with direct participation features where the Group holds the underlying items, the Group applies the accounting policy choice of disaggregating insurance finance income or expense for the period to include in profit or loss an amount that eliminates accounting mismatches, with income or expense included in profit or loss on the underlying items held.\n\n## Reinsurance contracts held\n\nThe Group enters into reinsurance contracts in the normal course of business to limit the potential for losses arising from certain exposures. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Group as the originating insurer of its liability. Reinsurance contracts held are recorded separately unless the contract combination criteria specified above are fulfilled.\n\nSimilar to insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held are accounted for under PAA, if the qualifying criteria for PAA are fulfilled, or BBA in all other cases. The following differences specifically apply to reinsurance contracts held:\n\n- - Classification: Reinsurance contracts held can never be classified as direct participating contracts; hence, measurement under VFA does not apply.\n- - Level of aggregation: Reinsurance contracts held cannot be onerous; therefore, at initial recognition, the groups of reinsurance contracts held comprise (i) contracts in a net gain position, if any; (ii) contracts with no significant possibility of turning into a net gain position subsequently, if any; and (iii) remaining contracts, if any.\n- - Recognition of the CSM: As reinsurance contracts held cannot be onerous, for the groups of reinsurance contracts held accounted for under BBA, the CSM is recognized regardless of whether the reinsurance contract is a net gain or a net cost for the Group.\n- - Recognition of the risk of non-performance: The measurement of reinsurance contracts held includes the effect of non-performance risk of the reinsurer which considers the reinsurer's credit rating and the expected recovery period.\n- - Presentation: The Group presents the income or expense from reinsurance contracts held, other than reinsurance finance income or expense, as a single amount in profit or loss.\n\nReinsurance contracts held are measured using assumptions consistent with the assumptions used for the underlying insurance contracts for the fulfillment cash flows. The risk adjustment for non-financial risk represents the amount of risk being transferred by the holder of the reinsurance contract to the issuer of that contract. Consistent with the underlying insurance contracts, the Group made an accounting policy choice of disaggregating the reinsurance finance income or expense between profit or loss and OCI.\n\nIf reinsurance contracts held cover underlying onerous insurance contracts, a loss recovery component is recognized only if the reinsurance contract held was entered into before or at the same time as the underlying onerous insurance contracts. The loss recovery component is measured by reference to the percentage of claims from underlying onerous insurance contracts expected to be recovered from the reinsurance contracts held.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\n## Non-life contracts\n\nThe Group is required to establish a LIC for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses that arise from the Group's non-life products. These liabilities represent the expected ultimate cost to settle claims occurring prior to, but still outstanding as of, the balance sheet date. The Group establishes its liabilities by product line, type and extent of coverage, and year of occurrence. There are two categories of the LIC: liability for reported losses, and liability for incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses. Additionally, the LIC is held for loss adjustment expenses, which contain the estimated legal and other expenses expected to be incurred to finalize the settlement of the losses.\n\nThe Group's liability for reported losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on estimates of future payments to settle reported claims. The Group bases such estimates on the facts available at the time the liability is established, considering the estimated costs of bringing pending claims to final settlement. The liability takes into account inflation, as well as other factors that can influence the amount required to fulfil the Group's obligations, some of which are subjective and some of which are dependent on future events. In determining the level of the liability, the Group considers historical trends and patterns of loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and types of coverage. In addition, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes may affect the ultimate cost of settlement and, as a result, the Group's estimation of the liability. Between the reporting and final settlement of a claim, circumstances may change which may result in changes to established liability. Items such as changes in law and interpretations of relevant case law, results of litigation or changes in medical costs, as well as costs of vehicle and home repair materials and labor rates can substantially impact ultimate settlement costs. Accordingly, the Group reviews and reevaluates claims and their liabilities on a regular basis. Amounts ultimately paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses can vary significantly from the level of liabilities originally set.\n\nThe Group establishes the liability for IBNR losses to recognize the estimated cost of losses for events which have already occurred, but for which the Group has not yet been notified. This liability is established to recognize the estimated costs required to bring such claims to final settlement. As these losses have not yet been reported, the Group relies upon historical information and statistical models, based on product line, type and extent of coverage, to estimate its IBNR liability. The Group uses reported claim trends, claim severities, exposure growth and other factors in estimating its IBNR liability. The liability is revised as additional information becomes available and as claims are actually reported.\n\nThe time required to learn of and settle claims is an important consideration in establishing the Group's LIC. Short-tail claims, such as those for motor and property damage, are normally reported soon after the incident and are generally settled within months. Long-tail claims, such as bodily injury, pollution, asbestos and product liability, can take years to develop and additional time to settle. For these claims, information concerning the event, such as the required medical treatment for bodily injury claims and the required measures to clean up pollution, may not be readily available. Accordingly, the reserving analysis of long-tail lines of business is generally more difficult and subject to greater uncertainties than for short-tail claims.\n\nSince the Group does not establish a liability for catastrophes in advance of the occurrence of such events, these events may cause volatility in the levels of its LIC subject to the effects of reinsurance recoveries. This volatility may also be contingent upon political and legal developments after the occurrence of the event.\n\nThe Group uses a number of accepted actuarial methods to estimate and evaluate the amount of the LIC. The nature of the claims being reserved for and the geographic location of the claims influence the techniques used by the Group's actuaries. Additionally, the Group's Corporate Center actuaries perform periodic reserve reviews of the Group's businesses throughout the world. Management considers the results of these reviews and adjusts its liabilities, where necessary.\n\nThe process of establishing the amount of the LIC is complex and deals with uncertainty, requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments considering the time value of money and the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arise from non-financial risk. Any changes in estimates or judgments are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which estimates and judgments are changed.\n\nSignificant delays may occur in the notification and settlement of claims, and a substantial measure of experience and judgment is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty as of the balance sheet date. The LIC is determined on the basis of the information available. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Life contracts\n\nThe measurement of life insurance contracts involves a number of assumptions regarding mortality or longevity, lapses, surrenders, expenses, future policyholder participation (or profit sharing), discount rates and investment returns. These assumptions can vary by country, year of policy issuance and product type, and are determined with reference to past experience adjusted for new trends, current market conditions and future expectations. As such, the amounts included in future cash flows may not represent the ultimate amounts paid out to policyholders. For example:\n\n- - The estimated number of deaths determines the value of the benefit payments. The main source of uncertainty arises because of the potential for pandemics and wide-ranging lifestyle changes, such as changes in eating, smoking and exercise habits, which could result in earlier deaths for age groups in which the Group has significant exposure to mortality risk.\n- - For contracts that insure the risk of longevity, such as annuity contracts, an appropriate allowance is made for people living longer. Continuing improvements in medical care and social conditions could result in further improvements in longevity in excess of those allowed for in the estimates used to determine the liability for contracts where the Group is exposed to longevity risk.\n- - Under certain contracts, the Group has offered product guarantees (or options to take up product guarantees), including fixed minimum crediting interest rate or fixed minimum annuity benefits. In determining the value of these options and/or benefits, estimates have been made as to the percentage of policyholders that may exercise them. Changes in investment conditions could result in significantly more policyholders exercising their options and/or benefits than had been assumed.\n- - Estimates are made as to future investment income arising from the assets backing long-term insurance contracts. These estimates are based on current market returns as well as expectations about future economic and financial developments.\n\nAssumptions are determined with reference to current and historical customer data, as well as industry data. Assumptions also reflect expected earnings on the assets supporting the future policyholder benefits. The information used by the Group's qualified actuaries in setting such assumptions includes, but is not limited to, pricing assumptions and available experience studies based on internal and external data. Expert judgment is involved in setting these assumptions, which are subject to a review and governance process that involves significant effort; therefore, it is generally performed on an annual basis.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk is the compensation that the Group requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows of groups of insurance contracts that arises from non-financial risk (insurance risk and other non-financial risk such as lapse risk). The risk adjustment is an explicit adjustment to the estimates of future cash flows to reflect the compensation the Group would require to make it indifferent between fulfilling a liability that has a range of possible outcomes arising from non-financial risk and fulfilling a liability that will generate fixed cash flows with the same expected present value as the insurance contracts.\n\nThe Group estimates the risk adjustment using a confidence level approach, taking into account the Group's internal view of the level of capital required in order to continue operating on a going-concern basis based on the Group's target Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio. The risk adjustment is calibrated as the value at risk (VaR) at the defined target confidence level minus the expected value of the future cash flows using simulations of the distribution of the future cash flows. This distribution is based on the SST framework and model, with a few modifications considering the different purpose of the IFRS 17 risk adjustment.\n\nSeparate target confidence levels apply to the distribution of cash flows of long-duration (predominantly life) and short-duration (predominantly non-life) (re-)insurance contracts. The confidence levels fall within the following ranges: 74 - 79 percent for short-duration and 90 - 95 percent for long-duration (re-)insurance contracts.\n\nIn line with the internal capital model used by the Group, these ranges are defined net of external reinsurance. The risk adjustment for the reinsurance contracts held is determined consistently with the risk adjustment for insurance contracts issued.\n\nThe Group disaggregates the change in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk between the insurance service result and insurance finance income or expense, and the latter between profit or loss and OCI, so that the movement in risk adjustment resulting from changes in discount rates is presented in OCI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe risk adjustment is the measure of the compensation required by the Group for the uncertainty arising from non-financial risks. As such, it is based on subjective considerations that take into account Zurich's internal view of the capital required in order to continue operating on a going-concern basis.\n\nTo support the selection of the confidence levels, a quantitative analysis is performed. This quantitative analysis is aimed at defining ranges of justifiable percentiles for life and non-life businesses separately, determined by calculating, with different sets of assumptions, the financial compensation the Group requires on the SST capital (defined accordingly with the internal capital targets) to cover the non-financial risks over the outstanding run-off period of the insurance liabilities.\n\nAs with any other risk capital model, the SST model is subject to simplification and application of expert judgments. These include, for example, assumptions on the shape of the distributions and on the geographical and risk dependencies, amongst others. The full list of assumptions, simplifications and expert judgments applied in the model are outlined in the documentation regularly provided to FINMA. These are validated regularly by the Group to ensure the overall adequacy of the risk model.\n\nThe Group percentiles selected for life and non-life businesses are expected to fall within these ranges described above. However, an additional uplift factor may be applied locally to the risk adjustment for specific contracts or groups of contracts, where there is a higher level of uncertainty around the compensation required for bearing non-financial risks. For example, an uplift factor may be applied to a specific contract or group of contracts where key long-term best estimate assumptions used to project the fulfillment cashflows have been set based on expert judgment in the absence of credible experience data.\n\nThe key assumptions in the determination of the risk adjustment percentiles are:\n\n- - Assumed cost of capital rate: the long-term mean of the weighted average cost of capital is used;\n- - Level of group diversification: the risk adjustment allows for diversification of non-financial risks among the Group's reporting entities as well as diversification of non-financial risks with financial risks;\n- - Target capitalization under the Group's internal capital model: the Group's target capitalization under SST is used. Under SST, the Group has defined a minimum solvency ratio target requirement only (\u2265 160 percent SST ratio); hence, assumptions are made on the level of capitalization that Zurich would be expected to maintain on a goingconcern basis over and above the minimum target;\n- - Level of segmentation: separate percentiles are defined for life and non-life businesses; and\n- - Higher levels of expert judgment in the absence of credible demographic assumptions used in cashflow projection: an uplift may be applied to the risk adjustment in respect of a portfolio or product where the Group has concerns over the credibility of assumptions used.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe Group applies bottom-up discount rates for most groups of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. Bottom-up discount rates are constructed using risk-free rates, plus an illiquidity premium, where applicable. Risk-free rates are determined by reference to the market interest rates (either swap rates or yields of highly liquid sovereign securities) in the currency of the underlying cash flows for the groups of (re-)insurance contracts. Whenever the expected timing of the cash flows exceeds the liquid part of the yield curve in the respective currency (the last liquid point), the risk-free interest rate is extrapolated to converge toward a long-term rate (the ultimate forward rate) using widely accepted extrapolation techniques (Smith-Wilson algorithm). The illiquidity premium is determined by reference to observable market spreads for illiquid instruments (e.g., corporate debt, etc.) adequately corrected to remove credit risk.\n\n## Derecognition and contract modification\n\nThe Group derecognizes an insurance contract only when the obligation specified in the insurance contract expires or is discharged or canceled, or if the contract is modified in a way that requires derecognition of the original contract and recognition of the new contract with modified terms. The exercise of a right included in the terms of a contract is not a modification.\n\nWhen an insurance contract is extinguished, the entity is no longer at risk and is therefore no longer required to transfer any economic resources to satisfy the insurance contract. Typically, when the Group buys reinsurance, the underlying insurance contract(s) continue to be recognized as the respective obligations are not extinguished.\n\nIf the terms of an insurance contract are modified, for example, by agreement between the parties to the contract or by a change in regulation, the Group derecognizes the original contract and recognizes the modified contract as a new contract, if any of the conditions below are satisfied:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\na) If the modified terms had been included at contract inception:\n\n- - The modified contract would not be an insurance contract; or\n- - The Group would have separated different components from the host insurance contract resulting in a different insurance contract; or\n- - The modified contract would have had a substantially different contract boundary; or\n- - The modified contract would have been included in a different group of contracts.\n\nb) The original contract met the definition of an insurance contract with direct participation features, but the modified contract no longer meets that definition, or vice versa; or\n\n- c) The entity applied the premium allocation approach to the original contract, but the modifications indicate that the contract no longer meets PAA eligibility criteria.\n\nIf a contract modification meets none of the above conditions, the changes in cash flows caused by the modification are treated as changes in estimates of fulfillment cash flows.\n\nA reinsurance contract is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire.\n\n## Treatment of accounting estimates\n\nThe Group prepares interim financial statements semi-annually and applies an accounting policy choice to change the treatment of accounting estimates made in the first semi-annual financial statements when preparing the annual financial statements (i.e., applying a year-to-date approach). This accounting policy choice applies to all (re-)insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held.\n\n## d) Liabilities for investment contracts (without DPF)\n\nInvestment contracts are those contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk and do not include discretionary participation features. The Group predominantly issues investment contracts without fixed terms (refer to unit-linked investment contracts below) and to a lesser extent investment contracts with fixed and guaranteed terms (e.g., fixed interest rate), which are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Unit-linked investment contracts\n\nUnit-linked investment contracts are contracts referencing unit-linked asset portfolios maintained to meet the specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the credit, market and liquidity risks related to the investments. The liabilities are carried at fair value, which is determined by reference to the underlying financial assets. Changes in fair value are recorded in profit or loss. The related assets for unit-linked investment contracts are designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) in order to reduce measurement inconsistencies. The services provided by the Group under such contracts are investment management and policy administration services that are provided over time and are not contingent on meeting specified performance criteria. Fees from such services are recognized ratably over the service period as fee income. Refer to note 10 for further information.\n\n## e) Group investments, investments for unit-linked contracts and other financial assets excluding derivative financial instruments\n\n## Classification, measurement and presentation of financial assets\n\nThe classification and measurement of Group investments is driven by the business model under which these assets are held and by their contractual cash flow characteristics. The combined effect of the business model and contractual terms assessment (also referred to as 'solely payment on principal and interests test' (SPPI test)) determines whether the debt instruments are measured at amortized cost, fair value with changes recognized in other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).\n\nThe Group primarily holds financial assets to fund insurance liabilities. Specifically, financial assets and insurance liabilities are economically linked and jointly managed with the aim of matching the duration of the assets with the expected obligation toward policyholders. In order to ensure that the contractual cash flows from the financial assets are sufficient to settle insurance liabilities as they become due, the Group may undertake significant buying and selling activities on a regular basis to rebalance its asset portfolio and to meet day-to-day cash flow needs as they arise. Consequently, the majority of the financial assets, including government and supra-national bonds, mortgage and other asset backed securities (ABS/MBS), as well as syndicated loans and other corporate debt, are 'held to collect contractual cash flows and for sale' (HtC&S). Furthermore, the Group has identified specific portfolios that are managed with the aim of holding assets only to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the instrument. These financial assets are managed in the business model 'held to collect contractual cash flows' (HtC) and include certain private debt portfolios (for example, commercial real estate, infrastructure and other private debt), mortgage loans and other financial assets (bank deposits, lease and trade receivables), as well as high-quality government bonds held in the Zurich Italy Bank S.p.A.'s proprietary portfolio to cover structural excess liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interest income is determined using the effective interest rate method and included in net investment income. The cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded in OCI are net of the expected loss allowance and income taxes. When financial assets measured at fair value through OCI are derecognized, the cumulative gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to profit or loss as net capital gains/(losses) on investments. Loss allowances for expected credit losses and any subsequent changes are recorded in profit or loss within net capital gains/(losses) on investments.\n\nDebt instruments held under the HtC business model that pass the SPPI test are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Loss allowances for expected credit losses and individual credit impairments are recognized in profit or loss within net capital gains/(losses) on investments, with a corresponding reduction in the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets that fail the SPPI test are always measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Such assets include equities, fund investments, callable bonds with significant prepayment features, hybrid bonds with certain cash flows at the discretion of the issuer and some ABS/MBS that do not fulfill the SPPI criteria for contractually linked instruments. The significance of the prepayment feature is assessed at the date of the initial recognition of the financial asset as well as whenever additional purchases of the same instrument occur within the same portfolio.\n\nIn addition to financial assets that fail the SPPI test, the Group designates investments held for unit-linked insurance and investment contracts as well as some other investment portfolios backing specific portfolios of insurance contracts at FVPL in order to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or recognizing the gains and losses on these assets on a different basis to the liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of such investments are recognized in profit or loss within net capital gains/(losses) on investments in the period in which they arise. Interest income determined using the effective interest rate method and dividend income from financial assets at FVPL are included in net investment income.\n\nThe Group did not make use of the option to present changes in fair value of certain equity instruments that are not held for trading in OCI with no subsequent reclassification of realized gains or losses to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group recognizes regular purchases and sales of financial assets on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nGroup investments are grouped together based on their nature and considering the shared risk characteristics as follows:\n\n- - Equity securities and unconsolidated investment funds include equity instruments held that do not result in control or significant influence by the Group, and fund investments where the Group does not have control over the investment vehicle;\n- - Debt securities include government and supra-national bonds, corporate debt and ABS/MBS;\n- - Mortgage loans include predominantly retail residential mortgages; and\n- - Other loans mainly include private debt investments (such as infrastructure and commercial real estate loans and private placements) typically managed by third-party asset managers and subject to a ratings-based approach for credit risk monitoring, as well as lease receivables and non-unit-linked deposits held as part of Group investments.\n\nGroup investments further include investment property accounted for at FVPL. Rental income from investment property is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in net investment income, net of operating rental expenses. Please see note 5 for further information on Group investments.\n\nCash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, cash collateral received and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTrade receivables are presented as part of other assets.",

When third-party pricing providers are unable to obtain adequate observable information for a particular financial instrument, the fair value is determined either by requesting selective nonbinding broker quotes or by using internal valuation models.\n\nValuations can be subject to significant judgment, especially when the fair value is determined based on at least one significant unobservable input parameter; such items are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See notes 5 and 22 for further information regarding the estimate of fair value.\n\n## Recognition of expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit loss (ECL) is recognized for debt securities measured at amortized cost, debt securities measured at FVOCI, mortgage loans, lease and trade receivables, and reflects the difference between the contractual cash flows of the instrument and the cash flows the Group expects to receive. ECL is recognized on the following basis:\n\n- - 12-months ECL is recognized from the initial recognition of a debt instrument and reflects a portion of lifetime expected credit losses that would result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date (12-months ECL). The Group applies the low credit risk simplification to recognize 12-months ECL for all financial instruments that have an internal or external investment grade credit rating. Instruments for which 12-months ECL is recognized are referred to as stage 1; and\n- - Lifetime ECL is recognized in the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition and reflects lifetime expected credit losses over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL). The Group applies a permitted simplification to recognize lifetime ECL for all trade receivables. Instruments with lifetime ECL are referred to as stage 2. Lifetime ECL is also recognized for credit-impaired financial instruments, referred to as stage 3. Stage 3 includes instruments that are non-performing or for which a default event has occurred. The Group presents the gross carrying amount of such assets net of lifetime ECL.\n\nAt each reporting date, an assessment is conducted to determine whether a SICR has occurred since the initial recognition of a financial asset not covered by the low credit risk practical expedient and/or whether the financial asset has become credit impaired.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nIn the assessment for SICR, the Group considers all relevant reasonable and supportable information, including information about past events and current and future economic conditions, available either on an individual or on a collective basis.\n\nWhen an external or internal rating is available, the Group applies the low credit risk practical expedient by assuming that no increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition for financial assets that have an external or internal rating equivalent to 'investment grade' (i.e., AAA to BBB-) at the reporting date. This approach is applied to government and supra-national bonds, mortgage and other asset backed securities, as well as corporate debt, including commercial real estate, infrastructure and other private debt.\n\nFor all debt instruments rated below investment grade, the Group determines SICR thresholds that vary depending on the credit rating at initial recognition and the residual life of the instruments. The SICR threshold is calibrated such that the lower the probability of default at inception, the higher the relative credit deterioration is required to trigger a SICR. If the credit rating of the instrument at the reporting date is equal to or below the trigger level, the instrument is deemed to have experienced SICR.\n\nIrrespective of the SICR assessment based on default probabilities, credit risk is generally deemed to have significantly increased if the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. SICR is no longer observed if the rating at the reporting date is above the trigger level indicated in the notching table and the rating has improved by at least one notch since the previous reporting date, in which case the instrument transitions back to stage 1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is further complemented by fundamental research and expert opinion and presented to the Credit Valuation Committee (CVC) comprising representatives of Group Investment Management, Group Risk and Group Finance. The CVC takes the final decision on the stage allocation.\n\nThe mortgage loan portfolio is predominantly consisted of residential and small commercial real estate loans. The exposures are grouped into homogenous buckets in terms of geographic location (mainly Switzerland, Germany, Italy) and property type (residential versus commercial). The forward-looking loan to value (LTV) is within the range of 40 - 67 percent for the Swiss portfolio and 10 - 25 percent for the German portfolio. The SCIR is assessed using the number of past due days, the actual affordability on the customer level as well as forward-looking LTV, which is derived from the expected evolution in the property prices.\n\n## Forward-looking scenarios and measurement of expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit losses reflect an unbiased, probability-weighted estimate based on possible default events either over the next 12 months or over the remaining life of a financial instrument. The ECL is calculated using a combination of the following main input parameters: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD).\n\nFor originated residential and small commercial mortgage loan portfolios, the forward-looking parameters are derived from the evolution of the real estate prices by property type, as well as actual affordability of the loan for a customer. The Group records expected credit losses on mortgages; however, the ECL amount may be rather insignificant for mortgages with very low LTV.\n\nFor unrated exposures, for example, trade receivables, the ECL is measured using an expected loss rate provision matrix, based on historical observed default rates (adjusted and regularly updated for forward-looking estimates), depending on the past due status. For this purpose, the exposures are grouped into sub-portfolios that are homogeneous in terms of loss pattern, and specific loss rates are assigned depending on the number of days past due. From the provision matrix, the calculation of the ECL is determined by multiplying the gross carrying amount of the exposure by the given expected loss rate.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFor rated debt securities, the Group determines the forward-looking inputs by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. A scenario-based approach is applied whereby three scenarios (downside scenario, base case and upside scenario) are modelled once a year considering potential development of relevant macroeconomic variables (GDP growth, 10-year interest rates and credit spreads) in the U.S. and Eurozone over a 1-year horizon. If no internal or external credit rating is available (e.g., due to timing constraints), the Group assigns a fallback rating which is used to derive the ECL parameters (i.e., exposures are assigned A- if the issuer is domiciled in a country with investment grade sovereign rating, while B- is assigned to other exposures).\n\nEach of the forward-looking scenarios applied is based on management assumptions about future macroeconomic conditions. Additional judgment is required to assign a weight to each scenario which reflects the probabilities that the respective set of macroeconomic variables will materialize. The economic scenarios are developed by Group Investment Management - Market Strategy and Macroeconomics, which proposes the scenario weightings based on Group forward-looking expectations. The final decision on scenario weighting lies with the CVC where Group functions can challenge the selection and weights of different scenarios. Changes to the scenario weights and macroeconomic assumptions taken could have a significant effect on ECL -see note 23 for further details.\n\n## Exchange or modification of financial assets\n\nThe Group may enter into transactions involving the exchange of financial assets with one or multiple financial assets. Furthermore, the terms of financial assets may be modified subsequent to initial recognition. When the contractual terms of the financial asset(s) received in an exchange transaction or upon modification are significantly different from the original financial asset, the Group derecognizes the original asset. In certain cases, such exchange or modification results from the financial distress of the original debtor, in which case an exchange or modification of financial assets may involve recognition of purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial instruments. POCI financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value with interest income subsequently being accrued based on a creditadjusted effective interest rate. Changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition are recognized in profit or loss within net capital gains/(losses) on investments.",

Furthermore, the SICR assessment is performed by comparing the current risk of default with the risk of default at initial recognition based on the original and unmodified contractual terms.\n\n## Defaulted and credit-impaired financial assets\n\nThe Group considers the financial asset as defaulted when one or a combination of events with detrimental impact on the estimated cash flows of the financial asset have occurred (i.e., an incurred credit loss event). The Group places emphasis on counterparty specific factors, such as significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency on interest or principal payments. In addition, the Group usually considers that default does not occur later than when a financial asset is 90 days past due. Nevertheless, for certain exposures, such as Swiss residential mortgage loans, historical evidence indicates there is no correlation between default and payments being more than 90 days past due, but such correlation can be identified, for example, when payments are more than 180 days past due. Therefore, these latter exposures are considered defaulted when payment is overdue for more than 180 days. If one or more default events have occurred, the Group considers the financial assets as credit impaired and recognizes individual credit impairment directly as a reduction of the gross carrying amount. In the rare case of default on mortgage loans, the Group may enter forbearance measures, including temporary postponement of contractual payments, to enable the recovery of the mortgage loan.\n\nFinancial assets and the related credit impairment allowances are partially or fully written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. The write-offs represent partial or full derecognition events.\n\n## Comparative accounting policies applicable prior to January 1, 2023\n\nPrior to January 1, 2023, Group investments were accounted for at either (a) fair value through OCI; (b) fair value through profit or loss; or (c) amortized cost. The majority of Group investments were accounted for at fair value through OCI (available-for-sale financial assets) and included debt and equity securities as well as fund investments. Such assets were carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in OCI, until the securities were either sold or impaired. Interest income determined using the effective interest rate method and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through OCI was included in net investment income. The cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded in OCI were net of cumulative deferred income taxes, certain related life policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs. When available-for-sale financial assets were sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains or losses were reclassified from OCI to profit or loss as net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments.\n\nGroup investments at fair value through profit or loss included debt and equity securities backing certain life insurance contracts with participation features, and financial assets evaluated on a fair value basis. The designation of these assets at fair value through profit or loss eliminated or significantly reduced a measurement inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or recognizing the gains and losses on these assets on a different basis to the liabilities.\n\nGroup investments at amortized cost included debt securities for which the Group had the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity (held-to-maturity financial assets) as well as mortgage and other loans (loans and receivables). Such investments were carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any charges for impairment. When an impairment was determined to have occurred, the carrying amount of held-tomaturity investments and loans and receivables was reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the movement in the impairment allowance was recognized in profit or loss as an impairment loss.\n\nThe Group assessed at each reporting date whether there was objective evidence that loss events had occurred that negatively affected the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset or a group of financial assets. A financial asset was considered impaired if there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more occurred loss events that had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. The evaluation of whether an available-forsale debt security was impaired required analysis of the credit standing of a particular issuer and involved management judgment. When assessing impairment of available-for-sale debt securities, the Group placed emphasis on issuer specific factors, such as significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency on interest or principal payments. A credit rating downgrade, worsened liquidity or decline in fair value below the weighted-average cost was not by itself considered a loss event, but rather incorporated in the impairment analysis along with other available information.\n\nThe Group determined that there was objective evidence of impairment of an available-for-sale equity security, if at the reporting date:\n\n- - Its fair value was below the weighted-average cost by an amount significantly in excess of the volatility threshold determined quarterly for the respective equity market (such as North America, Asia Pacific, UK, Switzerland and other European countries); or\n- - Its fair value had been below the weighted-average cost for a period of 24 consecutive months or longer.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## f) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used by the Group to economically hedge risks. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value. The changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in profit or loss, except where such derivative financial instruments are designated under a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge relationship.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nIn limited circumstances, derivative financial instruments are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes in:\n\n- - Fair value hedges, which are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability;\n- - Cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss; or\n- - Net investment hedges, which are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nAll hedge relationships are formally documented, including the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedge effectiveness assessment is made, including the analysis or sources of hedge ineffectiveness and description of how the hedge ratio is determined. Differences in critical terms, the effect of credit risk or differences in the time value of money could be sources of ineffectiveness. To a limited extent, ineffectiveness may also arise from the currency basis spread of cross currency swaps, or from the forward elements of forward contracts, if these are not excluded from the hedge designation.\n\nAt inception of a hedge, the hedge relationship is formally assessed to determine whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk. Subsequently, the hedge effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis (or upon a significant change in circumstances) on a forward-looking basis. Any ineffectiveness is recorded in profit or loss.\n\nHedge accounting is not discontinued on a voluntary basis as long as the risk management objective is still being pursued and other qualifying criteria are fulfilled. If the qualifying criteria for the application of hedge accounting are no longer met for the entire hedging instrument (or a part of it), the hedge relationship is discontinued prospectively, in which case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are then subsequently reported independently in accordance with the respective accounting policy.\n\nThe accounting treatment of qualifying hedge relationships is further described in note 6.\n\n## Comparative accounting policies applicable prior to January 1, 2023\n\nThe treatment of derivative financial instruments prior to January 1, 2023 was largely the same as outlined above with the following differences relating to derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting:\n\nAt inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge relationship was formally assessed to determine whether the hedging instruments are expected to be (prospective assessment) and have been (retrospective assessment) highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk. If the qualifying criteria for the application of hedge accounting were no longer met, the hedge relationship was discontinued prospectively, in which case the hedging instrument and the hedged item were subsequently reported independently in accordance with the respective accounting policy.\n\nHedge accounting could be discontinued prospectively on a voluntary basis.\n\n## g) Goodwill and attorney-in-fact contracts (AIF)\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognized at the amount of the consideration transferred in a business combination in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that the amount of goodwill is not recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) based on the level at which management monitors operations and makes decisions related to the continuation or disposal of assets and operations. The Group has defined the CGUs according to regions, separating P&C, Life businesses and other (see note 26). The CGUs which carry the majority of goodwill and AIF contracts are presented in table 3.1. If goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the carrying amount of the operation includes attributable goodwill when determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## AIF contracts\n\nThe AIF contracts reflect the ability of the Group to generate future revenues through Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI) based on the FGI's relationship with the Farmers Exchanges. In determining that these contracts have an indefinite useful life, the Group took into consideration the organizational structure of inter-insurance exchanges, under which subscribers exchange contracts with each other and appoint an attorney-in-fact to provide non-claims services, and the historical AIF relationship between FGI and the Farmers Exchanges. The value of the AIF contracts is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that the carrying amount of AIF contracts is not recoverable.\n\nThe services provided by FGI under such contracts are non-claims services including risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative functions. The multiple performance obligations covered by the consideration received are considered to be a series with the same pattern of transfer; therefore, the performance obligations are not separated. The fee income for the services provided includes Farmers management fees, membership fees and revenues for ancillary services. Farmers management fees are determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges and recognized ratably over the period the services are provided. Membership fees are one-time fees charged at the time of the policy issuance that do not cover a distinct performance obligation. Such fees are recognized as revenue over the expected life of the customer relationship. The revenue for ancillary services includes remuneration for services provided that are not covered by Farmers management fees where FGI acts as a principal. Typically, these services are provided over time, so that the revenue is also recognized over time. The incremental costs incurred in connection with the customer setup activity are recognized as an asset and subsequently amortized using the same pattern as the related revenue. Please see notes 10 and 25 for further information.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFor goodwill impairment testing, the Group estimates the recoverable amount based on the value-in-use of the CGU.\n\nValue-in-use is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the CGU. Cash flow projections are based on business plan projections, which are approved by management, typically covering a three-year period or, if appropriate and adequately justified, a longer period, which may be necessary to more accurately represent the nature of the cash flows used to test goodwill recoverability. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using, among others, estimated perpetual growth rates, which typically do not exceed the expected inflation of the geographical areas in which the cash flows supporting the goodwill are generated. If cash flows are generated in different geographical areas with different expected inflation rates, weighted averages are used. The discount rates applied reflect the respective risk-free interest rate adjusted for the relevant risk factors to the extent they have not already been considered in the underlying cash flows.\n\nThe discount rates used in the recoverable amount calculations for developed markets are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). For the cost of capital, the Group considers government bond rates, which are further adjusted for market risk premium, appropriate beta and leverage ratio. In emerging markets, instead of government bond rates, the Group uses a U.S. dollar discount rate, taking into account inflation differential expectations and country risks. All input factors to the discount rates are based on observable market data.\n\nTable 3.1 sets out for the major CGUs the applied discount rates and the perpetual nominal growth rates beyond the projection period that depend on expectations about country-specific growth rates and inflation as of the date of valuation, as well as the value of goodwill and AIF contracts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\nTable 3.1\n\n|                              | Business   | in USD   millions   |   Discount  rates in % 2023 | Discount  rates in % 2022   |   Perpetual  nominal  growth   rate in % 2023 | Perpetual  nominal  growth   rate in % 2022   |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Farmers                      | Farmers    | 3,914               |                         9.7 | 9.4                         |                                           2.1 | 2.0                                           |\n| North America                | P&C        | 350                 |                         9.4 | 9.3                         |                                           2.1 | 2.0                                           |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa | P&C        | 456                 |                         9.4 | 8.9                         |                                           2   | 2.0                                           |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa | Life       | 218                 |                         8.4 | -                           |                                           1.6 | -                                             |\n| Asia Pacific                 | P&C        | 785                 |                         9.2 | 9.8                         |                                           2.2 | 2.1                                           |\n| Asia Pacific                 | Life       | 1,122               |                         9   | 10.0                        |                                           1.9 | 2.1                                           |\n| Latin America                | P&C        | 264                 |                        29.3 | 21.1                        |                                          11.3 | 8.0                                           |\n| Latin America                | Life       | 72                  |                        21.1 | 17.0                        |                                           6.2 | 5.6                                           |\n\nDiscount and perpetual growth rates for goodwill and AIF contracts for major CGUs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the estimated future cash flows and other assumptions deviate significantly from the Group's current outlook, there is a risk that the goodwill is impaired.\n\nQuantitative sensitivity tests have been performed for all CGUs, by applying a reasonably possible change to each of the key assumptions to capture potential future variations in market conditions: a decrease in cash flows of up to 20 percent, an increase in the discount rate of 2.0 percentage points and a decrease in the perpetual growth rate of 2.0 percentage points. Under each individual scenario, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not impair goodwill and AIF contracts.\n\n## h) Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets typically have finite lives and are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairments. Such assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## Distribution agreements\n\nDistribution agreements may have useful lives extending up to 30 years, estimated based on the period of time over which they are expected to provide economic benefits, but for no longer than the contractual term, after taking into account all economic and legal factors such as stability of the industry, competitive position and the period of control over the assets.\n\nQualitative analyses have been performed on distribution agreements, typically comprising an analysis of the current financial performance and any change in the conditions in the agreement and environment that would indicate an impairment. Please see notes 5, 12, 13 and 14 for further information on impairment of assets.\n\n## Software\n\nCosts associated with research and maintenance of internally developed software are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalized. Software under development is tested for impairment annually.\n\nAcquired software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software into use.\n\nThe useful lives of software licenses and capitalized internal software development costs generally range from three to five years. In limited circumstances, capitalized software development costs may be amortized over a period of up to 10 years, taking into account the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic and legal factors. Changes in the expected useful life are recognized prospectively as changes in accounting estimates.\n\n## i) Employee benefits\n\n## Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group operates long-term incentive plans that are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of these incentive plans is determined at the grant date, taking into consideration non-vesting and market conditions, and is recognized as an expense in profit or loss over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase recorded in additional paid-in capital. Under the Group's long-term incentive plan (LTIP), the market condition, which is the position of the Group's relative 'Total Shareholder Return' (TSR) measured against an international peer group of insurance companies, is included in the performance metrics.\n\nSubsequently, the Group may revise its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be issued based on the expected fulfillment of the service and non-market conditions. Under the Group's LTIP, the non-market conditions, such as the average business operating profit after tax attributable to shareholders return on common shareholders' equity ('BOPAT ROE'), and the cumulative net cash remittances, as well as an operational CO2e emissions reduction target which is newly included in the performance metrics, are aligned with the Group's financial and non-financial targets. The impact of the revision, if any, is recognized in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital. However, no subsequent adjustment is made after the vesting date.\n\nPlease see note 20 for further information regarding share-based compensation and cash incentive plans.",

If the fair value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the recognition of the resulting net asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe Group's expense related to these plans is accrued over the employees' service periods based on the actuarially determined cost for the period. Net interest is determined by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Actuarial gains and losses and the effect of the asset ceiling are recognized in full in OCI in the period in which they occur. Past service costs, which result from plan amendments and curtailments, are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs (which is the date from which the plan change is irrevocable) and the date on which a constructive obligation arises. Settlement gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss when the settlement occurs.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nOther post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance, are also provided for certain employees and are primarily funded internally. Similar to defined benefit plans, the cost of such benefits is accrued over the service period of the employees based on the actuarially determined cost for the period.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nIn assessing the Group's liability for defined benefit plans and other post-employment plans, critical judgments include estimates of mortality rates, rates of employment turnover, disability, early retirement, discount rates, future salary and pension increases, and increases in long-term healthcare costs. Discount rates for significant plans are based on a yield curve approach. The Group sets the discount rate by creating a hypothetical portfolio of highquality corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated pay-outs of the defined benefit plan. These assumptions may differ from actual results due to changing economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in variability of pension income or expense recorded in future years. Please see note 19 for further information on employee benefits.\n\n## j) Leases\n\nThe Group is typically acting as a lessee in property, car or equipment leases. Furthermore, the Group is acting as a lessor in leases of investment property.\n\nWhen acting as a lessee, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date when the leased asset is available for use by the Group. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Any options to extend or terminate a lease that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise are included in the lease term. The right-of-use asset is initially recognized at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments made or lease incentives received, initial direct costs and any estimated costs to dismantle or restore the leased asset.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the leased asset's useful life or the lease term on a straightline basis. The right-of-use asset is included in property and equipment and disclosed separately in note 12. The carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect the unwinding of the discount so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period and is reduced by the lease payments made during the period. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on a nonleveraged index or a rate. Lease liabilities are included within other liabilities.\n\nThe Group records short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are consisted of hardware and smaller office equipment. The lease expense is included in other expenses.\n\nWhen acting as a lessor of investment property in an operating lease, the Group follows the accounting policy in paragraph e).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## k) Current and deferred taxes\n\nCurrent income taxes payables (receivables) are measured at the amount expected to be paid (recovered) in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that are enacted or substantively enacted as of the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable income, including income from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies, is available for realization. The utilization of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases depends on the generation of sufficient taxable profits in the period in which the underlying asset or liability is recovered or settled. If applicable tax law acknowledges different types of expenses to be tax deductible, deferred tax assets are only recognized if they give rise to deductions against the same type of taxable income. The utilization of deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or tax credits depends on the generation of sufficient taxable profits before the unused tax losses or tax credits expire.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences unless they arise:\n\n- - From the initial recognition of goodwill; or\n- - An asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences; or\n- - Are associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nAs of each balance sheet date, management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and, if it is considered probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be utilized, then a valuation allowance is recognized. Please see note 16 for further information on deferred taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Interest expense is charged to profit or loss using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement. Securities lending was nil in 2023 and not material in 2022.\n\nUnder a reverse repurchase agreement, the securities received are not recognized on the balance sheet, as long as the risk and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the Group. The cash delivered by the Group is derecognized and a corresponding receivable is recorded within receivables and other assets. Interest income is recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement.\n\n## Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments mainly for economic hedging purposes to mitigate risks. Such risks result from changes in interest rates, equity prices and exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are reported in receivables and other assets (please see note 14) and those with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities (please see note 15).\n\nTable 6.1 shows the fair value and notional amounts for all group derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 separated by risks. While these notional amounts express the extent of the Group's involvement in derivative transactions, they do not, however, represent the amounts at risk.\n\nTable 6.1\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31            |                             |                             |                             |          | 2023        | 2023        | 2023     | 2022        | 2022        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                               | Maturity by notional amount | Maturity by notional amount | Maturity by notional amount |          |             |             |          |             |             |\n|                                               |                             | 1 to 5                      |                             | Notional | Positive    | Negative    | Notional | Positive    | Negative    |\n|                                               | < 1 year                    | years                       | > 5 years                   | amounts  | fair values | fair values | amounts  | fair values | fair values |\n| Interest rate contracts  1                    | 2,106                       | 8,358                       | 2,938                       | 13,402   | 540         | (756)       | 13,436   | 508         | (956)       |\n| Equity contracts                              | 828                         | 635                         | 722                         | 2,185    | 55          | (21)        | 1,911    | 55          | (16)        |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                    | 20,651                      | 473                         | 115                         | 21,239   | 352         | (475)       | 20,732   | 222         | (193)       |\n| Total Group derivative  financial instruments | 23,584                      | 9,466                       | 3,775                       | 36,825   | 947         | (1,252)     | 36,078   | 786         | (1,165)     |\n| Thereof exchange traded                       | 491                         | 884                         | 221                         | 1,597    | 1           | (497)       | 2,160    | 9           | (701)       |\n| Thereof OTC   (over the counter)              | 23,093                      | 8,582                       | 3,554                       | 35,229   | 945         | (755)       | 33,918   | 776         | (464)       |\n\n- 1   Include USD 1.7 billion and USD 1.2 billion notional related to derivatives which are centrally cleared as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Please note that derivatives centrally cleared that are not designated under qualifying hedge accounting relationship, are presented net of corresponding variation margin payments under 'Amounts due from investment brokers' (see note 14) and 'Amounts due to investment brokers' (see note 15) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Interest rate contracts\n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates and to manage asset liability mismatches. Whenever possible, the Group enters into exchange-traded and centrally cleared contracts, which are standardized and regulated. Furthermore, because of the structure of the exchanges and central clearing houses, exchange-traded and centrally cleared contracts are not considered to carry material counterparty risk. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are otherwise entered into and consist of swaps and swaptions.\n\n## Equity contracts\n\nEquity contracts are entered into, either on a portfolio or on a macro level, to protect the fair value of equity investments against a decline in equity market prices or to manage the risk return profile of equity exposures. Short positions are always covered and sometimes used to mitigate hedging costs.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nSwaps and forward contracts are used to hedge the Group's foreign currency exposures and to manage balance sheet mismatches.\n\n## Credit contracts\n\nThe Group may from time to time enter into credit contracts. Credit contracts are credit default swaps entered into, either on a portfolio or on a macro level, to limit market risks arising from the investment portfolios against a change in credit spreads or to manage the risk return profile of the credit exposures. As of December 31, 2023, the Group does not hold credit default swaps.\n\n## Other contracts\n\nOther contracts predominantly include stable value products (SVPs) issued to insurance company separate accounts in connection with certain life insurance policies (Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) and Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI)) with an account value of USD 9.8 billion and USD 11.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and with a market value of the underlying investments of USD 9.0 billion and USD 9.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (not included in the table above). The Group includes the likelihood of surrender as one of the input parameters to determine the fair value of the SVPs, which was nil as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn certain circumstances, derivative financial instruments meet the requirements of an effective hedge for accounting purposes. Where this is the case, hedge accounting may be applied. Financial information for these instruments is set out in table 6.2.\n\n## Maturity analysis of notional amounts and fair values of Group derivative financial instruments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The hedging instrument is measured at fair value, with the effective portion of changes in its fair value recognized in OCI. The effective portion, related to spot rate changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods in which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nThe net change of gains/(losses) deferred in OCI on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges was USD 5 million and USD (38) million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Group recognized hedging gains/(losses) for interest rate risk of USD 1 million and USD (3) million in the consolidated income statements within net investment income on Group investments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Group also recognized net hedging gains for currency risk of USD 12 million and USD 9 million within other net capital gains/(losses) on Group investments for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively, as an offset to the foreign currency revaluation on the underlying hedged items.\n\nA nil amount for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was recognized in net capital gains/(losses) and impairments due to hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Group applies net investment hedge accounting to protect against the effects of changes in exchange rates in its net investments in foreign operations.\n\nMeasurement of hedge effectiveness is based on changes in forward rates. Gains and losses on the designated hedging derivative and non-derivative financial instruments related to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in OCI together with the translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment. The accumulated gains and losses in OCI are reclassified to income on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nThe net change of gains/(losses) deferred in OCI were USD 132 million and USD (41) million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as a result of a hedge relationship by foreign exchange forwards and swaps.\n\nThe Group has also designated certain debt issuances as hedging instruments on a non-derivative net investment hedge relationship. The notional amount of these financial instruments was USD 10 billion and USD 12 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The net gains/(losses) deferred in OCI were USD 783 million and USD 187 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

These arrangements commonly create a right of offset that becomes enforceable and affects the realization or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified event of default or other circumstances which would not be expected to arise in the normal course of business.\n\nTable 6.4\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31                     | Derivative assets   | Derivative assets   | Derivative liabilities   | Derivative liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                        | 2023                | 2022                | 2023                     | 2022                     |\n| Netting recognized on the balance sheet                |                     |                     |                          |                          |\n| Gross amounts of financial assets and liabilities  1   | 949                 | 786                 | (1,257)                  | (1,165)                  |\n| Cash collateral (received)/pledged that are set off  2 | -                   | (3)                 | 3                        | -                        |\n| Net amount recognized presented in the balance         | 949                 | 783                 | (1,254)                  | (1,165)                  |\n| Netting potential not recognized on the balance sheet  |                     |                     |                          |                          |\n| Related amounts not offset                             | (151)               | (131)               | 164                      | 106                      |\n| Cash collateral (received)/pledged  2                  | (729)               | (612)               | 496                      | 337                      |\n| Non-cash collateral (received)/pledged                 | (2)                 | (7)                 | 543                      | 709                      |\n| Net amount  3                                          | 67                  | 32                  | (51)                     | (13)                     |\n\nGroup derivative financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements\n\n- 1   Includes USD 3.4 million and USD 49.4 million of derivative assets and USD 4.7 million and USD 0 million of derivative liabilities centrally cleared before netting against variation margin as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n- 2   Includes USD 0 million and USD 48.9 million of cash collateral for derivative assets centrally cleared through central counterparty (CCP) as well as USD 2.9 million and USD 0 million derivative liabilities centrally cleared as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n- 3   Includes USD 1.6 million and USD 0.4 million of total potential exposure to centrally cleared derivatives as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is offset by net favorable prior year reserve development amounting to USD 654 million, mainly related to the release of risk adjustment and underlying favorable run-off.\n\nFor insurance contracts accounted for under BBA, the decrease of USD 1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 is driven primarily by the recognition of the sale of the annuity book by Inversiones Suizo-Chilena S.A. of USD 2.6 billion partially offset by currency movements of USD 0.6 billion and the insurance finance expense of USD 1.3 billion.\n\nFor insurance contracts accounted for under VFA, the increase of USD 10.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 is mainly due to changes in financial market conditions driven by a positive performance on assets of USD 11.7 billion as well as currency movements of USD 5.1 billion, partially offset by net cash outflows of USD 5.3 billion.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts accounted for under BBA, the increase of USD 1.0 billion for the year ended December 31,2023 primarily relates to the reinsurance of the in-force individual life book of Farmers New World Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Farmers Group, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

shows the estimated undiscounted amount of future payments for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in that year and in prior years and the corresponding effects of discounting and risk adjustment for non-financial risk, which correspond to the liabilities for incurred claims (LIC), net of reinsurance, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe cumulative claims paid, net of reinsurance section of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid in each subsequent year in respect of the LIC established at each year end. The undiscounted liabilities for incurred claims re-estimated, net of reinsurance, show the re-estimation of the initially recorded liabilities as of each subsequent year end. The amounts are presented gross of non-distinct investment component. The figures disclosed in this table for information published from 2021 and prior are as published previously and have not been restated for changes resulting from the application of IFRS 17. The effects from the application of IFRS 17 did not have a material effect and were primarily attributable to scope changes (e.g., incurred claims and expenses from short-term life insurance contracts were previously not included).\n\nChanges to incurred claims estimates are made as more information becomes known about the actual insurance losses for which the initial LIC were established. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of insurance losses in the past may or may not necessarily occur in the future, and accordingly, conclusions about future results cannot be derived from the information presented in this table.\n\n## Development of insurance losses, measured under the PAA, net\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The expected pattern for the CSM recognition for reinsurance contracts held is consistent with insurance contracts under the BBA. Due to significantly longer coverage period of insurance contracts measured under the VFA, the expected CSM release pattern is much slower, with a significant proportion of CSM to be recognized in P&L in more than 10 years.\n\nOn transition to IFRS 17, the Group applied transition modifications as described in note 2, including those affecting the amount of OCI recognized for groups of (re-)insurance contracts under the modified retrospective or fair value approaches. Table 7.14 below provides a reconciliation of the cumulative amounts included in OCI for financial assets measured at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) related to these groups of (re-)insurance contracts as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Effect of insurance and reinsurance contracts initially recognized, measured under the BBA and VFA - current period\n\n## Effect of insurance and reinsurance contracts initially recognized, measured under the BBA and VFA - prior period\n\n## Expected recognition of the CSM in the P&L",

The Group manages risks arising from such contracts using the internal model approved by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA for use under the Swiss Solvency Test (SST). SST represents a comprehensive framework that takes into account the interdependencies between risks. Within the internal model, premium and reserve risk, as well as natural catastrophe risk, cover insurance risks arising from short-term contracts, whereas business risk and life insurance risk cover insurance risks arising from long-term contracts, including contracts with policyholder participation accounted for as direct participating contracts. Market risks arise from assets backing insurance contracts, and also covers risks arising from the asset/liability mismatches and credit risk of investments. From a risk perspective, long-term life contracts include investment contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk and are accounted for as investment contracts.\n\nThe approaches implemented by the Group to manage these risks and risk concentrations are further described in the 2023 Risk Review which forms an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, the 2023 Risk Review provides a comprehensive overview of the exposures per risk type as well as the Group approach to mitigate insurance risk concentrations by entering into reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe tables below provide sensitivities to changes in key risk variables arising from (re-)insurance contracts issued after the risk mitigation by reinsurance contracts held, as this is the basis on which exposures are presented to the key management personnel.\n\n## Insurance risk sensitivity\n\nTables 7.19a and 7.19b show the sensitivity of net income before tax and net assets as a result of adverse development in the net loss ratio by one percentage point using the Group effective income tax rate. The sensitivities do not indicate the probability of such an event and do not consider any non-linear effects of reinsurance. Based on the assumptions applied in the sensitivity analysis in tables 7.19a and 7.19b, each additional percentage point increase in the loss ratio would have a linear impact on net income before tax and net assets. The Group also monitors insurance risk by evaluating extreme scenarios, taking into account the non-linear effects of reinsurance contracts.\n\n| in USD millions, for the year ended December 31, 2023   | Europe,  Middle East  & Africa   | North  America   | Asia Pacific   | Latin  America   | Reinsurance   | Total  2   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|------------|\n| +1% in net loss ratio  1                                |                                  |                  |                |                  |               |            |\n| Net income before tax                                   | (172)                            | (206)            | (34)           | (28)             | (8)           | (423)      |\n| Net assets                                              | (129)                            | (155)            | (26)           | (21)             | (6)           | (317)      |\n\n- 1   A 1 percent change in net loss ratio is defined as a 1 percent change in insurance revenue.\n- 2   Includes the impact of eliminations upon consolidation.\n\n## Expected derecognition of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows\n\n## Insurance risk sensitivity for the Property & Casualty business - current period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Though these events have a small probability of occurring, they could, if realized, negatively affect the net income before tax and net assets. The impacts of insurance-specific scenarios would have been a decrease of net income before tax and net assets of USD 1.8 billion, USD 1.2 billion and USD 0.7 billion, respectively. Note that the scenario impacts are comparable to the modelled 250-year net occurrence loss for the respective peril (equivalent to a 99.6 percent probability of non-exceedance).\n\n## Market risk sensitivity\n\nThe Group manages the market risk of assets relative to liabilities on an economic total balance sheet basis. This is done to achieve the maximum risk-adjusted excess return on assets relative to the liability benchmark, while also taking into account the Group's risk tolerance and local regulatory constraints. Therefore, economic risk sensitivities are evaluated by the Group based on their effects on available financial resources (AFR) or available capital in SST, taking into account interdependencies between the effects of the shocks on financial assets held by the Group and insurance contracts net of reinsurance contracts held. The sensitivities as a result of predefined interest rate yield curve, stock market and credit spread shocks are presented in tables 7.20 to 7.22.\n\n## Table 7.20\n\n| in USD millions, as of October 1                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 50 bps increase in the interest rate yield curves |        |        |\n| Property & Casualty                               | (88)   | (115)  |\n| Life                                              | 260    | 151    |\n| Rest of the business                              | 61     | (8)    |\n| 50 bps decrease in the interest rate yield curves |        |        |\n| Property & Casualty                               | 109    | 92     |\n| Life                                              | (410)  | (323)  |\n| Rest of the business                              | (62)   | (31)   |\n\n## Table 7.21\n\n| in USD millions, as of October 1   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| 20% decline in stock markets       |         |         |\n| Property & Casualty                | (1,183) | (1,132) |\n| Life                               | (1,168) | (878)   |\n| Rest of the business               | (81)    | (171)   |\n\n| in USD millions, as of October 1   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| 100 bps increase in credit spreads |         |         |\n| Property & Casualty                | (1,404) | (1,449) |\n| Life                               | (1,449) | (1,739) |\n| Rest of the business               | (169)   | (395)   |\n\n## Insurance risk sensitivity for the Property & Casualty business - prior period\n\n## Economic interest rate sensitivities on SST AFR\n\n## Economic equity price sensitivities on SST AFR\n\n## Economic credit spread sensitivities on SST AFR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The undiscounted contractual cash flows for investment contract liabilities are USD 60 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 51 billion as of December 31, 2022. Liabilities for unit-linked investment contracts amounted to USD 60 billion and USD 50 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the leased asset's useful life or the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Table 12.1\n\nTable 12.2a\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   | Real Estate   | Real Estate   |   Equipment |   Equipment | Equipment   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|\n|                                      | 2023          | 2022          |        2023 |        2022 | 2023        | 2022    |\n| Right-of-use                         | 1,184         | 1,303         |          56 |          47 | 1,241       | 1,349   |\n| Owned and subject to operating lease | 423           | 436           |         428 |         439 | 851         | 876     |\n| Total                                | 1,608         | 1,739         |         484 |         486 | 2,092       | 2,225   |\n\n| in USD millions                                | Real Estate   | Real Estate    | Real Estate   | Equipment   | Equipment      | Equipment   | Total                          | Total         | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------|---------|\n|                                                | Owned         | Right-  of-use | Total         | Owned       | Right-  of-use | Total       | Owned  incl.  operating  lease | Right-of- use | Total   |\n| Gross carrying value as of  January 1, 2023  1 | 529           | 2,496          | 3,025         | 1,323       | 98             | 1,421       | 1,853                          | 2,594         | 4,447   |\n| Less: accumulated  depreciation/impairments    | (93)          | (1,193)        | (1,286)       | (883)       | (51)           | (935)       | (977)                          | (1,244)       | (2,221) |\n| Net carrying value as of  January 1, 2023      | 436           | 1,303          | 1,740         | 440         | 47             | 487         | 876                            | 1,350         | 2,226   |\n| Additions and improvements                     | 6             | 41             | 47            | 97          | 33             | 130         | 103                            | 74            | 177     |\n| Lease modifications                            | -             | 75             | 75            | -           | (1)            | (1)         | -                              | 74            | 74      |\n| Depreciation and  impairments                  | (48)          | (231)          | (279)         | (118)       | (17)           | (135)       | (167)                          | (248)         | (415)   |\n| Acquisitions/(divestments)  and transfers      | (7)           | (31)           | (38)          | (2)         | (8)            | (10)        | (9)                            | (38)          | (47)    |\n| Foreign currency translation  effects          | 36            | 27             | 63            | 12          | 2              | 13          | 48                             | 29            | 77      |\n| Net carrying value as of   December 31, 2023   | 423           | 1,184          | 1,608         | 428         | 56             | 484         | 851                            | 1,241         | 2,092   |\n| Plus: accumulated  depreciation/impairments    | 109           | 1,291          | 1,400         | 940         | 33             | 972         | 1,049                          | 1,324         | 2,373   |\n| Gross carrying value as of   December 31, 2023 | 532           | 2,476          | 3,008         | 1,368       | 89             | 1,457       | 1,900                          | 2,564         | 4,465   |\n\n- 1   January 1, 2023 balances are impacted by hyperinflation, please see note 1 for details.\n\n## Property and equipment overview\n\n## Property and equipment current period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, the income tax expense or benefit attributable to these life insurance policyholder earnings is included in income tax expense. In certain jurisdictions, an accrual for future policy fees that will cover the tax charge is included in insurance benefits and losses.\n\nTaxes paid by certain of the Group's life insurance businesses are based on the investment result, and it is normal practice for certain of the Group's businesses to recover from policyholders the taxes attributable to their share of the investment result. While the relevant insurance businesses have the contractual right to charge policyholders for the taxes attributable to their share of the investment result, the obligation to pay the tax authority rests with the company and therefore the full amount of tax, including the portion attributable to policyholders, is accounted for as income tax. Income tax expense, therefore, includes an element attributable to policyholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the case of a capital increase, the Board would determine the number of shares, the date of issue of any such new shares, the issue price, type of contributions (including cash contributions, contributions in kind, set-off and conversion of freely usable reserves, including retained earnings, into share capital), the conditions of exercising subscription rights and the beginning of the dividend entitlement.\n\nThe Board may issue such new shares by means of a firm underwriting by a financial institution, a syndicate of financial institutions or another third party and with a subsequent offer of those shares to the current shareholders. The Board is authorized to restrict or to prohibit trading in the subscription rights to the new shares and may allow the expiration of subscription rights which have not been exercised, or it may place these rights as well as shares, the subscription rights of which have not been exercised, at market conditions, or use them otherwise in the interest of ZIG.\n\nThe Board is further authorized to restrict or exclude the subscription rights and to allocate them to individual shareholders, third parties, ZIG or one of its group companies for one or more increases, up to a maximum of 14,600,000 shares, if the shares are to be used:\n\n- - for the take-over of an enterprise, or parts of an enterprise or of participations or for investments by ZIG or one of its group companies, or for the financing including refinancing of such transactions;\n- - for the purpose of expanding the scope of shareholders in connection with the listing of shares on foreign stock exchanges or issuance of shares on the national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors);\n- - for the conversion of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'Financial Instruments') issued by ZIG or one of its group companies; or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or rating capital position of ZIG or one of its group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nIn case of a capital reduction, the Board shall, to the extent necessary, determine the number of shares to be canceled and the use of the reduction amount. The acquisition and holding of shares repurchased for purposes of cancellation under the capital band are not subject to the 10 percent threshold for treasury shares within the meaning of art. 659 para. 2 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.\n\n## Share capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the case of an increase or reduction of the nominal value, the Board shall determine the new nominal value of the shares and shall adapt all provisions of the Articles of Association relating to the nominal value of a share as well as the number of shares with a new nominal value corresponding to the fixed upper and lower limit of the capital band pursuant to art. 5 bis para. 1, accordingly.\n\nUp to April 6, 2028, the total of new shares issued from (i) the capital band where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) the contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,600,000 new shares.\n\n## b) Contingent share capital\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\nSince the replacement of the authorized share capital with the capital band (see a) above) on April 6, 2023, the validity of the combined dilution limitations for the capital band and the contingent share capital pursuant to art. 5 ter para. 1 of the Articles of Association is April 6, 2028, and the total of new shares issued from the capital band where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and the contingent share capital pursuant to art. 5 ter para. 1 of the Articles of Association where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,600,000 new shares. No other changes were resolved with respect to the contingent share capital.\n\nThe share capital of ZIG may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 2,992,160 by issuing of up to 29,921,600 fully paid-in registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each by the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion and/or option rights which are granted in connection with the issuance of Financial Instruments by ZIG or one of its group companies or by mandatory conversion of Financial Instruments issued by ZIG or one of its group companies, that allow for contingent mandatory conversion into shares of ZIG, or by exercising option rights which are granted to the shareholders. The subscription rights are excluded. The then-current owners of the Financial Instruments shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares. The conversion and/or option conditions are to be determined by the Board.\n\nThe Board is authorized, when issuing Financial Instruments, to restrict or exclude the advance subscription rights in cases where they are issued:\n\n- - for the financing including refinancing of a take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise, or of participations or of investments by ZIG or one of its group companies;\n- - on national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or rating capital position of ZIG or one of its group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nIf the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded by a resolution of the Board, the following applies: the Financial Instruments are to be issued at prevailing market conditions (including standard dilution protection clauses in accordance with market practice) and the setting of the conversion or issue price of the new shares must take due account of the stock market price of the shares and/or comparable instruments priced by the market at the time of issue or time of conversion.\n\nThe conversion rights may be exercisable during a maximum of ten years and option rights during a maximum of seven years from the time of the respective issue; contingent conversion features may remain in place indefinitely.\n\nUp to April 6, 2028, the total of new shares issued from (i) the capital band where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) the contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,600,000 new shares.\n\n## Employee participation\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, no shares were issued to Group employees out of the contingent share capital. As of December 31, 2023, and as of December 31, 2022, the remaining contingent share capital available for issuance to Group employees amounted to CHF 409,509.20 and 4,095,092 fully paid-in registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, respectively. Subscription rights, as well as advance subscription rights of the shareholders, are excluded. The issuance of new shares or respective option rights to employees is subject to one or more regulations to be issued by the Board and takes into account performance, functions, levels of responsibility and criteria of profitability. New shares or option rights may be issued to employees at a price lower than that quoted on the stock exchange.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## 19. Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of retirement benefit arrangements for employees. Historically, the majority of employees belonged to defined benefit pension plans and some will still have past service benefits accrued in those plans.\n\nHowever, the majority of employees now accrue benefits under defined contribution plans, which provide benefits equal to the amounts contributed by both the employer and the employee plus investment returns.\n\nCertain of the Group's operating companies also provide post-employment benefit plans covering medical care and life insurance, mainly in the U.S. Eligibility for these plans is generally based on completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. The plans typically pay a stated percentage of medical expenses subject to deductibles and other factors. The cost of post-employment benefits is accrued during the employees' service periods.\n\nThe Group Pensions Committee is responsible for developing, reviewing and advising on the Group governance framework in matters related to pension and post-employment benefit arrangements. It provides oversight and guidance in the areas of market, demographic and reputational risk. It reports to and makes recommendations to the Group Balance Sheet Committee on material pension-related matters and reports regularly to the Remuneration Committee. The Group Pensions Committee provides a point of focus and coordination on the topic of pensions and post-retirement benefits at Group level for the supervision and exercise of company powers and obligations in relation to pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\n\nFunding and asset allocation is subject to local legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## a) Defined contribution pension plans\n\nCertain companies of the Group sponsor defined contribution pension plans. Eligibility for participation in such plans is either immediate on commencement of employment or based on completion of a specified period of continuous service. The plans provide for voluntary contributions by employees and contributions by the employer which typically range from 2 percent to 13 percent of annual pensionable salary, depending on a number of factors. The Group's contributions under these plans amounted to USD 297 million and USD 301 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## b) Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe largest defined benefit obligations are in the pension plans in Switzerland, the UK, the U.S. and Germany, which together comprise over 90 percent of the Group's total defined benefit obligation. The remaining plans in other countries are not individually significant, therefore; no separate disclosure is provided.\n\nCertain Group companies provide defined benefit pension plans, some of which provide benefits on retirement, death or disability related to employees' service periods and pensionable earnings. Others provide cash balance plans where the participants receive the benefit of the accumulated employer and employee contributions (where paid) together with additional cash credits in line with the rules of the plan.\n\nMost of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are funded through contributions by the Group and, in some cases also by employees, to investment vehicles managed by trusts or foundations independent of the Group's finances, or by management committees with fiduciary responsibilities. Where a trust or foundation exists, it is required by law or by articles of association to act in the interests of the fund and of all relevant beneficiaries to the plan, which can also include the sponsoring company, and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The trust/foundation board or committee is usually composed of representatives from both employers and plan members. Independent actuarial valuations for the plans are performed as required. It is the Group's general principle that plans are appropriately funded in accordance with local pension regulations in each country.\n\nThe pension plans typically expose the company to risks such as interest rate, price inflation, longevity and salary increases. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risk but introduce some investment risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The actual asset allocation is determined by reference to current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. The Group has a governance framework to ensure the trust/foundation board or committee considers how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the potential impact on the funding status of the plans, including short-term liquidity requirements. The investment strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the governance body in each country, with oversight by the Group Pensions Committee. The pension assets are invested in diversified portfolios across geographical regions and asset classes to ensure diversified returns, also taking into account local pension laws. The investment strategies aim to mitigate asset-liability mismatches in the long run. In recent years, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors has become a significant element of Zurich's pension plans' investment decision making. Pension plans will continue progressing on their responsible investment journey, leveraging Zurich's expertise and leadership while being cognizant of their fiduciary responsibility.\n\nFor post-employment defined benefit plans, total contributions to funded plans and benefits paid directly by the Group were USD 302 million for 2023 compared with USD 289 million for 2022. The estimated total for 2024 is USD 327 million (actual amount may differ).\n\n## Swiss pension plan\n\nThe main plan provides benefits that exceed the minimum benefit requirements under Swiss pension law. It provides a lifetime pension to members based on their accrued retirement savings in the basic and additional accounts multiplied by the applicable conversion rate at the normal retirement age of 65 (age 62 for Executive Staff). Participants can draw retirement benefits early from age 60 (age 58 for Executive Staff). Alternatively, the benefit can be taken as a lump sum payment at retirement. In addition, at retirement, the plan pays a one-off cash sum settlement equal to the accrued retirement savings in the capital account. Contributions to the plan are paid by the employees and the employer, both for retirement savings and to finance risk benefits paid out in the event of death and disability. The accumulated balance on the pension account is based on the employee and employer pension contributions and interest accrued. The interest rate credited is defined annually by the plan's Board of Trustees, which is responsible for the governance of the plan. The trustees review the Pension Plan's funding status regularly as well as the technical interest rate and the conversion rates.\n\nFollowing the reduction of the technical interest rate from 1.75 percent to 1.25 percent as of December 31, 2019, the conversion rate at age 65 will be further reduced from the value of 5.00 percent as of end of 2023 in two annual steps, starting from January 1, 2025 to 4.70 percent. To partially compensate for this reduction, top-up payments from the company will be paid to the retirement accounts of members affected by the changes. In addition, from January 1, 2025, some plan design features will be changed to align the plan with market practice. The top-up payments will be made in five annual installments starting from January 1, 2025. The impact of these changes resulted in a one-off prior service credit of USD 29 million, which has been reflected as a reduction in expense in 2023, and an increase in ongoing expense through the service cost (USD 15 million in 2023).\n\nAlthough the Swiss plan operates like a defined contribution plan under local regulations, it is accounted for as a defined benefit pension plan under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' because of the need to accrue a minimum level of interest on the mandatory part of the pension accounts and the payment of a lifetime pension at a fixed conversion rate under the plan rules.\n\nActuarial valuations are completed annually and if the plan becomes underfunded under local regulations, options for managing this include additional contributions from the Group into the plan and/or reducing future benefits. At present, the plan is sufficiently funded, meaning that no additional contributions into the plans are expected to be required in the next year. The investment strategy of the Swiss plan is constrained by Swiss pension law, including regulations related to diversification of plan assets. Under IAS 19, volatility arises in the Swiss pension plan net assets as the fair value of the plan assets is not directly correlated to movements in the value of the plan's defined benefit obligation in the short-term.\n\nIf the fair value of plan assets exceeds the plan's defined benefit obligation, a surplus is only recognized on the balance sheet to the extent that it does not exceed the estimated future economic benefit. The value of the future economic benefit is estimated as the sum of two items: the difference between the present value of the estimated future net service cost and the present value of estimated future employer contributions, plus employer contribution reserves in accordance with local Swiss regulations.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## UK pension plan\n\nThe major UK pension plan is a hybrid arrangement and defined benefits entitlements accrued to December 31, 2015 increase in line with salary increases. Normal retirement age for the plan is 60. The plan is split into distinct sections and the two defined benefit sections are closed to new entrants and, with effect from January 1, 2016, to future benefit accrual. All employees now participate in a defined contribution section within the same trust. The notes that follow consider only the defined benefit sections.\n\nThe UK Pension Trustee Board is responsible for the governance of the plan. The employer contributions are determined based on regular triennial actuarial valuations which are conducted using assumptions agreed by the Trustee Board and the sponsoring company. A local statutory valuation was carried out at an effective date of June 30, 2022 and was finalized in September 2023. This valuation disclosed a funding surplus of USD 172 million (GBP 135 million) after taking into account the value of the asset-backed funding arrangement established in 2014. The asset-backed funding arrangement does not qualify as a plan asset under IAS 19 and is therefore not included in the tables set out in the rest of this note.\n\nThe ongoing funding of the plan is closely monitored by the Trustee Board and a dedicated funding committee is made up of representatives from the Trustee Board and the Group. The plan rules and UK pension legislation set out maximum levels of inflationary increases applied to plan benefits. The plan assets are invested in diversified classes of assets.\n\n## U.S. pension plans\n\nThere are two major pension plans in the U.S., the Zurich North America (ZNA) pension plan and the Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI) pension plan. Both plans are funded entirely by the participating employers. The ZNA plan is a cash balance and the FGI pension plan utilizes a cash balance pension formula for benefits accruing after January 1, 2009, except with respect to certain grandfathered participants who retained a final average pay formula. Under a cash balance pension formula, an amount is credited to the cash balance account each quarter, determined by an employee's age, service and their level of earnings up to and above the social security taxable wage base. The minimum annual interest credited on the account balance is 5 percent. The cash balance account is available from age 65, or age 55 with five years of service. The benefit can be taken as a monthly annuity or as a lump sum. Both the ZNA and FGI plans have fiduciaries as required under local pension laws. The fiduciaries are responsible for the governance of the plans. Actuarial valuations are completed regularly. The annual employer minimum required contributions are equal to expected expenses paid from the plan each year, plus a rolling amortization of any prior underfunding.\n\nThe ZNA and FGI plans have been frozen with effect from December 31, 2018. ZNA and FGI employees with a cash balance account will continue to earn interest credits on their existing cash balance account balance after the freeze date and will continue to earn eligibility service used to determine vesting and early retirement eligibility. FGI employees participating in the final average pay formula will continue to earn eligibility service used to determine vesting and the percentage of pension benefit payable for early retirement before normal retirement age of 65. ZNA and FGI employees earn only defined contribution retirement benefits with effect from January 1, 2019. In conjunction with the change in the pension plan, ZNA and FGI employees receive an additional company contribution within their defined contribution plan.\n\n## German pension plans\n\nThere are a number of legacy defined benefit plans in Germany, most of which were set up under works council agreements. Contributions to support the pension commitments are made to a contractual trust arrangement. A separate arrangement was also established in 2010 to provide for retirement obligations that were in payment at that time. Consideration is given from time to time based on the fiscal efficiency of adding recent retirees to this arrangement and to adding assets to the contractual trust. In 2023, the pension liabilities are funded at 80 percent; however, no additional funding was required.\n\nThe defined benefit plans provide benefits on either a final salary, career average salary or a cash balance basis. New entrants participate in a cash balance arrangement, which has the characteristics of a defined contribution arrangement, with a lump sum paid at retirement and a capital guarantee on members' balances, which mirrors the capital guarantee given in a conventional life insurance arrangement in Germany.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the UK, where price inflation is required for projecting benefits in those calculations, this is done using the full breakeven price inflation curve. The figures for discount rates and for UK price inflation in table 19.4 are single-equivalent rates for the defined benefit obligations (i.e., the single assumption that would produce the same defined benefit obligation as using the full curve); single-equivalent rates for other elements of the accounting results will differ slightly from the figures set out below.\n\n## Table 19.4\n\nTable 19.5a\n\n| as of December 31                   | 2023 2022   | 2023 2022       | 2023 2022      | 2023 2022   | 2023 2022   | 2023 2022       | 2023 2022      | 2023 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|\n|                                     | Switzerland | United  Kingdom | United  States | Germany     | Switzerland | United  Kingdom | United  States | Germany     |\n| Discount rate                       | 1.3%        | 4.5%            | 5.0%           | 3.2%        | 2.2%        | 4.8%            | 5.4%           | 3.7%        |\n| Inflation rate (CPI)  1             | 1.2%        | 2.5%            | 2.4%           | 2.3%        | 1.2%        | 2.6%            | 2.5%           | 2.6%        |\n| Salary increase rate                | 1.2%        | 2.4%            | 4.9%           | 3.6%        | 1.2%        | 2.8%            | 5.0%           | 3.9%        |\n| Expected future   pension increases | 0.1%        | 2.6%            | n / a          | 2.3%        | 0.1%        | 3.4%            | n / a          | 2.6%        |\n| Interest crediting rate  2          | 1.3%        | n / a           | 5.4%           | n / a       | 2.2%        | n / a           | 5.4%           | n / a       |\n\n- 1   In the UK, part of the liability is linked to the inflation measure of the Retail Price Index (RPI), which is assumed to be 1.0 percent higher than the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022. As RPI is expected to converge with CPI no earlier than in 2030, the RPI assumption for the UK was assumed to be 1.0 percent higher than CPI for durations up to and including 2029 and the same as CPI for 2030 onwards.\n- 2   As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the disclosed assumption for the U.S. is calculated as a weighted average of ZNA pension plans and the FGI pension plans.\n\nTables 19.5a and 19.5b set out the life expectancies used in the valuation of the Group's major plans.

The effect on the defined benefit obligation shown allows for an alternative value for each assumption while the other actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. While this table illustrates the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the overall defined benefit obligation. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for different plans. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the evaluation of the defined benefit obligation under market conditions at the measurement date. Its results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall defined benefit obligation. Furthermore, the analysis does not indicate a probability of such changes occurring and it does not necessarily represent the Group's view of expected future changes in the defined benefit obligation. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## 20. Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group has adopted various share-based compensation and cash incentive plans to attract, retain and motivate employees. The plans are designed to reward employees for their contribution to the performance of the Group and to encourage employee share ownership. Share-based compensation plans include performance-based share plans and employee share purchase plans. Share-based compensation plans are based on the provision of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd shares.\n\n## a) Cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group's short-term incentive plan (STIP) is utilized across the Group and in many countries covers all employees in that country who are selected to participate in a short-term incentive plan. In addition, there may be other local short-term incentive plans in place. Awards are made in cash, based on the accomplishment of both organizational and individual performance objectives. The expense recognized for these cash incentive plans amounted to USD 720 million and USD 607 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## b) Share-based compensation plans for employees\n\nThe Group encourages employees to own shares in Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and has set up a framework based on the implementation of performance share programs. Actual plans are tailored to meet local market requirements.\n\nThe cost of share-based payments depends on various factors, including achievement of targets, and are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and the Board. Costs may therefore vary significantly from year to year. The net amounts of USD 317 million and USD 246 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflect all aspects of share-based compensation, including adjustments made during the year.\n\nThe explanations below provide a more detailed overview of the main plans of the Group.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\n## Share incentive plans for employees in the UK\n\nThe Group established an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan and launched the Partnership Shares element of this plan in 2003, which enabled participating employees to make monthly purchases of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd shares at the prevailing market price from their gross earnings. This plan was terminated in 2007. There were 9 participants in the plan as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nA revised Partnership Share Scheme was launched in March 2013. Participants benefit from purchasing shares by making deductions from gross salary up to a maximum of GBP 1,800 or 10 percent of their year-to-date earnings. There were 883 and 744 active participants in the plan as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Group also operates a profit-sharing element of the Share Incentive Plan (Reward Shares) which was launched in 2004 with annual share allocations being made in May each year subject to business performance. The awards are based on business operating profit (BOP) after tax for the year achieved by the business unit of each participating employee. Individual awards are subject to a maximum of 5 percent of a participant's base salary (before any flexible benefit adjustments) with an overall maximum of GBP 3,600. The total number of participating employees in Reward Shares as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 4,056 and 4,319, respectively.\n\nA Dividend Shares scheme was launched in 2014 which allows employees to reinvest their dividends from Partnership Shares and Reward Shares. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were 696 and 569 participants in the scheme, respectively.\n\n## Share incentive plan for employees in Switzerland\n\nUnder the Employee Share Plan, eligible employees are allowed to acquire sales-restricted shares at a 30 percent discount to the market value. The maximum permitted investment at the preferential price in shares is equivalent to CHF 3,500 per employee per annum. During 2023, 4,846 employees were eligible to participate in the plan, compared with 4,515 in 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 2,560 and 2,331 employees, respectively, purchased shares under the 2023 and 2022 share plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n373\n\n373",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## The Group Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nParticipants in this plan are allocated a target number of performance shares units (PSUs) as notional shares of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd in April each year. The number of PSUs to be allocated is calculated according to each participant's annual target amount which is expressed as a percentage of their annual base salary. To further align participants with the interests of shareholders, PSUs are credited with dividend equivalent units (DEUs) during the vesting period to compensate participants in LTIP for dividends paid to shareholders.\n\nPSUs allocated in 2023 will vest after a period of three years following the year of allocation (three-year cliff vesting), with the actual level of vesting between 0 percent and 200 percent of the overall target shares (PSUs allocated and DEUs that accrued during the vesting period), depending on the achievement of pre-defined performance criteria. The performance criteria used to determine the level of vesting are the Group's business operating profit after tax return on common shareholders' equity (average BOPAT ROE), the position of its relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured against an international peer group of insurance companies, and the achievement of cash remittance targets, each with a 30 percent weight, as well as operational CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions with a 10 percent weight. The four pre-defined performance criteria are assessed independently over a period of three consecutive financial years starting in the year of allocation. One half of the shares that vest are sales-restricted for a further three years for members of the Executive Committee. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 there were 1,281 and 1,305 participants in this plan, respectively.\n\nTable 20\n\n| for the years ended December 31           | Fair value at the   | Fair value at the   |   Fair value at the |   Fair value at the |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                           | 2023                | 2022                |              2023   |              2022   |\n| Target shares allocated during the period | 424,071             | 408,015             |               443.5 |               451.2 |\n\n- 1   Fair value measured using the market price of the shares at the allocation date and volatility indicators.\n\nThe target shares allocated each year are based on parameters under the Group's LTIP.

Commitments and contingencies, legal proceedings and regulatory investigations\n\nThe Group has provided contractual commitments and financial guarantees to external parties, associates and joint ventures as well as partnerships. These arrangements include commitments under certain conditions to make liquidity advances to cover default principal and interest payments, make capital contributions or provide equity financing.\n\nTable 21\n\n| in USD millions as of December 31                 |   2023 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Remaining commitments under investment agreements |    832 | 1,045  |\n| Guarantees and letters of credit  1               |    864 | 838    |\n| Undrawn loan commitments                          |      1 | -      |\n| Other commitments and contingent liabilities  2   |    447 | 427    |\n\n- 1   Guarantee features embedded in life insurance products are not included.\n- 2   Includes USD 94 million and USD 11 million future cash flows in 2023 and 2022, respectively, that the Group as a lessee is potentially exposed to which are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities in the balance sheet.\n\n## Commitments under investment agreements\n\nThe Group has committed to contribute capital to third parties that engage in making investments in direct private equity, private equity funds and real estate. Commitments may be called by the counterparty over the term of the investment (generally three to five years) and must be funded by the Group on a timely basis.\n\n## Guarantees and letters of credit\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, USD 605 million and USD 572 million related to guarantees in the aggregate amount of GBP 475 million which were provided to the directors of a wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the repatriation of capital. These guarantees have no expiry date.\n\nThe Group knows of no event of default that would require it to satisfy financial guarantees. Irrevocable letters of credit have been issued to secure certain reinsurance contracts.\n\nThe Group is active in numerous countries where insurance guarantee funds exist. The design of such funds varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some, funding is based on premiums written; in others, the Group may be called upon to contribute to such funds in case of a failure of another market participant. In addition, in some jurisdictions the amount of contribution may be limited to, for example, a percentage of the net underwriting reserve net of payments already made.\n\nThe Group carries certain contingencies in the ordinary course of business in connection with the sale of its companies and businesses. These are primarily in the form of indemnification obligations provided to the acquirer in a transaction in which a Group company is the seller. They vary in scope and duration by counterparty and generally are intended to shift the potential risk of certain unquantifiable and unknown loss contingencies from the acquirer to the seller.\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd has provided unlimited guarantees in support of entities belonging to the Zurich Capital Markets group of companies.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has received notices from various tax authorities asserting deficiencies in taxes for various years. The Group is of the view that the ultimate outcome of these reviews will not materially affect the Group's consolidated financial position.\n\nThe Group has commitments to provide collateral on certain contracts in the event of a financial strength downgrading for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd from the current AA by Standard & Poor's. Should the rating by Standard & Poor's fall to A+, then the additional collateral based on information available amounts to nil as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn common with other insurance companies, the Group is mindful of the trend toward enhanced consumer protection. There is significant uncertainty about the ultimate cost this trend might have on our business. The main areas of uncertainty concern court decisions as well as the volume of potential customer complaints related to sales activities and withdrawal rights, and their respective individual assessments.\n\n## Quantifiable commitments and contingencies",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Pledged assets\n\nThe majority of assets pledged to secure the Group's liabilities relate to debt securities pledged under short-term sale and repurchase agreements. The total amount of pledged financial assets including the securities under short-term sale and repurchase agreements amounted to USD 1.8 billion and USD 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nTerms and conditions associated with the financial assets pledged to secure the Group's liabilities are usual and standard in the markets in which the underlying agreements were executed.\n\n## Legal, compliance and regulatory developments\n\nThe Group's business is subject to extensive supervision, and the Group is in regular contact with various regulatory authorities. The Group is also involved in legal and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of its business operations in various jurisdictions where it operates. In addition, the Group and/or its subsidiaries are involved in legal matters arising out of transactions involving the transfer of portfolios or businesses. These legal matters can include claims brought by purchasers or other parties asserting claims for damages on various theories, including failure to disclose material information, failure to perform contractual duties or otherwise seeking to impose liability on the Group and/or its subsidiaries. With respect to significant legal or regulatory matters, the Group considers the likelihood of a negative outcome, and when the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated, a reserve or provision is established to record the estimated loss for the expected outcome. While the Group believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its subsidiaries the subject of, any unresolved current legal proceedings, claims, litigation and investigations that will have a material adverse effect on the Group's consolidated financial condition, proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the outcome of any proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in the particular reporting period in which it is resolved. Specifically:\n\n- - Several of the Group's subsidiaries as well as other insurance companies are involved in litigation relating to the extent to which COVID-19 was intended to be covered under Property Damage Business Interruption policies. A limited number of class actions have also been initiated. Most of the litigation has been filed in United States courts and in addition to test cases in the UK. The final determination of outcomes may take many years as appeals are pursued by the plaintiffs and insurers, including the Group or its subsidiaries.\n- - In 2016, the Group, on its own initiative, undertook an internal review of the life insurance, savings and pension business sold by its non-U.S. operating companies with relevant cross-border business to customers with a nexus to the U.S. The review confirmed that the Group's cross-border business with U.S. persons was very limited and of a legacy nature, with the large majority of sales having occurred more than a decade ago. The review also confirmed that the Group's U.S. operating companies were not involved in or connected to those activities. The Group voluntarily disclosed the results of the review and the regulatory issues presented by sales to U.S. residents to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other authorities. The Group continues to cooperate with these authorities. In April 2019, the DOJ announced that Zurich Life Insurance Company Ltd (ZLIC) and Zurich International Life Limited (ZILL) entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the DOJ, which memorializes the DOJ's decision not to prosecute these entities for any U.S. tax-related offenses in connection with legacy cross-border sales to U.S. persons. Under the terms of the NPA, ZLIC and ZILL have agreed to comply with certain specified conditions during the four-year term of the NPA. This resolution has not had, and will not have, an adverse effect on the Group's business or consolidated financial condition.\n- - In April 2023, a putative nationwide class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, California (the 'Superior Court'), against Farmers Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries, Fire Underwriters Association and Truck Underwriters Association (collectively, 'FGI'). The case, captioned Paul Lim, et al v. Farmers Group, Inc., et al., alleges that FGI breached its fiduciary duty by accepting excessive compensation for their services and failing to disclose certain information about their fees, calculation methods and relationship to Zurich. In May 2023, FGI removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California under the Class Action Fairness Act, and subsequently filed a motion to dismiss. On May 26, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the action to the California state Superior Court, which was granted on November 13, 2023. In light of the remand, the U.S. District Court did not rule on the substance of FGI's motion to dismiss. On January 2, 2024, with the Superior Court's permission, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint. An Initial Case Management Conference is set for February 15, 2024. The case has been subject to a stay leading up to the Initial Case Management Conference. At the Initial Case Management Conference, the Superior Court will likely consider the extent to which to lift the stay to allow motion practice or discovery to proceed. FGI believes it has numerous and substantial defenses to the claims raised and will vigorously contest the action.\n- - In July and August 2023, the administrators of Greensill Bank AG (GBAG) served two Particulars of Claim on Zurich Insurance plc (ZIP) issued in the London Commercial Court, alleging non-payment of claims presented under a trade credit policy written by ZIP. Subsequently, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC) was substituted in the actions for ZIP. ZIC's defense to both actions was filed on January 26, 2024. In the defense, ZIC also filed counterclaims against GBAG and other third parties. ZIC believes that it has meritorious defenses to the policy and the claims raised and will vigorously contest the actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n376\n\n376",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## 22. Fair value measurement\n\nTo measure fair value, the Group gives the highest priority to quoted and unadjusted prices in active markets. In the absence of quoted prices, fair values are calculated through valuation techniques, making the maximum use of relevant observable market data inputs. Whenever observable parameters are not available, the inputs used to derive the fair value are based on common market assumptions that market participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities. Depending on the observability of prices and inputs to valuation techniques, the Group classifies instruments measured at fair value within the following three levels (the fair value hierarchy):\n\nLevel 1 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined directly from unadjusted current quoted prices resulting from orderly transactions in active markets for identical assets/liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined using significant inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable market inputs.\n\nLevel 3 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined using valuation techniques with at least one significant input not being based on observable market data. This approach is used only in circumstances when there is little, if any, market activity for a certain instrument, and the Group is required to rely on third party providers or develop internal valuation inputs based on the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe governance framework and oversight of the Group's standards and procedures regarding the valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value lies within the responsibility of Group Risk Management, Group Investment Management, Treasury Capital Management and Group Finance. Specialists from these departments ensure the adequacy of valuation models, approve methodologies and sources to derive model input parameters, provide oversight over the selection of third-party pricing providers, and on a semi-annual basis review the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the financial instruments in scope.\n\nThe Group makes extensive use of third-party pricing providers to determine the fair values of its financial instruments measured at fair value through comprehensive income and at fair value through profit or loss, and only in rare cases places reliance on prices that are derived from internal models. Investment accounting, operations and process functions are independent from those responsible for buying and selling the assets, and are responsible for receiving, challenging and verifying values provided by third-party pricing providers to ensure that fair values are reliable, as well as ensuring compliance with applicable accounting and valuation policies. The quality control procedures used depend on the nature and complexity of the invested assets. They include variance and stale price analysis, and comparisons with fair values of similar instruments and with alternative values obtained from asset managers and brokers. Model review activities are also conducted for evaluated prices supplied by third parties to verify that their valuation processes, methodologies, models, and governance and control frameworks comply with applicable internal guidance, and that the allocation of those instruments within the fair value hierarchy is adequate. They include the collection and review of relevant documentation as well as meetings with third-party representatives to supplement the analysis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n377\n\n377",

Subsequently, financial assets measured at fair value through comprehensive income, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date. All other financial instruments are carried at amortized cost and the valuation techniques used to determine their fair value measurement are described below.\n\nFair values for debt securities held at amortized cost and senior and subordinated debt are obtained from third-party pricing providers. The fair value received from these pricing providers may be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, alternative pricing methods such as matrix pricing, or an income approach employing discounted cash flow models. Such instruments are categorized within level 2.\n\nDiscounted cash flow models are used for mortgage and other loans. The discount yields in these models use interest rates that reflect the return a market participant would expect to receive on instruments with similar remaining maturities, cash flow patterns, currencies, credit risk and collateral. Such instruments are categorized within level 3.\n\nDifferent valuation techniques are used to value private debt instruments, including the income approach (such as discounted cash flow models) or the market approach (such as relative value models). Where prices are obtained from an evaluated pricing service from a data vendor in which price transparency data indicates no use of significant unobservable inputs, they are categorized within Level 2. All other prices are classified to Level 3 unless factual evidence indicates that unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation.\n\nFair values of liabilities related to investment contracts are determined using discounted cash flow models. Such instruments are categorized within level 3 due to the unobservability of certain inputs used in the valuation.\n\n## Fair value and carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities",

The fair value received from these pricing providers may be based on quoted prices in an active market for similar assets, alternative pricing methods such as matrix pricing, or an income approach employing discounted cash flow models.\n\nOver-the-counter derivative financial instruments are valued using internal models and third-party valuation services. The fair values are determined using dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, which use various inputs including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, time to expiry, yield curves and volatility of underlying instruments. Such instruments are classified within level 2 as the inputs used in pricing models are generally market observable or derived from market observable data.\n\nFair values of liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts are usually determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying assets backing these liabilities. Such instruments are classified within level 2.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy unit-linked current period\n\n## Fair value hierarchy unit-linked prior period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Within level 3, the Group has classified:\n\n- - Unlisted stocks, private equity funds and hedge funds that are not actively traded. The valuations of such instruments are obtained from quarterly net asset value information from the fund manager and annual audited financial statements provided by the issuing company. The prices are generally derived for each underlying company in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) guidelines, using discounted cash flows (income approach) or multiples methods (market approach). The Group has only limited insight into the specific inputs used by the fund managers; hence, a narrative sensitivity analysis is not applicable.\n- - Non-agency MBS, ABS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO) rated below 'AAA' and private debt holdings including certain private placements that are valued by independent pricing providers or external asset managers using primarily the discounted cash flow method with significant unobservable input parameters such as asset prepayment rates, default rates and credit spreads. A significant market yield increase of the benchmark securities in isolation could result in a decreased fair value, while a significant market yield decrease could result in an increased fair value. However, a reasonable variation in the option-adjusted spread taken from a set of benchmark securities with similar characteristics has only an immaterial impact on fair value.\n- - All investment properties for which there are no active and transparent real estate markets or observable data available. The valuation for the majority of these investment properties - other than certain investment properties located in Switzerland - are typically performed annually by independent qualified appraisers. The parameters used for the valuations are specific to each country or region and vary significantly across different markets. External appraisals are reviewed by internal real estate valuation specialists; however, since the unobservable inputs were not developed by the Group they are not readily available. In some cases, where external valuations are obtained at least every three years, interim valuations by internal valuation specialists are performed. For investment properties located in Switzerland, the valuation model is based on a discounted cash flow method and is applied to each individual property based on its expected cash flows. The unobservable input parameters include the future transition cost for carbon emission and capital expenditures to achieve the desired environmental footprint depending on the current condition of each individual property. These input parameters are combined into a synthetic spread applied to the otherwise observable discount rate.\n- - Overall, as of December 31, 2023, around 40 percent of level 3 investment properties were covered by internal valuations. Significant increases/(decreases) in synthetic spread, in isolation, would result in a lower/(higher) fair value measurement. For example, an increase in spread of 10bps, considered in isolation, would result in a decrease in fair value of 3 percent or approximately USD 140 million as of December 31, 2023.\n- - Options and long-dated derivative financial instruments with fair values determined using counterparty valuations or calculated using significant unobservable inputs such as historical volatilities, historical correlation, implied volatilities from the counterparty or derived using extrapolation techniques. Quantitative information on unobservable inputs is not available when counterparty pricing was used. For internally calculated fair values, significant increases/(decreases) in volatilities or correlation would result in a significantly higher/(lower) fair value measurement; however, the overall effect on the Group's financial statements would not be material.\n\nFor details on Group investments sensitivities, refer to section analysis by risk type in the 2023 Risk Review as well as select disclosures included in note 7.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy is reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether significant transfers between levels have occurred. Transfers between levels mainly arise as a result of changes in market activity and observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of certain instruments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group recorded a transfer of USD 275 million of non-unit-linked mutual funds out of level 1 into level 2 due to their lower subscription and redemption volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group recorded a transfer of USD 430 million of unit-linked fair value through profit or loss equity securities out of level 2 into level 1 for mutual funds with daily published prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

(see note 4).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group transferred USD 87 million of debt securities held at fair value through comprehensive income from level 2 into level 3 corresponding to private debt instruments that exhibit higher reliance on unobservable valuation inputs, and non-agency ABS and MBS with a credit rating downgrade from AAA. The Group transferred USD 158 million of debt securities held at fair value through comprehensive income out of level 3 into level 2 attributable to private debt instruments with a higher reliance on observable valuation inputs and non-agency ABS and MBS whose credit rating has been upgraded to AAA.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Group transferred USD 3 billion of investment property from level 2 to level 3. During 2023, the Group reviewed the fair value hierarchy classification of investment properties primarily located in Germany. The sharp increase in interest rates, coupled with rising inflation and uncertainty around future interest rate development, resulted in significantly fewer transactions in the real estate market.

Expected credit loss measurement\n\nThe Group recognized expected credit losses in line with the accounting policies outlined in note 3e of the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\n## ECL scenarios and key input parameters\n\nFor rated debt securities, the Group determines the forward-looking inputs by evaluating a range of possible outcomes through a scenario-based approach. The following macroeconomic and financial variables have been selected due to historical correlation with credit loss emergence and relevance to the Group investment portfolio: GDP growth, 10-year interest rates and investment credit spread in the U.S. and Eurozone. Table 23.1 shows the variables for each of the three scenarios (downside scenario/base case/upside scenario) modelled by Group Investment Management Market Strategy and Macroeconomics, as well as the weights assigned to each scenario. For residential and small commercial mortgage loan portfolios, the forward-looking parameters are derived from the forecast of the real estate prices by property type, as well as actual affordability of the loan for a customer.\n\nFor 2024, the economic scenarios remain broadly consistent with the previous estimate and are centered around expectations for the development of the U.S. economy:\n\n- - The base case scenario has global growth remaining below trend, as the U.S. enters recession in the first half of the year while economic activity in Europe and China remains weak. The U.S. recession is expected to be relatively mild and short lived, due to a lack of significant economic and financial imbalances and falling inflation, which allows the Federal Reserve and other major central banks to begin with limited interest rate cuts. Default rates in high-yield credit are expected to continue rising for the next few quarters, where weaker speculative grade companies remain vulnerable as supply is low and lending conditions tight, while cash positions have been run down. Financial markets are expected to stay volatile, with the possibility of further drawdowns in equity prices, before a recovery gains traction in the second half of 2024. Credit spreads are then also expected to fall back quickly from recessionary levels, ending the year tighter compared to 2023.\n- - In the downside scenario, there is a hard landing for the U.S. economy with a deeper and more drawn-out recession and asset price decline compared to the base case. In this scenario, the Federal Reserve and other central banks maintain their hawkish stance and deliver some further rate hikes in early 2024, as services inflation remains strong and labor markets tight. Hopes of a soft landing fade and fears of a deeper and longer lasting recession set in, causing a sharp selloff in financial assets. U.S. equity markets are assumed to fall by close to 30 percent from peak to trough while, in credit markets, more companies become vulnerable to cash burn and distress and defaults pick up notably, with spreads peaking in the second half of 2024. There is only a slow recovery toward the end of the year.\n- - The upside scenario sees the U.S. economy maintain growth at around trend, while inflation falls markedly in early 2024 as services price pressures normalize. Economic activity remains resilient, which allows companies and households to continue to service debt despite the high interest rate environment, while sentiment picks up from a lower level. Global financial markets consequently recover and stage a strong rally in 2024 with notable gains in credit, with spreads recovering significantly, leaving room for modest gains in subsequent years. While government bond yields fall from current elevated levels in this scenario, they remain high for longer compared with the base case.\n\nTable 23.1\n\n| As of                         | USA               | Eurozone          | USA             | Eurozone        | Assigned weights in %   | Assigned weights in %   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                               |                   |                   |                 |                 | December 31,            | January 1,              |\n|                               | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | January 1, 2023 | January 1, 2023 | 2023                    | 2023                    |\n| Upside scenario               |                   |                   |                 |                 |                         |                         |\n| GDP year-on-year change in %  | 1.8               | 0.8               | 1.4             | (0.1)           |                         |                         |\n| 10-year interest rate in %    | 3.7               | 2.5               | 3.2             | 1.6             |                         |                         |\n| Credit spread in basis points | 100               | 90                | 80              | 75              | 25%                     | 20%                     |\n| Base case scenario            |                   |                   |                 |                 |                         |                         |\n| GDP year-on-year change in %  | 0.2               | 0.4               | 0.3             | (0.4)           |                         |                         |\n| 10-year interest rate in %    | 3.5               | 2.3               | 3.0             | 1.6             |                         |                         |\n| Credit spread in basis points | 125               | 120               | 125             | 140             | 50%                     | 45%                     |\n| Downside scenario             |                   |                   |                 |                 |                         |                         |\n| GDP year-on-year change in %  | (0.6)             | (0.4)             | (0.6)           | (1.0)           |                         |                         |\n| 10-year interest rate in %    | 3.0               | 2.0               | 2.5             | 1.3             |                         |                         |\n| Credit spread in basis points | 250               | 250               | 175             | 220             | 25%                     | 35%                     |\n\nScenario weights and macroeconomic assumptions for ECL measurement of debt securities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Related parties of the Group include, among others, subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, key management personnel, and the post-employment benefit plans (please see note 19). Transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation, and they are not disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

Relationship with the Farmers Exchanges\n\nFarmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI) provide certain non-claims services to the Farmers Exchanges as their attorneys-in-fact, and also provide certain ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges. Farmers Group, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. Attorney-in-fact services primarily include risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative and managerial functions. Fees for these services are primarily determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. Ancillary services primarily include information technology, brand advertising and certain distribution related services that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts for which FGI acts as a principal in arranging for those services to the Exchanges. The finances and operations of the Farmers Exchanges are governed by independent Boards of Governors. In addition, the Group has the following relationships with the Farmers Exchanges.\n\n## a) Quota share reinsurance treaties with the Farmers Exchanges\n\nFarmers Reinsurance Company (Farmers Re Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of FGI, assumes risk through a quota share reinsurance treaty, the All Lines Quota Share reinsurance agreement (All Lines agreement) with the Farmers Exchanges. The All Lines agreement can be terminated after 90 days' notice by any of the parties.\n\nThe All Lines agreement provides for an assumption of a quota share of the all lines insurance results of the Farmers Exchanges.\n\nTable 25.1\n\n| in USD millions, for the years ended December 31   | All Lines agreement   | All Lines agreement   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                    | 2023  1               | 2022  2               |\n| Insurance revenue                                  | 1,536                 | 316                   |\n| Insurance service expense  3                       | (1,461)               | (298)                 |\n| Insurance service result                           | 75                    | 19                    |\n\n- 1   Subject to regulatory approval, effective December 31, 2023, Farmers Re Co assumed a 10.00 percent quota share of which 8.25 percent was retroceded to Zurich Global, Ltd. Another 23.00 percent was assumed by other third parties.\n- 2   Effective December 31, 2022, Farmers Re Co assumed an 8.50 percent quota share of which 6.75 percent was retroceded to Zurich Global, Ltd. Another 22.50 percent was assumed by other third parties.\n- 3   Under the All Lines agreement, Farmers Re Co catastrophe losses are subject to a maximum amount each year.

As the attorney-in-fact, FGI is permitted by policyholders of the Farmers Exchanges to receive a management fee of up to 20 percent (up to 25 percent in the case of the Fire Insurance Exchange) of the gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. This management fee, the primary source of revenue for FGI, has an agreed upon margin cap of 7 percent which is derived from FGI gross management result divided by the gross premium earned by the Farmers Exchanges. The expected revenues and expenses are assessed monthly to determine if expected revenues will be in excess of the cap, in which case the revenue is reduced on a pro-rata basis to ensure that no revenue is recognized for the amounts exceeding the cap. In addition, FGI revenue includes reimbursement of certain ancillary service costs incurred by FGI on behalf of primarily the Farmers Exchanges that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts. The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to FGI at cost in accordance with allocations that are subject to approval by the Farmers Exchanges Boards of Governors.\n\nFGI has historically charged a lower management fee than the amount allowed by policyholders. The range of fees has varied by line of business over time and from year to year. The gross earned premiums of the Farmers Exchanges were USD 26.7 billion and USD 25.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nTable 25.2\n\n| in USD millions, for the years ended December 31   | 2023    | 2022    | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Fee income                                         | 4,529   | 4,487   | 1%       |\n| Management fees                                    | 3,577   | 3,425   | 4%       |\n| Revenues for ancillary services                    | 865     | 968     | (11%)    |\n| Membership fees                                    | 51      | 55      | (9%)     |\n| Other revenues                                     | 37      | 39      | (5%)     |\n| Fee business expenses                              | (2,587) | (2,714) | 5%       |\n| Expenses for ancillary services                    | (865)   | (968)   | 11%      |\n| Management and other expenses                      | (1,722) | (1,746) | 1%       |\n| Fee result                                         | 1,942   | 1,773   | 10%      |\n| Other management related income/expenses           | (67)    | (59)    | (14%)    |\n| Gross management result  1                         | 1,875   | 1,713   | 9%       |\n| Managed gross earned premium margin                | 7.0%    | 6.6%    | 0.4 pts  |\n\n- 1   Includes the impact of amortization/impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination.\n\n## Farmers Management Services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Segment information\n\nThe Group pursues a customer-centric strategy, where the Property & Casualty (P&C) and Life businesses are managed on a regional basis. The Group's reportable segments have been identified on the basis of the businesses operated by the Group and how these are strategically managed to offer different products and services to specific customer groups. The Group has identified 13 reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8 and segment information is presented accordingly as follows:\n\n- - P&C regions\n- - Life regions\n- - Farmers\n- - Group Functions and Operations\n- - Non-Core Businesses\n\nThe Group's reportable segments comprise the following:\n\n## P&C and Life regions\n\n- - Europe, Middle East & Africa\n- - North America\n- - Asia Pacific\n- - Latin America\n- - Group Reinsurance\n\nP&C regions provide a variety of motor, home and commercial products and services for individuals, as well as small and large businesses on both a local and global basis. Products are sold through multiple distribution channels including agents, brokers and bank distribution.\n\nLife regions provide a comprehensive range of life and health insurance products on both an individual and a group basis, including annuities, endowment and term insurance, unit-linked and investment-oriented products, as well as full private health, supplemental health and long-term care insurance. In addition to the agent distribution channel, certain of these products are offered via bank distribution channels.\n\nFarmers, through Farmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI), provides certain non-claims administrative and management services to the Farmers Exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders. This segment also includes all reinsurance assumed from the Farmers Exchanges by the Group. Farmers Exchanges are prominent writers of personal and small commercial lines of business in the U.S. In addition, this segment includes the activities of Farmers Life, a writer of individual life insurance business in the U.S.\n\nGroup Functions and Operations comprise the Group's Holding and Financing and Headquarters activities, including central initiatives in Zurich Global Ventures. Certain alternative investment positions not allocated to business operating segments are included within Holding and Financing. In addition, this segment includes operational technical governance activities relating to technology, underwriting, claims, actuarial and pricing.\n\nNon-Core Businesses include insurance and reinsurance businesses that the Group does not consider core to its operations and that are therefore mostly managed to achieve a beneficial run-off. Non-core businesses are mainly situated in the U.S., Bermuda and in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business operating profit (BOP) indicates the underlying performance of the Group's businesses, after non-controlling interests, by eliminating the impact of financial market volatility and other non-operating variables. This measure is the basis on which the Group manages its business units. BOP reflects adjustments for shareholders' taxes, net capital gains/ (losses) and expected credit losses on investments (except investments in hedge funds as at fair value through profit or loss and certain securities held for specific economic hedging purposes) after considering the effect of changes in fair value of underlying items held for direct participating contracts and effects of hyperinflation. Significant items arising from special circumstances, including restructuring charges, legal matters outside the ordinary course of business, amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, gains and losses on divestment of businesses and impairments of goodwill are also excluded from BOP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as those of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards (IESBA Code)), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.

As described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Group applied IFRS 17 to insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held retrospectively from January 1, 2022, in accordance with the accounting policies outlined in Note 3. The 2022 comparative figures as presented in these consolidated financial statements have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 17.\n\nOn transition to the new standard, shareholders equity as of January 1, 2022, decreased by USD 8.7 billion, resulting from a decrease of USD 14.4 billion relating to the recognition of the Contractual Service Margin (CSM) as part of the insurance contract assets and liabilities and an increase of USD 5.7 billion relating to a combination of the derecognition of intangibles, other valuation differences and deferred tax.\n\nAuditing the Group's Initial Application was complex, as it related to the measurement of the Group's insurance contract liabilities, including the transition CSM. This required the application of significant auditor judgment due to the complexity of the models, accounting interpretations made and the development of fair value assumptions used in the determination of the transition CSM. The audit effort involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified the Initial Application as a key audit matter.\n\nThe critical accounting judgments and the impact related to the Initial Application are disclosed in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The controls we tested included controls related to management's selection of accounting policies and the related determination of the transition approach, as well as controls related to the development of fair value and actuarial models, the integrity of data used and the implementation of new systems and models.\n\nTo test the Initial Application, our audit procedures were executed with the assistance of our actuarial specialists and included, amongst others:\n\n- -Evaluating the Group's accounting policies and actuarial methodology to assess compliance with IFRS 17.\n- -Assessing the analyses of contracts prepared by the Group for the purpose of the classification according to the different measurement approaches (either the building block approach (BBA), variable fee approach (VFA) or premium allocation approach (PAA)) and tested such analyses for compliance with IFRS 17 and to the underlying contracts on a sample basis.\n- -In respect of the transition approaches (Fully retrospective, Modified retrospective or Fair Value approach) applied in the calculation of the CSM, evaluating the Group's assessment on the availability of reasonable and supportable historic information required by the full retrospective approach, and the appropriateness of simplifications, under the modified retrospective approach, or fair value approach applied.\n- -Testing of the completeness and accuracy of data used in the calculation of the transition balances to underlying source systems on a sample basis.\n- -Assessing the appropriateness and consistency of key assumptions used in the calculation of the transition balances with those used in IFRS 4 for the corresponding period, publicly available market data, our knowledge of the products and the requirements of IFRS 17.\n- -Testing the methodology and calculation of the IFRS 17 insurance contract liabilities and transition CSM, either through review of the calculation logic within the newly implemented models, or through calculating an independent estimate of the insurance contract liability for a sample of insurance contracts and comparing the results to the Group's results.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Of this amount, USD 62,042 million relates to the present value of future cash flows, and USD 1,310 million relates to the risk adjustment for non-financial risk. (*)\n\nAs described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, the LIC reflects a current, explicit, unbiased and probability-weighted estimate of the present value of the expected future cash outflows (best estimate), and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe estimation of the IBNR is a complex process, applying actuarial and statistical methods over historical data and patterns requiring the use of estimates and judgments. It requires the use of complex formulas and computational tools that may be incorrectly configured, and for which inaccurate or incomplete input data may be used.\n\nThis is specifically the case for lines of business that are considered longer-tail, such as worker's compensation, general and professional liability, and other specialty lines where certain longer-term assumptions are required as part of the projection techniques. These projection techniques also consider emerging risks, which can have a significant impact on the determination of the ultimate settlement costs, but where available experience is limited, including uncertainty around claims litigation, timeliness of claims reporting, and inflation.\n\nAdditionally, the expected future cash outflows relating to the IBNR for catastrophes which are usually of less frequency but higher severity, are more difficult to estimate and their calculation require the use of expert judgment, especially for events taking place close to period end.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified the IBNR as a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates regarding the IBNR are described in Note 3, with additional information presented in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For VFA, USD 113,575 million relates to the PVFCF. (*)\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a group of insurance contracts under BBA and VFA as the total of:\n\n- -Fulfilment cash flows, which comprise of:\n- o (i) estimates of future cash flows, adjusted to reflect the time value of money and financial risks.\n- o (ii) risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n- -Contractual service margin (CSM), which represents the unearned profit the Group will recognize as it provides service under the related insurance contracts.\n\nPVFCF are associated with significant uncertainties requiring the use of expert judgment within complex actuarial models relying on subjective assumptions in relation to future events. Key assumptions include mortality, lapse and expense assumptions as well as modelled future decisions of management and of policyholders. Moreover, because of the long duration of many life insurance products, relatively small changes in key assumptions may have a significant impact on PVFCF.\n\nThe determination of PVFCF requires the use of complex formulas as well as the construction of models and other computational tools that may be incorrectly designed or configured, and for which inadequate assumptions and/or incomplete or inaccurate input data may be used.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified PVFCF within the recorded liability for remaining coverage as a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates regarding PVFCF are described in Notes 3, with additional information presented in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Goodwill and AIF are allocated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are identified at the segment level.\n\nManagement tests goodwill and AIF for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that the amount of goodwill and AIF is not recoverable.\n\nEstimation of the recoverable amount requires management to use complex models, expert judgment, and is based on subjective assumptions, particularly in respect of projections of future income based on prospective business plans, perpetual growth rates, and discount rates.\n\nAccordingly, we deem the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill and the AIF contract intangibles to be a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates related to goodwill and AIF are disclosed in Note 3, with additional information presented in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of controls over the model used and centrally provided key assumptions.\n\nTo test the recoverability of goodwill and AIF, our audit procedures included:\n\n- -Assessing, with assistance of our valuation specialists, the valuation methods used and the reasonableness of the key assumptions within these models, i.e., discount rates, perpetual growth rates and tax rate.\n- -Evaluating whether the goodwill and AIF allocation to CGUs as identified by management is supportable.\n- -Performing risk-based substantive procedures for selected CGUs regarding key assumptions, including evaluating the:\n- o consistency of projected future cash flows with management's most recent estimates, including those used in the Group's planning process;\n- o assumptions made with respect to projected future cash flows and whether they are reasonable in terms of the applicable CGU's economic and financial outlook, including the impacts of the current macro-economic environment;\n- o comparison of actual results versus historical projected financial information;\n- o completeness and accuracy of data used by management to project future cash flows; and\n- o sensitivity analysis performed by management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements, the remuneration report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibilities for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/auditreport.

        "page_content": "S\n\n## Holding company (continued)\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## 1. General information\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd (the Company or ZIG) is a corporation domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland, and its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. It was incorporated on April 26, 2000, and is the holding company of the Zurich Insurance Group (Group) with the principal activity of holding subsidiary companies. The Company does not employ staff, as employees work in a joint capacity for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC).\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation\n\nThe Company presents its financial statements in accordance with Swiss law.\n\nAll amounts in these financial statements, including the notes, are shown in Swiss franc thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified. All variances are calculated using the actual figures rather than the rounded amounts.\n\n## 3. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## a) Exchange rates\n\nUnless otherwise stated, assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than Swiss francs are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Net unrealized exchange losses are recorded in the income statements and net unrealized exchange gains are deferred until realized.\n\n## b) Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are equity interests, held on a long-term basis for the purpose of the Company's business activities. Each investment in subsidiaries is valued individually and carried at its cost less adjustments for impairments.\n\n## c) Accrued income\n\nIncome is accrued for interest which is earned but not yet due for payment at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## d) Reserves for treasury shares (indirectly held via subsidiaries)\n\nReserves for treasury shares are accounted for at the acquisition costs of these shares held by the respective subsidiary.\n\n## e) Treasury shares (directly held by the Company)\n\nOn June 7, 2023, ZIG completed the public share buyback program of up to CHF 1,800 million, which was launched on November 21, 2022. After completion of the public share buyback program, all treasury shares directly held by the Company were cancelled using the capital band introduced on April 6, 2023, by the Annual General Meeting. The new share capital of CHF 14,635,575.40 and the new number of shares of 146,355,754 shares were registered in the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich on August 7, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, treasury shares directly held by the Company were carried at acquisition cost and presented as a deduction in the shareholders' equity.\n\n## 4. Other operating expenses\n\nOther operating expenses for the year were CHF 40.6 million compared with CHF 17.0 million in 2022. The increase of CHF 23.6 million was mainly due to the Company making a charitable contribution to the Z Zurich Foundation of CHF 29.5 million, while there was no contribution in 2022. In addition, Board member fees of CHF 5.8 million and CHF 5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, are included in this line item. Overhead expenses decreased by CHF 6.1 million to CHF 1.4 million in 2023. Furthermore, fees paid to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA amounting to CHF 2.9 million are included for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n## 5. Financial income\n\nFinancial income for the year 2023 mainly consists of dividend income of CHF 5,170 million received from the Company's subsidiary ZIC and interest income of CHF 134.3 million on the subordinated loan with ZIC. This interest income is recognized when ZIC declares its intention to pay a dividend to the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Receivables from subsidiaries\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries include intragroup balances related to the Group's internal cash pooling facility in the amount of CHF 7.7 million and CHF 1,652 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in 2023 is driven by the dividend paid out of available earnings totaling to CHF 3,507 million as well as the repayment of the senior debt of CHF 1,800 million issued by ZIC (see also note 11). Further, the cash payment as consideration for the public share buyback program in 2023 of CHF 1,580 million has contributed to the decrease.

They amounted to CHF 765 million as of December 31, 2023, and CHF 794 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease is solely due to a negative foreign exchange effect. Furthermore, the Company has issued an unlimited guarantee in favor of the Institute of London Underwriters in relation to a run-off business transferred to Zurich Insurance plc and to ZIC from a Group company which no longer has insurance licenses. On March 27, 2023, the Company has terminated the unlimited guarantee in support of entities belonging to the Zurich Capital Markets group of companies.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any event of default that would require it to satisfy any of these guarantees or to take action under a support agreement.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Share capital\n\n## a) Changes to the share capital\n\nOn April 6, 2023, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company approved a capital band as replacement of the authorized share capital (Art. 5 bis of the Articles of Association). From April 2021 until April 6, 2023, the authorized share capital (former Art. 5 bis of the Articles of Association) was comprised of 44,882,400 shares. The capital band parameters, which are in force since April 6, 2023, until April 6, 2028, are described in section b) below. Since April 2021, the contingent share capital for Financial Instruments (Art. 5 ter 1a of the Articles of Association; term as defined in section b) below) is comprised of 29,921,600 shares. As of December 31, 2023, and as of December 31, 2022, the contingent share capital for Group employees (Art. 5 ter 2a of the Articles of Association) was comprised of 4,095,092 shares. During the years 2023 and 2022, no shares were issued to Group employees out of the contingent share capital.\n\nOn June 7, 2023, the Company completed its public share buyback program of up to CHF 1,800 million that was launched on November 21, 2022. Under this program, the Company repurchased 4,104,413 of its shares, which were subsequently cancelled using the capital band introduced on April 6, 2023, by the AGM. The new share capital of CHF 14,635,575.40 and the new number of shares of 146,355,754 shares were registered in the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich on August 7, 2023. For further information, see the audited consolidated financial statements, note 19 on pages 364 to 372 of this Annual Report.\n\n## b) Capital band (as specified in Article 5 bis of the Articles of Association)\n\nOn April 6, 2023, the AGM approved a capital band as replacement of the authorized share capital. Until and including April 6, 2028, the Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to conduct one or more increases and/or reductions of the share capital within the upper limit of CHF 18,917,751.50, corresponding to 189,177,515 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, and the lower limit of CHF 13,541,415.00, corresponding to 135,414,150 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each. In case of a capital increase, the Board of Directors would determine the number of shares, the date of issue of any such new shares, the issue price, type of contributions (including cash contributions, contributions in kind, set-off and conversion of freely usable reserves, including retained earnings, into share capital), the conditions of exercising subscription rights, and the beginning of the dividend entitlement.\n\nThe Board of Directors may issue such new shares by means of a firm underwriting by a financial institution, a syndicate of financial institutions or another third party and with a subsequent offer of those shares to the current shareholders. The Board of Directors is authorized to restrict or to prohibit trading in the subscription rights to the new shares and may allow the expiry of subscription rights which have not been exercised, or it may place these rights as well as shares, the subscription rights of which have not been exercised, at market conditions, or use them otherwise in the interest of the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors is further authorized to restrict or exclude the subscription rights and to allocate them to individual shareholders, third parties, the Company or one of its group companies for one or more increases up to a maximum of 14,600,000 shares, if the shares are to be used:\n\n- - for the take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise or of participations or for investments by the Company or one of its group companies, or the financing including refinancing of such transactions;\n- - for the purpose of expanding the scope of shareholders in connection with the listing of shares on foreign stock exchanges or issuance of shares on the national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors);\n- - for the conversion of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'Financial Instruments') issued by the Company or one of its group companies; or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of the Company or one of its group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nIn case of a capital reduction, the Board of Directors shall, to the extent necessary, determine the number of shares to be cancelled and the use of the reduction amount. The acquisition and holding of shares repurchased for purposes of cancellation under the capital band are not subject to the 10% threshold for treasury shares within the meaning of art. 659 para. 2 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.\n\nThe Board of Directors is further authorized to carry out a capital increase by increase of the nominal value or a capital reduction by reduction of the nominal value within the capital band or to carry out a simultaneous reduction and re-increase. In the case of an increase or reduction of the nominal value, the Board of Directors shall determine the new nominal value of the shares and shall adapt all provisions of the Articles of Association relating to the nominal value of a share as well as the number of shares with a new nominal value corresponding to the fixed upper and lower limit of the capital band pursuant to art. 5 bis para. 1 accordingly.\n\nUp to April 6, 2028, the total of new shares issued from (i) the capital band where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) the contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,600,000 new shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The subscription rights are excluded. The thencurrent owners of the Financial Instruments shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares. The conversion and/or option conditions are to be determined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is authorized, when issuing Financial Instruments, to restrict or exclude the advance subscription rights in cases where they are issued:\n\n- - for the financing including refinancing of a take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise, of participations, or of investments by the Company or one of its group companies;\n- - on national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of the Company or one of its group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nIf the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded by a resolution of the Board of Directors, the following applies: the Financial Instruments are to be issued at prevailing market conditions (including standard dilution protection clauses in accordance with market practice) and the setting of the conversion or issue price of the new shares must take due account of the stock market price of the shares and/or comparable instruments priced by the market at the time of issue or time of conversion.\n\nThe conversion rights may be exercisable during a maximum of ten years and option rights during a maximum of seven years from the time of the respective issue; contingent conversion features may remain in place indefinitely.\n\nUp to April 6, 2028, the total of new shares issued from (i) the capital band where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) the contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,600,000 new shares.\n\n## Employee participation\n\nOn January 1, 2023, and on January 1, 2022, the contingent share capital, to be issued to Group employees, amounted to CHF 409,509.20 or 4,095,092 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, no shares were issued to Group employees out of the contingent share capital. As of December 31, 2023, and as of December 31, 2022, the remaining contingent share capital available for issuance to Group employees amounted to CHF 409,509.20 or 4,095,092 fully paid-in registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each. Subscription rights as well as advance subscription rights of the shareholders are excluded. The issuance of new shares or respective option rights to employees is subject to one or more regulations to be issued by the Board of Directors and taking into account performance, functions, levels of responsibility and criteria of profitability. New shares or option rights may be issued to employees at a price lower than that quoted on the stock exchange.\n\nFor further information, see Art. 5 bis and 5 ter of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/ articles-of-association).\n\n## 14.

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For the matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report, including in relation to these matters.

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of association, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report.

It indicates the underlying performance, after non-controlling interests, by eliminating the impact of financial market volatility and other non-operational variables. BOP reflects adjustments for shareholders' taxes, net capital gains/(losses) and change in expected credit loss (ECL) allowance on investments (except for certain non-insurance operations included in Non-Core Businesses, investments in hedge funds as at fair value through profit or loss, certain securities held for specific economic hedging purposes, policyholders' share of investment results for the life businesses), amortization of intangible assets acquired in a business combination and non-operational foreign exchange movements. Significant items arising from special circumstances, including restructuring charges, legal matters or large one-off regulatory projects outside the ordinary course of business, gains and losses on divestment of businesses, certain business combination integration costs, impacts from hyperinflation and impairments of goodwill are also excluded from BOP. Please refer to the 'consolidated financial statements, Note 26. Segment information, Table 26.4' for further information.\n\n## Business operating profit (after-tax) return on shareholders' equity (BOPAT ROE)\n\nindicates the level of BOP relative to resources provided by shareholders. It is calculated as BOP, annualized on a linear basis and adjusted for taxes, divided by the average value of shareholders' equity, adjusted for net unrealized gains/(losses) on insurance liabilities and on investments classified as fair value through comprehensive income and cash flow hedges, using the value at the beginning and end of each quarter within the period. The average shareholders' equity for each quarter is then added together and divided by the number of quarters. If the dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting within the first ten working days in April, then the dividend is deducted from the shareholders' equity at the start of the second quarter. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/ROE, EPS and BVPS' for further information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cash remittances\n\nis the net extraction of capital from each of the business units (P&C, Life, Farmers and Non-Core Business) to Group Functions & Operations (GF&O) and after all central costs in GF&O. Cash remittances are typically extracted from subsidiaries by way of dividends, capital reductions, repayment of intragroup debt and reinsurance profits.\n\n## Investments\n\nTotal investments in the consolidated balance sheets include Group investments and investments for unitlinked contracts. Group investments are those for which the Group bears part or all of the investment risk. Average Group investments include investment cash and derivative financial instruments. The Group manages its diversified investment portfolio to optimize benefits for both shareholders and policyholders while ensuring compliance with local regulatory and business requirements under the guidance of the Group's Asset/Liability Management and Investment Committee. Investments for unit-linked contracts include investments where the policyholder bears the investment risk, and are held for liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts and reserves for unit-linked contracts. They are managed in accordance with the investment objectives of each unit-linked fund.\n\n## Like-for-like\n\nis the change in the underlying metric over a period of time and after removing the impact of foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Return on shareholders' equity (ROE)\n\nis a measure that indicates the level of profit or loss relative to resources provided by shareholders. It is calculated as net income after taxes attributable to shareholders, annualized on a linear basis, divided by the average value of shareholders' equity, adjusted for net unrealized gains/(losses) on insurance liabilities and on investments classified as fair value through comprehensive income and cash flow hedges, using the value at the beginning and end of each quarter within the period.

Factors such as (i) general economic conditions and competitive factors, particularly in key markets; (ii) the risk of a global economic downturn, in the financial services industries in particular; (iii) performance of financial markets; (iv) levels of interest rates and currency exchange rates; (v) frequency, severity and development of insured claims events; (vi) mortality and morbidity experience; (vii) policy renewal and lapse rates; (viii) increased litigation activity and regulatory actions; and (ix) changes in laws and regulations and in the policies of regulators may have a direct bearing on the results of operations of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its Group and on whether the targets will be achieved. Specifically in relation with the COVID-19 related statements, such statements were made on the basis of circumstances prevailing at a certain time and on the basis of specific terms and conditions (in particular applicable exclusions) of insurance policies as written and interpreted by the Group and may be subject to regulatory, legislative, governmental and litigation-related developments affecting the extent of potential losses covered by a member of the Group or potentially exposing the Group to additional losses if terms or conditions are retroactively amended by way of legislative or regulatory action. Zurich Insurance Group Ltd undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether to reflect new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise.\n\nAll references to 'Farmers Exchanges' mean Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange, Truck Insurance Exchange and their subsidiaries and affiliates.
