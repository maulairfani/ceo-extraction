        "page_content": "## Supporting our customers in all the ways we can\n\nOur strategy reflects a bolder ambition and our commitment to use the strength of CBA to support our customers, invest in our communities and provide strength and stability for the broader economy.\n\nWe recognise that many Australians are feeling under pressure in the current environment. As the nation's largest bank, we will continue to help and support our customers. This includes helping them save on everyday expenses, navigate a changing economic environment and plan for the future.\n\nFor our retail and home loan customers, we introduced flexible features to make it easier to manage repayments and save on interest. We also increased the rates on a number of our savings products and provided budgeting and spending tools in the CommBank app. For our business banking customers, we helped maximise cash flow with a new short notice deposit account and made it easier for them to obtain funding through digital investment and process improvements. We remain ready to help our customers with financial assistance for those who need it.\n\nWe have also prioritised combatting the rise in scams and fraud, helping customers stay safe through early detection and prevention. We announced two new initiatives to protect customers from scams: NameCheck, designed to help customers avoid mistaken payments; and CallerCheck, which allows customers to verify a caller and identify themselves safely through the CommBank app. Since launch, NameCheck has helped more than 11,000 customers avoid\n\npotential mistaken payments through flagging unrecognised account details. We recognise that the system is only as safe as its weakest link, so we are planning to make the NameCheck technology available to government organisations and other trusted partners, encouraging a broader national approach to fight scams and fraud.\n\n## Executing our strategy\n\nWe continue to execute our strategy of building tomorrow's bank today for our customers. Our strategy reflects a bolder ambition and our commitment to use the strength of CBA to support our customers, invest in our communities and provide strength and stability for the broader economy.\n\nWith 35% of Australian consumers and 25% of Australian businesses naming us their main financial institution, deep customer relationships are a key differentiator. Our considered multi-decade investment in technology, data and analytics capabilities has resulted in high customer engagement enabling us to better understand their needs and provide the best banking experience.\n\nThe Bank's Customer Engagement Engine, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), is one of the key tools we are using to deliver more personalised and relevant experiences to our customers digitally, and empower our customer-facing teams\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto do the same. With 7.8 million customers using our CommBank app, AI-enabled features like Bill Sense and Benefits finder are playing an important role in giving customers greater visibility and control of their money to help tackle cost of living challenges. We recently launched a new version of the CommBank app, app 5.0, which provides dynamic navigation, more personalisation and further integration with CommSec. It has also been built to enable us to offer customers more enhancements at a faster pace in the future.\n\nCBA's strategic investment in business banking, and focus on strengthening customer relationships, has resulted in growing our customer base to over one million customers. We continue to work towards being a leading business bank, and are focused on delivering superior customer experiences for both our retail and business customers.\n\n- Learn more about our strategic priorities on pages 8-17.\n\n## Beyond the APRA Prudential Inquiry Remedial Action Plan\n\nWe made significant progress under CBA's Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) Prudential Inquiry Remedial Action Plan, focused on improving our governance, culture and accountability. Importantly, we reset our cultural foundations including the Bank's purpose and values.\n\nThe changes represent an evolution in the way we want to deliver outcomes for our customers, communities, our people and shareholders.\n\nIn recognition of this progress, the remaining operational risk capital overlay of $500 million imposed on the Bank was released by APRA in September 2022. We are focused on sustaining this progress and continuously improving and strengthening the changes made to live our purpose and values, in particular instilling a strong culture that encourages the right mindsets and behaviours.\n\nThis approach continues to resonate with our people, and overall engagement remains high at 79%, with continuing high levels of pride across the organisation.\n\n- Learn more about our culture ambitions on pages 25-26.\n\n## Progressing our sustainability agenda\n\nWe continue to embed our sustainability commitments and priorities into the Bank's strategy and risk management practices to create long-term value for our stakeholders. This year we reviewed our Environmental and Social (E&S) policy settings and updated our E&S Framework. We also performed an environmental, social and governance materiality assessment to identify stakeholder priorities for us to consider and support decision making.\n\nWe welcome legislative and policy initiatives that help guide industry and communities to meet Australia's ambitious climate targets and encourage investment to support Australia's transition to a net zero economy. We are committed to working closely with communities, businesses, industry leaders and governments to encourage a holistic approach to emissions reductions. By bringing stakeholders together, we can share knowledge and collectively address the challenges associated with the transition to a more sustainable future.\n\n- Read our 2023 Climate Report.\n\n## Ensuring good governance\n\nUpholding a high standard of governance is essential in delivering on both our strategic and sustainability goals. Our approach sets the foundation for the way we conduct business and deliver outcomes.\n\nThe Board and management are focused on testing CBA's strategic settings to ensure they remain appropriate in our current context. We look for ways to improve customer experiences and advocacy, by investing in key areas such as cyber security and scams and fraud.\n\n- Learn more about our corporate governance practices on pages 66-73.\n\n## Strong results\n\nOur results demonstrate our continued focus on supporting our customers, investing in our communities, and providing strength and stability for the broader economy. Our operating performance reflected strong volume growth and an increase in the Group's net interest margin. With tighter and rapidly changing financial conditions we have taken a prudent approach to managing risks including credit, interest rate, funding and liquidity risks.\n\nOur conservative balance sheet is a highlight of our result and provides flexibility to navigate uncertainty and support our customers while delivering sustainable returns. We declared a final dividend of $2.40 per share, fully franked, resulting in a full year dividend of $4.50.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Australian economy has been resilient with the tailwinds of a recovery in population growth, relatively high commodity prices and low unemployment. However there are signs of downside risks building as rising interest rates have a lagged impact on mortgage customers and other cost of living pressures become a financial strain for more Australians.\n\nWe will continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy to deliver our purpose of building a brighter future for all.\n\nOn behalf of all the Board and Executive Leadership Team, we would like to thank all our people for their hard work and commitment - and to you, our shareholders, for your ongoing support.\n\nPaul O'Malley Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatt Comyn Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Leadership in Australia's recovery and transition\n\nSupporting our customers and the nation to help build a brighter, more sustainable future, together.\n\nMillions of Australians trust CBA with their savings, and we aim to be their trusted financial partner. At a time when many are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living, we remain committed to supporting our customers financially impacted by the current environment.\n\nWe proactively contacted customers whose fixed-rate home loans were maturing to discuss their needs and help them understand their options. Through targeted communications we were able to provide personalised support, flexibility and financial assistance. We also increased interest rates across a number of our savings products and helped customers better manage their finances through tips and guidance, as well as budgeting and spending tools in the CommBank app. Benefits finder is one of a number of digital tools to help customers offset the rising cost of living. Since inception, it has connected customers to over $1 billion in benefits, rebates and concessions. In New Zealand, ASB scaled-up their use of behavioural nudges to help customers make positive changes and feel more in control of their finances. Over 220,000 ASB customers have taken positive actions to improve their financial wellbeing as a result of these nudges.\n\nCBA's continued balance sheet strength and conservative approach to funding means we are well placed to support our customers as financial conditions tighten, while still delivering sustainable returns to shareholders.\n\n- Learn more about how we are supporting our customers and communities on pages 30-35.\n\n17.1m\n\ncustomers served 1\n\n$1bn+\n\nin savings through Benefits finder\n\n## $200m+\n\nprotected for customers through our scams prevention and detection program\n\n- 1  See Glossary on pages 290-303 for source information.\n\n## Extending our retail and business banking leadership\n\nStrong customer relationships form the foundation of our retail bank. With 35% of all Australians naming CBA as their main financial institution, our strategy is centred on deepening and strengthening customer relationships through superior experiences and better personalisation. We have also applied this focus in our business bank, strengthening business banking relationships and growing our business customer base to over one million customers.\n\nThe Bank's strategic investments in business banking over the past three years have resulted in strong customer engagement, deepening relationships and earnings growth. One in four businesses now consider CBA to be their main financial institution. Our business banking approach is relationship-led with business transaction accounts and payments at the centre of that relationship. From these relationships, we gain unique customer insights and can build deeper customer relationships through our product and service offerings.\n\nWith transaction banking at the core of the business banking relationship, continually evolving our payments and merchant acquiring offerings remains a focus. This year we launched a range of new smart terminals including the Smart Mini (portable tap'n'go solution) and Smart Integrated (point-of-sale integrated solution) - with over 70,000 devices currently in market. These new devices allow us to build bespoke industry solutions, with a particular focus on health care and hospitality. We also released an end-to-end ecommerce proposition, PowerBoard, to provide merchants with access to multiple payment methods through a simple solution that will help them start, run and grow their business online.\n\nWe recognise cash flow is key for our business customers, especially in the current economic environment. The Capital Growth Account, our new short notice deposit account, will help business customers maximise their cash flow by allowing them to earn interest at the same time as being able to withdraw funds, with just 48 hours or seven days' notice.\n\nFor both our retail and business customers, we are focused on fixing service issues that lead to poor customer experiences and reimagining our critical customer processes. We aim for each customer interaction to be exceptional - whether it be digital, in branch, through a contact centre or relationship manager.\n\n- Learn more about how we are creating value for customers on pages 12-14.\n\n## Helping build Australia's future economy\n\nWe remain committed to helping Australia transition to a more digital, resilient and sustainable economy. We do this by lending to support the transformation of industries, as well as to support key sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, transport, healthcare, retail and wholesale trade. We also provide a range of innovative products, services and solutions that reward our customers for making more environmentally sustainable choices.\n\nWe are focused on supporting customers as they transition their business models to deliver on their decarbonisation goals and net zero by 2050 commitments. Nature-based emissions reduction solutions are expected to play an important role in Australia's transition to a net zero economy by 2050. Our carbon markets team enables financing and risk management solutions across global carbon markets that support our customers to achieve their climate goals.\n\n- Learn more about our commitment to support Australia's transition to a net zero economy on pages 22-23.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Combatting cybercrime, scams and fraud in the Australian community\n\nThere is always more to do to protect and educate our customers, given the rising volume and fast changing nature of scams and fraud. We are committed to playing our part to address this national priority alongside leading businesses, government, and the broader community. For more information on how we are helping protect customers, their data and our systems, see:\n\n- Our strategy - pages 12-17.\n- Our customers - page 30-33.\n- Governance - pages 36-39.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assisting with nature-based solutions\n\nMore agribusinesses are exploring opportunities to advance their environmental goals while improving farm assets, productivity and profitability. This year, we supported future carbon credits that will be generated by a carbon credit project in Western Australia. The transaction supports the purchase of pastoral leases for cattle stations, to help the properties remain productive while also seeking to deliver better carbon and environmental outcomes. The Australian Carbon Credit Units will be delivered over a five-year period, further supporting a growing Australian carbon market.\n\n- Learn more about carbon markets at commbank.com.au/carbonmarkets\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continually look to strengthen these relationships, by reimagining banking to deliver superior and more personalised customer experiences.\n\nOur ambition is to deliver a superior digital experience, beyond just digital banking - equal to or better than any other. The Bank's sustained investment in technology underpins our digital leadership and supports our ambition. We continue to grow digital engagement with 8.7 million digitally active customers - over a million more than two years ago - and our digital transactions account for 75% of total transactions by value. This strong engagement provides unique insights that help us better understand our customers and how we can support them.\n\nWe look to build deeper, more trusted customer relationships, better understand customer needs and risk, and deliver a superior experience by advancing and uplifting our existing infrastructure and people.\n\n8.7m\n\ndigitally active customers 1\n\n## #1\n\nbanking app in Australia 1\n\n## #1\n\nconsumer mobile app NPS 1\n\n- 1  See Glossary on pages 290-303 for source information.\n\n## Reimagined products and services\n\nWe aim to give customers more value from their banking relationship with us. Through personalisation and distinct propositions, we look to keep meeting the needs of our retail and business customers as they evolve over time.\n\n## CommBank app 5.0\n\nThe CommBank app is central to our customer approach. With 7.8 million users, it is the #1 banking app in Australia - and for many customers, continues to be their preferred channel. Harnessing bank data and insights on what customers want from a digital banking experience, app 5.0 provides dynamic navigation, more personalisation and further integration with CommSec. It has also been built to enable us to deliver more enhancements to customers at a faster pace in the future.\n\n## Key features include:\n\n## Automatic login\n\nFaster experience by securely logging in as soon as the app opens.\n\n## Quick links\n\nPersonalised navigation tiles based on customer's in-app behaviour (e.g. frequently visited).\n\n## App library and enhanced search\n\nSimplified catalogue of app features, products and services, as well as improved app-wide search functionality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about the CommBank app 5.0 at commbank.com.au/app\n\n## Business profile switching\n\nSwitch option allows business customers to easily toggle between business and personal accounts.\n\n## New investing functionality\n\nEnables users to browse and invest in Australian shares and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).\n\n## Expanded simple balances\n\nAbility to see current balance of up to three accounts on homepage.\n\nC R E A T I N G V A L U E\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Enabling customers to achieve their financial goals\n\nWe know our customers are looking for ways to save money and manage their finances. CBA's Behavioural Science Centre of Excellence specialises in analysing data, working with research partners and developing new tools and services to help customers achieve their financial goals.\n\nMoney Plan, Spend Tracker, Bill Sense and Goal Tracker in the CommBank app can help customers stay on top of their financial decisions, understand where their money is being spent, see upcoming bills and set and reach their savings goals. Data from our app shows that 3.2 million customers use one or more of our money management tools in the app each month - 51% higher than the same time last year. We are making these tools even easier for customers to find in the new version of the app.\n\nWe are also helping customers put money back in their pockets with shopping offers and cashback, and through the use of tools like Fuel finder and Benefits finder. Building on our AI and machine learning capabilities, we are improving customer engagement and value by increasing the level of personalisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating more value by di/fferentiating our customer proposition\n\nIn response to customers' shifting needs and expectations, we continue to evolve and improve our offerings - through personal banking, business banking and investing.\n\nWe recognise the importance of providing a consistent experience for customers no matter which part of the Bank they are dealing with. Our new profile switch option in the app allows small business customers to easily toggle between their business and personal accounts. With the majority of our small business customers also being personal customers of CBA, profile switching will give them a much clearer view of their business banking products, while also enabling us to provide them with a range of in-app insights specific to their business. Similarly, the integration of CommSec into the app provides investors with a seamless investment experience, giving customers the ability to manage their investments alongside their banking.\n\nWe also continue to offer customers more value through strategic relationships. Our telecommunications referral relationship with fast-growing broadband provider More, gives customers access to broadband offers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping customers stay safe online\n\nWe are continuing our investment in technology to protect our customers, as well as providing the tools and resources to empower Australians to stay safe online.\n\n## New security features\n\nThis year we launched a new app feature, CallerCheck, which allows customers to verify whether a caller claiming to be from CBA is legitimate. By triggering a security message, customers can confirm who is calling them and quickly identify themselves before sharing sensitive information.\n\nWe also introduced NameCheck in NetBank, the CommBank app and progressively to CommBiz payments. The feature uses AI to search account details and check if the customer is paying the intended recipient, helping reduce false billing scams and mistaken payments. Since launch, NameCheck has prevented over $11 million in mistaken payments. The NameCheck capability will be o/ffered to government organisations and other trusted partners to support a broader national approach to combat scams and fraud.\n\n## Joining forces to better protect customers\n\nIn partnership with Telstra, we have been piloting Scam Indicator to help protect joint CBA and Telstra customers from phone scams. Using a machine-learning scams detection model, the tool is designed to detect certain high-risk scam situations in real time, enabling us to try to contact the customer or put in additional checks. Scam Indicator is expected to be made available to customers later this year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global best digital experiences and technology\n\nWe are using data, AI, technology and world-class engineering to enable better personalisation and provide a differentiated customer proposition.\n\n## Building world-class engineering, data and AI capability\n\nTechnology plays a critical role in anticipating and solving unmet customer needs. For more than a decade, we have been driving personalisation and improving customer experiences and processes.\n\n## Becoming an AI-first bank\n\nSince 2016 our Customer Engagement Engine has transformed the way we engage with customers. With over 1,000 machine learning models and using 157 billion data points, it helps serve our customers with next best conversations and service across all channels - including the CommBank app. Our partnership with H2O.ai has further accelerated how we design, build, test, deploy and govern AI models across the Bank. It provides CBA with access to exceptional world-leading talent and is helping us empower those who are serving customers every day with better tools and capability.\n\nWe want to ensure every team across the bank has AI capability embedded, to help deliver more personalised experiences for our customers. By embedding AI across CBA, our employees will benefit from a reduced administrative burden and our customers will benefit from the enhanced personalisation it delivers. We are creating a world-class engineering environment with improved tools, education and innovation opportunities. Training has been provided to more than 300 employees to make sure we are safely and securely deploying AI across the organisation. This year we hired over 1,400 engineers and 219 technology graduates. We also have Technology Hubs in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth to help attract domestic talent.\n\nOver the last year, we have leveraged our AI capabilities to enhance scams and fraud detection and prevention - improving our detection of card-not-present fraud by 35%, which we anticipate will prevent an additional $10 million of fraud losses for our customers every year.\n\n## Modernising our systems and digitising end-to-end\n\nCBA's technology capabilities facilitate the effective delivery of our strategy by driving velocity, availability, efficiency and security. We are continuously improving how we work to deliver improved products and services better and faster, while being supported by modern technology and infrastructure. As part of our technology simplification and to keep up with the pace of change, we continue to upgrade, replace and modernise legacy platforms. Ongoing automation of our Application Programming Interfaces also drives efficiencies and strengthens our security environment.\n\nAbove all else, the security of our systems and data is integral to delivering on our promises. System resilience is central to retaining our customer's trust and we continue to focus on ensuring our systems operate securely and seamlessly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Using AI responsibly\n\nOur focus has always been on making sure we safely and responsibly scale the use of AI across CBA. In 2019 we were one of a small number of organisations that partnered with the Australian Government to help draft the Australian AI Ethics Principles, which informed our own AI policies and frameworks.\n\nOur AI policy builds on CBA's 'Should We?' test and introduces six AI principles: Human, social & environmental wellbeing; Fairness; Transparency; Privacy & security; Reliability & safety; and Accountability. We spend considerable time with regulators to test how we identify, assess and manage risk - AI being one of these risk types. Importantly, where we implement AI, the Bank needs to assess that the model or the automated process is significantly better than the model or the task it replaces.\n\nWe see opportunity for AI and machine learning to help us do better. Making sure we are safely and securely deploying AI across the organisation every day, is central to our technology strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Simpler, better foundations\n\nKeeping the Bank strong and safe, and making it easier for our people to get things done.\n\nWe manage the organisation conservatively to ensure that we are well prepared for a wide range of economic scenarios to support the Australian and New Zealand economy, and our customers and communities.\n\nOur prudent approach to managing credit, interest rate, funding and liquidity risks - and our continued balance sheet strength and capital position - creates flexibility to provide support and manage potential economic headwinds. We remain focused on maintaining capital and pricing discipline, while looking to reduce costs where possible and optimise growth, reinvestment and returns.\n\nOur efforts have been centred on uplifting our risk management capability to ensure we are delivering the right customer experience and always asking 'Should We?'. To deliver an even better end-to-end customer experience, we are focused on simplifying our processes and safeguarding our digital systems.\n\n## Driving operational excellence\n\nBuilding trust requires that we put our customers' interests first, are easy to deal with and provide relevant and secure services.\n\nOur customers' expectations are constantly evolving. Operational excellence is key to serving our customers well every day, and meeting their needs now and into the future. It requires ongoing focus to not only get the basics right, but to ensure we deliver a seamless experience end-to-end, by identifying and fixing complex or time consuming processes related to our services or operations. Fixes may include reducing rework rates, improving time-to-decisions or challenging existing policies to simplify our processes.\n\nWe know customers are impacted by downtime or security threats, both of which negatively impact their experience. The resilience and availability of our systems - as well as the ability to recover from any incident rapidly - is vital. While we continue to enhance our resilience strategy, we also need to sustain change and remain relevant for our customers.\n\nSimplification is centred on streamlining, standardising and digitising our most important processes. It incorporates a wide range of activities, including product rationalisation, policy simplification, end-to-end technology simplification and process design excellence. These activities remove complexity that makes it difficult for customers and our people to get things done. For example, we enhanced our Know Your Customer (KYC) process, to enable better digital fulfilment and remove the need to visit a branch or receive outbound calls.\n\n- Learn more about how we are providing better end-to-end experiences on page 32.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustaining leading risk management\n\nTransparent and leading risk management is about understanding different perspectives and using appropriate judgement to mitigate risk and deliver better outcomes for shareholders and customers. Through the completion of our program of work arising from the 2018 Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) Prudential Inquiry into CBA, we have made significant progress in improving and sustaining our governance, accountability and risk culture frameworks and practices. In recognition of this progress, the remaining operational risk capital overlay of $500 million was released by APRA in September 2022. We are focused on sustaining this progress and continuously improving on and strengthening the changes made.\n\nCBA's Risk Management Approach sets out the Board and Executive Leadership Team's expectations regarding how we identify, measure, monitor and respond to our risks. Our risk behaviours in particular require us to support constructive debate and challenge of our risks and controls, adhere to the Code of Conduct, including asking 'Should We?', and share our learnings so that we can deliver better customer outcomes. The Board Risk Culture Assessment allows the Board to form a view of the Group's risk culture and identify desirable changes that will instil an appropriate risk culture.\n\n- Learn more about our approach to managing risk on pages 60-65.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Committing to cyber security\n\nSafeguarding our customers' personal information through strong cyber security has never been more important.\n\nAustralians, many of them CBA customers, are concerned about the safety of their personal details following the recent cyber attacks on large organisations. We have an obligation to keep customer and sensitive information secure and protected. We continue to educate our customers about cyber risks and are dedicated to keeping our systems safe, sound and secure.\n\nCyber security is changing and involves working collaboratively and innovatively to prepare for potential attacks and combat them when they arise. To keep up with the advancement of cyber threats, we consult global experts, run regular internal exercises and participate in industry-wide exercises, coordinating with a number of government and regulatory stakeholders. We also recently provided a comprehensive response to the Federal Government's 2023-2030 Cyber Security Strategy discussion paper to help Australia's national cyber response.\n\nDuring the year, we have taken several actions to further improve our cyber security capability and ability to manage cyber security-related risks. This includes expanding our capabilities to defend against malware and assess the security of our system configurations, strengthening our management of system access, and enhancing the threat protection to CBA's network.\n\n## Cyber security objectives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRight people, right access\n\nDefending our systems\n\nProtecting our people and customers' information\n\n- Learn more about cyber security and data privacy on page 38.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year we reviewed our Environmental and Social (E&S) Framework to update our position and commitments relating to financing of certain sectors after engaging with stakeholders.\n\nWe also performed an environmental, social and governance (ESG) materiality assessment to identify stakeholder priorities for us to consider in how we conduct business. The results of this assessment will support focused decision making and allow us to deliver on our purpose of building a brighter future for all our stakeholders. It also enables us to better understand how we can align with and positively deliver on the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n- See our E&S Framework at commbank.com.au/policies\n\n## Engaging with stakeholders\n\nWe recognise the importance of building trusted relationships with stakeholders to achieve our purpose. Our diverse stakeholder groups provide valuable insight through their different perspectives. CBA's stakeholder engagement approach ensures our engagement is conducted responsibly when we interact with customers, communities, government, political parties, industry associations, regulators, investors and suppliers.\n\nWe engage with our customers and the community through feedback channels, surveys and workshops, customer representative bodies, and community visits and programs. This year we sought customer feedback on the development of the refreshed CommBank app, which helped inform a number of improvements and new features - including the ability to trade shares directly through the app. We also used feedback to identify and fix customer service issues.\n\nOur dedicated Customer and Community Advocacy team represents the voice of the customer and community at the Bank, helping us find and fix negative impacts and improve our products and services. We engage with them through our Community Council and regular community visits.\n\nCBA's government, regulatory, procurement and investor relations teams proactively engage with their stakeholders to build constructive relationships and understand their issues and expectations.\n\nWe continue to explore ways to improve how we share stakeholder insights across the Bank and demonstrate how this process informs our strategy and actions. This year, detailed materiality assessment findings were shared with internal teams for consideration.\n\n## Identifying our material themes\n\nOur materiality assessment enables us to engage with stakeholders and identify topics with the potential to most impact the Australian people, community and environment. It also helps us better understand the Bank's ability to influence these impacts - directly or indirectly. Our process draws on external frameworks and resources, such as the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and the International Integrated Reporting Framework.\n\nThe material themes identified this year are aligned to the themes we reported in 2022. In 2023, key changes in topics included the rising cost of living pressures; increases in cybercrime, scams and fraud; and the ongoing need to provide excellent customer experiences.\n\nOur materiality assessment follows a multi-step process - including issue identification through desk research and interviews, stakeholder identification, and topic validation and prioritisation. This year's information sources included engagement with key internal and external stakeholders, as well as consideration of political and regulatory developments and global research reports.\n\n## Our materiality process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Identifying ESG topics\n\n- \u00b7  Creating a topic list by reviewing key stakeholder sources.\n- \u00b7  Identifying key stakeholders for engagement.\n- \u00b7  Understanding which topics matter most through qualitative interviews with internal and external stakeholders.\n- \u00b7  Analysing and shortlisting topics, using frequency of mention in identification of topics.\n\n## Analysing, validating and prioritising topics\n\n- \u00b7  Validating and prioritising shortlisted topics with guidance from internal subject matter experts.\n- \u00b7  Rating topics with consideration of their potential to impact on the Australian people, community and environment; and whether CBA could influence the impact, positively or negatively.\n\n## Disclosure and review\n\n- \u00b7  Grouping similar topics into material themes and sharing findings with internal teams.

        "page_content": "## Environmental\n\nUnderstanding how environmental issues could impact our business and how our business activities can impact the environment, helps inform us on how to make a positive change.\n\n## Our position on climate change\n\nClimate change is a collective global challenge requiring coordinated action to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Our net zero by 2050 ambition is to transition our operational and financed emissions to align with pathways to net zero by 2050. We are progressively setting operational and sector-level financed emissions targets in line with pathways that aim to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. We remain committed to managing the risks and opportunities of climate change and supporting our customers.\n\nAustralia's electricity grid remains reliant on coal-fired electricity generation. Rapidly replacing this generation with renewables is one of our nation's greatest medium-term transition challenges and opportunities. Reducing the emissions intensity of the electricity grid is also a key driver to lower emissions in other sectors, including the largest sector in our portfolio - Australian housing. Australia's electricity grid is key to achieving the nation's and our own emission reduction ambitions.\n\nOur role is to support the financing of a secure, affordable energy transition. Our lending portfolio will continue to be influenced by the production and energy mix of Australia's grid as it changes over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor definitions of key words and phrases used in this section, such as financed emissions, see Glossary on pages 290-303.\n\n## Our climate strategy\n\nLast year, we released our inaugural Climate Report reaffirming our support for Australia's transition to net zero emissions by 2050. We also outlined our transition roadmap for progressively setting sector-level targets on our financed emissions. This year, we have made progress against our transition roadmap, including setting new sector-level targets for Australian housing and heavy industry, using scenarios which are aligned to limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe aim to support Australia's climate change goals and help finance a secure, affordable energy transition. This includes lending to sectors and businesses that will be integral to Australia's energy transition. To help direct our lending and financing activities, we apply our E&S Framework, set sector-level financed emissions targets and strategies aligned to 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, and have a Sustainability Funding Target (SFT). We want to help our customers navigate to a net zero economy by 2050 and build resilience. We aim to do this by developing new products and services, and partnering with others.\n\n## Governance\n\nProviding effective governance of environmental issues enables the Board to monitor the Bank's management of climate-related risks and opportunities for our stakeholders. The Board is responsible for the strategic consideration of the E&S impact of the Bank's activities, and holds the CEO and Executive Leadership Team (ELT) accountable for the delivery of E&S responsibilities. During the year, we updated our E&S Framework and refined our approach to assessing certain Clients' Transition Plans. In March, we established a new transaction-level committee in our Institutional Bank which reviews certain transactions in fossil fuel sectors.\n\n## Risk\n\nClimate-related risks can have different impacts on our customers, people, communities and the Bank. Our risk management approach seeks to ensure we understand and address the risks to our operations and strategy. We have a range of tools and processes to help us do this, and will continue to manage and monitor these risks as they evolve. This year, we finalised the stranded asset Risk Appetite Statement indicator for the agriculture portfolio and the non-retail institutional banking portfolio.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nWe set targets and track progress related to our climate strategy. We measure and report our financed emissions, aligned to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials Standard. Our SFT of $70 billion in cumulative funding by 2030 helps us as we seek to support sustainable industries and asset types. As at 30 June 2023, we provided $44.7 billion in cumulative funding towards our target.\n\n- For more information see our 2023 Climate Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our own operations\n\nWe aim to reduce our operational emissions to address the environmental impacts of our operations.\n\nWe have made significant progress to reduce the impacts of our operational footprint with a 95% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to 2014. We also purchased the equivalent of 100% renewable electricity for our Group-wide operations in 2022. This year the increase in our Scope 3 emissions is primarily attributable to increased emissions from business travel, as operating conditions normalised post-COVID-19; and the inclusion of new Scope 3 emissions categories, such as employees commuting to work.\n\nWe aim to incorporate leading sustainable design principles across energy, water, indoor air quality and waste in our o/ffice refurbishments. For example, to reduce our impact we use recycled water and limit chemical usage at our main Sydney corporate o/ffices.\n\n## Understanding natural capital\n\nWe recognise the importance of taking action to maintain, enhance and restore biodiversity. This year, we used the ENCORE platform to deepen our understanding of potential naturerelated impacts and dependencies in our business and corporate lending portfolio. Agriculture and mining are our priority natural capital sectors due to their high dependency and impact on natural resources.\n\nOur priority remains to prepare for increased environmental reporting. The barriers to reporting remain high due to data limitations, nascent methodologies and customer confidentiality considerations. We welcome the Australian Government's Nature Positive Plan's commitment to establish national environmental standards to guide decision making.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The changes represent an evolution in the way we want to deliver outcomes for customers, communities and each other.\n\nThis year, we prioritised strengthening mindsets, behaviours, processes and practices that put our customers at the centre of everything we do.\n\nTo create a strong culture, we recognise that change needs to occur simultaneously at three levels: organisational (ways of working, systems and structures), team (practices and social norms), and individual (mindsets and behaviours).\n\nOur Organisational Culture Plan harnesses programs of work to drive culture change, including risk culture, at all three levels. These include making it easier for our people to deliver the highest impact work for our customers, by supporting all teams to understand the impact of their work on our customers' experience; helping people strive for simpler, better solutions by continually adapting and learning; and embedding a new way to lead.\n\nOur Leadership Principles are a key element of our culture plan, describing both what to prioritise and what is required to lead successfully at CBA. Embedded throughout the organisation, the principles are intentionally aspirational and aimed at provoking fundamental shifts to mindsets and behaviours.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key phases of our approach to organisational culture development\n\n## Phase 1: Design and implement\n\nEmbraced the APRA Prudential Inquiry Report's cultural recommendations and developed an action plan to build a better bank.\n\n## Phase 2: Define and embed\n\nEmbedded and sustained the outcomes of our action plan, while accelerating culture change.\n\n## Phase 3 (we are here): Evolve and mature\n\nContinue to mature, assess and evolve our culture to ensure we keep pace with CBA's changing internal and external context.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board plays a critical role in setting the cultural tone of the Bank and it guides culture through the CEO and ELT.\n\nCulture change initiatives are continually monitored using insights from employee surveys, strategic metrics and focus groups, as well as audit and whistleblower reports. Our culture assessments\n\ninclude the Organisational Culture Assessment, Board Risk Culture Assessment, targeted risk culture reviews and business unit self-reflections. This enables a cyclical process of assessment, action planning, implementation and re-assessment to support a customer-focused culture that delivers on our strategy and purpose.\n\n## Evolving our culture to deliver on our purpose and strategy\n\nCBA's culture is built on the foundation of our refreshed Code of Conduct, which includes our values and 'Should We?' test.

The results support a continued focus on CBA's values and purpose; diversity, equity and inclusion; and flexible working options as drivers of engagement and our people's experience. Important factors in delivering CBA's strategic priorities included stopping least impactful work, supporting our people's wellbeing at work, and providing new skilling opportunities. These factors have been shared across the Bank to ensure ongoing improvement.\n\nWe encourage employees to have regular, motivating and developmentfocused conversations with their leaders. Check-in conversations occur quarterly to regularly reflect on performance, reset goals, and establish meaningful development opportunities for the next quarter.\n\nOur recognition programs celebrate colleagues who are living our values, and allow our people to nominate those who have gone above and beyond for Excellence Awards, including a People's Choice Award. This year's People's Choice Award 'Backing Good Judgement' was selected to recognise those who exemplify our values by demonstrating the ability and willingness to apply careful judgement and take on the right risks that prioritise good customer outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Prioritising mental health and wellness\n\nWe are committed to creating a positive and supportive workplace which helps our people be their best. This includes creating a mentally healthy workplace where our culture is supportive for those experiencing mental ill-health and provides our people opportunities to thrive.\n\nWe provide employees with tools and resources to support their physical and mental wellbeing. This includes health, nutrition and fitness sessions, money management tools, mental health guides and access to professional support. We also run an annual Wellness Awareness Week to encourage positive habits.\n\nTo better understand and support the mental health and wellbeing of CBA's workforce, we conducted our first Leading Mentally Healthy Workplaces Survey, led by the Corporate Mental Health Alliance Australia. The insights from this survey will be used to inform employee programs and offerings. We continue to improve our health and safety systems to better identify and manage psychosocial risk, work-related factors that can impact the psychological health and safety of employees, including how work is designed, organised and managed.\n\n## Helping through challenging times\n\nWith the rising cost of living, we are committed to looking after the financial wellbeing of our people.\n\nCBA's Wellbeing Hub contains resources to help employees better manage their finances, such as our workbook - Financial Wellbeing for Our People. The workbook provides simple steps and tools to help build confidence in managing money. Monthly webinars cover topics such as budgeting, saving, using employee benefits, controlling debt, and estate planning.\n\nWe provide several employee benefits which can help reduce expenses. For example, staff deals offering discounts on retail products and services; pay advance options for employees struggling to meet everyday expenses; and other savings and benefits. Our Financial Assistance Solutions team can help tailor personalised solutions for our customers and employees. Our Employee Assistance Program also has financial coaches to help those experiencing or anticipating financial difficulty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is an important part of how we live our values and support each other to be our best.\n\nWith a strategic focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, we are working towards ensuring that employees who are at risk of exclusion feel safe and are able to access the support they need, when they need it, harmful behaviours are prevented and addressed at work and everyone feels valued and has opportunities to grow.\n\nWe continue to embed Respect Lives Here, our key initiative to strengthen respect and prevent harmful behaviours at work, by educating our people on the impact of these behaviours and how to be an active bystander. Quarterly Inclusion Conversations encourage senior leaders to reflect on equitable decision-making and help our people to succeed. In addition, our six employee-led networks play a vital role in creating an inclusive culture, by elevating the voices of our people to ensure their experience at work is heard.\n\nAs one of the first organisations to be certified as a Family Friendly Workplace, we are proud to be recognised for the depth and breadth of support options we provide for families and carers. This includes a diversity of leave options, such as Sorry Business leave, workplace support for domestic and family violence, resources for LGBTI+ families, aged caring support, wellbeing guides for new and single parents, and guides to assist with navigating miscarriage, stillbirth and infant loss.\n\n## Our diversity goals and impact\n\nWe continue to make progress on our diversity goals. We aim for 47-50% gender equality in Executive Manager and above roles, and for our senior leaders to match the cultural diversity of the Australian population by 2025. We also target 3% Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander representation in our domestic workforce, to reflect parity with the Australian population.\n\nWe are proud to be included in the global 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), which recognises our commitment to transparency in gender reporting. The GEI is our primary gender equality benchmarking source to measure our performance against global best practice in five areas: leadership and talent pipeline, equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and external brand.\n\nWomen in leadership\n\n## 44%\n\nin Executive Manager and above roles\n\n47-50%\n\n2025 goal\n\nIndigenous workforce (ancestry)\n\n1%\n\nof domestic workforce\n\n3%\n\n2026 goal\n\n## A/ffirming our ways of working\n\nWe know how important it is for our people to maintain flexibility in where and how they work. This must also be balanced with the important role the workplace plays in facilitating connection, innovation, learning, wellbeing and career development.\n\nTo support our people to deliver and achieve the right balance of connection, learning and flexibility; we have a Group-wide approach to provide consistency and clarity for all our people who work in our corporate offices. Employees are expected to be in the office for 50% of their work time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe're operating in di/fferent sectors requiring a wide variety of skills and abilities and therefore are able to o/ffer di/fferent careers which you would not normally associate with a bank.'\n\n## Sian Lewis\n\nGroup Executive, Human Resources\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building a skilled workforce\n\nOur focus is to maximise the development of capability across the organisation through a culture where people want to continually learn and develop.\n\nOur approach to upskilling and reskilling focuses on the technical, behavioural and leadership skills required to deliver on our strategy and ensure our people are ready for the future of work.\n\nWe recognise that the way people learn has changed, so we continue to evolve how our people grow and build new skills through a variety of digital, face-to-face, on the job and peer-to-peer learning modalities. In addition to upskilling initiatives that build breadth and depth of skills within roles, reskilling has continued to be a focus this year - allowing our people to find new, sustainable career paths and evolve skills in our existing workforce. These programs include recognised certification and building internal talent pipelines, largely within high demand areas such as data and analytics. Since inception, over half of those who have attended a program have successfully secured a new role.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expanding our technology graduate program\n\nWe are significantly expanding our technology graduate intake and have hired 219 new technology graduates in 2023 - more than 280% higher compared to our 2020 intake. 38% of these graduates are based in our technology hubs outside of Sydney. The program is designed to build the technical capability and core career skills for the future, with a focus on three key technology pathways: cyber security, data science and engineering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## You x CommBank\n\nAs part of our new talent attraction campaign, You x CommBank, we are inviting successful candidates to become our partners.

We are committed to supporting those customers that need assistance and providing a series of tools, tips and guidance to help with managing finances.\n\nLessons learned from the financial impacts of COVID-19 have helped us better understand our customers, and segment and tailor our approach for different needs. This helps us identify changes that may signal financial distress, and assess how to best engage and support them. We have a number of solutions to assist customers experiencing financial difficulty, including interest rate concessions on home and personal loans, interest only payments, loan term extensions and loan combination service options to support customers through difficult times and decisions. We are also using behavioural and data insights to better understand and support our customers' savings behaviour.\n\nWe are taking steps to ensure our people provide the right care for those experiencing vulnerability. In 2023 we implemented a Group-wide procedure for\n\nsupporting customers in vulnerable circumstances, which guides all of our people on the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and processes around vulnerability. The procedure helps employees understand what vulnerability is, how it may impact our customers, and how we can all help minimise the harm our customers may experience. Our specialised Next Chapter (available to individuals experiencing domestic and family violence and financial abuse) and Extra Care teams are trained to provide additional empathetic support, resources and referrals to both internal and external experts for customers.\n\nIn addition to ensuring our people understand vulnerability and how it may prevent a customer from receiving equitable outcomes, our processes and procedures are designed to embed fairness for the customer in all decision making. We use regular quality assurance and controls, and additional fairness reviews to assess customer cases to make sure decisions are in the customer's best interests. For acute and sensitive cases, senior stakeholders across the Bank collaborate to create personalised solutions for our customers in highly vulnerable or sensitive circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commitment to inclusive banking\n\nThe impacts of financial exclusion can be varied and significant for customers. As Australia's largest bank, we look to support financial inclusion and deliver a positive impact.\n\nThe Indigenous Customer Support Program, established in 2021, continued to bring efforts underway across the Bank together to support First Nations customers. This year we completed community visits to APY Lands (SA), Mornington Island, Palm Island (QLD), Djarindjin, Ardyaloon, Beagle Bay, and Bidyadanga (WA) to deliver remote banking support. These visits will inform our future remote banking support.\n\nWe partnered with First Nations Foundation in 2022 to run a financial literacy program pilot called My Money Dream. The program was available across a selection of remote branches for First Nations customers, to support positive money habits and build financial prosperity.\n\nWe understand the importance of building strong financial awareness and habits in children, to help them become financially resilient in the digital economy. Our earning-and-learning app, Kit, is being used by thousands of families in Australia. The app and prepaid card are designed with kids in mind, while still providing oversight for parents and carers. A recent Money Matters Report found families using Kit were more likely to save money, earn money on their own and apply positive spending strategies when purchasing an item.\n\nWe have chosen to play a role in addressing the significant impacts of financial abuse and improving outcomes for victim-survivors. Our Next Chapter program continues to provide ongoing and tailored support to customers and communities impacted by financial abuse.\n\n- Find out more about our Next Chapter program and progress on page 34.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making banking accessible for all Australians\n\nWe continue our ambition to improve our accessibility, helping to remove barriers for customers with temporary, situational or permanent disabilities. CBA's Accessibility and Inclusion Plan guides how we are making our products, technology and workplaces accessible for all.\n\nThis year, we launched Equal Access Toolkits into all branches to make it easier for our customers with different accessibility requirements to bank with us. Each toolkit includes items to support an array of accessibility requirements when customers visit us and help them complete tasks. These include communication cards, high contrast keyboards and pens, headphones, and magnifying tools. We also provided guidance and training for branch and specialist centre employees to respectfully offer these options to those who may need them.\n\n- Learn more at commbank.com.au/ accessibility\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Net Promoter Score (NPS) is key to how we measure and understand what our customers expect of us. Listening to and improving the customer experience has delivered positive movements in NPS across all of our business activities. We are currently ranked #1 across major banks in all business units, and have held this ranking for seven months. However, we recognise that we still have more to learn from and improve for customers.\n\n## Consumer NPS\n\n## Target: #1\n\n#1 among major banks for 8 months\n\nKey CBA Peers (major banks)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business NPS\n\n## Target: #1\n\n#1 among major banks for 17 months\n\nKey\n\nCBA\n\nPeers (major banks)\n\n10.7 on FY22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating better end-to-end customer experiences\n\nIn order to deliver better customer outcomes, we need to understand their full experience when interacting with us. We focus on identifying and fixing areas which are contributing to poor customer experiences, particularly related to our service, process or operations. These are identified by listening to the voice of the customer through complaints, employee feedback and NPS, and are grounded in data to help track the impact of our continuous improvement. We have seen positive impacts from many of the actions we have already taken to fix complex or problematic areas.\n\nFor customers experiencing difficulty, we removed barriers in the hardship application process to help them access solutions quickly when they need it most. Customers can now apply for hardship assistance through the CommBank app or by phone, and we have reduced the complexity and requirements to provide excessive proof and budgeting documents for simple requests. This change has resulted in an increase of customers in hardship undertaking responsible payment arrangements, with better long-term outcomes, and a decrease in hardship complaints.\n\nIn response to feedback about long wait times related to business corporate cards, we enhanced CommBank app messaging capabilities, reviewed our procedures and increased contact centre recruitment to better meet demand. These actions led to a 27% reduction in Business Banking call centre wait times and 84% reduction in wait time complaints.\n\nBankwest home lending and digital teams introduced the ability to provide rate reviews via messaging, helping reduce caller wait times and improving customer retention. By sending a message such as 'please review my rate', Bankwest customers receive a reply with a new rate offer if available, and the new rate is applied almost immediately. Since November, many customers have requested and received a better home loan rate, with an average 87% customer satisfaction score for the solution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Educating our customers on scams and fraud\n\nWith $3.1 billion stolen from Australians due to scams in 2022, as reported by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the threat of cybercrime continues to increase. We recognise the critical role we have to play in supporting and protecting customers, as well as leading the national conversation across the industry.\n\nWe have a range of technologies to keep customer information secure, but are equally focused on helping customers learn how to protect themselves. The security check-up in the CommBank app walks customers through key steps to keep accounts and cards secure, from activating location-based security and setting up alerts, to applying card blocks and limits. Customers can also check and protect their credit score in-app with SavvyShield from Credit Savvy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, the cost of scams in Australia totalled\n\n## $3.1 billion\n\nCybercrime directed at small-to-medium enterprises\n\n43%\n\n## Building business defence against cybercrime\n\nAccording to the Australian Cyber Security Centre's (ACSC) Annual Cyber Threat report, the average cost of cybercrime to Australian businesses has risen by 14% from financial year 2021 to 2022. On average, there is a cyber attack every 7 minutes in Australia, with 43% of these attacks targeting small-to-medium enterprises.\n\nIn response, we created an online business security hub to give specialised advice to businesses - empowering them to keep themselves and their customers safe and secure. We are also forming partnerships to help build small businesses' defence against cybercrime, scams and fraud. Our Small Business Cyber Security Guide, created with the ACSC, provides guidance on understanding and combatting the latest cyber security threats. Together with Telstra, we partnered with the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (COSBOA) to support small businesses in completing the COSBOA Cyber Wardens pilot program. The program is based on the ACSC's Essential Eight model, equipping Australian small businesses with the tools to safely engage with an increasingly digital world.\n\n## Empowering our customers through learning\n\nEducation is key to minimising the number of successful scam attempts. We provide a series of awareness videos, webinars, guides and research online and in-app to help our customers identify the signs of and protect themselves from a scam.\n\n- Learn more at commbank.com.au/safe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Understanding how scams work\n\nOur podcast series, Anatomy of a Scam, uses real stories to expose how scammers target people - with advice from cyber security and law enforcement experts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout the year, we provided Emergency Assistance during weather-related events in many parts of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nUsing the power of our Customer Engagement Engine we are able to proactively connect with those who may be impacted by a natural disaster, with offers of support that align to their needs, such as deferring a loan or providing an emergency overdraft. In New Zealand, ASB provided disaster relief to customers and communities following major flooding in Auckland. ASB also offered a one-off payment of NZ$2,000 for customers hardest hit by the impacts of Cyclone Gabrielle, and donated NZ$2 million to the New Zealand Red Cross. ASB further provided NZ$180 million in low-cost lending to support heavily impacted corporate, business and rural customers.\n\nThrough the CommBank Staff Foundation, our employees can participate in workplace giving, with the Bank making an additional annual $2 million donation. The Foundation's annual Community Grants program awards 200 community organisations with a $10,000 donation. This year, the grants came after another turbulent year for community organisations, with many facing rising costs while still recovering from the pandemic. The grants program helps relieve these cost pressures from organisations nationwide working across key areas of the community including mental health, cancer research, the arts, Indigenous support and homelessness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ongoing support for domestic violence and financial abuse\n\nWe remain committed to helping victim-survivors of domestic violence and financial abuse by continuing our support for customers, employees and communities through CommBank Next Chapter.\n\nSince inception of CommBank Next Chapter in 2020, the program has supported 52,277 interactions with people impacted by domestic and family violence and provided free confidential support and referrals to help rebuild financial independence. This includes 4,478 participants supported by the Financial Independence Hub, delivered in partnership with Good Shepherd. The Hub is delivering positive outcomes for participants including increased optimism for the future, steps towards financial recovery and independence, and increased financial resilience, no matter who they bank with. We have aspirations to support over 10,000 people by the end of the 2024 financial year as they move towards longterm recovery and financial independence. We are focused on increasing the understanding of our employees of financial abuse and its impacts. This year we continued to educate our people on how to respond to and prevent financial abuse.\n\nThe Group Customer Advocate also conducted a review into coercive relationship debt, a highly sensitive form of financial abuse, which often goes unrecognised by customers until acute impacts are felt. The review produced a number of recommendations that are being implemented throughout the Bank. These include tailored hardship support, employee and customer education, and updates to our processes.\n\nImportantly, we want to ensure customers feel safe when banking with us. CBA's AI model enables us to proactively identify instances of technology-facilitated abuse, a targeted form of domestic and family violence. The AI model complements the Bank's automatic block filter to stop transaction descriptions that include threatening, harassing or abusive language. The use of AI to help us address technology-facilitated abuse, demonstrates how we can use innovative technology to create a safer banking experience for all customers, especially for those in vulnerable circumstances. We are currently working to make our pre-trained model available to other financial institutions domestically and globally.\n\n## Empowering First Nations voices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCBA's Elevate status from Reconciliation Australia recognises our leadership role in driving reconciliation, both within CBA and nationally. We released our 2023-2025 Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP), setting out an ambitious plan which focuses on improving access to our products and services, and helping remove barriers to employment, business and supplier opportunities.\n\nWe are committed to supporting self-determination and we believe it is critical that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices inform our approaches and decisions. To assist us in achieving this, the Indigenous Leadership Team (ILT) was established in 2022. The ILT is an internal group made up of a diverse range of First Nations CBA employees across different roles and business units representing the Indigenous Employee Network. The ILT is underpinned by strong cultural concepts of leadership and has a responsibility to amplify the strengths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ways of knowing and being. They act as an internal collective voice on matters which impact Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees, customers, businesses and communities aligned to and beyond our RAP commitments.\n\nAs the nation continues discussion about Indigenous constitutional recognition, we maintain our long standing support of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, including the Indigenous Voice to Parliament. In reaching our position and approach, we have sought advice from the ILT and CBA's Indigenous Advisory Council, and reflected on our positive experiences and improved outcomes as a result of listening to First Nations voices. We have also supported a number of organisations working towards Indigenous constitutional recognition, including Uphold & Recognise, Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition and the Uluru Dialogues. We acknowledge and respect that our people and customers will have a variety of views about the Voice, and are focused on encouraging respectful conversations about what can be done to improve economic, social and health outcomes for First Nations people.\n\n## Promoting equality and inclusiveness in Australian sport\n\nWith women under-represented in organised sport in Australia, we aim to promote equality and inclusiveness for women's sport, including football.\n\nCBA is proud to be working with Football Australia, who aim to make football the first sport to reach gender parity in community participation. As an Official Supporter of the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023\u2122 and partner of the CommBank Matildas, we are committed to helping players of all ages and abilities participate in one of the country's favourite sports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting regional Australia's growth\n\nOur Regional Movers Index continues to show strong population movement to Australia's regional areas in the past year - drawn by employment and business opportunities across a diverse range of sectors.\n\nCBA has supported regional communities and businesses for over 100 years, by providing regional and agricultural businesses with specialist expertise. This year we were proud to partner with Newcastle Airport as sole financier for a $240 million package to support their expansion. The project will significantly increase the airport's capacity, improve connectivity and support future growth and opportunity in the Hunter Region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCBA people across regional Australia to support regional and agribusiness customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLocations across Australia with dedicated business bankers offering tailored banking solutions to regional businesses\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the significance of E&S issues, the Board has oversight and responsibility for E&S-related risks and opportunities. The Board considers the social, ethical and environmental impact of the Group's activities and approves the CBA E&S Framework.\n\nThe ELT E&S Committee was established to oversee detailed implementation of our E&S work program and provide governance of E&S risks and opportunities.\n\n- For more information on our E&S Framework and other policies, see commbank.com.au/policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evolving our Code of Conduct\n\nCBA's Code of Conduct sets out expectations for how we act, solve problems and make decisions. It is regularly reviewed to ensure it remains current to our business needs, and is aligned with customer and community expectations.\n\nThis year, the Code was updated to clarify and reinforce our responsibilities in relation to the responsible use of customer information and data. The 'Should We?' test remains fundamental to our Code, helping us focus on the right outcomes when making difficult decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making it safe to speak up\n\nWe support our people and external partners to raise concerns when something does not feel right.\n\nThe Bank's SpeakUP service is available 24/7 for our people and external partners who do not feel comfortable raising concerns through other channels, or want to remain anonymous. Individuals who raise concerns assessed as whistleblower disclosures receive support and protection under the Group Whistleblower Policy and applicable Australian whistleblower laws. During the 2023 financial year, 331 reports were made to the SpeakUP program, up from 317 in 2022. Of these reports, 81 were whistleblower cases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Learn more at commbank.com.au/policies\n\n## Building on our human rights commitments\n\nWith a continued focus on respecting human rights, we support the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nAddressing modern slavery risk remains a critical focus for the Bank. Our Annual Modern Slavery Statements outline the actions taken by the Bank to identify, assess and mitigate modern slavery and human trafficking risks in our operations and supply chain. In line with the annual reporting requirement under the Modern Slavery Act, we published our latest Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement in December 2022.\n\nWe recognise the importance of engaging with external experts to support appropriate responses to human rights issues, and through our Social Impact Program we continue to engage formal advisory bodies, including our Modern Slavery Advisory Council and IAC.\n\nSupported by the Bank's IAC and ILT, we launched a Human Rights of First Nations Stakeholders Grievance Process Framework. The process seeks to provide an avenue for First Nations stakeholders to raise directly with us genuine concerns regarding possible human rights impacts connected with CBA's business lending activity to Clients. Prior to the launch of the grievance process, we received and responded to one grievance relating to the resources sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more on page 51 in our 2023 Climate Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Safeguarding our information\n\nWe know the personal information we hold makes us an attractive target for cyber security attacks. The increase in cyber attacks on companies in Australia and abroad has increased our focus on cyber security resilience, minimising disruptions and improving the protection of customer and employee information.\n\n## Our policy frameworks\n\n## Cyber security\n\nCBA's Information Security Policy Framework comprises of a suite of policies and procedures which outline how we manage cyber and information security risk; and includes clear and detailed cyber security policies and standards. We are committed to complying with all relevant regulatory obligations, and aligning to industry frameworks, best practice and standards. These include ISO27001 Information Security Management Systems, ISO27002 Code of Practice for Information Security Controls, APRA Prudential Standard CPS 234 Information Security, NIST Cyber Security Framework, and the ACSC's Essential Eight mitigation strategies. CBA regularly reviews and uplifts internal policy documents and continuously develops and maintains a compliance framework. These are embedded in our behaviours and the way we conduct our business, maintaining a secure design of our systems and processes.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nThe Bank's Privacy Statement sets out how we collect and handle personal information, and how individuals may exercise their privacy rights. The principles of good privacy compliance contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) are embedded in our internal Group Privacy Policy, Standard and Procedures and guide how we comply with privacy obligations and respond to privacy requests.\n\nAccordingly, we seek to be transparent about the types of personal information we collect, how we use it, and who we may share it with. Similarly, we aim to keep personal information protected and destroy or de-identify it once it is no longer needed. We also have processes in place to enable individuals to exercise their privacy rights as set out in the Privacy Act .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our Privacy Statement at commbank.com.au/policies\n\n## Test, review and prevent\n\n## Cyber security\n\nWe maintain a range of internal and external mechanisms to assess our information security capability. Our internal audit teams periodically report to the Board, and Board Risk and Compliance Committee, on cyber security controls and capabilities.\n\nCBA's cyber security team is focused on maintaining our defences against the evolving threat environment, running regular simulations to improve the Bank's response and recovery capability in case of significant events. When significant cyber security breaches occur at other organisations, we conduct internal assessments to test CBA's controls and processes against similar threats. As these increase and consequences magnify, our testing and review cycles are more frequent to ensure new vulnerabilities and risks are understood and managed by our controls.\n\nIn addition, we participate in external and regulatory body reviews which help us identify areas for improvement and benchmark ourselves against best-in-class and industry peers. Following APRA's 2022 Technology Resilience Prudential Review, there were no adverse findings specific to cyber security for CBA. In the last year, we conducted two external reviews to assess CBA's cyber program against international best practice benchmarks, ensuring its alignment with global standards. We were also one of the nine pilot entities included in APRA's first CPS 234 tripartite assessment, where our domestic and international operations were externally assessed in 2021 and 2022 respectively. These findings aligned with our self-identified areas for improvements, and we have closed all findings for CBA and ASB. PT Bank Commonwealth is progressing efforts to close out remaining findings.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nWe regularly review our data privacy processes and controls. CBA's Information Security Identity and Access Management Standard outlines access requirements such as multi-factor authentication and segregation of duties so that only relevant roles are able to access systems and information. CBA has implemented software and controls to monitor email, USB and web traffic. This safeguard is known as Data Loss Prevention and plays an important role in keeping Bank and customer data secure.\n\n## Training, awareness and oversight\n\nAll employees at CBA undertake annual mandatory privacy training. The Bank also maintains an information security training and awareness program that involves participation from employees to reinforce the information security roles and responsibilities of our employees and contractors. This program includes online training completed when joining the Bank, and thereafter on an annual basis. The mandatory training is based on regulatory guidance and best practices to ensure our people know how to prevent, detect and escalate cyber risks appropriately. Noncompletion of mandatory training may result in disciplinary action, including termination. This training is further supported through information security awareness initiatives including simulated exercises and intranet articles and newsletters, which promote secure practices across key topics such as 'phishing' and 'spear phishing' attacks, password security, and secure information transfer and storage.\n\n## Designing products for better customer outcomes\n\nEnsuring fair and equitable outcomes for customers is a key priority, and informs our responsible product design, marketing and communication approach. We also embed regular reviews of products, services and communications to understand where they may not deliver good outcomes for some customers, and where we can improve.\n\nThe Bank's policies and procedures set out our commitment to providing information and marketing materials that are clear, accurate, and when targeted, relevant to the customer. We provide direct communication to customers in agreed timeframes and through their preferred communication methods. We will reasonably honour prices advertised and comply with all regulatory requirements. Any material that does not meet these standards, is incorrect or is expired, is revoked or rectified as soon as practicable.\n\nWe look to meet genuine customer needs or demands when developing and distributing products, as well as ensuring alignment with CBA's business risk appetite and strategy. We are required by law to have Target Market Determinations which describe the particular cohort of customer the product is intended for - taking into account their circumstances, financial literacy, potential vulnerability or hardship and accessibility requirements. This helps reduce the risk of customer harm from the development and distribution of our products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information on Target Market Determinations, see commbank.com.au/TMD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focusing on our customer outcomes assessment\n\nThe Group Customer Advocate has developed new resources to support product teams across the Bank. These help instil a deeper understanding of the needs and circumstances of the customers for each product we design and manage. CBA's customer outcomes assessment areas include:\n\n- \u00b7 Respecting and elevating the customer voice\n- \u00b7 Asking 'Should We?'\n- \u00b7 Delivering accessible and inclusive products, services and experiences\n- \u00b7 Designing products with vulnerability in mind\n- \u00b7 Designing safe products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach with suppliers\n\nCBA has a complex and diverse supply chain made up of over 4,300 suppliers.\n\nWe recognise that diversity in our supply chain drives flexibility, responsiveness and innovation. We seek to engage and support Indigenous-owned businesses and social enterprises though our direct (first tier) and directed (second tier) suppliers. This year we appointed an Indigenous Supplier Relationship Manager to ensure an Indigenous perspective when engaging with Indigenous suppliers. Through our 2023-2025 RAP, we have targeted increasing our spend with Indigenous businesses by 10% year-on-year, this year achieving an 19% increase. In the 2023 financial year, we also increased the number of Indigenous suppliers with whom we spend by 18%, including three regional and remote suppliers.\n\n## Position on political donations\n\nThe Bank's political donations policy precludes us from making political donations.\n\nHowever, we pay to attend political events and forums. This year, we spent $62,100 with the Australian Labor Party, $62,000 with the Liberal Party of Australia, and $12,825 with the National Party of Australia. These payments are disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission in line with State and Federal regulation.\n\n## Our approach to tax\n\nCBA is one of the largest taxpayers in Australia. We recognise the important contribution taxes make to support government assets and services.\n\nOur approach to managing our tax affairs is in accordance with CBA's values, purpose and strategy. Our commitment is to comply with prevailing tax laws in all jurisdictions that we operate in, and to maintain transparent and collaborative relationships with tax authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More information is available in our Tax Transparency Code at commbank.com.au/sustainabilityreporting\n\n<!-- image -->",

Emissions from these locations have been reclassified from Scope 3 to Scope 1 or 2 emissions, depending on source.\n- 2 Market-based reporting reflects the emissions from electricity that companies have purchased. Reported from FY21 onwards. Location-based reporting reflects the average emissions intensity of the grid where electricity is consumed.\n- 3 Pending acquittal of energy attribute certificates for the reporting year. ASB offsite ATMs reclassified as Scope 2 in FY23. Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) could not be purchased due to metering limitations.\n- 4 Refers to reporting of selected Scope 3 emissions categories under the GHG Protocol. Increase in emissions due to business travel and new reporting of emissions from Australian employee commuting. Refer to definitions for changes.\n- 5 New Zealand's FY20, FY21 and FY22 location-based emissions have been restated.\n- 6 ASB offsite ATMs were reclassified as Scope 2 in FY23. RECs could not be purchased due to metering limitations. New Zealand data excludes base building electricity consumption.\n- 7 Not assured by PwC.\n- 8 In FY23, invoiced amounts contributed to 90% of waste to landfill data, 88% of waste recycled data and 76% of water usage. The remainder is estimated based on average tonnes per m2 of net lettable area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Limited assurance report\n\nPwC has provided limited assurance on these metrics on pages 40-46, for the year ended 30 June 2023, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Metric is not assured by PwC.\n- 2 In FY22, 72 interactions covering outbound contacts made for the purpose of supporting customers in receipt of potentially abusive transaction descriptions were also included. This channel was excluded in FY23 due to a change in information handling. Of the total 20,560 interactions, 16,260 were assured by PwC. 875 internal vulnerability referrals received by the Community Wellbeing team were also excluded from the limited assurance engagement due to a change in information handling. 3,425 interactions related to the asynchronous chat channel, were unable to be assured due to the nature of the third party data that was able to be provided as part of the assurance.\n- 3 The 'Providing banking services to First Nations customers' e-learning was completed and launched in the second half of FY22 and is mandatory for targeted teams in the retail and business banks and is recommended for all other employees. The roll out of this mandatory learning drove the increase between FY21 to FY22. As employees are not expected to complete this training every year, the overall training completion rate is lower in FY23.\n- 4 Does not include identified corporate credit card spend of $98,577 with Indigenous suppliers. Credit Card spend is not assured by PwC.\n- 5 Reported for the first time in FY23.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Selected Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the Criteria.\n\nThe Criteria used by the Group to prepare the Selected Sustainability Information is set out on pages 290 to 303 in the 2023 Annual Report ( the Criteria ).\n\nThe maintenance and integrity of the Group's website is the responsibility of the Group's management; the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported Selected Sustainability Information or Criteria when presented on the Group's website.\n\nOur assurance conclusion was with respect to the year ended 30 June 2023 and does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods or to any other information included in, or linked from, the 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management\n\nManagement of the Group is responsible for the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes:\n\n- \u00b7  determining appropriate reporting topics and selecting or establishing suitable criteria for measuring, evaluating and preparing the underlying Selected Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7  ensuring that those Criteria are relevant and appropriate to the Group and the intended users;\n- \u00b7  designing, implementing and maintaining systems, processes and internal controls over information relevant to the evaluation or measurement of the Selected Sustainability Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, against the Criteria.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality control\n\nWe have complied with the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standard Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) relevant to assurance engagements, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nOur firm applies Australian Standard on Quality Management ASQM 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information , or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements , which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, ABN 52 780 433 757\n\nOne International Towers Sydney, Watermans Quay, Barangaroo NSW 2000, GPO BOX 2650 Sydney NSW 2001 T: +61 2 8266 0000, F: +61 2 8266 9999, www.pwc.com.au\n\nLevel 11, 1PSQ, 169 Macquarie Street, Parramatta NSW 2150, PO Box 1155 Parramatta NSW 2124 T: +61 2 9659 2476, F: +61 2 8266 9999, www.pwc.com.au\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.\n\nOur engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ASAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements . Those standards require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the Selected Sustainability Information has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included:\n\n- \u00b7  Reading the Selected Sustainability Information to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the Sustainability performance;\n- \u00b7  Enquiring of management responsible for preparing the Selected Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7  Enquiries regarding the processes and controls for capturing, collating, calculating and reporting the Selected Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7  Assessing the appropriateness of estimates, assumptions and methodologies applied by management in the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7  Calculating the arithmetic accuracy of a sample of calculations of the Selected Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7  Assessing the appropriateness of the greenhouse gas emission factors and methodologies applied in calculating the Selected Sustainability Information;\n- \u00b7  Undertaking analytical procedures over the performance data utilised within the calculations and preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information; and\n- \u00b7  Comparing the Selected Sustainability Information to relevant underlying sources on a sample basis.\n\nThe Selected Sustainability Information includes a deduction from the Group's emissions for the year of 90,235 tonnes of CO 2-e relating to offsets. We have performed procedures as to whether these offsets were acquired during the year and arrangements are in place for their surrender, as well as procedures over the calculation of net emissions. We have not, however, performed any procedures regarding the external providers of these offsets, and express no conclusion about whether the offsets have resulted, or will result, in a reduction of 90,235 tonnes of CO 2-e.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nInherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information being examined. It is therefore possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Selected Sustainability Information with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making enquiries of Management and applying analytical procedures.\n\nAdditionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating and estimating such data. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities over time.\n\nThe limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.\n\n## Our limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed, as described under 'Our responsibilities' and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Sustainability Information has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\n## Emphasis of matter - Estimation of 'Selected Scope 3 emissions'\n\nThe estimation of 'Selected Scope 3 emissions' reported by the Group comprises selected sources of operational Scope 3 emissions only.\n\nWe draw attention to the Glossary of terms on pages 295 to 296 which sets out these assumptions and data sources for different Scope 3 emissions sources. Our conclusion is not qualified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Use and distribution of our report\n\nWe were engaged by the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia to prepare this independent assurance report having regard to the criteria specified by the Group and set out in this report. This report was prepared solely for the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the purpose of providing limited assurance on the Selected Sustainability Information and may not be suitable for any other purpose.\n\nWe accept no duty, responsibility or liability to anyone other than the Group in connection with this report or to the Group for the consequences of using or relying on it for a purpose other than that referred to above. We make no representation concerning the appropriateness of this report for anyone other than the Group and if anyone other than the Group chooses to use or rely on it they do so at their own risk.\n\nThis disclaimer applies to the maximum extent permitted by law and, without limitation, to liability arising in negligence or under statute and even if we consent to anyone other than the Group receiving or using this report.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElizabeth O'Brien Partner\n\nSydney 9 August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

It represents the net profit generated as a percentage of the equity shareholders have invested.\n\nEPS measures the Bank's earnings growth. It is calculated by dividing net profit after tax by the number of shares on issue.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe final dividend of $2.40 per share reflects the Bank's strong capital position. Our aim is to deliver sector leading returns and a sustainable dividend. To deliver sustainable dividends we seek to:\n\n- \u00b7  Pay cash dividends at sustainable levels;\n- \u00b7  Target a full-year payout ratio of 70-80% of cash NPAT; and\n- \u00b7  Maximise the use of our franking account by paying fully franked dividends.\n\nThe final dividend payout ratio was 74% of the Bank's cash earnings for the full financial year. Including the interim dividend of $2.10 per share, the full year dividend was $4.50 per share, fully franked.\n\nThe Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) continues to be offered to shareholders. No discount will be applied to shares allocated under the plan for the final dividend.

The loan loss rate measures loan impairment as a percentage of average gross loans and acceptances.\n\nLoan impairment expense increased $1,465 million reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and a decline in house prices.\n\n## Portfolio credit quality\n\nConsumer arrears show the proportion of our consumer credit portfolio where customers have fallen behind on their contractual loan repayments. Home loan arrears remained low, reflecting low levels of unemployment and consumer savings buffers. Credit card and personal loan arrears began to deteriorate reflecting increased cost of living pressures.\n\nTroublesome and impaired assets include loans where customers are experiencing financial difficulties that could result in credit losses for the Group, loans to customers not meeting their repayment obligations such as loans in default and loans restructured on non-commercial terms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Loan impairment provisions\n\nOur total impairment provisions increased to $5,950 million from $5,347 million in FY22 reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and a decline in house prices.\n\nThe Group maintains a cautious approach to managing potential risks as financial conditions continue to tighten. Provisioning coverage remains strong with the provision coverage ratio at 1.64%.\n\nThe increase in troublesome and impaired assets to $7,099 million from $6,403 million in FY22, was primarily driven by increases in the construction, retail trade and commercial property sectors.\n\n## Troublesome and impaired assets ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTroublesome         Impaired\n\n## Total impairment provisions ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Loan loss rate (bpts) as a percentage of lending\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Balance Sheet strength\n\nBalance Sheet strength is critical to our ability to serve our customers, drive core business outcomes and deliver sustainable returns for our shareholders. Our liquidity, funding and capital metrics remained strong. The strength of our balance sheet means the Bank is well positioned to continue supporting our customers while delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders.\n\n## Capital\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n\n12.2% 1 APRA (Level 2) FY22  11.5%\n\nThe Group has a strong capital position with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 12.2% as at 30 June 2023, well in excess of regulatory minimum capital requirement of 10.25%. This represents a $9 billion of capital surplus to the minimum regulatory requirement.\n\nThe Bank's CET1 ratio was supported by strong organic capital generation from earnings, the removal of the remaining $500 million of APRA operational risk capital add-on, and the divestment of our CommInsure General Insurance business.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, the Group has successfully completed its previously announced $3 billion on-market share buy-back.\n\nThe strong capital position and our progress on executing our strategy means that we are well placed to continue to support our\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nDeposit funding ratio\n\n75%\n\nFY22  74%\n\nLiquidity coverage ratio\n\n131%\n\nFY22  130%\n\nNet stable funding ratio\n\n## 124%\n\nFY22  130%\n\n- 1  The adoption of APRA revised capital framework on 1 January 2023 led to an increase in CET1 ratio from 11.4% on 31 December 2022 to 12.1% on 1 January 2023.\n- 2  The timing and actual number of shares purchased under the buy-back will depend on market conditions, available trading windows and other considerations. CBA reserves the right to vary, suspend or terminate the buy-back at any time.\n\nThe deposit funding ratio represents the proportion of total funding made up of customer deposits. Customer deposits are considered the most stable source of funding. The strength of our banking business has allowed us to maintain the highest share of stable household deposits in Australia. Ensuring we are well funded has been critical to our ability to continue supporting our customers and the Australian economy.\n\nThe Group continued to satisfy a significant portion of its funding requirements from customer deposits, accounting for 75% of total funding, with customers continuing to increase retail, business and institutional deposits.\n\ncustomers, manage ongoing uncertainties and continue returning excess capital to shareholders.\n\nOn 9 August 2023, the Group announced its intention to undertake a further $1 billion on-market share buy-back. 2\n\nThe Bank is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) regulated by APRA. To ensure banks hold sufficient capital to protect deposit holders against unexpected losses, APRA sets minimum capital requirements for ADIs based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision guidelines. These requirements influence the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\n\nFor more details on divestments refer to Note 11.3 on pages 259-260 in the Financial report .\n\n## The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nrepresents the level of high quality liquid assets available to meet short-term obligations in a liquidity stress scenario. The Group's average LCR for the quarter ended 30 June 2023 was 131% which was significantly above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\n## The net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nshows to what extent our long-term assets are covered by stable sources of funding. The Group's NSFR as at 30 June 2023 was 124%, remaining well above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

RBS also includes the retail banking activities conducted under the Bankwest and Unloan brands.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $5,158 million, an increase of $245 million or 5% on FY22. The result was driven by improved deposit margins and volume growth in lending and deposits, partly offset by lower home lending margins reflecting increased competition, and higher loan impairment charges reflecting increased cost of living pressures, rising interest rates and a decline in housing prices. Costs increased, driven by inflation, higher IT spend and amortisation, additional resources to support increased call centre volumes and strategic initiatives, and increased scams and fraud related losses, partly offset by productivity initiatives including workforce and branch optimisation. Investment spend focused on strategic growth and productivity initiatives including product and service innovation, digital enhancements, partnership integration, and home buying process optimisation.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nRBS' strategy to broaden and deepen relationships with our customers has allowed for strong customer advocacy scores - being #1 in NPS among major banks for a majority of the year, increased Main Financial Institution (MFI) share, and leading market share in both home lending and household deposits.\n\nRBS' continued focus on operational excellence and the launch of our new digital-only proprietary offering, Unloan, resulted in $149 billion of new home loans funded. Over 30,000 of these home loans were to first home buyers, including those using the Government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme.\n\nRBS also saw strong growth in household deposits with more than 1.5 million new transaction accounts opened by customers. This included significant new migrant transaction account openings, which were ~50% higher than pre-COVID levels.\n\nA key focus area remains supporting our customers, including customers impacted by scams and fraud, and customers experiencing mortgage stress given the increasing interest rate environment. We provide tips on staying safe on our website and have introduced safety and security features, including NameCheck and CallerCheck, to help prevent scams and fraud. Financial assistance and temporary hardship relief is available to customers struggling to make card and loan repayments.\n\n- 1  On 30 September 2022, CBA completed the sale of its Australian General Insurance business to Hollard Group (Hollard).\n\n## Business Banking\n\nCash NPAT\n\n$3,973m\n\nFY22  $3,010m\n\nContribution to Group profit\n\n39%\n\nNet interest margin\n\n3.60% FY22  2.97%\n\n## Brands\n\nBusiness Banking (BB) serves the banking needs of business, corporate and agribusiness customers across the full range of financial services solutions.

The result was driven by improved deposit margins from the rising interest rate environment and continued lending volume growth, partly offset by lower lending margins. Costs were flat reflecting lower remediation costs, productivity initiatives and higher leave usage partly offset by inflation and higher IT spend. Loan impairment expense increased driven by higher individual and collective provisions reflecting the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and rising interest rates.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nOur continued focus on reimagining our products and services, enhancing customer experiences, and simplifying how we do things has resulted in our higher customer advocacy scores. We are now leading among major banks, in business banking customer advocacy scores. More than one in four Australian businesses now call us their main bank, according to our MFI share.\n\nBB delivered strong performance across core business banking products with loan growth of $14 billion.\n\nIn response to our customers needs, we continue to develop tailored industry solutions for ecommerce, digital Medicare and insurance claiming, cash flow management and sustainability.

Higher income from improved margins on deposits due to the rising interest rate environment, increased Markets trading income and gains on asset sales in Structured Asset Finance were partly offset by a decrease in lending margins and unfavourable derivative valuation adjustments. Operating expenses increased due to inflation, investment in capabilities, higher IT spend, unfavourable foreign exchange and increased volume driven operational costs.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nLending volumes have increased driven by higher commitments and increased utilisation of facilities, particularly in strategic sectors, while maintaining an efficient risk weighted asset profile. Margins remain under pressure given the challenging cost of funding environment.\n\nDeposit balances continue to grow due to customer preference for term investment products, and beneficial margins due to the rising rate environment.\n\nDespite ongoing market volatility, Global Markets has delivered a solid performance particularly in trading, and remains well positioned to support clients in a continuing challenging macro environment.\n\nAligned to the bank's commitment to support Australia's climate change goals and help reduce our clients' emissions, CBA assisted on 64 sustainable finance transactions across loans, bonds and trade finance, totalling $15 billion, and continues to invest in carbon capabilities in line with IB&M's strategy.\n\nIB&M ended the year with a net promoter score of 52.3 in the greater than $300 million customer category.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nCash NPAT\n\n$1,356m\n\nFY22  $1,265m\n\nContribution to Group profit\n\n13%\n\nNet interest margin 1\n\n2.44% FY22  2.22%\n\nBrands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew Zealand includes ASB Bank which provides a range of banking and investment products and services to its personal, business and rural customers in New Zealand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $1,356 million, an increase of $91 million or 7% on FY22. Total operating income increased driven by an increase in net interest margins, while operating expenses increased reflecting continued investment in our people, technology, and regulatory compliance. Loan impairment expense increased due to the impact of inflationary and interest rate pressures, and a decline in house prices.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nASB continued to deliver balanced growth in core lending markets. Home lending grew by 3% for the year reflecting customer preference for fixed rate loans. Business lending grew 5% reflecting above system growth in its medium and large business lending, and rural lending grew 6%. Total customer deposits grew 3%, with customer preference for higher interest deposit products in the rising rate environment.\n\nASB lending margins declined primarily reflecting the impact on home lending of higher swap rates and heightened pricing competition, while customer deposit margins increased in the rising interest rate environment. Fee income declined as ASB continued to reduce or remove fees across a range of accounts and services.\n\nASB further supported financial wellbeing with 'tools' such as Support Finder, to help New Zealanders access government support, and Card Tracker a digital service that gives customers visibility of what subscriptions are being charged to their Visa debit or credit cards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Managing our risks\n\nCBA's embedded risk framework, together with a stronger culture, empowers our people to confidently manage risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Bank's operating environment is complex and dynamic. This introduces new risks and opportunities, and affects our current risk priorities. The Group Risk Management Framework enables the Board, Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and our people to make informed risk decisions to support the delivery of our strategy.\n\nKey considerations for risk management this year:\n\n## Macroeconomic pressures and rising cost of living\n\nThe Bank's financial performance is closely linked to local and global economic performance. Economic growth in Australia and New Zealand is slowing as the impact of higher interest rates takes e/ffect and consumer spending softens. Many customers are under financial strain due to higher loan repayments, rising costs of electricity, and other household expenses. In addition, the majority of fixed-rate home loans will transition to variable rates by the end of 2024, which will further impact some households and their ability to meet their financial commitments. The Bank seeks to carefully manage credit risk, while also providing support to households and businesses who are financially impacted by economic conditions.\n\n## Global banking instability\n\nThe recent bank failures in the United States and Europe highlighted the importance of maintaining bank stability for customer confidence. A global banking crisis could potentially reduce the availability of credit to banks globally and increase the cost of funding. Australian banks have benefited from conservative regulatory settings and vigilant oversight by APRA. Our banking system capital requirements are well above international requirements, with strong liquidity rules. Our balance sheet resilience and prudent capital and liquidity management, informed by stress testing, enable us to continue to support our customers and the Australian economy.\n\n## Escalating scams, fraud and cybercrime\n\nAustralians lost a record $3.1 billion to scams in 2022, as reported by the ACCC. Scams are becoming more sophisticated, resulting in millions of people experiencing a range of financial and non-financial harms. Current geopolitical tensions also elevate cyber security concerns. Cyber attacks on Australian companies are increasing in frequency and scale as cyber criminals use more advanced techniques. The Bank provides educational tools and resources to help customers stay safe, and continues to invest in the latest technological capabilities. We are focused on initiatives to detect, prevent and recover losses from scams and fraud on our customers.\n\n## Environmental expectations\n\nRegulatory and societal pressures continue for organisations to develop robust strategies and to accelerate progress associated with the transition to net zero. We have a role to play in lending to support the transition, and helping our customers to transition and build resilience through our products and services. Our approach to climate change is detailed in our 2023 Climate Report.\n\n## Competition intensity\n\nCompetition continues to intensify from both existing and new competitors, including non-traditional competitors. Digital disruption in payments and banking service o/fferings, as well as increasing customer expectations for integrated and personalised digital experiences, requires us to continue innovating to deliver superior customer experiences.\n\n## Capability and culture\n\nThe progression of new technologies such as AI, changing customer expectations and rapidly evolving risks such as cybercrime, requires leaders, employees and partners to have new and di/fferent skill sets, particularly in engineering, technology, environmental, data and analytics. In recent years, we have transformed our culture to take measured risks we understand and can manage, ask 'Should We?' when making decisions, and encourage challenge of the status quo to ensure that we prioritise positive outcomes for our customers.\n\n## Our risk management process\n\nOur Risk Management Framework (RMF) outlines the Bank's key risk processes. The Board approved Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) sets the risk limits the Bank operates within to deliver our strategy. The RMF includes a number of risk types (Strategic, Financial and Non-financial), each with their own specific frameworks to identify, assess, govern and manage their unique risks. Our material risks are those the Bank is placing extra focus on mitigating, due to their potential to materially impact the Bank, our customers, shareholders and the community, now or in the future.\n\n- For more detailed information on the Group RMF and risk types, refer to Note 9 in the Financial report on pages 204-245.\n\n## Group strategy and business plans\n\n## Material risks\n\n## Financial risk\n\nCyber security\n\nScams and fraud\n\nEnvironmental and social\n\nCapability and culture\n\n## Privacy and data management\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\n## Financial crime compliance\n\nInvestment allocation and delivery\n\nBusiness disruption\n\nRegulatory compliance\n\n- For more detailed information on material risks see pages 62-65.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Board approved RAS is set at a level that the Board expects management to operate within, to achieve desired business outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7  Preserving capital adequacy\n- \u00b7  Maintaining liquidity\n- \u00b7  Achieving targeted performance\n- \u00b7  Protecting our franchise value\n\n## Manage and control risks\n\nWe implement measures to manage and control risks within appetite, such as:\n\n- \u00b7  Detective and preventative controls\n- \u00b7  Limits, delegated authorities and review and approval processes\n- \u00b7  Policies and procedures\n- \u00b7  Issue and incident management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Identify and assess risks\n\nThe Bank uses multiple techniques to identify and measure the risks it is exposed to such as:\n\n\u00b7  Stress and scenario analysis\n\n\u00b7  Risk and Control\n\nSelf-Assessments\n\n\u00b7  Emerging risk assessment \u00b7  Systems and models to quantify risks and identify risk exceptions\n\n## Govern and monitor\n\nThe Board and its committees:\n\n\u00b7  Oversee the Group's system of internal controls and compliance\n\n\u00b7  Review regular reports on the measurement of risk, and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems\n\n## Risk types\n\n## Strategic\n\n## Financial\n\nThe risk of value destruction or less than planned value creation, due to changes in the internal or external operating environment.\n\nEmerging\n\nRisks typically arising from financial transactions - credit, market and liquidity risks.\n\n## Non-financial\n\nRisks arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, including failure to act in accordance with laws and regulations.\n\nRisks, that are driven by changes in the external operating environment with potential to materially impact our risk profile in the medium to longer term (>12 months).\n\nRisk management process\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to corporate governance\n\n## Introduction from the Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt was a privilege to have become Chair of CBA last August. My focus over the past year has been to build on the Bank's strong foundations, helping steer the organisation through its next strategic phase.\n\nAs a key contributor to the Australian economy, CBA plays a meaningful role in the lives of its customers and in the country's national interest. We are relied upon to support economic growth and to provide support to our customers and communities - particularly in the current environment.\n\n## Board and strategic priorities\n\nGlobally we are facing a period of economic uncertainty, with many Australians feeling the strain of cost of living pressures and rising\n\ninterest rates. The role of the Board is to oversee management and test the appropriateness of the Bank's strategic priorities over the long term. It is critical that the Board listens to a broad range of stakeholders to inform our decisions. This year the Board spent considerable time on customer experience, cyber and information security, technology investment, climate change, and balance sheet resilience.\n\nWith customer interests at the centre of CBA's purpose and strategy, the Board continued to actively monitor how the Bank is handling complaints as well as its progress in improving customers' experiences. Focus areas included\n\nensuring fairness and transparency in the support we provide, delivering seamless end-to-end experiences, and continuing to offer relevant and secure services that meet customer needs.\n\nAs cyber threats continue to escalate, the Board considered CBA's cyber risk management approach and focused on building strong cyber resilience across the organisation. This included having two external reviews on the Bank's cyber security and participating in the 2022 Technology Resilience Prudential Review, where there were no adverse findings specific to cyber security for CBA. We recognise the critical importance of management accountabilities for responsible data management and information security. We will continue to consult with our regulators to keep abreast of expectations and upcoming standards. We also continue to oversee processes implemented to reduce customer susceptibility to scams and fraud.\n\nWe have been focused on providing more personalised digital experiences for our customers for over a decade. AI has been a key enabler in executing our strategy. The Board is committed to ensuring it is used safely under existing and new governance. This year, the Board reviewed CBA's new AI Policy with a focus on how to safely scale the use of AI.\n\nThere continues to be considerable interest from stakeholders on our climate-related progress and how we are managing the risks and opportunities as well as balancing competing factors. Our actions need to align with our purpose - building a brighter future for all - and support an inclusive transition.\n\n- For further information on the Bank's climate strategy, see pages 22-23.\n\nThe Board sets both the strategic objectives and risk appetite of the Bank. As part of our annual Risk Management Declaration to APRA, the Board performs a rigorous assessment of the maturity of each key risk type of the Bank and ensures the Risk Management Framework is appropriate for our external context, business plan and strategic priorities. We take this declaration seriously as it provides the Board with time to reflect on CBA's framework assurances and make any required enquiries so that we are confident the Framework is effective and appropriate for the Group.\n\n- More information on CBA's approach to managing risk is on pages 60-65.\n\nImportantly, in order to execute our strategy and deliver for both our customers and shareholders, we need to maintain disciplined capital allocation and balance sheet resilience. Managing the organisation conservatively ensures the Bank is prepared for a wide range of economic scenarios and market conditions. Our cautious approach to balance sheet settings allows an orderly execution of our funding plans in uncertain environments, while maintaining flexibility. Delivering stable earnings contributes to the strength of Australia's banking system, helping to provide confidence and stability for businesses and consumers.\n\n- For more information on our approach to stakeholder engagement and key areas of Board consideration, see pages 69-71.\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nThe Board plays a critical role in setting the cultural tone of the Bank and is supportive of management's focus on encouraging the right mindsets and behaviours. We are particularly focused on ensuring progress made under CBA's Remedial Action Plan is sustained, while remaining adaptive to the Bank's changing internal and external context.\n\nCBA has a highly regarded management team that has delivered consistently strong operational performance, and significant cultural change. We also have a highly engaged and diverse workforce who we need to support and develop. We continue to monitor initiatives to further embed inclusion, equity and diversity across the organisation. The Board is focused on ensuring we continue to attract and retain our talent - both at the executive level and broader workforce - ensuring the depth of skills reflect what is needed to execute our strategy.\n\nEqually, we are focused on ensuring our people remain accountable for their actions and outcomes - effectively rewarding positive outcomes and enforcing consequences for poor outcomes. As part of the Bank's performance and risk review, each February and June, the People & Remuneration Committee members meet concurrently with the Risk & Compliance, Audit, and Nominations Committee members. These meetings provide an opportunity for the Committee members to assess executive performance against strategic priorities, risk management and living our values - and supports the determination of collective and individual remuneration consequences.\n\n- For further information on the Bank's executive remuneration, see pages 88-116.\n\n## Board e/ffectiveness\n\nI am committed to ensuring the Board continues to operate effectively. It is important for directors to spend the right amount of time on the right issues. When setting the forward planners, we keep all strategically significant matters which could impact the Group's strategy - such as digital transformation, environmental and social issues, and global competition - at the Board level. Committees continue to support the Board by undertaking work to facilitate sound decision making, which creates time for the Board to focus on long-term issues and constructively challenge management where appropriate.\n\nI am also focused on ensuring that all Directors have significant experience across multiple areas of the Board Skills Matrix, and contribute to all elements of strategic and risk oversight. As we look forward, we will continue to ensure the Board has the best mix of skills and experiences to provide the long-term focus required on banking, technology and customer experience.\n\n- Detailed information about Board composition and renewal is on page 72.\n\n## Closing\n\nI would like to thank all who have contributed to the Bank's success - including my fellow Directors for their commitment to ensuring the Bank is well positioned for the future, our people who work hard each day to deliver for our customers, our customers and communities for trusting us to serve their financial needs, and our shareholders for their ongoing support.\n\nPaul O'Malley Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Board meetings are core to fulfilling these duties. In the 2023 financial year, the Board held 10 meetings. These included six multi-day Board and Committee meetings with structured, standing agendas, and four shorter supplementary Board meetings by video conference. Two strategy sessions were also held.\n\nTo ensure the Board's time is used e/fficiently and discussions reflect the Bank's priorities, Board agendas are\n\nreviewed by respective Board and Committee Chairs, in consultation with the Group Company Secretary and CEO. Importantly, the Board also retains flexibility for ad hoc matters to be raised and discussed where appropriate. This year, the Board spent time reviewing assumptions that underpin the Bank's strategy to ensure they remain appropriate. They sought to increase informal engagement with management with a particular focus on constructive challenge, as well as continued engagement with stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Learn more about the key areas of Board consideration on pages 70-71.\n\n## Board education and training\n\nThe Nominations Committee oversees the induction program for new Directors which is tailored to their skills and experience. Given the Bank's complex and dynamic operating environment, they also ensure there are appropriate continuing education opportunities for Directors to develop and maintain the skills and knowledge required to perform their role. Board education sessions for the 2023 financial year included cyber-related risks, Respect at Work, director's duties and responsible AI.\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe Board has extensive discussions which cover a range of topics. When planning Board meetings, regulatory and legal obligations are balanced to allow sufficient time to discuss strategy and other matters. Significant agenda items at the six multi-day Board meetings in the 2023 financial year are included in the table below.

With the assistance of the Nominations Committee, the Board regularly reviews its size and composition and considers a number of factors including independence, skills, experience and diversity of views.\n\n## Skills and experience\n\nFrequent and deliberate consideration is given to diversity of thought, background, experience and skills. Each year the Directors, including the Chair, self-assess their individual skills and experience. This assessment informs the Board Skills Matrix (Matrix), which sets out the skills and experience considered essential for effective decision-making.\n\nThe self-assessment ratings and Matrix are reviewed and discussed by the Nominations Committee and approved by the Board. The Matrix is considered in the context of CBA's external environment and strategic priorities, and is used to inform areas of Board continuing education as well as guide the ongoing Board renewal process.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Board agreed to revise the Digital and Technology category to better address emerging issues such as the use of data and analytics, digital transformation, cyber security and other technology risks. This reflects the Board's focus on cyber-related topics in education sessions.\n\n## Board performance\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of continuously monitoring and improving its performance and the performance of its Committees. The Board internally assesses its performance annually, with an independent external review of the Board and its Committees every three years.\n\nThe results of the 2022 internal review were made available to the Board in August 2022. It concluded that while both the Board and ELT see the relationship as respectful, constructive and well-balanced, more informal engagement between the Board and ELT was an area of opportunity. Other areas of future focus included more time for unstructured discussion and more opportunity for education and study, contributing to knowledge and understanding of each other's strengths, skills and experience.\n\n## Board renewal\n\nFollowing Paul O'Malley's appointment as Board Chair on 10 August 2022, he retired as Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee, becoming the Chair of the Nominations Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. Simon Moutter became Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee and Julie Galbo became a member of the Audit Committee and Risk & Compliance Committee.\n\nLyn Cobley was appointed to the Board on 1 October 2022. She brings over 30 years' experience in senior positions at Australian and global banks, with deep experience in financial risk management, leadership and culture, and navigating complexity in a highly regulated environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information is available at commbank.com.au/corporategovernance\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nThe Board Skills Matrix sets out the

We serve more than 17 million customers with a focus on providing retail and commercial banking services predominantly in Australia, and in New Zealand through our subsidiary ASB. Our products and services are provided through our divisions, Retail Banking Services, Business Banking, Institutional Banking and Markets, and ASB New Zealand.\n\n- A review of the divisional operations and their results for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 can be found on pages 56-59.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Simpler, better foundations\n\nWe have undertaken and completed a number of transactions that are consistent with our strategy to focus on our core banking business.\n\nOn 21 June 2021, the Group announced the sale of CommInsure General Insurance to Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd (Hollard). The sale completed on 30 September 2022.\n\nThere have been no other significant changes in the nature of the principal activities of the Group during the financial year.\n\n- For further details, refer to Note 1.1 and Note 11.3 in the Financial report on pages 127 and 259, respectively.\n\n## Operating and financial review\n\nThe Operating and financial review section includes the information below as well as the information in the Overview section on pages 2-7, Creating Value section on pages 8-81 and Financial performance section on pages 50-59.\n\n## Group profit\n\nThe Group's statutory net profit after tax for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 was $10,090 million, a decrease of $681 million or 6% on the prior year. Statutory net profit after tax from continuing operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 was $10,188 million, an increase of $515 million or 5% on the prior year. The increase was driven by a 10% increase in total operating income, partly offset by a 4% increase in operating expenses and a $1,465 million increase in loan impairment expense.\n\nStatutory net loss after tax from discontinued operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 was $98 million, compared to the net profit of $1,098 million in the prior year. This was predominantly driven by gains on completion of significant business divestments in the prior year.\n\nStatutory net profit after tax complies with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The cash net profit after tax is management's preferred measure of the Group's financial performance. It excludes items that are non-recurring in nature and are not considered representative of the Group's ongoing financial performance (non-cash items). We use the cash net profit after tax to present a clear and consistent view of our financial performance from period to period.\n\nThe Group's cash net profit after tax including discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $10,182 million, an increase of $474  million or 5% on the prior year. Excluding discontinued operations, cash net profit after tax for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $10,164 million, an increase of $569 million or 6% on the prior year. For further detail on the drivers of cash net profit after tax, refer to the Financial performance section on pages 50-59.\n\n## Cash to statutory profit reconciliation\n\nStatutory net profit after tax includes the following non-cash items:\n\n|                                                                                                                                  | Continuing operations   | Continuing operations   | Total including  discontinued operations   | Total including  discontinued operations   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                  | FY23                    | FY22                    | FY23                                       | FY22                                       |\n| Net profit after tax - cash basis                                                                                                | 10,164                  | 9,595                   | 10,182                                     | 9,708                                      |\n| Gain/(loss) on acquisition, disposal, closure and demerger of businesses  and associates (classified as discontinued operations) | 32                      | (30)                    | (84)                                       | 955                                        |\n| Hedging and IFRS volatility                                                                                                      | (8)                     | 108                     | (8)                                        | 108                                        |\n| Net profit after tax - statutory basis                                                                                           | 10,188                  | 9,673                   | 10,090                                     | 10,771                                     |\n\nNon-cash items include:\n\n- \u00b7 Gain/(loss) on acquisition, disposal, closure and demerger of businesses and associates (classified as discontinued operations): Gains and losses on these transactions are inclusive of foreign exchange impacts, impairments, restructuring, separation and transaction costs and cover both controlled businesses and associates classified as discontinued operations.\n- \u00b7 Hedging and IFRS volatility: Hedging and IFRS volatility represents timing differences between fair value movements on qualifying economic hedges and the underlying exposure.

Australian home loan growth of 5% was in line with market growth.\n\nBusiness and corporate loans increased $17 billion or 7%, driven by business lending growth across a number of industries.\n\nDeposits increased $41 billion or 5%, primarily driven by continued growth in savings, investments and transaction deposits. The growth in deposits was driven by greater demand for higher yielding deposits.\n\nDebt issues increased $5 billion or 5%, reflecting higher wholesale funding requirements due to lending volume growth.\n\n|                                         | As at     | As at     | As at    |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Total Group assets and liabilities ($m) | 30 Jun 23 | 30 Jun 22 | % change |\n| Home loans                              | 652,218   | 621,993   | 5%       |\n| Consumer finance                        | 17,042    | 16,494    | 3%       |\n| Business and corporate loans            | 261,512   | 244,380   | 7%       |\n| Total Group lending                     | 930,772   | 882,867   | 5%       |\n| Other assets                            | 322,073   | 332,393   | (3%)     |\n| Total assets                            | 1,252,845 | 1,215,260 | 3%       |\n| Deposits                                | 896,440   | 855,931   | 5%       |\n| Debt issues                             | 122,267   | 116,902   | 5%       |\n| Term funding from central banks         | 54,220    | 54,807    | (1%)     |\n| Other liabilities                       | 107,913   | 114,782   | (6%)     |\n| Total liabilities                       | 1,180,840 | 1,142,422 | 3%       |\n\nFurther information and analysis of the financial performance of the Group for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 can be found in the Financial performance section on pages 50-59 of this Annual Report. Details on our risk management processes, material risks and approach to managing them, including a description of the material trends in our current external operating context and more information on our business strategies can be found in the Overview (pages 2-7), Creating Value section (pages 8-81), including the Managing our risks section (pages 60-65) of this Annual Report.\n\nWith the transition out of the pandemic, COVID-19 is no longer considered a material business risk to the Group. Through the ongoing operation of the Group's Risk Management Framework, any residual impacts of the pandemic are considered through the assessment and management of the Group's existing risk types. The Group however still retains $54.2 billion in funding facilities from the RBA and RBNZ that will mature over the next few years, and has $609 million in loans outstanding under the SME Loan Guarantee Scheme.\n\nOther than the information included in the operating and financial review and throughout this Annual Report by cross reference, information on other likely developments, business strategies and prospects for future financial years of the Group's operations has not been included in this report as it would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Group.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDetails of dividends paid and dividends determined are outlined in Note 8.4 in the Financial report on pages 202-203.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The proceedings include:\n\n- \u00b7 The defence of ten class actions. These include two separate shareholder class action proceedings (which have proceeded to trial and now await judgment), three class action claims in relation to superannuation products (one of which has settled, subject to Court approval), a class action that was commenced by Bankwest customers (which has settled, subject to Court approval), a class action in relation to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans (which has settled, subject to Court approval), two class actions related to financial advice, as well as a class action commenced in New Zealand against ASB Bank regarding disclosure of loan variations;\n- \u00b7 One ASIC civil penalty proceeding against CBA and a Group entity (ASIC's appeal in respect of which has been heard with judgment reserved);\n- \u00b7 One civil penalty proceeding brought against CBA and a Group entity by the Fair Work Ombudsman; and\n- \u00b7 One criminal proceeding brought against two Group entities by the Wage Inspectorate Victoria.\n\nThere are also ongoing matters where regulators are investigating whether CBA or a Group entity has breached legal or regulatory obligations. Where a breach has occurred, regulators may impose, or apply to a Court for, fines and/or other sanctions. The Group is also party to five enforceable undertakings and one compliance program with a regulator and continues to receive various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews.\n\nIn addition to possible regulatory actions and reviews, there may also be financial exposure to claims by customers, third parties and shareholders and this could include further class actions, customer remediation or claims for compensation. The outcomes and total costs associated with such regulatory actions and reviews, and possible claims remain uncertain.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor each of these proceedings and investigations. CBA also continues to engage with its regulators in relation to the matters under investigation.\n\n- For further information about some of the more significant litigation and regulatory matters referred to above, refer to Note 7.1 in the Financial report on pages 190-193.\n\n## Change in state of a/ffairs\n\nSignificant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year include:\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in the nature of principal activities outlined in the Simpler, better foundations section on page 82.\n- \u00b7 Changes to the Board as outlined in the Our approach to corporate governance section on pages 66-81.\n\nOther than the changes outlined above, there have been no other significant changes in the state of affairs during the financial year.\n\n## Events subsequent to reporting date\n\nThe Directors have determined a fully franked final dividend of 240 cents per share amounting to $4,023 million. The Bank expects the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) for the final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2023 will be satisfied in full by an on-market purchase of shares of approximately $700 million.\n\nOn 9 August 2023, following the completion of the previously announced $3 billion on-market share buy-back, the Bank announced its intention to undertake a further $1 billion on-market share buy-back. The Bank reserves the right to vary, suspend or terminate the buy-back at any time.\n\nThe Directors are not aware of any other matter or circumstance that has occurred since 30 June 2023, that has significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial years.\n\n## Environmental reporting\n\nWe are subject to the Federal Government's National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme. The scheme makes it mandatory for controlling corporations to report annually on greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and energy consumption, if they exceed certain threshold levels. Our NGER submission is independently audited and submitted before the deadline to ensure that the Group meets the NGER requirements.\n\nWe do not believe that we are subject to any other significant environmental reporting regulations under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of Australia.\n\n- For more information on our voluntary environmental reporting, see the Environmental section on pages 22-23 and our Sustainability performance on pages 40-41. For further detail on our approach to climate change, refer to our 2023 Climate Report.\n\n## Modern slavery reporting\n\nWe are subject to Australia's Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) and as required by that legislation, we published our 2022 Modern Slavery Statement (Statement) in December 2022. The Statement outlines the actions taken by the Group to identify, assess and mitigate modern slavery and human trafficking risks in our operations and supply chain, over the financial year ended 30 June 2022. We remain focused on this critical issue and will continue to report in line with the Modern Slavery Act requirements. This disclosure builds upon our annual reporting for the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 , having published our first Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement in 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further detail on our disclosures, refer to our Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking statement at commbank.com.au/sustainabilityreporting\n\n## Directors and Directors' meetings\n\nThe Board of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia met 10 times during the year ended 30 June 2023. In addition, Directors attended Board strategy sessions and special purpose committee meetings during the year.\n\nThe following table includes:\n\n- \u00b7 names of the Directors holding office at any time during, or since the end of, the financial year; and\n- \u00b7 the number of scheduled and unscheduled Board and Board Committee meetings held during the financial year for which each Director was a member of the Board or relevant Board Committee and eligible to attend, and the number of meetings attended by each Director.\n\nAll Directors may attend Board Committee meetings (with the exception of the Nominations Committee) even if they are not a member of the relevant Committee. The table below excludes the attendance of those Directors who attended meetings of Board Committees of which they are not a member.\n\n|                              | Board Committees    | Board

The Bank's Directors, and other individuals described in the preceding paragraph, rely on the terms of their individual deed of indemnity and not the indemnity deed poll.\n\nThe deed poll has been executed by the Bank in favour of each:\n\n- \u00b7 secretary and senior manager of the Bank;\n- \u00b7 director, secretary or senior manager of a related body corporate of the Bank;\n- \u00b7 person who, at the request of the Bank or a related body corporate, acts as director, secretary or senior manager of a body corporate which is not a related body corporate of the Bank (in which case the indemnity operates only in excess of protection provided by that body corporate); and\n- \u00b7 person who, at the request of a related body corporate of the Bank, acts as a member of the compliance committee of a registered scheme for which the related body corporate of the Bank is the responsible entity.\n\nIn the case of a subsidiary or partly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, where a director, company secretary or a senior manager of that entity holds such a position as a nominee of or due to being nominated by an entity which is not a related body corporate of the Bank, the indemnity deed poll will not apply to that person unless the Bank's CEO has certified that the indemnity will apply to that person.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe Bank has, during the financial year, paid an insurance premium in respect of a Directors' and Officers' liability and company reimbursement insurance policy for the benefit of the Bank and persons defined in the insurance policy who include Directors, Company Secretaries, Officers and certain employees of the Bank and related bodies corporate. The insurance is appropriate pursuant to section 199B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). In accordance with commercial practice, the insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the terms of the policy, including the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium.\n\n## Proceedings on behalf of the Bank\n\nNo application has been made under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) in respect of the Bank, and there are no proceedings that a person has brought or intervened in on behalf of the Bank under that section.\n\n## Rounding and presentation of amounts\n\nCommonwealth Bank is an entity to which ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 (Instrument) dated 24 March 2016, relating to the rounding of amounts in directors' reports and financial reports, applies. Pursuant to this Instrument, amounts in this Directors' report and the accompanying financial report have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n## Company secretaries\n\nCarmel Mulhern was appointed Company Secretary of the Bank on 10 December 2020. Carmel is also the Bank's Group General Counsel and Group Executive, Legal & Group Secretariat and her experience is set out on page 79.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nThe Group delivered strong performance in the 2023 financial year while remaining focused on doing the right thing for our customers, shareholders, people and communities.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2023 Remuneration Report following my first year chairing the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\nWe acknowledge community and stakeholder expectations that the remuneration of Executives should be commensurate and closely aligned to balanced financial and non-financial performance outcomes, appropriately governed, and support sustainable long-term value creation. This has been our strong focus as a Board and it is pleasing that the Group has continued to build on our robust risk management foundations and demonstrate our values of Care, Courage and Commitment to progress our strategy of building tomorrow's bank today for our customers. Our focus on sustainable performance has underpinned another year of good outcomes for our customers and stakeholders and that is reflected in executive remuneration outcomes.\n\n## Financial performance and target setting\n\nThe Group overall and the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) have performed strongly this year. Cash Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) was $10,182 million, up 5%, and the Bank's capital position remains strong.\n\nThese results demonstrate disciplined execution of our strategic priorities, and growth in a challenging and competitive\n\nmarket. Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over the period 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2023 was above peers and dividends returned to shareholders were higher than the prior year.\n\nAs the Board monitored Executives' performance during the financial year, it became apparent that rapidly changing macroeconomic factors, in particular central bank interest rate increases, differed from our assumptions at the start of the year. This warranted a mid-year review of the financial targets.\n\nThe Board therefore exercised its discretion to increase the Group NPAT and Profit after Capital Charge (PACC) targets mid-year, an action that was considered to be fair to our shareholders and our Executives given the extraordinary market conditions. Through excellent financial management and operational execution, Group NPAT and PACC results materially exceeded these more challenging targets, a good outcome for our shareholders.\n\n## Non-financial performance and remuneration\n\nAs Australia's largest bank, we have a responsibility to the people we serve: our customers, people, communities, and shareholders. Consistent with Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA), the Board firmly believes that non-financial measures\n\n## In this section\n\nRemuneration overview\n\n90\n\n- 1. Variable remuneration outcomes for the financial year ended 30 June 2023\n\n99\n\n- 2. Executive remuneration framework in detail 101\n- 3. Executive statutory remuneration\n\n106\n\n- 4. Risk and remuneration consequences 112\n- 5. Non-Executive Director arrangements 113\n- 6. Loans and other transactions\n\n116\n\nare leading indicators of sustainable future performance and value creation and fully endorses the need to assess and reward executives for non-financial as well as financial outcomes. These measures reflect our values, leadership principles, strategy, customer outcomes and environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities, and have been part of our remuneration framework for a number of years.\n\nWe ended the year ranked first relative to the other major peer banks in customer advocacy as measured by net promoter score (NPS). We have many opportunities to improve further and are encouraging and supporting our people to deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n\nWe recognise that some customers are under pressure in the current environment. We remain focused on proactively supporting those customers with enhanced procedures, assistance measures, and tools and training for our people, to provide the right support when customers need it most, including keeping them safe from cyber security threats, frauds and scams.\n\nOur ESG obligations and ambitions are prioritised as they are integral to our purpose to build a brighter future for all, critical to our overarching strategy, and are incorporated in executive performance scorecards and risk milestones.\n\nThe Bank has continued to make progress towards achievement of its gender diversity goals, and has maintained high levels of employee engagement. Our corporate reputation, as measured independently by RepTrak, is the highest among our peers.\n\nFinancial and non-financial performance are considerations for short-term variable remuneration (STVR) outcomes. Leadership and strategy outcomes also determine whether long-term alignment remuneration (LTAR) awards are granted and, consistent with new APRA requirements, final vesting outcomes, a change to our executive remuneration framework implemented from this year.\n\n- Additional detail on our performance outcomes can be found on page 99.\n\n## Culture, accountability and remuneration\n\nOur remuneration framework, including consequences for when expectations are not met, supports the Group's commitment to do the right thing for our customers, people, communities, and shareholders.\n\nFY23 outcomes are inclusive of STVR risk adjustments applied to three Executives, including roles not defined as Key Management Personnel (KMP), applying the risk and reputation modifier. Two Executives received a downward adjustment to their STVR as a result of risk related matters and one received an upward adjustment for risk and reputation considerations.\n\nRisk management is a core element of our approach to performance, from setting expectations to assessing outcomes. Our people understand the importance of managing risk to deliver better outcomes for customers. Over time the proportion of our people fully meeting the Group's risk expectations has improved. This reflects the impact of our programs of work aimed at improving risk management, together with the impact of consequences when expectations are not met.\n\nIt is encouraging to see more of our people also being recognised for managing risk well.\n\n- Additional detail on consequences and remuneration adjustments can be found on page 112.\n\n## Performance and\n\nremuneration outcomes\n\nThe Board considered performance outcomes both in the context of FY23 and over a multi-year period and approved:\n\n- \u00b7 In the 2023 financial year, fixed remuneration remained unchanged for eight of the 10 Executive KMP, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Increases were received by the other Executive KMP. The average FR increase across the KMP was 1.3%.\n- \u00b7 FY23 STVR outcomes between 73% and 100% of maximum, a direct reflection of Group financial performance and strong non-financial outcomes for both individual and collective measures.\n- \u00b7 FY23 LTAR grant awarded with no reduction, consistent with the design and objective to reinforce individual leadership and strategy execution. Final outcomes will be assessed prior to vesting as part of the new pre-vest assessment introduced for FY23.\n- \u00b7 FY20 long-term variable remuneration (LTVR) vesting outcome of 92.5%, which reflects TSR performance of 70th percentile and strong performance across employee engagement and trust and reputation over the long term.\n- \u00b7 FY23 realised remuneration for the CEO and six Executives incorporates the FY19 LTVR vesting at 100%\n\non the basis of strong outcomes on relative TSR, trust and reputation, and employee engagement over the four-year performance period, ending 30 June 2022. The face value of the award at vesting was 39% higher than at the time of grant due to the increase in share price during the period (from $72.84 to $101.52). The TSR over this same period was 59%, reflecting strong return for our shareholders.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Fees\n\nThere was no change to Directors' fees or the fee pool.\n\n- Additional detail on the Directors' fees are provided on page 113.\n\n## Our future and an invitation\n\nLooking ahead we are focused on relentlessly improving our customers' lived experience and the best way to do this is with an engaged and skilled workforce. Our priorities as a People & Remuneration Committee are to ensure that our people and remuneration strategy, frameworks and practices continue to support the Group's strategic priorities and cultural ambitions, are future fit, and are compliant with all applicable local and global regulatory requirements.\n\nFrom 1 July 2023, changes to our remuneration framework have been implemented in full to meet the requirements of APRA Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration. This will further strengthen our governance, remuneration and accountability practices, with regular effectiveness reviews to consider outcomes for our Executives as well as the broader workforce.\n\nWe continue to enhance our performance assessment approach through simplification, clarity, and appropriate alignment of KPIs in scorecards. These changes aim to further strengthen variable remuneration linkage in line with individual and collective performance.\n\nI invite you to read the Remuneration Report and welcome your feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Moutter People & Remuneration Committee Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

The responsibilities of the People & Remuneration Committee are outlined in its Charter, which is reviewed annually.\n\n- The Charter is available at commbank.com.au/peopleandremuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the performance and risk review, and to support the determination of remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Group Executives, the People & Remuneration Committee meets concurrently with the Risk & Compliance, Audit, and Nominations Committees in February and June. These concurrent meetings provide an opportunity for the Committees to review and discuss relevant risk and audit matters that may warrant consideration in the People & Remuneration Committee's determination of remuneration outcomes, including any in-year or malus adjustments or clawback for the CEO and Group Executives (including former Group Executives) and the determination of the Group-wide short-term variable remuneration (STVR) pool. Information provided to the concurrent meetings supports determination of collective and/or individual remuneration impacts and includes risk scorecards for the CEO and Group Executives, details of material risk matters, outcomes of internal audit reviews conducted during the year, and consideration of the quality of CBA's financial results.\n\nThe Risk & Remuneration Review Committee, a management committee that advises the Group CRO, oversees assessment of accountability for material risk matters, including those impacting CBA's reputation, and application of remuneration adjustments as appropriate for employees at and below the Executive General Manager level.\n\nIn line with New Zealand regulatory requirements, the performance and remuneration arrangements and outcomes for the CEO ASB, are determined and approved by the Board of ASB.\n\n## External advisors\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, external advisors were engaged to provide information to the People & Remuneration Committee to assist with making remuneration decisions. The People & Remuneration Committee did not seek or receive any remuneration recommendations from external advisors in the 2023 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

TSR outcomes are calculated by an external provider.\n\n## TSR relative to a general ASX peer group\n\n- \u00b7 The peer group is made up of the 20 largest companies on the ASX by market capitalisation at the beginning of the performance period, excluding resources companies and CBA. This cross-industry peer group has been chosen as it represents the typical portfolio of companies in which CBA's shareholders invest, and so provides relevant benchmarks for measuring CBA's TSR.\n- \u00b7 The peer group at the beginning of the performance period for the relative TSR performance measure comprised (in alphabetic order):\n- - ANZ Group Holdings Limited\n- - Aristocrat Leisure Limited\n- - ASX Limited\n- - Brambles Limited\n- - Coles Group Limited\n- - Computershare Limited\n- - CSL Limited\n- - Goodman Group\n- - James Hardie Industries PLC\n- - Macquarie Group Limited\n- - National Australia Bank Limited\n- - QBE Insurance Group Limited\n- - Ramsay Health Care Limited\n- - REA Group Ltd\n- - Sonic Healthcare Limited\n- - Telstra Group Limited\n- - Transurban Group\n- - Wesfarmers Limited\n- - Westpac Banking Corporation\n- - Woolworths Group Limited\n\nA reserve bench company will be substituted (in order of market capitalisation as at the beginning of the performance period) into the peer group when a peer group company ceases to be listed on the ASX as a result of an acquisition, merger or other relevant corporate action or delisting. The reserve bench (in order of market capitalisation) comprised: Suncorp Group Limited, Amcor PLC, Endeavour Group Limited, Scentre Group and APA Group.\n\n## TSR relative to a financial services peer group\n\n- \u00b7 The peer group is made up of the eight most comparable financial services companies listed on the ASX at the beginning of the performance period.\n- \u00b7 The financial services peer group at the beginning of the performance period for the relative TSR performance hurdle comprised:\n- - AMP Limited\n- - ANZ Group Holdings Limited\n- - Bank of Queensland Limited\n- - Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Limited\n- - Macquarie Group Limited\n- - National Australia Bank Limited\n- - Suncorp Group Limited\n- - Westpac Banking Corporation\n\nThere is no reserve bench for this peer group. The companies comprising each peer group are subject to change at the Board's discretion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There were two downward risk-related adjustments to the Executive Leadership Team STVR outcomes in the 2023 financial year. Remuneration adjustments for remaining employees in relation to the 2023 financial year will be finalised in September 2023 in line with the CBA-wide annual remuneration review process and will be outlined in the 2024 Remuneration Report.\n\n|                                                        | 2022 financial year                                        | 2021 financial year                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees rated 'exceptionally  managed' for risk      | 588 employees                                              | 463 employees                                              |\n| Employees rated 'partially met'  or 'not met' for risk | 1,918 employees  (including 20 General Managers and above) | 2,255 employees  (including 22 General Managers and above) |\n\nCBA recognises and rewards a cohort of employees rated 'exceptionally managed' for managing risk in a way that brings our purpose and values to life. Everyday risk recognition continues to be incorporated in the Group-wide recognition platform, providing our people with the ability to recognise positive risk behaviours.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, 93.8% of employees were assessed as fully meeting risk expectations in their roles (92.7% in 2021).\n\nSTVR outcomes have been reduced by a minimum of 10% for 'partially met' ratings since the 2019 financial year and ranged up to 100% for 'not met' ratings.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, CBA's consequence management framework was further embedded with 1,122 instances of substantiated misconduct, with 119 resulting in termination (of which, one was a senior leader (General Manager or Executive General Manager).\n\nRisk assessment in performance and remuneration\n\nCBA's performance and remuneration frameworks support and promote the mitigation of risk by holding employees individually and collectively accountable for managing role-related risks and non-compliance to the Group's Code of Conduct, including policies such as Group Mandatory Learning.\n\nGroup-wide risk assessment guidance including examples is continually enhanced to set clear expectations of managing risks for both employees and managers, and to help people leaders consistently assess risk behaviours and outcomes, determine the appropriate level of STVR adjustments for not fully meeting expectations, and document the reasons for their assessment.\n\nExecutive risk assessments continue to be supported by comprehensive reporting, independent assessment by the Chief Risk Officer, and concurrent committee meetings as part of the interim and annual performance assessment processes.\n\nComprehensive reporting is provided to the Board to support its oversight of risk assessment and STVR outcomes and to inform the Board's guidance for the annual performance and remuneration review.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\n- \u00b7 Malus (the ability to reduce, and/or lapse granted variable remuneration before it has vested) and clawback (the recovery of variable remuneration that has been paid or vested) are embedded within our consequence management framework.\n- \u00b7 Malus adjustments have been made to unvested deferred variable remuneration in relation to poor risk outcomes and/or misconduct. In the 2022 financial year, impacted employees received malus adjustments ranging from 21% to 100% as a result of poor risk outcomes.\n- \u00b7 To the extent in-year or malus adjustments are insufficient to satisfy remuneration consequences determined by the Board, clawback may be applied to the variable remuneration awarded to the CEO, GEs, and other regulated roles of the Group in line with prudential requirements.\n- \u00b7 The time horizon of application has also been aligned to the latest APRA regulatory obligation, i.e in general, the Board may exercise clawback in relation to applicable roles for at least two years from the date of payment or vesting, including where the employment or engagement of the person has ceased.\n\n5.\n\n## Non-Executive Director arrangements\n\nThe table below outlines the Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2023. From 1 July 2019, Non-Executive Directors are required to hold CBA shares equivalent to 100% of Board Chair fees for the Chair and 100% of Board member fees for Non-Executive Directors. This is to be accumulated within five years commencing the later of 1 July 2019 or date of appointment, valued with reference to the prevailing CBA share price at the relevant accumulation commencement date. This is also the starting date for compliance with the revised MSR within five years.

Non-Executive Directors do not receive any performance-related remuneration. The total amount of Non-Executive Directors' fees is capped at a maximum fee pool that is approved by shareholders. The current fee pool is $4.75 million, which was approved by shareholders at CBA's 2015 Annual General Meeting on 17 November 2015.\n\nFees are reviewed and recommended to the Board at least every two years. The last fee review was undertaken in the 2022 financial year. No changes to fees were made in the 2023 financial year. Fees are inclusive of base fees and statutory superannuation. The Chair does not receive separate Committee fees.\n\nThe following table outlines the Non-Executive Directors' fees for the Board and the Committees for the periods 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023.\n\n| Board/Committee                                            | Chair  $   | Member  $   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|\n| Board                                                      | 890,000    | 242,000     |\n| Audit Committee                                            | 70,000     | 35,000      |\n| Risk & Compliance Committee                                | 70,000     | 35,000      |\n| People & Remuneration Committee                            | 70,000     | 35,000      |\n| Nominations Committee 1                                    | -          | 12,500      |\n| United Kingdom Remuneration Assurance Committee (UK RAC) 2 | 30,000     | 18,000      |\n\n- 1 The Chair of the Board is also the Chair of the Nominations Committee, no additional fee is paid for this.\n- 2 Board members who also serve as members of the UK RAC receive fees in relation to this service, and these fees are set appropriately below fees for UK RAC independent members given a small portion of UK RAC matters overlap with People & Remuneration Committee matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reasons for this are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the effective operation of the Group External Auditor Services Policy during the year to restrict the nature of non-audit services engagements, to prohibit certain services and to require Board Audit Committee pre-approval for all such engagements; and\n- \u00b7 the relative quantum of fees paid for non-audit services compared to the quantum for audit, and audit-related services was appropriate.\n\nThe above Directors' statements are in accordance with the advice received from the Audit Committee.\n\n## Incorporation of additional material\n\nThe following sections form part of this report and should be read in conjunction:\n\n- \u00b7 the Our approach to corporate governance section on pages 66-81;\n- \u00b7 information on Directors' shareholdings, share rights and options on pages 106, 107 and 113;\n- \u00b7 the Remuneration report can be found on pages 88-116;\n- \u00b7 dividend information can be found in Note 8.4 to the Financial report on pages 202-203;\n- \u00b7 non-audit services information can be found in Note 12.3 to the Financial report on page 263; and\n- \u00b7 the external auditor's independence declaration on page 118.\n\nThis Directors' report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaul O'Malley\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatt Comyn\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer\n\n9 August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.\n\nThe Bank is a for-profit entity incorporated and domiciled in Australia. It is a company limited by shares that are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The registered office is Commonwealth Bank Place South, Level 1, 11 Harbour Street, NSW 2000, Australia.\n\nThe Financial Report includes the consolidated and standalone financial statements of the Group and the Bank, respectively. Notes accompanying the financial statements and the Directors' declaration form part of the Financial Report.\n\nOn 30 September 2022, the Group completed the sale of CommInsure General Insurance to Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd.\n\nThere have been no other significant changes in the nature of the principal activities of the Group during the year.\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Financial Report:\n\n- \u00b7 is a general purpose financial report;\n- \u00b7 has been prepared in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- \u00b7 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth);\n- \u00b7 is presented in Australian dollars, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency, with all values rounded to the nearest million dollars ($M) in accordance with ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 unless otherwise indicated;\n- \u00b7 includes foreign currency transactions that are translated into the functional currency, using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of each transaction;\n- \u00b7 has been prepared on a going concern basis using a historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) measured at fair value;\n- \u00b7 presents assets and liabilities on the face of the Balance Sheets in decreasing order of liquidity;\n- \u00b7 where required, presents restated comparative information for consistency with the current year's presentation in the Financial Report; and\n- \u00b7 contains accounting policies that have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Changes in comparatives\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nThe financial results of businesses reclassified as discontinued operations are excluded from the results of the continuing operations and are presented as a single line item Net profit/(loss) after income tax from discontinued operations in the Income Statement, and Other Comprehensive Income/(expense) net of income tax from discontinued operations in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe Income Statements and the Statements of Comprehensive Income for comparative periods are also restated. Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations subject to disposal have been presented on the Balance Sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. The Balance Sheet is not restated when a business is reclassified as a discontinued operation.\n\n## Re-segmentation\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group made a number of allocations and reclassifications including refinements to the allocation of support units and other costs. These changes have not impacted the Group's net profit, but have resulted in changes to the presentation of the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet of the affected segments. These changes have been applied retrospectively.\n\n127\n\n<!-- image -->",

In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced LIBOR cessation dates, after which representative LIBOR rates will no longer be available.

In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced LIBOR cessation dates, after which representative LIBOR rates will no longer be available.\n\n## IBOR reform program IBOR reform program\n\nIn October 2018, the Group formed the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Program (the Program) which was tasked with addressing the impact to the Group resulting from the transition from IBORs to risk-free reference rates (RFRs). The Program includes a formal governance structure to ensure clear accountability for all decisions, and incorporates the requisite risk, treasury, finance, legal, business, and support functions. In October 2018, the Group formed the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Program (the Program) which was tasked with addressing the impact to the Group resulting from the transition from IBORs to risk-free reference rates (RFRs). The Program includes a formal governance structure to ensure clear accountability for all decisions, and incorporates the requisite risk, treasury, finance, legal, business, and support functions.\n\nThe transition from IBORs to RFRs resulted in various risks to the Group, including operational, financial, legal, compliance and conduct risks. These risks stemmed from, amongst others, the need for new products that incorporate RFRs, the impact of IBOR related changes on customers and financial instrument counterparties, as well as the need for different system and process capabilities. The Group under direction of the Program, applied various means of eliminating and managing these risks, while ensuring that customer outcomes are appropriate and any disruption to business is minimised. No material changes were made to the Group's risk management strategy because of IBOR reform and the use of LIBOR in new products was phased out in accordance with industry and supervisory guidance.

Annual fees that are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are deferred on the Balance Sheet in Bills payable and other liabilities and recognised on a straight-line basis over the year. Transaction based fees are charged and recognised at the time of the transaction;\n- \u00b7 commitment fees and fees in relation to guarantee arrangements are deferred and recognised over the life of the contractual arrangements;\n- \u00b7 fee income is earned for providing advisory or arrangement services, placement and underwriting services. These fees are recognised and charged when the related service is completed which is typically at the time of the transaction;\n- \u00b7 the Group assesses whether the nature of the arrangement with its customer is as a principal provider or an agent of another party. Where the Group acts as an agent for another party, the income earned by the Group is the net consideration received. As an agent, the net consideration represents fee income for facilitating the transaction between the customer and the third party provider with primary responsibility for fulfilling the contract; and\n- \u00b7 commission income is presented net of directly attributable incremental external costs. Directly attributable incremental costs are the costs that would not have been incurred if a specific service had not been provided to a customer. These costs include the costs associated with credit card loyalty programs which are recognised as an expense when the services are provided on the redemption of points, cards processing expenses and certain other volume related expenses.\n\nEstablishment fees on financing facilities are deferred and amortised to interest income over the expected life of the loan and are not recognised when the commitment is issued.\n\nTrading income represents both realised and unrealised gains and losses from changes in the fair value of trading assets, liabilities and derivatives, which are recognised in the period in which they arise.\n\nNet gain/(loss) on non-trading financial instruments includes realised and unrealised gains and losses from non-trading financial assets and liabilities, as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses on non-trading derivatives that are held for risk management purposes.\n\nNet gain/(loss) on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between proceeds received and its carrying value.\n\nNet hedging ineffectiveness is measured on fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges.\n\nDividends received on non-trading equity investments are recognised on the ex-dividend date or when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nFunds management fees are recognised over the service period as the performance obligation is met and when it is probable that the revenue will be received.\n\nThe Group equity accounts for its share of the profits or losses of associate or joint venture investments, net of impairment recognised. Dividends received are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nOther income includes rental income on operating leases which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This income is presented net of depreciation and impairment expense on the associated operating lease assets held by the Group.\n\nOther income also includes the impact of foreign currency revaluations for foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are retranslated at the spot rate at the Balance Sheet date. Exchange differences arising upon settling or translating monetary items at different rates to those at which they were initially recognised or previously reported, are recognised in the Income Statement.\n\n137\n\nF\n\nI\n\nNAN\n\nC\n\nI\n\nAL\n\nR\n\nE\n\nP\n\nO\n\nRT\n\n<!-- image -->",

leave, employee incentives and relevant taxes. Staff expenses are recognised over the period the employee renders the service. Long service leave is discounted to present value using assumptions relating to staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary.\n\nShare-based compensation includes plans which may be cash or equity settled. Cash settled share-based remuneration is recognised as a liability and re-measured to fair value until settled. The changes in fair value are recognised as staff expenses. Equity settled remuneration is fair valued at the grant date and amortised to staff expenses over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in the Employee compensation reserve.\n\nSuperannuation  expense  includes  expenses  relating  to  defined  contribution  and  defined  benefit  superannuation  plans.  Defined contribution expense is recognised in the period the service is provided, whilst the defined benefit expense, which measures current and past service costs, is determined by an actuarial calculation.\n\nOccupancy and equipment expenses include depreciation which is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset, with the depreciation presented within depreciation of Property, plant and equipment.\n\nIT services expenses are recognised as incurred when the related services are delivered, unless they qualify for capitalisation as computer software because they are identifiable and controlled in a way that allows future economic benefits to be obtained and others' access to those benefits can be restricted. Capitalised computer software assets are amortised over their estimated useful life.\n\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the  provider's application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of these costs are incurred for the development of software code that enhances, modifies or creates additional capability to existing on-premises systems and meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset.\n\nThe Group assesses, at each Balance Sheet date, useful lives and residual values of capitalised software assets and Property, plant and equipment and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. If an asset's carrying value is greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.\n\nOther expenses are recognised as the relevant service is rendered. Operating expenses related to provisions are recognised for present obligations arising from past events where a payment to settle the obligation is probable and can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nActuarial valuations of the Group's defined benefit superannuation plans' obligations are dependent on a series of assumptions set out in Note 10.2, including inflation rates, discount rates and salary growth rates. Changes in these assumptions impact the fair value of the plans' obligations, assets, superannuation expense and actuarial gains and losses recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nMeasurements of the Group's share-based compensation is dependent on assumptions, including grant date fair values. Information on these is set out in Note 10.1.\n\nRefer to Note 6.2 for more information on the judgements and estimates associated with goodwill.\n\n139\n\nF\n\nI\n\nNAN\n\nC\n\nI\n\nAL\n\nR\n\nE\n\nP\n\nO\n\nRT\n\n<!-- image -->",

A description of the key components of the Group's impairment methodology is provided below.\n\n## Expected credit loss (ECL) model Expected credit loss (ECL) model\n\nThe  ECL  model  applies  to  all  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  debt  securities  measured  at  fair  value  through Other Comprehensive Income, finance lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The model uses a three-stage approach to recognition of expected credit losses. Financial assets migrate through these stages based on changes in credit risk since origination: The  ECL  model  applies  to  all  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  debt  securities  measured  at  fair  value  through Other Comprehensive Income, finance lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The model uses a three-stage approach to recognition of expected credit losses. Financial assets migrate through these stages based on changes in credit risk since origination:\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 1 - 12 months ECL - Performing loans \u00b7 Stage 1 - 12 months ECL - Performing loans\n\nOn origination, an impairment provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. 12 months ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the next 12 months. On origination, an impairment provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. 12 months ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the next 12 months.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 - Lifetime ECL - Performing loans that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) \u00b7 Stage 2 - Lifetime ECL - Performing loans that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nFinancial assets that have experienced a SICR since origination are transferred to Stage 2 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised. Lifetime ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the remaining life of financial assets. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant the exposure is reclassified to Stage 1 and the impairment provision reverts to 12 months ECL. Financial assets that have experienced a SICR since origination are transferred to Stage 2 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised. Lifetime ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the remaining life of financial assets. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant the exposure is reclassified to Stage 1 and the impairment provision reverts to 12 months ECL.\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 3 - Lifetime ECL - Non-performing loans \u00b7 Stage 3 - Lifetime ECL - Non-performing loans\n\nFinancial assets in default and assets restructured due to the borrower's financial difficulty or hardship are transferred to Stage 3 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised. Financial assets in default and assets restructured due to the borrower's financial difficulty or hardship are transferred to Stage 3 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\nCredit losses for financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are assessed for impairment collectively, whilst those in Stage 3 are subjected to either collective or individual assessment of ECL. Credit losses for financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are assessed for impairment collectively, whilst those in Stage 3 are subjected to either collective or individual assessment of ECL.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR) Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nSICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset at reporting date to the corresponding risk of default at origination. The Group considers all available qualitative and quantitative information that is relevant to assessing SICR. SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset at reporting date to the corresponding risk of default at origination. The Group considers all available qualitative and quantitative information that is relevant to assessing SICR.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, such as the corporate risk rated portfolio and the asset finance portfolio, the risk of default is defined using the existing Risk Rated Probability of Default (PD) Masterscale. The PD Masterscale is used in internal credit risk management and includes 24 risk grades that are assigned at a customer level using rating tools reflecting customer specific financial and non-financial information and management's experienced credit judgement. Internal credit risk ratings are updated regularly on the basis of the most recent financial and non-financial information. For non-retail portfolios, such as the corporate risk rated portfolio and the asset finance portfolio, the risk of default is defined using the existing Risk Rated Probability of Default (PD) Masterscale. The PD Masterscale is used in internal credit risk management and includes 24 risk grades that are assigned at a customer level using rating tools reflecting customer specific financial and non-financial information and management's experienced credit judgement. Internal credit risk ratings are updated regularly on the basis of the most recent financial and non-financial information.\n\nThe Group uses a Retail Masterscale in the ECL measurement on personal loans, credit cards and home loans. The Retail Masterscale has 16 risk grades that are assigned to retail accounts based on their credit quality scores determined through a credit quality scorecard. SME retail portfolios use a similar approach and are mapped to SME Retail pools. Risk grades and pools are updated monthly as credit quality scorecards are recalculated based on new behavioural information.

SME retail portfolios use a similar approach and are mapped to SME Retail pools. Risk grades and pools are updated monthly as credit quality scorecards are recalculated based on new behavioural information.\n\nFor significant portfolios, the primary indicator of SICR is a significant deterioration in an exposure's internal credit rating grade between origination and reporting date. Application of the primary SICR indicator uses a sliding threshold such that an exposure with a higher credit quality at origination would need to experience a more significant downgrade compared to a lower credit quality exposure before SICR is triggered. The level of downgrade required to trigger SICR for each origination grade has been defined for each significant portfolio.

The level of downgrade required to trigger SICR for each origination grade has been defined for each significant portfolio.\n\nThe assessment of significant increase in credit risk includes the impact of forward looking multiple economic scenarios in addition to adjustments for emerging risks at an industry, geographic location or a particular portfolio segment level, which are calculated by stressing an exposure's internal credit rating grade at the reporting date. This accounts for approximately 62% of Stage 2 exposures for the Group and 62% for the Bank as at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: 62% for the Group and 61% for the Bank).

Default occurs when there are indicators that a borrower is unlikely to meet contractual credit obligations to the Group in full, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Non-performing credit exposures include exposures that are in default and exposures that have been restructured due to the borrower's financial difficulty or hardship.\n\nLoans are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.  Unsecured retail loans are generally written off when repayments become 180 days past due. Secured loans are generally written off when assets pledged to the Group have been realised and there are no further prospects of additional recovery.\n\n## ECL measurement\n\nECL is a probability weighted expected credit loss estimated by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nThe Group uses the following collective provisioning models in calculating ECL for significant portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail lending: Personal Loans model, Credit Cards model, Home Loans model; and\n- \u00b7 Non-retail lending: Corporate Risk Rated model, Asset Finance model, Retail SME model.\n\nFor each significant portfolio ECL is calculated as a product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of default (PD): The likelihood that a borrower will be unable to pay its obligations in full without having to take actions such as realising security or that the borrower will become 90 days overdue on an obligation or contractual commitment;\n- \u00b7 Exposure at default (EAD): The expected Balance Sheet exposure at default. The Group generally calculates EAD as the higher of the drawn balance and total credit limit, except for the credit cards portfolio, for which the EAD calculation also takes into account the probability of unused limits being drawn down; and\n- \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD): The amount that is not expected to be recovered following default.\n\nSecured retail exposures and defaulted non-retail exposures are assessed for impairment through an Individually Assessed Provisions (IAP) process if expected losses are in excess of $20,000. Impairment provisions on these exposures are calculated directly as the difference between the defaulted asset's carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows including cash flows from realisation of collateral, where applicable.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure\n\nFor exposures in Stage 2 and Stage 3 impairment provisions are determined as a lifetime expected loss. The Group uses a range of approaches to estimate expected lives of financial instruments subject to ECL requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-revolving products in corporate portfolios : Expected life is determined as a maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Non-revolving retail products : For fixed term products such as personal loans and home loans, expected life is determined using behavioural term analysis and does not exceed the maximum contractual period; and\n- \u00b7 Revolving products in corporate and retail portfolios : For revolving products that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment, such as credit cards and corporate lines of credit, the Group's contractual ability to cancel the undrawn limits and demand repayments does not limit the exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For such products, ECL is measured over the behavioural life.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nCredit risk factors of PD and LGD used in the ECL calculation are point-in-time estimates based on current conditions and adjusted to include the impact of multiple probability-weighted future forecast economic scenarios.\n\nForward looking PD and LGD factors are modelled for each significant portfolio based on macroeconomic factors that are most closely correlated  with  credit  losses  in  the  relevant  portfolios.  Each  of  the  four  scenarios  (refer  below)  includes  a  forecast  of  relevant macroeconomic variables which differ by portfolio:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail portfolios: Interest rates, unemployment rate, GDP per capita and house price index; and\n- \u00b7 Non-retail lending: Unemployment rate, GDP, Business Investment, Disposable Income and exchange rates.\n\nNew Zealand equivalents of a subset of the above macroeconomic variables are used for retail credit exposures originated in New Zealand.\n\nThe Group uses the following four alternative macroeconomic scenarios to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes in estimating ECL for significant portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 Central scenario: This  scenario is based on the Group's internal economic forecasts and market consensus as well as other assumptions used in business planning and forecasting;\n\n157\n\n<!-- image -->",

In order to reflect the increased likelihood of the weaker Central and Upside scenarios, the Group increased the combined weighting of the Central and Upside scenarios from 52.5% to 57.5%. This led to a commensurate decrease in the combined weighting of the Downside and Severe Downside scenarios from 47.5% to 42.5%.

Where applicable, credit risk factors (PD and LGD) are adjusted upwards to incorporate reasonable and supportable forward looking information about known or expected risks for specific segments of portfolios that would otherwise not have been considered in the modelling process. Credit judgement is used to determine the degree of adjustment to be applied and considers information such as emerging risks at an industry, geographic and portfolio segment level.\n\nThe Group also applies overlays which are determined based on a range of techniques including stress testing, benchmarking, scenario analysis and expert judgement. Overlays are subject to internal governance and applied as an incremental ECL top-up amount to the impacted portfolio segments.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, the Group held $571 million of overlays for emerging risks, including the potential impacts of higher interest rates, inflationary pressures, and the residual risks associated with the impacts of COVID-19. This included $87 million in relation to the Group's non-retail lending portfolios and $484 million in relation to retail portfolios. The amount of overlays held by the Group reduced during the year ended 30 June 2023 as a result of the reversal of uncertainties associated with the impact of COVID-19. As at 30 June 2023, the Group held $525 million overlays for emerging risks, including the potential impacts of higher interest rates and inflationary pressures. The overlays included $25 million in relation to the Group's non-retail lending portfolio and $500 million in relation to retail portfolios.\n\nThe Group also applies additional overlays and forward-looking adjustments for other factors that cannot be adequately accounted for through the ECL models.\n\n## Sensitivity of provisions for impairment to changes in forward looking assumptions\n\nAs described above, the Group applies four alternative macroeconomic scenarios (Central, Upside, Downside and Severe downside scenarios) to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes in estimating ECL.\n\nThe table below provides approximate levels of provisions for impairment under the Central and Downside scenarios for the Group and the Bank assuming 100% weighting was applied to each scenario and holding all other assumptions constant. As noted above, these scenarios and their associated weights have been selected based on the expected range of potential future loss outcomes.\n\n|                                   | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                   | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M |\n| Reported probability-weighted ECL | 5,950        | 5,347        | 5,350        | 4,795        |\n| 100% Central scenario             | 3,832        | 3,591        | 3,232        | 3,190        |\n| 100% Downside scenario            | 7,893        | 6,117        | 7,293        | 5,503        |\n\n## Sensitivity of provisions for impairment to SICR assessment criteria\n\nIf 1% of Stage 1 credit exposures as at 30 June 2023 was included in Stage 2, provisions for impairment would increase by approximately $125 million for the Group and $117 million for the Bank (30 June 2022: $151 million for the Group and $138 million for the Bank).\n\nIf 1% of Stage 2 credit exposures as at 30 June 2023 was included in Stage 1, provisions for impairment would decrease by approximately $25 million for the Group and $23 million for the Bank (30 June 2022: $23 million for the Group and $21 million for the Bank).\n\n159\n\n<!-- image -->",

PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nDeposits from customers include certificates of deposit, term deposits, savings deposits and other demand deposits. Deposits are initially recognised at their fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost. Interest incurred is recognised within Net interest income using the effective interest method.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements are retained on the Balance Sheet where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group.

Trading liabilities are incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing or settling in the near term and are measured at fair value through the Income Statement.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, liabilities are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value, excluding those due to changes in the Group's own credit risk in relation to liabilities designated at fair value through the Income Statement on origination, are recognised in Net other operating income. Changes in fair value relating to the Group's own credit risk in relation to liabilities designated at fair value through the Income Statement on origination are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. Interest incurred is recognised within Net interest income on a contractual rate basis, including amortisation of any premium/ discount.\n\nThis category includes a portfolio of repurchase transactions which is managed and for which performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.\n\n161\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the mortgages, it continues to recognise the mortgages on the Balance Sheet. The Group is entitled to any residual income of the securitisation programmes after all payments due to investors have been met, where the Group is the income unitholder. The investors have recourse only to the pool of mortgages in the SPV they have invested in.\n\n## Covered bonds programmes\n\nTo complement existing wholesale funding sources, the Group has established two global covered bond programmes for the Bank and ASB. Certain residential mortgages have been assigned to SPV's associated with covered bond programmes to provide security on the payments to investors. The Group is entitled to any residual income after all payments due to covered bond investors have been met. As the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the mortgages, it continues to recognise the mortgages on the Balance Sheet. The covered investors have dual recourse to the Bank and the covered pool assets.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and es timates\n\nThe Group exercises judgement to assess whether a structured entity should be consolidated based on the Bank's power over the relevant activities of the entity and the significance of its exposure to variable returns of the structured entity. Such assessments are predominantly required for the Group's securitisation programmes, and structured transactions such as covered bond programmes.\n\n165\n\nF\n\nI\n\nNAN\n\nC\n\nI\n\nAL\n\nR\n\nE\n\nP\n\nO\n\nRT\n\n<!-- image -->",

The thresholds for collateral posting vary between two and three notches from the current rating, depending on the ratings agency. The thresholds for novation vary between four and six notches from the current rating, depending on the ratings agency. The fair value of funding these collateral arrangements has been recognised by the Bank as a funding valuation adjustment. The adjustment did not have a material impact on the Bank's Income Statement for the year. As the arrangement is between the Bank and the trusts, the fair value is eliminated on consolidation and will only be recognised by the Group if the trusts are deconsolidated.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, the weighted average fixed interest rate of interest rate swaps hedging interest rate risk was 2.93% (30 June 2022: 1.14%). The major currency pairs of cross currency swaps designated in hedge relationships are receive USD/pay AUD and receive EUR/pay USD with weighted average foreign currency rates of: AUD/USD 0.76 and USD/EUR 0.83 (30 June 2022: AUD/USD 0.78, USD/EUR 0.84).\n\nIn addition to derivative instruments used to hedge foreign currency risk, the Group and the Bank designate debt issues as hedging instruments of certain foreign exchange risk exposures. The carrying value of debt issues designated as cash flow hedging instruments as at 30 June 2023 was $1,008 million with average maturity of 6 years for the Group (30 June 2022: $899 million with average maturity of five years) and nil for the Bank (30 June 2022: nil).\n\n171\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsequent to initial recognition, gains or losses on derivatives are recognised in the Income Statement, unless they are entered into for hedging purposes and designated in a cash flow hedge.\n\n## Hedging strategy and hedge accounting Hedging strategy and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group risk management strategy (refer to notes 9.1 and 9.3) is to manage market risks within risk limits to minimise profit and capital volatility. The use of derivative and other hedging instruments for hedging purposes gives rise to potential volatility in the Income Statement because of mismatches in the accounting treatment between derivatives and other hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged. The Group and the Bank apply hedge accounting to reduce volatility in the Income Statement from hedging activities undertaken.

The Group and the Bank apply hedge accounting to reduce volatility in the Income Statement from hedging activities undertaken.\n\n## Fair value hedges Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or unrecognised firm commitment, predominantly associated with investment securities, debt issues and loan capital. Changes in fair values can arise from fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and futures to protect against such fluctuations. Fair value hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or unrecognised firm commitment, predominantly associated with investment securities, debt issues and loan capital. Changes in fair values can arise from fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and futures to protect against such fluctuations.\n\nChanges in the value of fair value hedges are recognised in the Income Statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. All gains and losses associated with the ineffective portion of fair value hedge relationships are recognised immediately as Net other operating income. Changes in the value of fair value hedges are recognised in the Income Statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. All gains and losses associated with the ineffective portion of fair value hedge relationships are recognised immediately as Net other operating income.\n\nIf the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the Income Statement from the date of discontinuation over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship based on a recalculated effective interest rate. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the Income Statement from the date of discontinuation over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship based on a recalculated effective interest rate. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to variability in future cash flows, which could affect profit or loss and may result from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates or in commodity prices on financial assets, financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions, predominantly associated with floating rate domestic loans and deposits. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, futures and commodity related swaps to protect against such fluctuations. Cash flow hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to variability in future cash flows, which could affect profit or loss and may result from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates or in commodity prices on financial assets, financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions, predominantly associated with floating rate domestic loans and deposits. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, futures and commodity related swaps to protect against such fluctuations.\n\nChanges in fair value associated with the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are recognised through Other Comprehensive Income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the period in which the hedged forecast transaction takes place. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are recognised through Other Comprehensive Income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the period in which the hedged forecast transaction takes place.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is recycled immediately to the Income Statement. Where it is appropriate, non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are also designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is recycled immediately to the Income Statement. Where it is appropriate, non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are also designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships.\n\n## Net investment hedges Net investment hedges\n\nThe Group holds investments in foreign operations, where changes in net assets resulting from changes in foreign currency rates are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve and result in volatility in shareholders' equity. To protect against the foreign currency risk, the Group enters into foreign currency forwards that are designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges. Gains and losses on derivative contracts relating to the effective portion of the net investment hedge are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign subsidiary or branch is disposed of.

Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign subsidiary or branch is disposed of.\n\n## Risk components Risk components\n\nIn some hedging relationships, the Group and the Bank designate risk components of hedged items as follows: In some hedging relationships, the Group and the Bank designate risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Bank Bill Benchmark Rate component; and \u00b7 benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Bank Bill Benchmark Rate component; and\n- \u00b7 spot exchange rate risk as a component of foreign currency risk for foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities. \u00b7 spot exchange rate risk as a component of foreign currency risk for foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities.\n\nHedging the benchmark interest rate risk or spot exchange rate risk components results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship. Hedging the benchmark interest rate risk or spot exchange rate risk components results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n\n## Economic relationships and hedge effectiveness Economic relationships and hedge effectiveness\n\nThe Group performs both prospective and retrospective tests to determine the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and to assess hedge effectiveness. At inception of the hedge relationship, prospective testing is performed on a matched terms basis. This test checks that the critical terms are matched between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. At the same time a hedging ratio is established by matching the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the portfolio or financial instruments being hedged. In most cases the ratio is 100%. Retrospective testing for each reporting period uses a regression model, which compares the change in the fair value of the hedged item and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. For a hedge to be deemed effective, the change in fair values should be within 80% to 125% of each other. Should the result fall outside this range the hedge would be deemed ineffective and recognised immediately through the Income Statement in line with each hedge relationship policy above.

Collateralised derivatives are discounted using Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount curves, which are not applied to the hedged item;\n- \u00b7 change in the credit risk of the hedging instrument; and\n- \u00b7 mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nNo other sources of hedge ineffectiveness have arisen during the year.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nIn certain instances, a derivative may be embedded within a financial liability host contract. It is accounted for separately as a stand-alone derivative at fair value through the Income Statement, where:\n\n- \u00b7 the host contract is not carried at fair value through the Income Statement; and\n- \u00b7 the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the host contract.\n\n177\n\n<!-- image -->",

securities (continued)\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nInvestment securities primarily include publicly traded debt securities held as part of the Group's liquidity portfolio.\n\n## Investment securities at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThis category includes debt securities held within the business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the assets. The contractual cash flows on these financial assets comprise payments of principal and interest only. These securities are initially recognised at their fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nInterest income and foreign exchange gains and losses on these securities are recognised in the Income Statement. The securities are assessed for impairment using the expected credit loss approach described in Note 3.2. Impairment is recognised in the Loan impairment expense line in the Income Statement.\n\nWhen debt securities at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified to the Net other operating income line in the Income Statement.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nThis category also includes non-traded equity instruments designated at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. Fair value gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on these equity instruments are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and are not reclassified to the Income Statement on derecognition.\n\n## Investment securities at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes debt securities held within the business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. The contractual cash flows on these financial assets comprise the payment of principal and interest only.

The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date useful lives and residual values and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment.

The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date useful lives and residual values and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment.\n\nIn determining the value in use of assets held as lessor, the Group incorporates the cash inflows over the lease term, as well as the expected selling price on expiry of the lease. Market disruption, lower demand for assets, decline in asset prices as well as credit events specific to individual lessees can result in a reduction of the asset's recoverable values.

The recoverable amount is determined based on fair value less cost to sell, primarily using an earnings multiple applicable to that type of business. The category of this fair value is Level 3 as defined in Note 9.5.\n\nEarnings  multiples relating to the Group's  banking  cash-generating units are sourced from publicly available data associated with Australian businesses displaying similar characteristics to those cash-generating units, and are applied to current earnings. The key assumption is the Price-Earnings (P/E) multiple observed for these businesses, which for the banking businesses were in the range of 11.1x-12.4x (30 June 2022: 9.9x-11.6x).\n\n## Goodwill allocation to cash generating units\n\n|                            | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                            | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M |\n| Retail Banking Services    | 3,763        | 3,768        | 2,002        | 2,005        |\n| Business Banking           | 1,241        | 1,241        | 499          | 499          |\n| New Zealand                | 259          | 255          | -            | -            |\n| Corporate Centre and Other | 32           | 31           | -            | -            |\n| Total                      | 5,295        | 5,295        | 2,501        | 2,504        |\n\n183\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are recognised only if it is probable the asset will generate future benefits for the Group. Those assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually. All intangible assets must be tested for impairment when there is an indication that its carrying amount may be greater than its recoverable amount.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually through allocation to a group of Cash Generating Units (CGUs). The CGUs' recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying amount of the CGUs including goodwill and an impairment is recognised for any excess carrying value.\n\n## Computer software costs\n\nCertain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring and developing software are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. The majority of software projects are amortised over three to five years. Software maintenance is expensed as incurred.\n\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the provider's application software, are generally recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances, modifies or creates additional capability to existing on-premise systems and meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible software assets and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straightline basis.\n\n## Brand names\n\nBrand names include the Bankwest brand name acquired in a business combination and initially recognised at fair value. The Bankwest brand name has an indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which it is expected to generate cash flows.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nOther intangibles predominantly comprise customer relationships  and software licences. Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated based on the timing of projected cash flows associated with those relationships.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nGoodwill is allocated to CGUs whose recoverable amount is calculated for the purpose of impairment testing. The recoverable amount calculation relies primarily on publicly available earnings multiples, which are disclosed on page 183.\n\n185\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where the payments are expected to be more than one year in the future, it factors in the expected period of service by employees, as well as salary increases. These future obligations are discounted using a market observable rate.\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nThis provision covers customer remediation costs and related program costs.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThis provision relates to dividends for prior periods which have not been settled at the Balance Sheet date.\n\n## Compliance and regulation\n\nThis provision relates to litigation, project and other administrative costs associated with certain compliance and regulatory programs of the Group.\n\n## Divestments and restructuring\n\nThis provision includes expenses arising from changes in the scope of the Group's business relating primarily to divestment transactions including related warranties and indemnities. The provision includes costs, which are both necessarily entailed by the divestment and are not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group. A provision for restructuring costs is only recognised when the Group has a detailed formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions include self-insurance provisions, make-good provisions in relation to property leases, and provisions for certain other costs.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nProvisions are held in respect of a range of future obligations, some of which involve significant judgement about the likely outcome of various events and estimated future cash flows.\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nProvisions for customer remediation require significant levels of estimation and judgement. The amount raised depends on a number of different assumptions, such as the number of years impacted, the forecast refund rate and the average cost per case. The Group is committed to comprehensively and efficiently addressing the full range of remediation issues impacting customers of the Banking and former Wealth Management businesses. Significant resources have been committed to a comprehensive program of work, to ensure that all issues are identified and addressed.\n\n## Aligned Advice remediation\n\nAligned advisors were not employed by the Group but were representatives authorised to provide financial advice under the licences of the Group's subsidiaries, Financial Wisdom Limited (FWL), Count Financial Limited (Count Financial) and Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited-Pathways (CFP-Pathways). The Group completed the sale of Count Financial to Count Limited (Count) on 1 October 2019, and ceased providing licensee services through CFP-Pathways and Financial Wisdom in March and June 2020, respectively. The Bank entered into reimbursement agreements with Financial Wisdom and CFP-Pathways, and an indemnity deed with Count to cover potential remediation of past issues including ongoing service fees and commissions, and other remediation matters. For details on the reimbursement agreements and the indemnity deed, refer to Note 11.2.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group recognised an increase in the provision for Aligned Advice remediation issues and program costs of $299 million (including $163 million for ongoing service fees remediation, $91 million for other remediation matters and $45 million for program costs). In addition, the Group paid $838 million customer refunds for ongoing service fees,  $2 million other remediation matters and utilised $108 million of program costs during the year ended 30 June 2023. As at 30 June 2023, the provision held by the Group in relation to Aligned Advice remediation was $262 million (30 June 2022: $911 million). This provision includes $67 million for customer fee refunds (30 June 2022: $446 million) and $71 million for interest on fees subject to refunds (30 June 2022: $367 million) for ongoing service fees, $95 million on other remediation matters (30 June 2022: $6 million) and $29 million for program costs (30 June 2022: $92 million).\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, the Group had materially completed all assessments for ongoing service fees and commissions. For offers not finalised, an increase/(decrease) in the refund rate by 1% would result in an increase/(decrease) in the provision by approximately $1 million (30 June 2022: $20 million). The Aligned Advice remediation provision of $262 million held as at 30 June 2023 includes $75 million in relation to offers that have not been finalised. The Group continues to engage with ASIC in relation to remediation programs.\n\n189\n\n<!-- image -->",

The AUSTRAC proceedings concerned contraventions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth). In October 2017 and June 2018 two separate shareholder class action proceedings were filed against CBA in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging breaches of CBA's continuous disclosure obligations and misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the subject matter of the civil penalty proceedings brought against CBA by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). The AUSTRAC proceedings concerned contraventions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).\n\nThe resolution of the AUSTRAC civil penalty proceedings was approved by the Federal Court on 20 June 2018 with CBA paying a penalty of $700 million and legal costs. The resolution of the AUSTRAC civil penalty proceedings was approved by the Federal Court on 20 June 2018 with CBA paying a penalty of $700 million and legal costs.\n\nIt is alleged in the class actions that CBA shareholders who acquired an interest in CBA shares between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017 suffered losses as a result of the alleged conduct.

The Group is also defending three class actions in relation to superannuation products.\n\nOn 9 October 2018, a class action was filed against Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) and CBA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim initially related to investment in cash and deposit options (which are cash and deposit products provided by CBA) in the Colonial First State First Choice Superannuation Trust (FirstChoice Fund) and Commonwealth Essential Super and later expanded to join Avanteos Investments Limited (AIL) as a party in respect of claims regarding the FirstWrap Pooled Cash Account. On 9 October 2018, a class action was filed against Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) and CBA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim initially related to investment in cash and deposit options (which are cash and deposit products provided by CBA) in the Colonial First State First Choice Superannuation Trust (FirstChoice Fund) and Commonwealth Essential Super and later expanded to join Avanteos Investments Limited (AIL) as a party in respect of claims regarding the FirstWrap Pooled Cash Account.\n\nThe main claims are that members that invested in these cash and deposit options received lower interest rates than they could have received had CFSIL/AIL offered similar products made available in the market by another bank with comparable risk and that CFSIL/AIL retained the margin that arises through the internal transfer pricing process in respect of deposits made with CBA, for their own benefit. It is claimed CFSIL/AIL breached their duties as a trustee of the funds, CFSIL breached its duties as a Responsible Entity of the underlying managed investment schemes and that CBA was involved in CFSIL/AIL's breaches. CBA, CFSIL and AIL deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings. The Court has ordered that mediation occur by 14 June 2024. The main claims are that members that invested in these cash and deposit options received lower interest rates than they could have received had CFSIL/AIL offered similar products made available in the market by another bank with comparable risk and that CFSIL/AIL retained the margin that arises through the internal transfer pricing process in respect of deposits made with CBA, for their own benefit. It is claimed CFSIL/AIL breached their duties as a trustee of the funds, CFSIL breached its duties as a Responsible Entity of the underlying managed investment schemes and that CBA was involved in CFSIL/AIL's breaches. CBA, CFSIL and AIL deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings. The Court has ordered that mediation occur by 14 June 2024.\n\nOn 18 October 2019, a second class action was commenced against CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to certain fees charged to members of the FirstChoice Fund. It is alleged that CFSIL breached its duties as trustee and acted unconscionably because it failed, between 2013 and 2019, to take steps to avoid the payment of grandfathered commissions to financial advisers, which would have resulted in a reduction of the fees paid by members in respect of whom those commissions were paid. CFSIL denies the allegations and was defending the proceedings. Following a mediation in June 2023, a settlement was reached with no admissions as to liability. The settlement is subject to Court approval. On 18 October 2019, a second class action was commenced against CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to certain fees charged to members of the FirstChoice Fund. It is alleged that CFSIL breached its duties as trustee and acted unconscionably because it failed, between 2013 and 2019, to take steps to avoid the payment of grandfathered commissions to financial advisers, which would have resulted in a reduction of the fees paid by members in respect of whom those commissions were paid. CFSIL denies the allegations and was defending the proceedings. Following a mediation in June 2023, a settlement was reached with no admissions as to liability. The settlement is subject to Court approval.\n\nOn 22 January 2020, a further class action was filed against CFSIL and The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA) in the Federal Court of Australia. On 22 October 2021, AIA Australia Limited (AIAA), who from 1 April 2021 was liable for and assumed certain liabilities of CMLA under a life insurance scheme pursuant to Part 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) (Part 9 Scheme), was joined as a third respondent to the class action. The class action alleges that CFSIL did not act in the best interests of members and breached its trustee duties when taking out group insurance policies obtained from CMLA. The key allegation is that CFSIL entered into and maintained insurance policies with CMLA on terms that were less favourable to members than would have reasonably been available in the market. It is alleged that CMLA was knowingly involved in CFSIL's contraventions as trustee and profited from those contraventions. CFSIL, CMLA and AIAA deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings. The Court has ordered that mediation occur by 6 December 2023. On 22 January 2020, a further class action was filed against CFSIL and The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA) in the Federal Court of Australia. On 22 October 2021, AIA Australia Limited (AIAA), who from 1 April 2021 was liable for and assumed certain liabilities of CMLA under a life insurance scheme pursuant to Part 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth) (Part 9 Scheme), was joined as a third respondent to the class action. The class action alleges that CFSIL did not act in the best interests of members and breached its trustee duties when taking out group insurance policies obtained from CMLA. The key allegation is that CFSIL entered into and maintained insurance policies with CMLA on terms that were less favourable to members than would have reasonably been available in the market.

CFSIL, CMLA and AIAA deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings. The Court has ordered that mediation occur by 6 December 2023.\n\n190\n\n190\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\nOn 1 December 2021, the Group completed the sale of a 55% interest in Colonial First State (CFS) to KKR. CBA has assumed carriage of the superannuation class actions proceedings on CFSIL's and AIL's behalf subject to the terms of a conduct indemnity deed between CBA, CFSIL and AIL. The Group has provided for certain legal and other costs associated with its obligations under the indemnity deed.\n\n## Advice class actions\n\nOn 21 August 2020, a class action was filed in the Federal Court of Australia against Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFP), FWL and CMLA. The claim relates to certain CommInsure (CMLA) life insurance policies recommended by financial advisers appointed by CFP and FWL during the period from 21 August 2014 to 21 August 2020. On 16 November 2021, AIAA (who from 1 April 2021 was liable for and assumed certain liabilities of CMLA under the Part 9 Scheme) was joined as a fourth respondent to the class action.  The key allegations include that CFP and FWL or their financial advisers breached their fiduciary duties to their clients, breached their duty to act in the best interest of their clients, and had prioritised their own interests (and the interests of CFP, FWL and CMLA) over the interest of their clients, in recommending certain CMLA life insurance policies in preference to substantially equivalent or better policies available at lower premiums from third party insurers. It is also alleged that CMLA knew the material facts giving rise to the breaches of fiduciary duty. CFP, FWL, CMLA and AIAA deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings.\n\nOn 24 August 2020, a class action was commenced against Count Financial in the Federal Court of Australia. The proceeding relates to commissions paid to Count Financial and its authorised representative financial advisers in respect of financial products (including insurance) and certain obligations of its financial advisers to provide ongoing advice in the period from 21 August 2014 to 21 August 2020. The claim also includes allegations (related to the receipt of commissions) that Count Financial engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, and that Count Financial and its authorised representatives breached fiduciary duties owed to the applicant and group members. The claim seeks compensation and damages from Count Financial, including any profits resulting from the contraventions. A trial date is fixed for March 2024.\n\nCount Financial was a wholly owned subsidiary of CBA until 1 October 2019, when it was acquired by CountPlus Limited. CBA has assumed the conduct of the defence in this matter on Count Financial's behalf. Count Financial denies the allegations made against it and is defending the proceedings.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of these claims.\n\n## Consumer credit insurance (CCI) class action\n\nOn 10 June 2020, a class action was commenced against CBA and CMLA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans that was sold between 1 January 2010 and 7 March 2018. On 1 April 2022, AIAA (who from 1 April 2021 was liable for and assumed certain liabilities of CMLA under the Part 9 Scheme) was joined as a third respondent to the class action. The class action alleges that CBA and CMLA engaged in unconscionable and misleading or deceptive conduct, failed to act in the best interests of customers and provided them with inappropriate advice. In particular, it is alleged that some customers were excluded from claiming certain benefits under the policies and the insurance was therefore unsuitable or of no value. Allegations are also made in relation to the manner in which the insurance was sold. CBA, CMLA and AIAA deny the allegations.\n\nOn 18 October 2022, the parties attended a Court ordered mediation following which they entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the proceedings. The settlement was made without admission of liability and is subject to Court approval. The Court approval hearing is set down for 4 August 2023.\n\nThe Group has provided for the legal costs expected to be incurred in this matter and the agreed settlement amount.\n\n## ASB class action\n\nProceedings were served on CBA subsidiary ASB Bank Limited (ASB) on 29 September 2021 by plaintiffs seeking to bring a representative (class action) proceeding against ASB in the High Court of New Zealand. These proceedings relate to ASB's compliance with parts of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 (CCCFA) which requires variation disclosure to be issued when customers and ASB make agreed changes to loan agreements captured under the CCCFA.\n\nOn 11 and 12 July 2023, the New Zealand Court of Appeal heard ASB's appeal from an earlier High Court decision permitting the plaintiffs to pursue their claims as an opt-out representative proceeding. The outcome of that appeal is not yet known.\n\nThe plaintiffs' proposed class definition covers all customers who had a home or personal loan with ASB between 6 June 2015 and 18 June 2019 covered by the CCCFA and who were not provided with compliant variation disclosure. Given this definition and the fact that issues raised in the claim have not been determined by the Courts before, the size of the proposed class is unknown. However, the proposed class and the allegations made in the proceedings would potentially cover hundreds of thousands of loans. ASB is appealing the lower court's decision and does not consider that this is an appropriate case to proceed as an opt-out representative proceeding.\n\nIn their claim, the plaintiffs argue that ASB is not entitled to retain any interest or fees paid by any class member for the period during which it is alleged that ASB did not provide, and has not provided, compliant variation disclosure under the CCCFA. ASB denies that the relief sought by the plaintiffs is available to them and is vigorously defending the proceedings.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim, if any, on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of this claim.\n\n191\n\n<!-- image -->",

CBA continues to address the underlying causes of the Anti-Money Laundering and CounterTerrorism Financing Act (AML/CTF Act) failings that resulted in AUSTRAC commencing its proceedings.\n\nRecognising the crucial role that the Group plays in fighting financial crime, it continues to invest significantly in its financial crime disruption capabilities, including in its central AML/CTF Compliance team, its business unit-led risk teams, regulatory and control operations team and through the Program of Action with coverage across all aspects of financial crime (including AML/CTF, sanctions anti-bribery and corruption and tax evasion).\n\nThe Group provides updates to AUSTRAC on its Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Program and related enhancements and remediation activities.\n\nHowever, there is no assurance that AUSTRAC or the Group's other regulators will agree that the Group's enhancements to its financial crime compliance capabilities, including through the multi-year Program of Action, are adequate or will effectively enhance the Group's financial crime compliance programs across its business units and the jurisdictions in which it operates. Although the Group is not currently aware of any other enforcement action by other domestic or foreign regulators in respect of its financial crime compliance, the Group regularly engages with such regulators (including in respect of compliance matters) and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be subject to such enforcement actions in the future.\n\n## Enforceable undertaking to the Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)\n\nIn June 2019, the Australian Information and Privacy Commissioner (Commissioner) accepted an EU offered by CBA, which requires further enhancements to the management and retention of customer personal information within CBA and certain subsidiaries.\n\nThe EU follows CBA's work to address two incidents: one relating to the disposal by a third party of magnetic data tapes containing historical customer statements and the other relating to potential unauthorised internal user access to certain systems and applications containing customer personal information. CBA reported the incidents to the Commissioner in 2016 and 2018 respectively and has since addressed these incidents. CBA found no evidence that as a result of these incidents, its customers' personal information was compromised or that there have been any instances of unauthorised access by CBA employees or third parties.\n\n## CommSec Compliance Program\n\nOn 25 October 2022, the Federal Court of Australia handed down its decision in proceedings which ASIC commenced against Commonwealth Securities Limited (CommSec). CommSec did not defend the proceedings. In addition to ordering a penalty of $20 million, the  Federal  Court  ordered  CommSec  to  undertake  a  compliance  program  (the  terms  of  which  were  agreed  with  ASIC  at  the commencement of proceedings). As required by the program CommSec has appointed an independent expert to review the adequacy and effectiveness of its remediation of the issues in the proceedings and their root causes, as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of its systems and controls. The independent expert will conduct an initial review and CommSec is required to address any recommendations. The  compliance  program  contemplates  a  potential  further  review  by  the  independent  expert  of  CommSec's  response  to  the recommendations, depending on the outcome of the initial review.\n\n## Enforceable undertaking to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA)\n\nIn connection with breaches of certain provisions of the Spam Act 2003, CBA has paid ACMA a fine of $3.55 million and on 2 June 2023, entered into an EU with ACMA. The issues the subject of ACMA's investigation resulted in some customers receiving messages from CBA after they had unsubscribed and others receiving messages without a functioning unsubscribe mechanism. The three-year EU requires CBA to appoint an independent expert to review its current procedures, policies, training and systems relating to CBA's compliance with the Spam Act. CBA has committed to implementing the independent expert's recommendations, providing ongoing compliance reports to ACMA and training relevant personnel under the EU.\n\n## Other matters\n\n## Exposures to divested businesses\n\nThe Group has potential exposures to divested businesses, including through the provision of services, warranties and indemnities. These exposures may have an adverse impact on the Group's financial performance and position.

The Group's shareholders' equity includes issued ordinary shares, retained earnings and reserves.\n\nThis section provides analysis of the Group's shareholders' equity including changes during the period.\n\n## 8.1 Capital adequacy\n\nThe Bank is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) regulated by APRA under the authority of the Banking Act 1959 . APRA has set minimum regulatory capital requirements for banks based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines.\n\nThe Basel III measurement and monitoring of capital has been effective from 1 January 2013. APRA adopted a more conservative approach than the minimum standards published by the BCBS and adopted an accelerated timetable for implementation.\n\nThese requirements were revised by APRA, effective 1 January 2023, in order to increase the risk sensitivity within the capital framework, enhance the ability of ADIs to respond flexibly to future stress events, and to improve the comparability of the Australian framework with international standards.\n\nThe requirements define what is acceptable as capital and provide methods of measuring the risks incurred by the Bank.\n\nThe regulatory capital requirements are measured for the Extended Licenced Entity Group (known as 'Level 1', comprising the Bank and APRA approved subsidiaries) and for the Bank and all of its banking subsidiaries, which includes ASB Bank (known as 'Level 2' or the 'Group').\n\nAll entities which are consolidated for accounting purposes are included within the Group capital adequacy calculations except for:\n\n- \u00b7 insurance subsidiaries; and\n- \u00b7 certain entities through which securitisation of Group assets are conducted where such entities meet APRA's capital relief requirements.\n\nRegulatory capital is divided into Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital. CET1 primarily consists of shareholders' equity, less goodwill and other prescribed adjustments. Additional Tier 1 Capital is comprised of certain securities with features as described in APRA's prudential standard APS 111 'Capital Adequacy: Measurement of Capital'. Tier 1 capital is the aggregate of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital. Tier 2 Capital is hybrid and debt instruments that fall short of necessary conditions to qualify as Additional Tier 1 to APRA. Total Capital is the aggregate of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital.\n\nCapital adequacy is measured by means of risk based capital ratios. The capital ratios reflect capital (CET1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 and Total Capital) as a percentage of total Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). RWA represents an allocation of risks associated with the Group's assets and other related exposures.\n\nThe Group has a range of instruments and methodologies available to effectively manage capital. These include share issues and buybacks, dividend and DRP policies, hybrid capital raising and subordinated loan capital issuances. All major capital related initiatives require approval of the Board.\n\nThe Group's capital position is monitored on a continuous basis and reported monthly to the Executive Leadership Team, Asset and Liability Committee and at regular intervals throughout the year to the Board.\n\nThe Group's capital ratios throughout the 2021, 2022 and 2023 financial years were in compliance with both APRA minimum capital adequacy requirements and the Board approved minimums. The Group is required to inform APRA immediately of any breach or potential breach of its minimum prudential capital adequacy requirements, including details of remedial action taken or planned to be taken.\n\n195\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policies for each component are set out below.\n\n## Ordinary share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are recognised at the amount paid up per ordinary share, net of directly attributable issue costs. Where the Bank or entities within the Group purchase shares in the Bank, the consideration paid is deducted from total shareholders' equity and the shares are treated as treasury shares until they are subsequently sold, reissued or cancelled. Where such shares are sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Retained profits\n\nRetained profits includes the accumulated profits for the Group including certain amounts recognised directly in retained profits less dividends paid.\n\n## Reserves\n\nAsset revaluation reserve\n\nThe Asset revaluation reserve is used to record revaluation adjustments on the Group's property assets. Where an asset is sold or disposed of, any balance in the reserve in relation to the asset is transferred directly to Retained profits.\n\nForeign currency translation reserve\n\nExchange differences arising on translation of the Group's foreign operations are accumulated in the Foreign currency translation reserve. Specifically assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at Balance Sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated at the transaction date; and all resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of, exchange differences are reclassified to the Income Statement.\n\nCash flow hedge reserve\n\nThe Cash flow hedge reserve is used to record fair value gains or losses associated with the effective portion of designated cash flow hedging instruments. Amounts are reclassified to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss.\n\nEmployee compensation reserve\n\nThe Employee compensation reserve is used to recognise the fair value of shares and other equity instruments issued to employees under the employee share plans and bonus schemes.\n\nInvestment securities revaluation reserve\n\nThe Investment securities revaluation reserve includes changes in the fair value of Investment securities measured at fair value through Other  Comprehensive  Income. For debt securities, these changes are reclassified to  the  Income  Statement  when  the  asset  is derecognised. For equity securities, these changes are not reclassified to the Income Statement when derecognised.\n\n201\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group manages these risks through its Risk Management Framework, which evolves to accommodate changes in the business operating environment, better risk practices, and regulatory and community expectations. The components of the Risk Management Framework are illustrated below, including the governance that enables executive and Board oversight of these risks.

Further details on each of the material risks, and how the Group manages them, are outlined in this note.\n\n204\n\n204\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 9.1 Risk management framework\n\nThe Risk Management Framework comprises the systems, structures, policies, processes and people that identify, measure, evaluate, control, monitor and report on, both internal and external sources of material risk. It incorporates three key documents:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's Business Plan (consisting of the Group Strategy and the Financial Plan) sets out the approach to implement the Group's strategic objectives;\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that establishes the type and degree of risk the Board is prepared to accept and the maximum level of risk that the Group must operate within; and\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk Management Approach (RMA) that sets out the Board and the Executive Leadership Team's expectations regarding the Group's approach to managing risk and the key elements of the Risk Management Framework that give effect to this approach.\n\nThe Risk Management Framework is underpinned by the following Risk Framework Enablers that allow the Group to effectively identify, measure, evaluate, control, monitor and report on, both internal and external sources of material risk.\n\n## Risk governance and reporting\n\nThe Group is committed to ensuring that its risk management practices reflect a high standard of governance. This enables management to undertake, in an effective manner, prudent risk-taking activities. The Board operates as the highest level of the Group's risk governance. The Board Risk and Compliance Committee oversees the Risk Management Framework and helps formulate the Group's risk appetite for consideration by the Board. In particular it:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitors the Group's risk profile (including identification of emerging risks); and\n- \u00b7 Reviews regular reports from management on the measurement of risk and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nAt management level, risk governance is undertaken by a structured hierarchy of personal delegations, management committees and forums across the Group and within the BUs and Support Units (SUs).\n\nRegular management information is produced that allows financial, strategic and non-financial risk positions to be monitored against approved risk appetite and policy limits. At Board level, the majority of risk reporting is provided to the Board Risk and Compliance Committee, although select matters are reported directly to the Board as required. Controls reporting is provided to the Board Audit Committee. The Chairs of the Board Risk & Compliance and Audit Committee report to the Board following each Committee meeting.\n\n## Risk policies and procedures\n\nRisk policies and procedures provide guidance to the business on the management of each material risk. They support the Risk Management Framework by:\n\n- \u00b7 Summarising the principles and practices to be used by the Group in identifying and assessing its material risks; and\n- \u00b7 Quantifying the operating tolerances for material risks.\n\n## Risk infrastructure\n\nThe Risk Management Framework is supported by key infrastructure systems and processes that together provide the infrastructure for the management of the Group's Material Risk Types.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk processes to identify, assess, escalate, monitor and manage risks and issues;\n- \u00b7 Management information systems to measure and aggregate risks across the Group; and\n- \u00b7 Risk models and tools , including significant calculators.\n\n## Risk accountabilities and skills\n\nThe Group operates a Three Lines of Accountability (3LoA) model that places the accountability for risk ownership with the Line 1 BUs and SUs, while focusing the mandate of Line 2 Risk teams on risk appetite and the Risk Management Framework, assurance, approval or acceptance of risk decisions of Line 1 and advice. Line 3 Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Board, regulators and other stakeholders on the effectiveness of risk management, internal controls and governance. The Risk Stewards (senior leaders in Line 1 or Line 2) complement the 3LoA model, by providing a view on the aggregated risk profile and adequacy of the Group's Risk Management Framework for each of our Risk Types, including design of key controls and policies, mitigation strategies and the capabilities needed to manage the Risk Type.\n\nThe effective management of the Group's material risks requires appropriate resourcing of skilled employees within each of the Group's 3LoA. It is important for all Group employees to have an awareness of their risk accountabilities, the Risk Management Framework, and the role our Values play in helping us manage risk. This awareness is developed through:\n\n- \u00b7 Communication of the Group RAS and RMA Following approval by the Board, the updated RAS and RMA are made available to all employees;\n- \u00b7 Performance and remuneration frameworks are designed to drive accountability for managing risks and adopting risk behaviours that assist the Group to respond to new and emerging risks and to better support our customers and communities. Each year employees are assessed on how they met the risk management expectations of their role as part of the annual performance review;\n- \u00b7 Group Mandatory Learning modules that provide foundational knowledge of the Risk Management Framework and Risk Management Approach for all Group employees;\n- \u00b7 Risk Management Capability Framework enabling the education, experience and exposure to build risk skills and judgment effectively within the Group; and\n- \u00b7 Induction and ongoing learning to support employees in gaining the knowledge, skills and behaviours required to work effectively across the Group.\n\n205\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also covers most non-retail lending where the aggregated credit exposure to a group of related borrowers is less than $1.5 million. This segment has sub-segments covering housing loans, credit cards, personal loans, and  personal overdrafts. It also covers most non-retail lending where the aggregated credit exposure to a group of related borrowers is less than $1.5 million.\n\nAuto-decisioning is used to approve credit applications for eligible borrowers in this segment. Auto-decisioning uses a scorecard approach based on a combination of factors, which may include the Group's historical experience on similar applications, information from a credit reference bureau, the Group's existing knowledge of a borrower's behaviour and updated information provided by the borrower.

Loan applications that do not meet scorecard auto-decisioning requirements may be referred to a Personal Credit Approval Authority (PCAA) for manual decisioning.\n\nAfter loan origination, these portfolios are managed using behavioural scoring systems and a delinquency band approach. This includes different actions taken when loan repayments are greater than 30 days past due compared to when they are greater than 60 days past due. Loans past due are reviewed by the relevant Arrears Management or Financial Assistance Team.

Expert judgement is used where the complexity of the transaction and/or the borrower is such that it is inappropriate to rely completely on a statistical model. External ratings may be used for benchmarking in the expert judgement assessment. Either a PD Rating Model, approved PD Rating Method or expert judgement is used to determine the PD rating for customers in this segment. Expert judgement is used where the complexity of the transaction and/or the borrower is such that it is inappropriate to rely completely on a statistical model. External ratings may be used for benchmarking in the expert judgement assessment.\n\nThe CRR is designed to: The CRR is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 aid in assessing changes to borrower credit quality; \u00b7 aid in assessing changes to borrower credit quality;\n- \u00b7 influence decisions on approval, management and pricing of individual credit facilities; and \u00b7 influence decisions on approval, management and pricing of individual credit facilities; and\n- \u00b7 provide the basis for reporting details of the Group's credit portfolio. \u00b7 provide the basis for reporting details of the Group's credit portfolio.\n\nCredit risk-rated exposures are generally reviewed on an individual basis, at least annually, and fall within the following categories: Credit risk-rated exposures are generally reviewed on an individual basis, at least annually, and fall within the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 'Pass' - these credit facilities qualify for approval of new or increased exposure on normal commercial terms; and \u00b7 'Pass' - these credit facilities qualify for approval of new or increased exposure on normal commercial terms; and\n- \u00b7 'Troublesome or Non Performing Assets (TNPAs)' - these credit facilities are not eligible for new or increased exposure, unless it facilitates rehabilitation to 'pass grade' or protects or improves the Group's position by maximising recovery prospects. Where a borrower is in default the facility is classified as non-performing. Restructured facilities, where the original contractual arrangements terms have been modified to non-commercial terms due to the customer's financial difficulties, are also classified as non-performing. \u00b7 'Troublesome or Non Performing Assets (TNPAs)' - these credit facilities are not eligible for new or increased exposure, unless it facilitates rehabilitation to 'pass grade' or protects or improves the Group's position by maximising recovery prospects. Where a borrower is in default the facility is classified as non-performing. Restructured facilities, where the original contractual arrangements terms have been modified to non-commercial terms due to the customer's financial difficulties, are also classified as non-performing.\n\nDefault is recorded with one or more of the following: Default is recorded with one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the customer is 90 days or more overdue on a scheduled credit repayment; or \u00b7 the customer is 90 days or more overdue on a scheduled credit repayment; or\n- \u00b7 the customer is unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the Group in full without taking action, such as realising on available security. \u00b7 the customer is unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the Group in full without taking action, such as realising on available security.\n\n## Credit risk measurement Credit risk measurement\n\nThe measurement of credit risk uses analytical PD rating models to calculate both: (i) Expected, and (ii) Unexpected Loss probabilities for the credit portfolio. The use of analytical tools is governed by the Model Risk Governance Committee. The measurement of credit risk uses analytical PD rating models to calculate both: (i) Expected, and (ii) Unexpected Loss probabilities for the credit portfolio. The use of analytical tools is governed by the Model Risk Governance Committee.\n\n## (i) Expected loss (i) Expected loss\n\nExpected loss (EL) is the product of: Expected loss (EL) is the product of:\n\n- \u00b7 PD; \u00b7 PD;\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default (EAD); and \u00b7 Exposure at Default (EAD); and\n- \u00b7 LGD. \u00b7 LGD.\n\nThe PD, expressed as a percentage, is the estimate of the proportion of the population of customers assigned that PD grade that will default within the next 12 months. The PD, expressed as a percentage, is the estimate of the proportion of the population of customers assigned that PD grade that will default within the next 12 months.\n\n212\n\n212\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 9.2 Credit risk (continued)\n\n## (i) Expected loss (continued)\n\nEAD is the estimate of the amount of a facility that will be outstanding in the event of default. Estimates are based on a downturn in economic conditions. For committed facilities, the estimate is based on the actual amount outstanding, plus the undrawn amount multiplied by a credit conversion factor (CCF). The CCF represents the potential rate of conversion from undrawn 12 months prior to default to drawn at default. For committed non-retail facilities, the Group applies a supervisory credit conversion factor to the undrawn amount, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nFor uncommitted facilities, the EAD will generally be the drawn balance only. For defaulted facilities, it is the actual amount outstanding at default. For retail exposures, a modelling approach can be used based on factors including limit usage, arrears and loan type to segment accounts into homogeneous pools to calculate EAD.\n\nLGD, expressed as a percentage of EAD, is the estimate of a facility likely to be lost in the event of default. LGD is impacted by:\n\n- \u00b7 the level of security cover and the type of collateral held;\n- \u00b7 liquidity of and volatility in the value of collateral;\n- \u00b7 carrying costs (effectively the costs of providing a facility that is not generating an interest return); and\n- \u00b7 realisation costs.\n\nVarious factors are considered when calculating PD, EAD and LGD. Considerations include the potential for default by a borrower due to economic, management, industry, other risks, and the mitigating benefits of any collateral held as security.\n\n## (ii) Unexpected loss\n\nIn addition to EL, a more stressed loss amount is calculated. This Unexpected Loss estimate directly affects the calculation of regulatory and internal economic capital requirements. Refer to Note 8.1 for information relating to regulatory capital.\n\n## Climate related risk\n\nThe Group uses climate scenario analysis to understand its exposure to risks arising from climate change and how these risks may impact its strategy and risk management decisions. The Group uses a range of plausible, but severe physical and transition scenarios developed by globally recognised providers including the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and International Energy Agency (IEA). When conducting climate scenario analysis these global scenarios are downscaled to the regions of our portfolios. The results of climate scenario analysis can be assessed to determine the modelled impact on expected credit loss outcomes. Significant model uncertainty exists within these scenarios which requires an understanding of the limitations of the data and methodologies applied in order to interpret the climate scenario analysis outcomes.\n\nClimate risk drivers have the potential to significantly reduce customers' capacity to repay a loan and house or other asset prices within a region, and ultimately affect customers' probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD). These include an increase in frequency and/or  severity  of  acute  perils,  rising  sea  levels,  long-term  changes  in  weather  patterns  such  as  drought,  changes  in  the availability/affordability of general insurance, and changes in unemployment in regions or industries that are economically dependent on industries impacted by the transition to a low carbon economy. While these risk drivers are important to measure, monitor and mitigate where possible, a severe deterioration in house or asset prices and increase in unemployment scenario is already considered within the Group's expected credit loss framework. Additionally, the Group notes that under current credible climate scenarios, the various climate risk scenarios and the possible economic impacts are expected to mostly occur beyond the average behavioural life of the Group's credit exposures.\n\nAs a result, the Group has concluded that no adjustments for climate risk are required to provisions for impairment as at 30 June 2023.\n\nClimate change and the measurement thereof is evolving and will develop over time. The Group continues to conduct climate scenario analysis and assess the impact this may have on its business.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation, collateral and other credit enhancements\n\nThe Group has policies, standards and procedures in place setting out the acceptable collateral for mitigating credit risks. These include valuation parameters, review frequency and independence of valuation.\n\nThe general nature of collateral that may be taken, and the balances held, are summarised below by financial asset classes.\n\n## Cash and liquid assets\n\nCollateral is not usually sought on the majority of Cash and liquid asset balances as these types of exposures are generally considered low risk. However, securities purchased under agreement to resell are collateralised by highly liquid debt securities. The collateral related to agreements to resell has been legally transferred to the Group subject to an agreement to return them for a fixed price.\n\nThe Group's Cash and liquid asset balance included $104,770 million (30 June 2022: $115,245 million) deposited with Central Banks and is considered to carry less credit risk.\n\n## Receivables from other financial institutions\n\nCollateral is usually not sought on these balances as exposures are generally considered to be of low risk. The exposures are mainly short-term, to investment grade banks and include collateral posted by the Group.\n\n## Trading assets at fair value through Income Statement and investment securities at fair value through OCI\n\nThese assets are carried at fair value, which accounts for the credit risk. Investment securities at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost and presented net of provisions for impairment. Collateral is not generally sought from the issuer or borrower but collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (such as an asset-backed security).\n\n213\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on derivative contracts. The counterparty credit risk is affected by the nature of the trades, the counterparty, netting, and collateral arrangements. Counterparty credit risk is mitigated where possible (typically for financial institution counterparties, but less frequently for corporate or government counterparties) through netting agreements, to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the same counterparty are terminated and settled on a net basis. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement (or other derivative agreements) are used by the Group as an agreement for documenting Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives.

All exposures outside the policy limits require approval by the Executive Credit Authority and are reported to the Board.\n\nThe Group has a high quality, well diversified credit portfolio, with 63% of the gross loans and other receivables in domestic mortgage loans and a further 7% in overseas mortgage loans, primarily in New Zealand. Overseas loans account for 13% of loans and other receivables.\n\nExcessive risk concentrations to countries and particular industries or sectors are managed through the Country Risk Exposure Policy and Industry Sector Concentration Policy.\n\n## Distribution of financial assets by credit classification\n\nWhere a borrower is in default or facility is restructured, the financial asset is classified and reported as non-performing. Provisions for non-performing financial assets are raised where there is objective evidence of non-performance and for an amount adequate to cover assessed credit related losses. The Group regularly reviews its financial assets and monitors adherence to contractual terms. Credit riskrated exposures are assessed, at least at each Balance Sheet date, to determine whether the financial asset is non-performing.\n\n## Distribution of financial instruments by credit quality\n\nThe tables on pages 218 to 22 5 provide information about the gross carrying amount of the Group's and the Bank's loans and other receivables by credit rating grade and ECL stage.\n\nThis segmentation of loans in retail and risk-rated portfolios is based on the benchmarking of a borrower's internally assessed PD to S&P Global ratings, reflecting a borrower's ability to meet their credit obligations. In particular, retail PD pools are aligned to the Group's PD grades which are consistent with rating agency views of credit quality segmentation.\n\n| Credit grade   | S&P rating equivalent     |\n|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Investment     | AAA to BBB-               |\n| Pass           | BB+ to B-                 |\n| Weak           | CCC and below, in default |\n\nD\n\nI\n\nR\n\nE\n\nC\n\nT\n\nO\n\nR\n\nS\n\n' R\n\nE\n\nP\n\nO\n\nR\n\nT\n\n<!-- image -->",

For other types of exposures, a facility is deemed to be secured when the ratio of exposure to the estimated value of collateral is less than or equal to 100%. A facility is deemed to be partially secured when the ratio is greater than 100% but does not exceed 250%, and unsecured when there is no security held (e.g. credit cards, unsecured personal loans, exposures to highly rated corporate entities), or where the secured loan exposure to the estimated value of collateral exceeds 250%. For the purposes of the collateral classification above, home loans are classified as secured when the ratio of exposure to the estimated value of collateral is 100% or below, and partially secured when the ratio of exposure to the estimated value of collateral is greater than 100%.

In limited circumstances, collateral in the form of cash or commercial property may be provided in addition to residential property. With the exception of some relatively small portfolios, for loans with a Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) of higher than 80% either a Low Deposit Premium or margin is levied, or Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is taken out to cover the difference between the principal plus interest owing and the net amount received from selling the collateral post default.\n\nOther consumer\n\nOther consumer category includes credit card and personal loans which are predominantly unsecured, whilst margin lending is secured.\n\n## Other lending\n\nThe Group's main collateral types for other lending consists of secured rights over specified assets of the borrower in the form of: commercial property; land rights; cash (usually in the form of a charge over a deposit) and other liquid assets (e.g. bonds, shares, investment funds); guarantees by company Directors; fixed and floating charges over a company's assets (including debtors, stock and work in progress); or a charge over assets being financed (e.g. vehicles, equipment). In other instances, a client's facilities may be secured by collateral with value less than the carrying amount of the credit exposure. These facilities are deemed partially secured or unsecured.\n\n227\n\n<!-- image -->",

VaR measures potential loss using historically observed market movements and correlation between different markets. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) as one of the measures of traded and non-traded market risk. VaR measures potential loss using historically observed market movements and correlation between different markets.\n\nVaR is modelled at a 99.0% confidence level. This means that there is a 99.0% probability that the loss will not exceed the VaR estimate on any given day. VaR is modelled at a 99.0% confidence level. This means that there is a 99.0% probability that the loss will not exceed the VaR estimate on any given day.\n\nThe VaR measured for traded market risk uses two years of daily movement in market rates. The VaR measure for non-traded banking book market risk uses six years of daily movement in market rates. The VaR measured for traded market risk uses two years of daily movement in market rates. The VaR measure for non-traded banking book market risk uses six years of daily movement in market rates.\n\nA 10-day holding period is used for trading book positions. A 20-day holding period is used for interest rate risk in the banking book. A 10-day holding period is used for trading book positions. A 20-day holding period is used for interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nVaR is driven by historical observations and is not an estimate of the maximum loss that the Group could experience from an extreme market event. As a result of this limitation, management also uses stress testing to measure the potential for economic loss at confidence levels significantly higher than 99.0%. Management then uses these results in decisions to manage the economic impact of market risk positions.

The maturity transformation activities of the Group create mismatches in the repricing terms of asset and liability  positions. These mismatches may have undesired earnings and value outcomes depending on the interest rate movements. The Group's objective is to manage interest rate risk to achieve stable and sustainable Net interest income in the long-term.\n\nThe Group measures and manages the impact of interest rate risk in two ways:\n\n## (a) Next 12 months' earnings\n\nInterest rate risk from an earnings perspective is the impact based on changes to the Net interest income over the next 12 months.\n\nThe risk to Net interest income over the next 12 months from changes in interest rates is measured on a monthly basis.\n\nEarnings risk is measured through sensitivity analysis, which applies an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shock in interest rates across the yield curve.\n\nThe prospective change to the Net interest income is measured by using an Asset and Liability Management simulation model which incorporates both existing and anticipated new business in its assessment. The change in the Balance Sheet product mix, growth, funding and pricing strategies is incorporated.\n\nAssets and liabilities that reprice directly from observable market rates are measured based on the full extent of the rate shock that is applied.\n\nProducts that are priced based on Group administered or discretionary interest rates and that are impacted by customer behaviour are measured by taking into consideration the historic repricing strategy of the Group and repricing behaviours of customers. In addition to considering how the products have been repriced in the past the expected change in price based on both the current and anticipated competitive market forces are also considered in the sensitivity analysis.\n\nFollowing the increase in interest rates during the year, the Group's sensitivity to a 100bps interest rate shock reduced.\n\n| Net interest earnings at risk   | June 2023  1 $M   | June 2022 $M   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Average monthly exposure        | 751. 1            | 1,625. 2       |\n| High monthly exposure           | 1,660. 1          | 1,849. 7       |\n| Low monthly exposure            | 415. 4            | 1,106. 3       |\n| As at balance date              | 591. 5            | 1,106. 3       |\n\n## (b) Economic value\n\nInterest rate risk from the economic value perspective is based on a 20-day 99.0% VaR measure.\n\nMeasuring the change in the economic value of equity is an assessment of the long-term impact to the earnings potential of the Group present valued to the current date. The Group assesses the potential change in its economic value of equity through the application of the VaR methodology.\n\nA 20-day 99.0% VaR measure is used to capture the net economic value impact over the long-term or total life of all Balance Sheet assets and liabilities to adverse changes in interest rates.\n\nThe impact of customer prepayments on the contractual cash flows for fixed rate products is included in the calculation. Cash flows for discretionary priced products are behaviourally adjusted and repriced at the resultant profile.\n\nThe figures in the following table represent the net present value of the expected change in the Group's future earnings in all future periods for the remaining term of all existing assets and liabilities.\n\n229\n\n<!-- image -->",

These policies are intended to protect the value of the Group's operations during periods of unfavourable market conditions.\n\nThe Group's funding policies are designed to achieve diversified sources of funding by product, term, maturity date, investor type, investor location, currency and concentration, on a cost effective basis. This objective applies to the Group's wholesale and retail funding activities.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk  management framework\n\nThe CBA Board is responsible for the sound and prudent management of liquidity risk across the Group. The Group's liquidity and funding policies, structured under a formal Group Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework, are approved by the Board and agreed with APRA. The Group Asset and Liability Committee's (ALCO) responsibilities include asset and liability management, reviewing liquidity and funding policies and strategies, and monitoring compliance with those policies across the Group. Group Treasury manages the Group's liquidity and funding positions in accordance with the Group's Liquidity Policy and supporting standards, and has ultimate authority to execute liquidity and funding decisions should the Group Contingency Funding Plan be activated. Risk Management provides oversight of the Group's liquidity and funding risks, compliance with Group policies and manages the Group's relationship with prudential regulators.\n\nSubsidiaries within the Group apply their own liquidity and funding strategies to address their specific needs. The Group's New Zealand banking subsidiary, ASB, manages its own domestic liquidity and funding needs in accordance with its own liquidity policy and the policies of the Group. ASB's liquidity policy is also overseen by the RBNZ.\n\n## Liquidity and funding policies and m anagement\n\nThe Group's liquidity and funding policies provide that:\n\n- \u00b7 an excess of liquid assets over the minimum prescribed under APRA's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement is maintained. Australian ADIs are required to meet a 100% LCR, calculated as the ratio of high quality liquid assets to 30 day net cash outflows projected under a prescribed stress scenario;\n- \u00b7 a surplus of stable funding from various sources, as measured by APRA's Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), is maintained. The NSFR is calculated by applying factors prescribed by APRA to assets and liabilities to determine a ratio of required stable funding to available stable funding which must be greater than 100%;\n- \u00b7 scenario analysis is central to the Group's liquidity management framework and the Group undertakes additional stress testing including market specific and idiosyncratic scenarios over and above the regulatory defined scenarios;\n- \u00b7 additional funding and liquidity metrics are calculated and monitored as early warning indicators of a potential stress event;\n- \u00b7 short and long-term wholesale funding limits are established, monitored and reviewed regularly;\n- \u00b7 the Group's wholesale funding market capacity is regularly assessed and used as a factor in funding strategies;\n- \u00b7 Group Treasury maintains a portfolio of highly liquid assets to meet liquidity requirements under a range of market conditions. The liquid asset portfolio includes cash and liquid assets, including government and Australian semi-government securities, meeting APRA's High Quality Liquid Asset (HQLA) definition and other highly liquid assets which are repo-eligible with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA);\n- \u00b7 liquid assets are held in Australian dollar and foreign currency denominated securities in accordance with expected requirements;\n- \u00b7 in line with APRA's requirements to hold adequate levels of self-securitised assets, the Group also holds internal RMBS (minimum value of 30% of Group net cash outflows as defined under the LCR), which are mortgages that have been securitised but retained by the Bank, that are repo-eligible with the RBA under the Exceptional Liquidity Assistance (ELA) arrangement; and\n- \u00b7 offshore branches and subsidiaries adhere to liquidity policies and hold appropriate foreign currency liquid assets to meet required regulations. Material banking subsidiaries are required to maintain an LCR of at least 100%;\n\nThe Group's key funding tools include:\n\n- \u00b7 consumer retail funding base, which includes a wide range of retail transaction accounts, savings accounts and term deposits for individual consumers;\n- \u00b7 small business customer and institutional deposit base; and\n- \u00b7 wholesale domestic and international funding programmes, which include Australian dollar Negotiable Certificates of Deposit, US and Euro Commercial Paper programmes, Australian dollar Domestic Debt Programme, US Medium-Term Note Programmes, Euro Medium-Term Note Programme, multi-jurisdiction Covered Bond programme and Medallion securitisation programmes. Additionally, the Group has accessed the RBA's Term Funding Facility (TFF) and RBNZ term lending facilities.\n\nLiquidity modelling and forecasting is undertaken on a daily basis to ensure the Group meets its internal and regulatory liquidity requirements at all times.  A  regulatory liquidity management reporting system models and reports regulatory liquidity outcomes. Additionally, a comprehensive Funds Transfer Pricing framework is in place to attribute the cost of funding and liquidity to business units and to provide appropriate incentives to inform business decision making.\n\n231\n\n<!-- image -->",

On initial recognition, the transaction price generally represents the fair value of the financial instrument, unless there is observable information from an active market that provides a more appropriate fair value. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. On initial recognition, the transaction price generally represents the fair value of the financial instrument, unless there is observable information from an active market that provides a more appropriate fair value.\n\nThe fair value for financial instruments traded in active markets at the reporting date is based on their quoted market price or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. Assets and long positions are measured at a quoted bid price, liabilities and short positions are measured at a quoted asking price. Where the Group has positions with offsetting market risks, mid-market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk positions and a quoted bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate. The fair value for financial instruments traded in active markets at the reporting date is based on their quoted market price or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. Assets and long positions are measured at a quoted bid price, liabilities and short positions are measured at a quoted asking price. Where the Group has positions with offsetting market risks, mid-market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk positions and a quoted bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate.\n\nNon-market quoted financial instruments are mostly valued using valuation techniques based on observable inputs except where observable market data is unavailable. Where market data is unavailable the financial instrument is initially recognised at the transaction price, which is generally the best indicator of fair value. This may differ from the value obtained from the valuation model. The timing of the recognition in the Income Statement of this initial difference in fair value depends on the individual facts and circumstances of each transaction, but is never later than when the market data becomes observable. The difference may be either amortised over the life of the transaction, recognised when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of the instrument, as appropriate.

The difference may be either amortised over the life of the transaction, recognised when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of the instrument, as appropriate.\n\nThe fair value of Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives includes credit valuation adjustments (CVA) for derivative assets to reflect the credit worthiness of the counterparty. Fair value of uncollateralised derivative assets and uncollateralised derivative liabilities incorporate funding valuation adjustments (FVA) to reflect funding costs and benefits to the Group. These adjustments are applied after considering any relevant collateral or master netting arrangements.

The Group utilises various valuation techniques and applies a hierarchy for valuation inputs that maximise the use of observable market data, if available.\n\nUnder AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorised into one of the following three fair value hierarchy levels: Under AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorised into one of the following three fair value hierarchy levels:\n\n## Quoted prices in active markets - Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets - Level 1\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities for which the valuation is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. This category includes assets and liabilities for which the valuation is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nFinancial instruments included in this category are liquid government bonds, listed equities and exchange traded derivatives. Financial instruments included in this category are liquid government bonds, listed equities and exchange traded derivatives.\n\nValuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2 Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities that have been valued using inputs other than quoted prices as described for Level 1, but which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other market accepted valuation models. This category includes assets and liabilities that have been valued using inputs other than quoted prices as described for Level 1, but which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other market accepted valuation models.\n\nFinancial instruments included in this category are financial institution and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, bank bills, commercial papers, mortgage-backed securities and OTC derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and FX options. Financial instruments included in this category are financial institution and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, bank bills, commercial papers, mortgage-backed securities and OTC derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and FX options.\n\nValuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3 Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities where the valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Unobservable inputs are those not readily available in an active market due to market illiquidity or complexity of the product. These inputs are generally derived and extrapolated from observable inputs to match the risk profile of the financial instrument, and are calibrated against current market assumptions, historic transactions and economic models, where available. These inputs may include the timing and amount of future cash flows, rates of estimated credit losses, discount rates and volatility. Financial instruments included in this category for the Group are certain exotic OTC derivatives and unlisted equity instruments.

The valuation of the investment as at 30 June 2023 was based on a methodology leveraging revenue multiples of market listed comparable companies. Comparable listed companies were included based on industry, size, developmental stage and/or strategy. A revenue multiple was derived for each comparable company identified and then discounted for considerations such as illiquidity. The Group adopted an adjusted revenue multiple of 4.1x in its valuation as at 30 June 2023.

The Group adopted an adjusted revenue multiple of 4.1x in its valuation as at 30 June 2023.\n\nThe valuation of the investment as at 30 June 2022 was based on a methodology leveraging inputs related to a private equity capital raise executed on 11 July 2022, close to the Balance Sheet date, in which CBA participated. The revenue multiple implied at 30 June 2022 for the price of the capital raise was 4.1x.

When using valuation techniques the Group makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity specific inputs. It incorporates all factors that the Group believes market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Data inputs that the Group relies upon when valuing financial instruments relate to counterparty credit risk, volatility, correlation and extrapolation.\n\nPeriodically, the Group calibrates its valuation techniques and tests them for validity using prices from any observable current market transaction in the same instruments (i.e. without modification or repackaging) and any other available observable market data.\n\n## 9.6 Collateral arrangements\n\n## Collateral accepted as security for assets\n\nThe Group takes collateral where it is considered necessary to support both on and off Balance Sheet financial instruments. The Group evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral taken, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. The Group has the right to sell, re-pledge, or otherwise use some of the collateral received. At Balance Sheet date the carrying value of cash accepted as collateral (and recognised on the Group's and the Bank's Balance Sheets) and the fair value of securities accepted as collateral (but not recognised on the Group's or the Bank's Balance Sheets) were as follows:\n\n|                                             | Group  1     | Group  1     | Bank  1      | Bank  1      |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                             | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M |\n| Cash                                        | 6,838        | 9,000        | 6,603        | 8,619        |\n| Securities                                  | 56,129       | 45,321       | 56,389       | 45,245       |\n| Collateral held                             | 62,967       | 54,321       | 62,992       | 53,864       |\n| Collateral held which is re-pledged or sold | 28,660       | 24,985       | 28,660       | 24,985       |\n\n## Assets pledged\n\nAs part of standard terms of transactions with other banks, the Group has provided collateral to secure liabilities.

The Group has no further obligation to make payments into the Scheme but retains responsibility for the benefits provided to the Scheme members.\n\n248\n\n248\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\n\n## 10.2 Retirement benefit obligations (continued)\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plan\n\n|                                                                                      | 30 Jun 23 Commonwealth Bank  Group Super   | 30 Jun 23 Commonwealth Bank  Group Super   | CBA (UK) SBS   | CBA (UK) SBS   | Total        | Total        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                      | Note                                       | 30 Jun 22 $M $M                            | 30 Jun 23 $M   | 30 Jun 22 $M   | 30 Jun 23 $M | 30 Jun 22 $M |\n| Present value of funded obligations                                                  |                                            | (2,453)                                    | (2,419)        | (435) (468)    | (2,888)      | (2,887)      |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                                            |                                            | 3,058                                      | 2,957          | 478 510        | 3,536        | 3,467        |\n| Net pension assets as at 30 June                                                     |                                            | 605                                        | 538            | 43 42          | 648          | 580          |\n| Amounts in the Balance Sheet:                                                        |                                            |                                            |                |                |              |              |\n| Assets                                                                               | 6.3                                        | 605 538                                    | 43             | 42             | 648          | 580          |\n| Net assets                                                                           |                                            | 605                                        | 538 43         | 42             | 648          | 580          |\n| The amounts recognised in the Income  Statement are as follows: Current service cost |                                            | (17)                                       | (30) (2)       | -

The trustees perform Asset-Liability Matching (ALM) exercises to ensure the plan assets are well matched to the nature and maturities of the defined benefit obligations.

Holding more than 50% of an entity's voting rights typically indicates that the Group has control over the entity. Significant judgement is involved where either the Group is deemed to control an entity despite holding less than 50% of the voting rights, or where the Group does not control an entity despite holding more than 50% of the voting rights.

Whether that power translates to control depends on whether the Group is deemed to act as an agent or a principal of that fund. Management have determined that the Group acts as a principal and controls a fund when it cannot be easily removed as a manager or RE by investors and when its economic interest in that fund is substantial compared to the economic interest of other investors. In all other cases the Group acts as agent and does not control the fund.

subsidiaries and other entities (continued)\n\n## Structured entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities. Depending on the Group's power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has the following contractual arrangements which require it to provide financial support to its structured entities.\n\n## Securitisation structured entities\n\nThe Group provides liquidity facilities to Medallion and Medallion NZ structured entities. The liquidity facilities can only be drawn to cover cash flow shortages relating to mismatches in timing of cash inflows due from securitised asset pools and cash outflows due to note holders. These 'timing mismatch' facilities rank pari passu with other senior secured creditors. The facilities limit is $1,498 million (30 June 2022: $1,487 million). This includes $1,225 million (30 June 2022: $1,225 million) in relation to the structured entity where the Bank holds all of the issued instruments and $1,372 million (30 June 2022; $1,350 million) where the Group holds all of the issued instruments.\n\nThe Group has no contractual obligations to purchase assets from its securitisation structured entities.\n\n## Covered bonds trust\n\nThe Group provides funding and support facilities to CBA Covered Bond Trust and ASB Covered Bond Trust (the 'Trusts'). The Trusts are bankruptcy remote SPVs that guarantee any debt obligations owing under the US$40 billion CBA Covered Bond Programme and the EUR7 billion ASB Covered Bond Programme, respectively. The funding facilities allow the Trusts to hold sufficient residential mortgage loans to support the guarantees provided to the Covered Bonds. The Group also provides various swaps to the Trusts to hedge any interest rate and currency mismatches. The Group, either directly or via its wholly owned subsidiaries, Securitisation Advisory Services Pty Limited and Securitisation Management Services Limited, provides various services to the Trusts including servicing and monitoring of the residential mortgages.\n\n## Structured asset finance structured entities\n\nThe Group has no contractual obligation to provide financial support to any of its structured asset finance structured entities.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2023, the Bank entered into a debt forgiveness arrangement with four wholly owned structured entities for a total of $55 million (30 June 2022: $69 million). The financial impact of the debt forgiveness was fully eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe  Group  has  exposure  to  various  securitisation  vehicles  via  Residential  Mortgage-backed  Securities  (RMBS)  and  Asset-backed Securities (ABS). The Group may also provide derivatives and other commitments to these vehicles. The Group also has exposure to investment funds and other financing vehicles.\n\n## Securitisations\n\nSecuritisations involve transferring assets into an entity that sells beneficial interests to investors through the issue of debt and equity notes with varying levels of subordination. The notes are collateralised by the assets transferred to these vehicles and pay a return based on the returns of those assets, with residual returns paid to the most subordinated investor.\n\nThe Group may trade or invest in RMBS and ABS, which are backed by Commercial Properties, Consumer Receivables, Equipment and Auto Finance. The Group may also provide lending, derivatives, liquidity and commitments to these securitisation entities.\n\n## Other financing\n\nAsset-backed entities are used to provide tailored lending for the purchase or lease of assets transferred by the Group or its clients. The assets are normally pledged as collateral to the lenders. The Group engages in raising finance for assets such as aircraft, trains, vessels and other infrastructure. The Group may also provide lending, derivatives, liquidity and commitments to these entities.\n\n## Investment funds\n\nThe Group conducts investment management and other fiduciary activities as responsible entity, trustee, custodian, adviser or manager for investment funds and trusts, including superannuation and approved deposit funds, wholesale and retail trusts. The Group's exposure to investment funds includes holding units in the investment funds and trusts, providing lending facilities, derivatives and receiving fees for services.\n\nThe nature and extent of the Group's interests in these entities are summarised below. Interests do not include derivatives and other positions where the Group creates rather than absorbs variability of the structured entity, for example deposits the funds place with the Group. These have been excluded from the tables on pages 256 to 257.\n\n255\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsidiaries  are  entities  (including structured entities) over which the Bank has control. The Bank controls an entity when it has:\n\n- \u00b7 power over the relevant activities of the entity, for example through voting or other rights;\n- \u00b7 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from the Bank's involvement with the entity; and\n- \u00b7 the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the Bank's returns from the entity.\n\n## Consolidation of structured entities\n\nThe Group exercises judgement at inception and periodically thereafter, to assess whether that structured entity should be consolidated based on the Bank's power over the relevant activities of the entity and the significance of its exposure to variable returns of the structured entity. Such assessments are predominately required for the Group's securitisation program, structured transactions and involvement with investment funds.\n\nTransactions between subsidiaries in the Group are eliminated. Non-controlling interests and the related share of profits in subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, and Balance Sheet. Subsidiaries are consolidated from  the  date  on  which  control  is  transferred  to  the  Group  and  de-consolidated  when  control  ceases.  Subsidiaries  are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments at the Bank level.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. At the acquisition date, the cost of the business is the fair value of the purchase consideration, measured as the aggregate of the fair values of assets transferred, equity instruments issued, or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Group's share of assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition. If there is a deficit instead, this discount on acquisition  is  recognised  directly  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement,  but  only  after  a  reassessment  of  the  identification  and measurement of the net assets acquired.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are entities over which the Group has significant influence or joint control, but not control. In the consolidated financial report, they are equity accounted. They are initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the Group's share of the associates' and joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses and Other Comprehensive Income, less any dividends received. At the Bank level, they are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments.\n\nThe Group assesses, at each Balance Sheet date, whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. If there is an indication that an investment may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less disposal costs) with the carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement are subsequently reversed through the Income Statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.\n\n257\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial guarantees are recognised within other liabilities and are initially measured at their fair value, equal to the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group's liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the Income Statement  and  the  expected  credit  losses.  Any  increase  in  the  liability  relating  to  financial  guarantees  is  recorded  in  the  Income Statement. The premium received is recognised in the Income Statement in other operating income on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee;\n- \u00b7 Performance related contingencies are  undertakings  that  oblige  the  Group  to  pay  third  parties should  a  customer fail to  fulfil  a contractual non-monetary obligation. Performance related contingencies are performance guarantees and do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee. Performance guarantees are recognised when it is probable that an obligation has arisen. The amount of any provision is the best estimate of the amount required to fulfil the obligation;\n- \u00b7 Commitments to provide credit include obligations on the part of the Group to provide credit facilities against which clients can borrow money under defined terms and conditions. Such loan commitments are made either for a fixed period, or are cancellable by the Group subject to notice conditions. As facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Loan commitments must be measured with reference to expected credit losses required to be recognised. In the case of undrawn loan commitments, the inherent credit risk is managed and monitored by the Group together with the drawn component as a single credit exposure. The exposure at default on the entire facility is used to calculate the cumulative expected credit losses; and\n- \u00b7 Other commitments to provide credit include commitments with certain drawdowns, standby letters of credit and bill endorsements. The details of the Group's accounting policies and critical judgements and estimates involved in calculating impairment provisions are provided in Note 3.2.\n\n261\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also considered one significant business activity within these segments, being Group Treasury. These business segments and the significant business activity are considered to be components as the Group prepares financial information for them for the inclusion in the financial report.\n\nThe nature, timing and extent of audit work performed for each component was determined by each components' risk characteristics and financial significance to the Group and consideration of whether su/fficient evidence had been obtained for our opinion on the financial report as a whole. This involved either:\n\n- \u00b7  an audit of the financial information of a component (full scope);\n- \u00b7  an audit of one or more of the component's account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures (specified scope); or\n- \u00b7  analytical procedures performed at the Bank and Group level and/or audit procedures performed at the Bank and Group level, including over the consolidation of the Bank and Group's components and the preparation of the financial report (other procedures).\n\nSet out in the following diagram is an overview of how our audit scope aligns to the identified components and our audit report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Scoping and performance of procedures   | Scoping and performance of procedures   | Reporting                                                                             | Reporting                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Component                               | Audit scope                             | Key Audit Matters                                                                     | Auditor's report                             |\n| RBS                                     | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| BB                                      | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| IB&M                                    | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| NZ                                      | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| Group Treasury                          | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| Corporate Centre  and Other  1          | Other procedures                        | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n\n- 1  This excludes Group Treasury.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Bank and Group materiality for the financial report, which we have set out in the table below.\n\n| Overall Bank and  Group Materiality               | $635 million (2022: $675 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                              | Approximately 5% of 2023 financial year net profit before income tax (PBT) for the Bank (2022:  approximately 5% of 2022 financial year net PBT for the Group). As the Bank has a lower PBT in  the year ended 30 June 2023, we calculated materiality based on the Bank PBT and applied this  during the audit of both the Bank and the Group. |\n| Rationale for the  materiality benchmark  applied | We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of  our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e/ffect of  misstatements on the financial report as a whole.                                                                                           |\n|                                                   | We chose PBT because, in our view, it is the metric against which the performance of the Bank  and the Group is most commonly measured and is a generally accepted benchmark.                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                                   | We performed our audit over both the Bank and the Group financial information concurrently.  We applied the lower materiality calculated based on the Bank PBT in order to avoid duplication  of work.                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                                   | We utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting that it is within the  range of commonly acceptable thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current year. We describe each key audit matter and include a summary of the principal audit procedures we performed to address those matters in the table below.\n\nThe key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate to both the Bank and the Group audit, unless otherwise stated below. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee.\n\n| Key audit matter               | How our audit addressed the key audit matter   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Provisions for loan impairment |                                                |\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the recognition of a Provision for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) against the gross carrying value of the Bank's and the Group's loans and other receivables, the measurement of which is required to incorporate reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nThe Bank and the Group utilise complex models to calculate ECL on a collective basis. These models have been developed using internal historical default data and incorporate various forward-looking assumptions, such as forecasts of future economic conditions across multiple economic scenarios.\n\nIndividually assessed provisions are also recognised by the Bank and the Group for loans and other receivables that are known to be impaired at the reporting date. These provisions are measured using probability weighted scenarios which are intended to reflect a range of reasonably possible outcomes, and incorporate assumptions such as estimated future cash repayments and proceeds expected to be recovered from the realisation of the value of collateral held by the Bank and the Group in respect of the impaired lending assets.\n\nWe considered the provision for ECL a key audit matter due to the significant audit e/ffort required and the inherent estimation uncertainty present in its determination, which is specifically due to the complexity, subjectivity and extent of judgement used by the Bank and the Group in its recognition and measurement. Specific drivers of this uncertainty include the following:\n\n- \u00b7  The models which are used to calculate ECL (ECL models) are inherently complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of each model;\n- \u00b7  Multiple assumptions are made by the Bank and the Group concerning the future occurrence of events and conditions, as well as their probabilities, for which there is inherently heightened levels of estimation uncertainty given the forward-looking nature of these assumptions;\n\nWe developed an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over Bank's and the Group's Provision for ECL, and for certain control activities, assessed whether they were appropriately designed and were operating e/ffectively, on a sample basis, throughout the year ended 30 June 2023. This included control activities relevant to:\n\n- \u00b7  Completeness and accuracy of certain inputs to and outputs from the ECL models;\n- \u00b7  Reliability and accuracy of certain critical data elements used in ECL models; and\n- \u00b7  Review and approval of forward-looking assumptions, post-model adjustments, in-model adjustments and overall adequacy of total Provisions for ECL by the Bank's and the Group's Loan Loss Provisioning Committee (LLPC).\n\nIn addition to controls testing we, along with PwC credit risk modelling experts and PwC economics experts, performed the following procedures, amongst others, to assess the reasonableness of the Bank's and the Group's Provision for ECL as at 30 June 2023:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of the ECL model methodology applied by the Bank and the Group for a selection of the Bank's and the Group's loan portfolios, with particular consideration to the results of model monitoring performed for existing models, including back-testing of observed losses against predicted losses, and model validation for newly implemented models;\n- \u00b7  Recalculated ECL to assess the accuracy of the modelled outputs for a targeted sample of the Bank's and the Group's loan portfolios;\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of certain forward-looking assumptions incorporated into the ECL models, including the macroeconomic scenarios developed, underlying forecasts and probability weightings applied;\n- \u00b7  Tested the completeness and accuracy of a sample of certain critical data elements used as inputs to the ECL models to relevant source documentation;\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes the impact of these factors to customer loan serviceability, internal credit ratings, the valuation of collateral held as security, forward-looking information including macroeconomic scenarios and their associated weightings, and the use of model adjustments and overlays in the calculation of ECL.\n\n## Relevant references in the financial report\n\nRefer to notes 1.1, 3.2 and 9.2 for further information.\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of certain model adjustments and overlays identified by the Bank and the Group;\n- \u00b7  Tested the appropriateness of individually assessed provisions recognised by the Bank and the Group for a selection of loan assets identified to be impaired as at the reporting date, by assessing the appropriateness of expected cashflow forecasts and other significant judgements made in their measurement; and\n- \u00b7  Considered the impact of relevant events occurring after the end of the financial year until the date of signing the auditor's report on the Provision for ECL.\n\nWhere applicable, we also considered the competency, capabilities, objectivity and nature of the work of certain experts used by the Bank and the Group to assist in the development of significant assumptions used in determining the Provision for ECL.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n| Key audit matter                               | How our audit addressed the key audit matter   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Judgemental valuation of financial instruments |                                                |\n\nThe Bank and the Group have material holdings in financial instruments measured at fair value. Australian Accounting Standards provide a hierarchy of observability to gauge the relative uncertainty of financial instrument valuations.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the value of Level 2 fair value financial assets and financial liabilities held by the Group are $92,120m and $59,184m, respectively, and by the Bank are $92,278m and $59,898m, respectively.\n\nThe Level 2 financial instruments held at fair value include:\n\n- \u00b7  Derivative assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7  Assets and liabilities at fair value through the Income Statement\n- \u00b7  Investment securities at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nWe considered the financial instruments measured at fair value a key audit matter due to the magnitude of the Level 2 holdings, the significant audit e/ffort required and the judgement applied by the Bank and the Group in their selection and application of appropriate valuation models, external market rates and assumptions.\n\nThe non-equity Level 3 financial instruments where the valuation is dependent on unobservable inputs remain immaterial.\n\nRelevant references in the financial report Refer to notes 4.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 9.5 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Bank's and the Group's financial instruments measured at fair value, and for certain control activities assessed whether they were appropriately designed and were operating e/ffectively on a sample basis, throughout the year ended 30 June 2023. We performed testing in relation to the following areas, amongst others, over the valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value:\n\n- \u00b7  Management's assessment of valuation models at their inception and on an ongoing basis;\n- \u00b7  Reliability and accuracy of key market rates used in the Bank and the Group's valuation models;\n- \u00b7  Trade confirmations; and\n- \u00b7  Financial instrument position and settlement reconciliations.\n\nAdditionally, together with PwC valuation experts, we tested the Bank and the Group's fair value measurement of financial instruments. This involved, for a sample of financial instruments, developing our own independent valuation and comparing it to management's valuation. We considered the aggregate results of this assessment to form a view on whether there was evidence of systemic bias in the Bank and the Group's valuation of financial instruments by investigating the root cause of any significant variances.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Significant judgement is required to determine whether a provision is required with regard to the requirements of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . Where a provision has been recognised, there is a high degree of estimation uncertainty.\n\nWe consider the determination, valuation and disclosure of these provisions to be a key audit matter due to the level of judgement required in determining whether a provision is required, the inherent estimation uncertainty in calculating the appropriate amount of a provision, where required, and the related disclosures within the financial report.\n\n## Relevant references in the financial report\n\nRefer to note 7.1 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the control activities relevant to our audit over the Bank's and the Group's provisions for ongoing class actions, and for certain control activities assessed whether they were appropriately designed and were operating e/ffectively on a sample basis, throughout the year ended 30 June 2023. We performed testing in relation to the following areas, amongst others, over the determination, valuation and disclosure of the provisions for class actions:\n\n- \u00b7  Made inquiries of management and in-house legal counsel in relation to the status of the class actions at the end of the financial year;\n- \u00b7  Inspected certain Board and other committee meeting minutes and papers for any material developments in relation to the class actions;\n- \u00b7  Inspected legal representation letters from external legal counsel for certain matters;\n- \u00b7  Evaluated the Bank's and the Group's assessments as to whether a provision was required with regard to the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards; and\n- \u00b7  Tested the valuation of the provisions recognised.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOperation of financial reporting Information Technology (IT) systems and controls\n\nThe Bank's and the Group's operations and financial reporting processes are heavily dependent on IT systems for the processing and recording of a significant volume of transactions.\n\nDue to this, we consider the operation of financial reporting IT systems and controls to be a key audit matter.\n\nIn particular, in common with all banks, access rights to technology are important because they are intended to ensure that changes to applications and data are appropriately authorised. Ensuring that only appropriate sta/ff have access to IT systems, that the level of access itself is appropriate, and that access is periodically monitored, are key controls in mitigating the potential for fraud or error as a result of a change to an application or underlying data.\n\nThe Bank and the Group have an ongoing multi-year strategic program to address controls related to access management for systems and data relevant to financial reporting.\n\nFor material financial statement balances, we developed an understanding of the business processes, IT systems used to generate and support those balances and associated IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls.\n\nOur procedures included evaluating and testing the design and operating e/ffectiveness of certain control activities over the continued integrity of the material IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting.\n\nThis involved assessing, where relevant to the audit:\n\n- \u00b7  Change management: The processes and controls used to develop, test and authorise changes to the functionality and configurations within systems;\n- \u00b7  System development: The project disciplines which ensure that significant developments or implementation are appropriately tested before implementation and that data is converted and transferred completely and accurately;\n- \u00b7  Security: The access controls designed to enforce segregation of duties, govern the use of generic and privileged accounts or ensure that data is only changed through authorised means; and\n- \u00b7  IT operations: The controls over operations are used to ensure that any issues that arise are managed appropriately.\n\nWithin the scope of our audit where technology services are provided by a third party, we considered assurance reports from the third party's auditor on the design and operating e/ffectiveness of controls.\n\nWe also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls that were key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain system enforced access controls.\n\nWhere we identified design and operating e/ffectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative audit procedures. We also considered mitigating controls in order to respond to the impact on our overall audit approach.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of our limited assurance report on Selected Sustainability Information as detailed in pages 40 to 46 of the annual report.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report\n\nThe directors of the Bank are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Bank and the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Bank or the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf.

In our opinion, the Remuneration report of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the year ended 30 June 2023 complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Bank are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElizabeth O'Brien Partner\n\nSydney 9 August 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

The PEI was refreshed  in September 2020 from a four item metric to a five item metric to include items relating  to discretionary e/ffort and work involvement and the removal of work satisfaction as a  predictor of engagement. PEI is calculated based on the proportion of employees replying  with a score of 4 or 5 to five engagement questions in the Group's biannual people and  culture survey. These questions relate to pride, advocacy, intent to stay, discretionary e/ffort  and work involvement on a scale of 1-5 (where 1 is 'Strongly Disagree' and 5 is 'Strongly  Agree'). Not all metrics are surveyed during the survey period.
