Forward-looking  statements  also  include  statements  regarding  the  future  performance  of  CNH  and  its  subsidiaries  on  a  standalone  basis.  These statements may include terminology such as 'may', 'will', 'expect',  'could',  'should',  'intend',  'estimate',  'anticipate',  'believe',  'outlook',  'continue', 'remain', 'on track', 'design', 'target', 'objective', 'goal', 'forecast', 'projection', 'prospects', 'plan', or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Rather, they are based on current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control and are difficult to predict. If any of these risks and uncertainties materialize (or they occur with a degree of severity that the Company is unable to predict) or other assumptions underlying any of the forward-looking statements prove to be incorrect, including any assumptions regarding strategic plans, the actual results or developments may differ materially from any future results or developments expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nFactors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others: economic conditions in each of our markets, including the significant uncertainty caused by geopolitical events; production and supply chain disruptions, including industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints; the many interrelated factors that affect consumer confidence and worldwide demand for capital goods and capital goods-related products, changes in government policies regarding banking, monetary and fiscal policy; legislation, particularly pertaining to capital goods-related issues such as agriculture, the environment, debt relief and subsidy  program  policies,  trade  and  commerce  and  infrastructure  development;  government  policies  on  international  trade  and  investment,  including sanctions, import quotas, capital controls and tariffs; volatility in international trade caused by the imposition of tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, and trade wars; actions of competitors in the various industries in which we compete; development and use of new technologies and technological difficulties; the interpretation of, or adoption of new, compliance requirements with respect to engine emissions, safety or other aspects of our products; labor relations; interest  rates  and  currency  exchange  rates;  inflation  and  deflation;  energy  prices;  prices  for  agricultural  commodities  and  material  price  increases; housing starts and other construction activity; our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt; price pressure on new and used equipment; the resolution of pending litigation and investigations on a wide range of topics, including dealer and supplier litigation, intellectual property rights disputes, product warranty and defective product claims, and emissions and/or fuel economy regulatory and contractual issues; security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of CNH and its suppliers and dealers; security breaches with respect to our products; our pension plans and other post-employment obligations; political and civil unrest; volatility and deterioration of capital and financial  markets,  including  pandemics  (such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic),  terrorist  attacks  in  Europe  and  elsewhere;  the  remediation  of  a  material weakness; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives as part of our strategic plan, including targeted restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations; our failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or divestitures and other similar risks and uncertainties, and our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing.\n\nForward-looking  statements  are  based  upon  assumptions  relating  to  the  factors  described  in  this Annual  Report,  which  are  sometimes  based  upon estimates and data received from third parties. Such estimates and data are often revised. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements  as  a  result  of  a  number  of  risks  and  uncertainties,  many  of  which  are  outside  CNH's  control.  CNH  expressly  disclaims  any  intention  or obligation  to  provide,  update  or  revise  any  forward-looking  statements  in  this  announcement  to  reflect  any  change  in  expectations  or  any  change  in events, conditions or circumstances on which these forward-looking statements are based.\n\nFurther information concerning CNH, including factors that potentially could materially affect its financial results, is included in the Company's reports and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\n\nAll  future  written  and  oral  forward-looking  statements  by  CNH  or  persons  acting  on  the  behalf  of  CNH  are  expressly  qualified  in  their  entirety  by  the cautionary statements contained herein or referred to above.",

(or  'the  Company')  is  incorporated  in,  and  under  the  laws  of  the  Netherlands.  CNH  has  its corporate seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its principal office in Basildon, England, United Kingdom. CNH Industrial N.V. is the company initially formed by the business combination transaction, completed on September 29, 2013, between Fiat Industrial S.p.A. (\"Fiat Industrial\") and its majority owned subsidiary CNH Global N.V. (\"CNH Global\"). Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the terms \"we\", 'us', 'our', 'CNH' and \"the Group\" refer to CNH Industrial N.V. and its subsidiaries.\n\nCNH reports  quarterly  and  annual  consolidated  financial  results  in  accordance  with  accounting  standards  generally accepted  in  the  United  States  ('U.S.  GAAP')  for  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (\"SEC\")  reporting purposes, and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') and adopted by the European Union (\"EU-IFRS\") for Dutch law requirements. The  reconciliation  from  EU-IFRS  figures  to  U.S.  GAAP  is  presented,  on  a  voluntary  basis,  in  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial statements under both sets of accounting principles use the U.S. dollar as the presentation currency.\n\nWe have prepared our annual Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared with the U.S. dollar as the presentation currency and, unless otherwise indicated, all financial data set forth in this Annual Report are expressed in U.S. dollars.\n\nCertain financial information in this Annual Report has been presented by geographic region. Our geographic regions are:  (1)  North America; (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa; (3) South America and (4) Asia Pacific. The geographic designations have the following meanings:\n\n- \u25aa North America : United States, Canada and Mexico;\n- \u25aa Europe, Middle East and Africa :  member countries of the European Union, European Free Trade Association, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Balkans, Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, the African continent and the Middle East;\n- \u25aa South America : Central and South America, and the Caribbean Islands; and\n- \u25aa Asia Pacific : Continental Asia (including the India subcontinent), Indonesia, and Oceania.\n\nCertain  industry  information  in  this  Annual  Report  has  been  presented  on  a  worldwide  basis  which  includes  all countries. In this Annual Report, management estimates of industry information are generally based on retail unit sales data in North America, on registrations of equipment in most of Europe, Brazil, and various other markets, and on retail and shipment unit data collected by a central information bureau appointed by equipment manufacturers associations, including  the  Association  of  Equipment  Manufacturers  in  North America,  the  Committee  for  European  Construction Equipment  in  Europe,  the  Associa\u00e7\u00e3o  Nacional  dos  Fabricantes  de  Ve\u00edculos  Automotores  in  Brazil,  the  Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association, and the Korea Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association, as  well  as  on  other  shipment  data  collected  by  independent  service  bureaus.  Not  all  agricultural  or  construction equipment is registered, and registration data may thus underestimate, perhaps substantially, actual retail industry unit sales demand, particularly for local manufacturers in China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and any country where local shipments are not reported.\n\nDuring  2021,  CNH  completed  a  strategic  project  to  separate  the  Commercial  and  Specialty  Vehicles  business,  the Powertrain  business,  and  the  related  Financial  Services  business  (together  the  'Iveco  Group  Business')  from  the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (juridische afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the 'Demerger'), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nSince  January  3,  2022,  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  Iveco  Group  N.V.  have  been  quoted  separately  on  the  regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management and Board of Directors.",

The targets are incorporated into CNH's Sustainability Plan, which also includes short-term targets, that are  updated  annually  to  monitor  the  progress  of  existing  projects  and  establish  new  targets  to  ensure  continuous improvement, which is essential for long-term growth and value creation.",

        "page_content": "CNH's sustainability priorities and targets are also aligned with the six UN Sustainable Development Goals (\"SDGs\") most relevant to CNH (1) :\n\n- \u25aa SDG 2: Zero hunger - end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture;\n- \u25aa SDG 3: Good health and well-being - ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all;\n- \u25aa SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth - promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all;\n- \u25aa SDG 10: Reduced inequalities - reduce inequality within and among countries;\n- \u25aa SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production - ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns;\n- \u25aa SDG 13: Climate action - take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n\nThese SDGs inspire CNH's future endeavors in terms of sustainability targets, practices, and projects.\n\nSustainability is a core element of CNH's Corporate Governance, with senior management playing a direct and active role.  The  Environmental,  Social,  and  Governance  Committee  (the  \"ESG\")  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (\"Board\")  is responsible for, among other things, assisting the Board in: monitoring and evaluating reports on CNH's sustainable development policies and practices, management standards, strategy, global performance and governance; reviewing and  making  recommendations  on  strategic  sustainability  guidelines,  including  occupational  health  and  safety  and climate-related issues; and reviewing CNH's annual Sustainability Report (2) .\n\nCNH has established an organizational  structure  made  up  of  global  and  regional  sustainability  committees  and  the corporate Sustainability Team to optimize the management of sustainability aspects within CNH.\n\nThe Sustainability Steering Committee ('SSC') are members of the Global Leadership Team (\"GLT\"), and responsible for identifying sustainability strategies, integrating them with business needs, adopting a medium-to-long term vision.\n\nThe SSC is chaired by the Chief Human Resource Officer and is coordinated by the corporate Sustainability Team. The permanent members of the committee are the GLT members.\n\nThe corporate Sustainability Team is a network of internal employees with global and regional expertise responsible for incorporating  sustainability  criteria  into  CNH's  strategy  and  for  ensuring  the  necessary  support  for  sustainability planning and reporting. The Sustainability Team is overseen by the Chief Human Resource Officer.\n\nCNH's sustainability management system consists of the following tools:\n\n- \u25aa the Code of Conduct, approved by the Board of Directors, and related policies that set out CNH's approach to key topics;\n- \u25aa a set of policies to manage specific issues, as well as the Human Capital Management Guidelines, Green Logistics Principles, and the Supplier Code of Conduct;\n- \u25aa the materiality analysis, which defines social and environmental priorities;\n- \u25aa stakeholder engagement on material topics;\n- \u25aa a  set  of  comprehensive  sustainability-related  Key  Performance  Indicators,  designed  to  provide  comprehensive coverage of all the key environmental, social, and governance aspects, in line with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards  (\"GRI  Standards\")  and  the  Sustainability  Accounting  Standards  ('SASB  Standards')  and  those  of  the major sustainability rating agencies; and\n- \u25aa the  annual  Sustainability  Report,  which  discloses  CNH's  strategic  sustainability  targets  and  tracks  commitments undertaken and performance.\n\n## Materiality analysis\n\nThe materiality analysis is a tool that CNH uses to ensure close alignment between the material topics identified and its business  decisions.  CNH's  most  recent  materiality  assessment  adopted  the  double  materiality  framework  that considered  both  the  financial  and  impact  perspectives  of  the  organization.  The  results  are  shared  with  the  GLT members, reviewed by the SSC, and approved by the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The materiality development process and results were reviewed and audited by an independent company.\n\nThe  Materiality  assessment  results  confirmed  the  greater  significance  of  business-related  aspects,  in  line  with  the sustainability priorities defined within CNH's Strategic Business Plan. Specifically, the material topics of Supply Chain, Health and Safety, Products, Climate Change and Biodiversity were considered to have the most critical financial values and impacts on the world. As a result, CNH will continue to monitor these topics closely and set specific targets to manage these issues accordingly.\n\nTo enable comparability over time, where available, the data presented refers to the 3-year period from 2021 to 2023. Target achievement dates are always year-end, i.e., they refer to December 31 of the year indicated.",

        "page_content": "## Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nCNH is committed to climate change mitigation and aims for full transparency in its management of climate-related risks and opportunities through the disclosures provided in this section, in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\"). The following section contains four thematic areas showing how CNH is addressing climate-change risks and opportunities: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets. For further details, please see the TCFD correspondence table at the end of this section.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe highest responsibility for defining and implementing the strategy of CNH is assigned to the Board of Directors. The ESG Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible, among other things, for assisting the Board in reviewing and guiding the strategy and risk management policies related to climate change. Moreover, the Committee is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the measures to meet climate change targets, such as CO2 emissions and energy efficiency. The Committee meets quarterly and, at least twice per year, the Chief Human Resource Officer updates the ESG Committee on the progress of CO2 emissions reduction and energy efficiency in manufacturing.\n\nAt the management level, the highest responsibility for initiatives focusing on energy efficiency and on the management of CO2 emissions at CNH lies with the GLT.\n\nGLT members are also members of the Sustainability Steering Committee (\"SSC\"). The SSC is responsible for defining sustainability  strategy  and  for  integrating  sustainability  aspects  into  operating  processes  and  is  chaired  by  the  Chief Human Resource Officer.\n\nThe  operating  segments  of  CNH  are  fully  responsible  for  the  global  growth  and  performance  of  their  respective businesses,  thereby  increasing  focus  and  accountability.  For  this  reason,  the  different  segments  have  nominated specific committees responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the Group's strategy. Climate-change issues are regularly discussed by these committees to ensure responsible management of climate risks and to identify trends and opportunities, including potential impacts of new product development and new market considerations.\n\nAdditionally, the Risk Management Center of Competence addresses all stages of pure risk (3) management, including risk identification, analysis, and treatment (including loss prevention).\n\nTo further align the management commitment to climate-change mitigation, part of the CEO's and other GLT members' remuneration  is  linked  to  sustainability  targets,  such  as  the  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  per  production  unit.  The remuneration of the management is reviewed and approved by the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nTargets  are  defined  for  business  unit  and  energy  managers  and  are  related  to  energy  consumption  reduction  and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. Targets are also included in CNH's Performance Management Process.\n\n## Strategy\n\nCNH's sustainability strategy is framed within the Company's purpose, Breaking New Ground, which incorporates a set of  values that lie at the core of the Company's day-to-day activities and are intrinsically linked to its future business success.  Specific  to  climate  change,  and  as  described  further  below,  CNH  has  an  established  risk  management process that includes the assessment and monitoring of climate-related risk. These assessments are used by CNH to identify  not  only  risk  exposure,  but  also  opportunities,  on  which  the  Group's  climate  change  strategy  is  based.  The identification of these climate-related risks and opportunities, along with the analysis of sustainability macrotrends, led to  the  definition  of  a  decarbonization  strategy,  which  in  turn  has  been  incorporated  within,  and  regularly  influences, CNH's Strategic  Business  Plan. To  further  address  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change,  CNH  has  implemented relevant projects and a number of other specific climate-related topics and has defined long-term strategic targets.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are embedded within CNH's strategy to ensure resiliency of its business model in  light  of  shifting  global  challenges.  CNH  has  established  specific  functions  and  structures  within  its  respective operating segments to monitor the relevant emerging policies and regulatory developments at local and global level. Resulting  analyses  are  incorporated  within  the  Group  strategy  to  ensure  full  compliance  with  applicable  laws.  CNH develops its product portfolio to steer the focus of research and development toward sustainable technologies (e.g., electric and biomethane propulsion technologies, digitalization and related intelligent capabilities that include precision farming  and  smart  water  management).  CNH  also  takes  advantage  of  the  collaboration  with  strategic  business partners, startups, and external expertise in the emerging technology sector.\n\nTo  ensure  the  timely  delivery  of  its  strategy,  CNH  has  established  specific  targets  linked  to  the  environmental performance  of  its  manufacturing  processes,  logistics,  and  product  portfolio,  as  outlined  in  the  section  Metrics  and Targets below.\n\nCNH developed a scenario analysis which led to the identification of the Internal Price of Carbon ('IPoC'), an indicator that  enables  it  to  prioritize  energy-saving  projects  based  on  their  ability  to  generate  the  greatest  reduction  in  CO2 emissions.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management\n\nRisk management is an important component of CNH's overall culture and is integral to the achievement of its longterm business plan. Accordingly, CNH's Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') framework is designed to assist in the identification,  evaluation,  and  prioritization  of  business  risks,  followed  by  a  coordinated  and  balanced  application  of resources to identify, monitor, and control the probability or impact of adverse events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.\n\nCNH's ERM processes are aligned with the Group's Sustainability Program and its strategic sustainability targets and aspirational goals, including those related to climate change, which are articulated in the Group's Strategic Business Plan.\n\nThe effects of climate change represent a key emerging risk to CNH and, as referenced above, examples of its related mitigation actions include investments in technology as part of its decarbonization strategy, and efforts to reduce energy consumption in manufacturing processes.\n\nMore details on CNH's enterprise risk management framework, including its risk appetite for individual risk categories, can be found in the Risk Management and Control System section of this Report.\n\n## Pure Risk Management\n\nTo strengthen sustainability and resilience within the company, CNH also works to develop and launch forward-looking solutions  to  better  understand  the  impacts  of  natural  hazards  and  to  respond  accordingly.  The  ability  to  assess  the losses  and  costs  associated  with  natural  hazards  is  essential  for  better  decision  making  on  hazard-mitigation investments and planning.\n\nCNH's Risk Management function has developed a risk management methodology in collaboration with the Group's Environment  Health  &  Safety  (\"EHS\")  departments,  a  major  international  consultancy  and  certification  firm,  and  an insurance  partner.  This  methodology  has  enabled  CNH  to:  (i)  obtain  objective,  quantified  knowledge  of  insurable environmental exposures; (ii) improve risk profiles according to the segments' EHS strategies; (iii) identify and clearly communicate priorities and benefits; (iv) effectively inform the insurance market about the loss prevention activities in place  to  prevent  or  mitigate  potential  environmental  losses;  (v)  obtain  adequate  environmental  insurance  coverage, commensurate with risk exposures and current loss prevention activities; (vi) carry out prevention activities in line with Group strategies. These activities provided the basis for the development of CNH's first environmental maps, which quantify  the  overall  level  of  risk  using  a  scientific,  certified  self-assessment  tool.  The  results  were  presented  to  the insurance market as evidence that CNH's environmental risks are known, well-quantified, and properly managed. The results also led to comprehensive global insurance coverage.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nCNH has developed various indicators and tools to assess its contribution, exposure, and resilience to climate change. CO2  emissions  are  calculated  according  to  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol  (GHG  Protocol),  incorporated  into  CNH Guidelines.\n\n| METRICS                                                               | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Plants in scope                                                       | 30     | 31     | 31     |\n| Direct energy consumption from renewable sources (GJ/000)             | 16     | 15     | 6      |\n| Direct energy consumption from non-renewable sources (GJ/000)         | 2,172  | 2,360  | 2,181  |\n| Total direct energy consumption (GJ/000)                              | 2,188  | 2,375  | 2,187  |\n| Total indirect energy consumption from renewable sources (GJ/000)     | 798    | 784    | 661    |\n| Total indirect energy consumption from non-renewable sources (GJ/000) | 536    | 624    | 707    |\n| Total indirect energy consumption (GJ/000)                            | 1,334  | 1,408  | 1,368  |\n| Direct CO2 emissions (Scope 1) (Mtons/000)                            | 118    | 128    | 120    |\n| Indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 2 - market-based) (Mtons/000)           | 88     | 106    | 102    |\n| Indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 2 - location-based) (Mtons/000)         | 123    | 127    | 121    |\n| Total CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 - market-based) (Mtons/000)  | 206    | 234    | 222    |\n\nBased on the climate-related risks and opportunities identified, CNH sets targets to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency:\n\n| TARGETS                                                             |   REFERENCE  PERIOD | 2023  RESULTS   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| 50% reduction vs. 2018 in CO 2  /h of production by 2030            |                2030 | -35.5%          |\n| 90% of total electricity consumption derived from renewable sources |                2030 | 63.4%           |",

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy on sustainable activities\n\nThe EU Taxonomy classification system introduced by the Regulation 2020/852 establishes a list of environmentally sustainable  economic  activities,  supporting  the  EU  Green  Deal  objectives (1) .  The  Regulation  provides  for  common definitions that identify when an economic activity can be considered as environmentally sustainable.\n\nThere are currently six environmental (2) objectives in the EU Taxonomy. Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation are regulated by the Climate Delegated Act, while the Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources,  Transition  to  a  Circular  Economy,  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  and  Protection  and  Restoration  of Biodiversity and Ecosystems are regulated by the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nFor  each  objective,  the  EU  Taxonomy  defines  the  list  of  economic  activities  that  can  substantially  contribute  to  it, provided that it meets the related technical screening criteria (\"TSC\") (3) .\n\nFor  financial  year  2023,  companies  have  to  disclose  information  of  both  taxonomy-aligned  and  taxonomy-eligible economic  activities  for  the  first  two  environmental  objectives:  climate  change  mitigation  (CCM)  and  climate  change adaptation (CCA), as defined by the Climate Delegated Act (Delegated Regulation 2139/2021). In addition, companies have to disclose the taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the new activities added to the Climate Delegated Act, as well as the activities related to the four other environmental objectives (i.e. protection of water and marine resources, transition  to  a  circular  economy,  pollution  prevention  and  control,  and  protection  and  restoration  of  biodiversity  and ecosystems) as defined by the Environmental Delegated Act (Delegated Regulation 2023/2486).\n\nFor each eligible activity for CCM and CCA, the Company shall then assess if the activity:\n\n- \u00b7 contribute substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives;\n- \u00b7 does not significantly harm (DNSH) any of the environmental objectives;\n- \u00b7 complies with minimum safeguards referred to in Art. 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, and\n- \u00b7 complies with technical screening criteria.\n\n## Eligibility assessment of CNH economic activities'\n\nCNH conducted an eligibility assessment of its core business activities and operations, comparing the latter against the subsections of Annexes I and II of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.\n\nIn this context, CNH identified eligible activities corresponding to 5 out of 6 climate and environmental objectives (for additional detail refer to the below presented EU Taxonomy list of activities).\n\nCNH defined as eligible the production of electric traction technologies, which falls within the definition of the activity 3.6 - 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies'.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  identified  a  list  of  additional  activities,  related  to  expenses  incurred  during  2023  that  can  be considered individually as Taxonomy-eligible investments, as contributing to the aim to reduce Group's greenhouse gas emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 1.1 - Manufacture of plastic packaging goods;\n- \u00b7 1.2 - Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment;\n- \u00b7 2.1 - Water supply;\n- \u00b7 2.3 - Sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS);\n- \u00b7 2.4 - Remediation of contaminated sites and areas;\n- \u00b7 3.3 - Demolition and wrecking of buildings and other structures;\n- \u00b7 3.4 - Maintenance of roads and motorways;\n- \u00b7 3.5 - Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings;\n- \u00b7 3.5 - Use of concrete in civil engineering;\n- \u00b7 3.8 - Manufacture of aluminum;\n- \u00b7 4.1 - Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology;\n- \u00b7 4.1 - Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions;\n- \u00b7 4.9 - Transmission and distribution of electricity;\n- \u00b7 4.16 - Installation and operation of electric heat pumps;\n- \u00b7 5.1 - Construction, extension and operation of water collection, treatment and supply systems;\n- \u00b7 5.2 - Renewal of water collection, treatment and supply systems;\n- \u00b7 5.5 - Collection and transport of non-hazardous waste in source segregated fractions;\n- \u00b7 5.5 - Product-as-a-service and other circular use- and result-oriented service models;\n- \u00b7 6.5 - Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles;",

SCC  determines  the  conditions  under  which  a  specific  economic  activity  qualifies  as contributing  substantially  to  climate  change  mitigation  or  climate  change  adaptation,  respectively. The  DNSH  should ensure that the economic activity has no significant negative environmental impact. For all the expenses considered as eligible,  as  the  Group  did  not  assess  the  full  compliance  of  the  suppliers  to  the  TSC  and  MSS,  a  precautionary approach was preferred.\n\nFor eligible activity 3.6, the Group assessed whether or not the technical screening criteria was met. For activity 3.6, an LCA  verified  by  an  independent  third  party  for  each  solution  is  required,  and  it  has  to  be  compared  to  the  best performing alternative technology/product/solution available on the market (4) .\n\nThe assessment led us to determine activity 3.6 as not aligned because LCA verification has not been completed and does not satisfy requirements at this time.\n\nFor  other  OpEX  and  CapEX  activities  above  listed  and  considered  as  eligible,  the  group  assessed  whether  the technical screening criteria were met. Using a conservative approach, we cannot confirm that all technical screening criteria were met.",

        "page_content": "## Minimum Safeguard Assessment\n\nArticle  3  of  the  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation  sets  a  further  requirement  for  the  economic  activities  to  be  considered sustainable.  Not  only  the  activities  shall  meet  the  TSC,  but  they  shall  also  be  socially  sustainable  by  meeting  the minimum safeguards.\n\nThe  Taxonomy  Regulation  requires  that  the  entity  conducting  an  eligible  activity  shall  also  implement  measures  to ensure  the  alignment  with  the  OECD  (Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development)  Guidelines  for Multinational  Enterprises  and  with  the  UN  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights.  Those  procedures include  the  principles  and  rights  set  out  in  the  eight  fundamental  conventions  identified  in  the  Declaration  of  the International  Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work  and  the  International  Bill  of Human Rights.\n\nTo verify compliance with minimum safeguards on its activities, CNH conducted a specific assessment activity.\n\nAs referenced in our Corporate Governance Chapter, CNH respects and promotes human rights in line with national laws, the fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nCNH is committed to ensuring respect for fundamental human rights wherever it operates and seeks to promote respect for these principles by others where it has an influence, particularly among contractors, suppliers, and other entities and individuals with whom it has a business relationship.\n\nCNH monitors respect for human rights both internally, through the Internal Audit function, and for suppliers, through an annual  assessment  process.  CNH  also  seeks  to  implement  a  variety  of  measures  (e.g.,  training  activities)  to  help employees understand and address human rights issues in the course of their work.\n\nCNH has adopted an Anti-Corruption Compliance Policy, which assigns responsibilities and establishes procedures that are  designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  applicable  anti-corruption  legislation  and  regulations  worldwide.  The Company's tax risk management strategy focuses on managing and minimizing the possibility of operating in violation of  tax  regulations  or  in  a  way  that  is  contrary  to  the  principles  or  purposes  of  the  tax  system.  The  Company  has established a compliance and ethics program and lastly, CNH's Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct, which stipulate, among other things, respect of fair competition and antitrust regulation.\n\n## Accounting Policy (1.2.1)\n\nFor the determination of the KPIs, the Group's Sustainability department, and the Accounting and Finance Department were involved, which, based on the indications given in Annex 1 to Disclosure Delegated Act (Delegated Regulation 2178/2021), identified the values to be included in the KPIs from the balance sheet items, as described in the next paragraph.\n\nAs for  the  calculation  of  the  numerator,  only  the  balance  sheet  items  related  to  the  identified  activities  (refer  to  the activities  listed  in  the  paragraph  \" Eligibility  assessment  of  CNH  economic  activities\" )  were  considered.  As  for  the calculation of the denominator, all the items provided for by the regulations at a consolidated CNH Industrial N.V. level were included, as specified within the contextual information paragraph.\n\n## Assessment of compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (1.2.2)\n\nCNH identified thirty-six taxonomy eligible activities, which do not meet all the relevant technical screening criteria.\n\nTo avoid any double counting in the calculation of the KPIs, the values were determined directly from the items included in  the  financial  statement  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  (for  additional  details  refer  to  the  below  paragraph  \" Contextual information (1.2.3.)\" and to the information presented in the EU Taxonomy list of activities table).\n\n## Contextual information (1.2.3)\n\nTurnover KPI:\n\n- a) The denominator was identified based on Group's consolidated net turnover from industrial activities (Refer to Note 1 \"Net revenues\").\n- b) The  numerator  was  identified  including  net  sales  from  sales  of  electrical  construction  vehicles  (activity  3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies').\n\n## CapEx KPI:\n\n- a) The denominator consists of additions to tangible and intangible fixed assets during the financial year, before depreciation,  amortization,  and  any  re-measurements,  including  those  resulting  from  revaluations  and impairments, as well as excluding changes in fair value (Refer to Note 13 \"Intangible assets\" and Note 14 \"Property, plant and equipment\" for Industrial Activities capital expenditures).\n- b) The numerator equals capital expenditures, that are part of the denominator, referred to the eligible activities and in particular capital expenditures on fixed assets and R&D costs capitalized of the industrial activities.",

It also includes investments in relation to alternative propulsion (low carbon technologies) R&D and Capital investments.\n\n## OpEx KPI:\n\n- a) The  denominator  includes  all  direct  non-capitalized  costs  related  to  maintenance,  building  renovation measures, research and development, short-term lease, and any other direct expenditures relating to the dayto-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment.\n- b) The numerator equals the direct non-capitalized costs that are part of the denominator referred to eligible activities and in particular innovation and advanced engineer development for Products Electrification and alternative propulsion solutions and R&D not capitalized of industrial activities.\n\nThere are no amounts in the reported values related to economic activities included in the taxonomy conducted for the internal consumption of the Group.\n\nWithin the CapEx and OpEx items, there are no items related to a plan to expand the economic activities aligned to the taxonomy.\n\nAfter investigating and consulting on EU Taxonomy's list of activities, the KPIs related are included in the tables below.\n\nProportion of turnover from

Row crop farmers typically purchase tractors at the midto-upper  end  of  the  horsepower  (\"hp\")  range,  combine  harvesters,  harvesting  equipment  and  crop  production equipment. Dairy and livestock farmers typically utilize tractors in the mid-to-lower hp range and crop preparation and crop packaging implements. The key factors influencing sales of agricultural equipment are the level of net farm income and, to a lesser extent, general economic conditions, interest rates and the availability of financing and related subsidy programs,  farmland  prices  and  farm  debt  levels.  Net  farm  income  is  primarily  impacted  by  the  volume  of  acreage planted, commodity and/or livestock prices and stock levels, crop yields, farm operating expenses (including fuel and fertilizer costs), fluctuations in currency exchange rates, government subsidies, tax incentives and trade policies. The availability, quality, and cost of used equipment for sale affects the level of new equipment sales. Weather conditions are  a  major  determinant  of  crop  yields  and  crop  prices  and  therefore  affect  equipment-buying  decisions.  Global organization  initiatives,  such  as  those  of  the  World  Trade  Organization,  also  can  affect  the  market  acceptance  of genetically  modified  organisms  such  as  seed,  feed  and  animals  and  can  promote  climate  change  and  sustainability initiatives that may have an impact on agriculture.\n\nDemand for agricultural equipment also varies seasonally by region and product, primarily due to differing climates and farming calendars. Peak retail deliveries for tractors and planting, seeding, and application equipment typically occur in March through June in the Northern hemisphere and in September through December in the Southern hemisphere. Dealers order equipment year-round but harvesting equipment orders in the Northern hemisphere generally increase in the late fall and winter so that the dealers can receive inventory before the peak retail selling season, which generally extends from March through June. In the Southern hemisphere, dealers generally order between August and October so they can receive inventory before the peak retail-selling season, which extends from November through February. Agriculture's production levels are based upon estimated retail demand, which takes into account, among other things, the  timing  of  dealer  shipments,  dealer  and  Company  inventory  levels,  the  need  to  retool  manufacturing  facilities  to produce new or different models, and the efficient use of labor and facilities. As production and wholesale shipments adjust throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales of agricultural equipment in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand for that period. However, the Company strives to match production scheduling to retail demand, driving lean manufacturing and enabling the shortest lead time to the final customer.\n\nCustomer  preferences  regarding  farming  practices,  and  thus  product  types  and  features,  vary  by  region.  In  North America, Australia, Brazil, Argentina and other areas where soil conditions, climate, economic factors and population density  allow  for  intensive  mechanized  agriculture,  farmers  generally  demand  high  capacity,  sophisticated  machines equipped with the most advanced technology. In Europe, where farms are generally smaller in size than those in North America  and Australia,  there  is  greater  demand  for  somewhat  smaller,  yet  equally  sophisticated,  machines.  In  the developing regions of the world where labor is more abundant and infrastructure, soil conditions and/or climate are not conducive to intensive agriculture, customers generally prefer simpler and easy to use machines with relatively lower acquisition and operating costs. In many developing countries, tractors are the primary type of agricultural equipment used, and much of the agricultural work in such countries that cannot be performed by tractors is carried out by hand. A growing  number of  part-time  farmers,  hobby  farmers  and  customers  engaged  in  landscaping,  municipality  and  park maintenance, golf course and roadside mowing in Western Europe and North America prefer relatively simple, low-cost agricultural  equipment.  Our  position  as  a  geographically  diversified  manufacturer  of  agricultural  equipment  and  our broad geographic network of dealers allows us to provide customers in each significant market with equipment that meets their specific requirements.\n\nOne agricultural trend in North America, Western European, and Brazil includes a reduction in number, but growth in size of farms, supporting increased demand for higher capacity agricultural equipment. In addition, we believe that the use of technology and other precision technology and solutions (including the development of autonomously operated equipment) to enhance productivity, profitability and environmental impact are becoming more important in the buyers' purchasing decision. In South America (other than Brazil), India and in other emerging markets, the number of farms is growing,  and  mechanization  is  replacing  manual  labor.  In  other  markets,  long-term  demographic  trends,  increasing urbanization, and low level of farm mechanization represent the key drivers of demand for agricultural equipment.\n\nGovernment farm programs, including the amount and timing of government payments, are a key income driver for farmers raising certain commodity crops in the United States (the \"U.S.\") and the European Union. The existence of comprehensive  subsidies  in  these  agricultural/farm  markets  reduces  the  effects  of  cyclicality  in  the  agricultural equipment  business.  The  existence  and  extent  of  subsidies  depends  largely  on  the  U.S.  Farm  Bill  and  programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union and  World  Trade  Organization  negotiations.  Additionally,  the  Brazilian  government  subsidizes  the  purchase  of agricultural equipment through low-rate financing programs administered by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social ('BNDES'). These programs have had over the years a significant influence on sales.",

        "page_content": "Global demand for renewable fuels increased considerably in recent years driven by consumer preference, government renewable fuel mandates, renewable fuel tax and production incentives. Biofuels, which include fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, have become one of the most prevalent types of renewable fuels. The primary type of biofuel supported by government mandates and incentives varies by region. North America and Brazil are promoting ethanol first and then biodiesel, while Europe is primarily focused on biodiesel and biomethane.\n\nThe demand for biofuels has created an associated demand for agriculturally  based  feedstocks,  which  are  used  to produce  biofuels.  Currently,  most  of  the  ethanol  in  the  U.S.  and  Europe  is  extracted  from  corn,  while  in  Brazil  it  is extracted from sugar cane. Biodiesel is typically extracted from soybeans and rapeseed oil in the U.S. and Brazil, and from rapeseed and other oil seeds as well as food waste by-products in Europe. The use of corn and soybeans for biofuel has been one of the main factors affecting the supply and demand relationships, as well as the price for these crops. The economic feasibility of biofuels is significantly impacted by the price of oil. As the price of oil falls, biofuels become a less attractive alternative energy source. This relationship will, however, be impacted by government policy and mandates as governments around the world consider ways to combat global warming and avoid potential energy resource issues in the future.\n\nSustainability  has  been  an  ongoing  focus  for  CNH.  During  the  2023  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference, COP28 event in the United Arab Emirates, there was an assessment of progress towards climate action and a call to accelerate  carbon  reduction  with  an  establishment  of  a  Loss  and  Damage  Fund,  which  aims  to  provide  financial assistance to nations most vulnerable and impacted by the effects of climate change. With the use of a bio-digester, animal and food waste can be processed to produce bio-methane. CNH has developed two New Holland brand key livestock models of methane-powered tractors (T6 and T7) that could also run on methane produced on the farm from animal  and  food  waste.  CNH  has  a  controlling  stake  in  Bennamann  Ltd  (\"Bennamann\"),  a  U.K.-based  technology company,  that  has  developed  a  solution  to  capture  fugitive  emissions  of  methane  from  livestock  farm  waste  and repurpose  it  into  a  better-than-zero-carbon  biofuel.  The  Company  believes  that  this  solution  is  suitable  for  small  to medium size farms - enabling a farm to become energy independent, less polluting, net-zero carbon, sustainable and regenerative.\n\nThis approach also improves the sustainability of farmland management practices by minimizing artificial inputs (e.g., manufactured fertilizer), lowering operational costs and reducing pollutants. This concept is intended to contribute to a dairy farm's decarbonization .\n\nThe developments in precision technology and solutions are designed to allow farmers to increase yield with reduced input  costs  in  the  areas  of  labor,  fertilizer,  chemicals  and  water.  Further,  with  shorter  planting  and  harvesting  cycles experienced in recent years, we believe that precision agriculture technology will help drive replacement demand for new farm equipment as this technology is designed to improve farm efficiency.\n\n## Construction\n\nThe construction equipment market consists of two principal segments: heavy construction equipment (excluding the mining  and  the  specialized  forestry  equipment  markets  in  which  we  do  not  participate),  with  equipment  generally weighing more than 12 metric tons, and light construction equipment, with equipment generally weighing less than 12 metric tons.\n\nIn developed markets, customers tend to prefer more sophisticated machines equipped with the latest technology such as machine control, automation and features to improve operator productivity. In developing markets, customers tend to prefer equipment that is relatively less costly and has greater perceived durability. In North America and Europe, where the  hourly  cost  of  machine  operators  is  higher  relative  to  fuel  costs  and  machine  depreciation,  customers  typically emphasize productivity, performance, and reliability. In other markets, where the relative cost for machine operators is lower, customers often continue to use equipment after its relative performance and efficiency have begun to diminish.\n\nCustomer demand for power and operating capacity does not vary significantly from market to market. However, in many countries, restrictions on equipment weight or dimensions, as well as road regulations or job site constraints can limit demand for larger machines.\n\nAlthough  the  demand  for  new  construction  equipment  tends  to  decrease  during  periods  of  economic  stagnation  or recession, the aftersales market is historically less volatile than the new equipment market and, therefore, helps limit the impact of declines in new equipment sales on the operating results of full-line manufacturers, such as Construction.\n\n## Heavy Construction\n\nHeavy  construction  equipment  typically  includes  general  construction  equipment  such  as  large  wheel  loaders  and excavators, and road building and site preparation equipment such as graders, compactors and dozers. Purchasers of heavy construction equipment include construction companies, municipalities, local governments, rental fleet owners, quarrying and mining companies, waste management companies and forestry-related concerns.\n\nSales of heavy construction equipment depend on the expected volume of major infrastructure construction and repair projects  such  as  highway,  tunnel,  dam  and  harbor  projects,  which  depend  on  government  spending  and  economic growth.  Demand for aggregate mining and quarrying equipment is more closely linked to the general economy and",

        "page_content": "commodity  prices.  In  North  America,  a  portion  of  heavy  equipment  demand  has  historically  been  linked  to  the development of new housing subdivisions, where the entire infrastructure needs to be created, thus linking demand for both  heavy  and  light  construction  equipment.  The  heavy  equipment  industry  generally  follows  macroeconomic cyclicality, linked to growth in gross domestic product and government spending.\n\n## Light Construction\n\nLight  construction  equipment  is  also  known  as  compact  and  service  equipment,  and  it  includes  skid-steer  loaders, compact track loaders, tractor loaders, rough terrain forklifts, backhoe loaders, small wheel loaders and excavators. Purchasers  of  light  construction  equipment  include  contractors,  residential  builders,  utilities,  road  construction companies, rental fleet owners, landscapers, logistics companies, and farmers. The principal factor influencing sales of light construction equipment is the level of residential and commercial construction, remodeling and renovation, which is influenced  by  interest  rates  and  the  availability  of  financing.  Other  major  factors  include  the  construction  of  light infrastructure, such as utilities, cabling and piping and maintenance expenditures. The principal use of light construction equipment is to replace relatively high-cost, slower manual work. Product demand in the United States and Europe has generally tended to mirror housing starts, with lags of six to twelve months. In areas where labor is abundant, and the cost of labor is inexpensive relative to other inputs, such as in India, Africa and South America, the light construction equipment  market  is  generally  smaller.  These  regions  represent  potential  areas  of  growth  for  light  construction equipment  in  the  medium  to  long-term  as  labor  costs  rise  relative  to  the  cost  of  equipment  or  the  supply  of  labor contracts, leading to increased mechanization.\n\nEquipment  rental  is  a  significant  element  of  the  construction  equipment  market.  Compared  to  the  U.K.  and  Japan, where there is an established market for long-term equipment rentals as a result of favorable tax treatment, the rental market  in  North  America  and  Western  Europe  (except  for  the  U.K.)  consists  mainly  of  short-term  rentals  of  light construction equipment to individuals or small contractors for which the purchase of equipment is not cost effective or that need specialized equipment for specific jobs. In North America, the main rental product has traditionally been the backhoe loader and, in Western Europe, it has been the mini-excavator. As the market has evolved, a greater variety of light  and  heavy  equipment  products  have  become  available  to  rent.  In  addition,  rental  companies  have  allowed contractors to rent machines for longer periods instead of purchasing the equipment, enabling contractors to complete specific  job  requirements  with  greater  flexibility  and  cost  control.  Large,  national  rental  companies  can  significantly impact  the  construction  equipment  market,  with  purchase  volumes  being  driven  by  their  decisions  to  increase  or decrease the size of their rental fleets based on rental utilization rates.\n\nSeasonal demand for construction equipment fluctuates somewhat less than for agricultural equipment. Nevertheless, in North America and Western Europe, housing construction generally slows during the winter months. North American and  European  industry  retail  demand  for  construction  equipment  is  generally  strongest  in  the  second  and  fourth quarters.\n\nAgricultural  and  landscaping  customers  also  contribute  to  a  significant  portion  of  the  North America  light  equipment market. In this segment the main applications are related to material handling.\n\nIn markets outside of North America, Western Europe and Japan, equipment demand may also be partially satisfied by importing used equipment. Used heavy construction equipment from North America may fulfill demand in the South American market and equipment from Western Europe may be sold to Central and Eastern European, North African and  Middle  Eastern  markets.  Used  heavy  and  light  equipment  from  Japan  is  mostly  sold  to  other  Southeast Asian markets,  while  used  excavators  from  Japan  are  sold  to  almost  every  other  market  in  the  world.  This  flow  of  used equipment is highly influenced by exchange rates, the weight and dimensions of the equipment and the different local regulations in terms of safety and/or engine emissions.\n\nThe construction equipment industry has seen an increase in the use of hydraulic excavators and wheel loaders in earth-moving and material handling applications. In addition, the light equipment sector has grown as more manual labor is being replaced on construction sites by machines with a variety of attachments for specialized applications, such as skid steer loaders, compact track loaders and mini-crawler excavators.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe  Agriculture  and  Construction  equipment  industries  are  highly  competitive.  We  believe  that  we  have  many competitive strengths that will enable us to improve our position in markets where we are already well established while we direct additional resources to markets and products with high-growth potential.\n\nWe compete with: (i) large global full-line equipment manufacturers with a presence in every market and a broad range of  products  that  cover  most  customer  needs,  (ii)  manufacturers  who  are  product  specialists  focused  on  particular industry  segments  on  either  a  global  or  regional  basis,  (iii)  regional  full-line  manufacturers,  some  of  which  are expanding worldwide to build a global presence, and (iv) local, low-cost manufacturers in individual markets, particularly in emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, India and China.\n\nOur competitive strengths include well-recognized brands, a full range of competitive products and features, including software, a strong presence, distribution and customer service network and a captive financing arm. There are multiple",

        "page_content": "factors  that  influence  a  buyer's  choice  of  industrial  equipment. These  factors  include  the  strength  and  quality  of  the distribution network, brand loyalty, product features, quality and performance, availability of a full product range, pricing, technological innovations, product availability, financing terms, parts and warranty programs, resale value and customer service and satisfaction. The ability to meet or exceed applicable engine emissions standards as they take effect is also a key competitive factor, particularly in those markets where such standards are the subject of frequent legislative or regulatory scrutiny and change, such as Europe and North America. Emission regulations are becoming a significant competitive factor at global level with new legislation in India and China, which leads to increases in product costs. We continually seek to improve in each of these areas but focus primarily on providing high-quality and high-value products with  environment  protection  features,  and  on  supporting  those  products  through  our  dealer  networks.  Customers' perceptions  of  product  value  in  terms  of  productivity,  reliability,  digital  content,  resale  value  and  dealer  support  are formed over many years. Buyers tend to favor brands based on experience with the product, the dealer, and the service network.\n\nThe efficiency of our manufacturing, logistics and scheduling systems are dependent on forecasts of industry volumes and our anticipated share of industry sales, which is predicated on our ability to compete successfully with others in the marketplace. We compete based on product performance, customer service, quality, precision technology and other innovations and price. The environment is by nature competitive from a pricing standpoint, but we have been able to counter inflationary cost increases with positive price realization. There is no guarantee that we can maintain positive price realization in the future. The ability of our supply chain and manufacturing system to timely deliver finished goods is also critical to meeting customer expectations. Failure to do so might imply losses of competitiveness.\n\nOur main competitors in the agricultural equipment market are Deere & Company, AGCO Corporation, Claas Group, Kubota Tractor Corporation, Argo Tractors S.p.A., and the Same Deutz Fahr Group.\n\nOur  principal  competitors  in  the  construction  equipment  market  are  Caterpillar  Inc.,  Komatsu  Ltd.,  J  C  Bamford Excavators  Ltd.,  Hitachi  Construction  Machinery  Co,  Ltd.,  Volvo  Group,  Liebherr  Group,  Develon,  Bobcat,  Kubota Tractor Corporation, SANY Heavy Industry Co., Ltd and Deere & Company.\n\n## PRODUCTS AND MARKETS\n\n## Agriculture\n\nTo capitalize on customer loyalty to its dealers and its brands, Agriculture's product lines are sold primarily under the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands as well as the STEYR and Kongskilde brands in Europe and the Miller and Flexi-Coil brands, primarily in North America and Australia. Raven primarily operates in North America, Australia, South America and Europe. Certain agricultural equipment products are also sold under the K-Line brand. We believe that these brands enjoy high levels of brand identification and loyalty among both customers and dealers.\n\nAlthough  newer  generation  tractors  have  a  high  percentage  of  common  mechanical  components,  each  brand  and product remains differentiated by features, color, interior and exterior styling, warranty terms, technology offering, and model designation. Flagship products such as row crop tractors and large combine harvesters may have significantly greater differentiation.\n\nDistinctive features that are specific to a particular brand such as the Supersteer \u00ae tractor axle or Twin Rotor combine threshing  technology  for  New  Holland,  the  Case  IH  tracked  four-wheel  drive  tractor,  Quadtrac \u00ae ,  and  the  front  axle mounted hitch for STEYR tractors are examples of certain distinctive features that remain an important part of each brand's unique identity.\n\nAgriculture's  product  lines  include  tractors,  combine  harvesters,  hay  and  forage  equipment,  seeding  and  planting equipment, and self-propelled sprayers. Our agricultural equipment is sold with a limited warranty that typically runs from one to three years.\n\nCNH  is  committed  to  advancing  technology  in  agriculture  and  is  investing  in  integrated  solutions  and  precision technologies  across  the  equipment  portfolio.  Our  technology  stack  spans  digital  web  and  mobile  platforms,  core technologies  such  as  global  navigation  satellite  system  (GNSS)  positioning,  connectivity  and  displays,  automation covering product control and guidance, and  capabilities like autonomy.\n\nIn  the  digital  space,  Case  IH  and  New Holland Agriculture brands enable customers to visualize and share in-depth real-time machine and farm operation data within the respective AFS-PLM Farm solution and offer data sharing to a third-party providers at full control of the customer. Our digital capabilities were bolstered in 2019 by our acquisition of AgDNA, an industry-leading Farm Management Information System (FMIS) that automatically collects and analyzes data  from  equipment  manufactured by CNH and third-party manufacturers. Our AFS-PLM digital platforms  connect farmers  to  their  equipment,  dealers,  input  providers,  partners,  and  advisors.  By  analyzing  machine,  agronomic,  and environmental data, these platforms deliver insights, empowering customers to optimize their operational performance and enhance farm profitability\n\nCNH's core technologies, inclusive of GNSS positioning, connectivity, and displays, were  augmented by the acquisition of Raven Industries, Inc., ('Raven') in 2021 and Hemisphere GNSS ('Hemisphere') in 2023. With Raven as part of the agriculture product portfolio, we now design, manufacture, sell, and service a  suite of core technology products both as",

The Raven integration  has  strengthened  our  portfolio  with  a  wide  range  of  innovative  guidance  offerings  and  has  helped  to accelerate  the  development  of  advanced  machine  automation  and  autonomous  agriculture  technology.  In  2023,  we acquired  Augmenta  Holding  SAS  (\"Augmenta\"),  a  machine  vision  company  that  automates  and  optimizes  farming operations.  Augmenta  has  built  a  real-time,  multi-spectral  sensor  that  can  perceive  canopy  health,  objects,  and patterns. Their technology utilizes edge computing, computer vision, and machine learning and translates images into agronomic  insights. Augmenta's  solution  is  designed  to  ease  the  burden  on  farmers  and  growers  so  that  they  can simply and efficiently achieve their goals.\n\nCNH  supports  our  customers  throughout  the  entire  equipment  lifecycle.  We  offer  a  suite  of  aftermarket  solutions spanning  guidance,  automated  steering  systems,  application  control  products,  and  correction  services  to  ensure customers have technology options wherever they are in their precision tech adoption journey.\n\n## Construction\n\nConstruction's product lines are sold primarily under the CASE Construction Equipment and New Holland Construction brands. CASE provides a wide range of products on a global scale, including crawler excavators and mini-excavators. The New Holland Construction brand family also markets a full product line of construction equipment in South America and focuses on light equipment distributed by the Agriculture network in the other regions. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sampierana S.p.A., which provides Construction direct control over technology and manufacturing of Mini and Midi Excavators. In 2023, we developed and launched our first range of mini track loaders under our Eurocomach brand.\n\nConstruction's products often share common components to achieve economies of scale in manufacturing, purchasing, and development. Construction differentiates these products based on the relative product value, technology, design concept, productivity, product serviceability, color, and styling to preserve the unique identity of each brand.\n\nHeavy  construction  equipment  product  lines  include  general  construction  equipment  such  as  large  excavators  and wheel  loaders,  and  road  building  and  site  preparation  equipment  such  as  compactors,  graders  and  dozers.  Light construction  equipment  is  also  known  as  compact  and  service  equipment,  and  its  product  lines  include  backhoe loaders, skid steer and tracked loaders, mini- and midi- excavators, and compact wheel loaders. The brands each offer parts  and  support  services  for  all  of  their  product  lines.  Our  construction  equipment  is  generally  sold  with  a  limited warranty that typically runs from one to two years.\n\nBeginning  in  2023,  we  have  produced  and  distributed  battery-powered  compact  construction  equipment,  including electric  mini  excavators  and  small  articulated  loaders.  We  plan  to  continue  to  deliver  battery-powered  compact construction equipment solutions to help our customers reduce tailpipe emissions.\n\nWe continue to evaluate our Construction business with a view toward increasing efficiencies and profitability as well as evaluating its strategic alliances to improve its position in key markets.\n\n## SALES AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nAgriculture sells and distributes products through dealers that sell either Case IH products, New Holland products or both brands. Overall in Agriculture, the CNH dealer network includes more than 2,600 dealer owners and more than 6,200 locations/points of sale. Construction sells and distributes products through approximately 406 full-line dealers and distributors with over 1,518 points of sale. Agriculture and Construction dealers are almost all independently owned and operated. Some Agriculture dealers also sell construction equipment. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, most of  Western  Europe,  Brazil,  Argentina,  India,  China,  Thailand,  Australia,  and  South  Africa  products  are  generally distributed  directly  through  the  independent  dealer  network.  In  the  rest  of  the  world,  products  are  either  sold  to independent distributors who then resell to dealers, or to importers who have their own branches to sell products to retail customers.\n\nAs the equipment rental business becomes a more significant factor in both the agricultural and construction equipment markets,  Agriculture  and  Construction  are  facilitating  sales  of  equipment  to  the  local,  regional  and  national  rental companies through their dealers as well as by encouraging dealers to develop their own rental activities. Agriculture and  Construction  have  launched  several  programs  to  support  their  dealer  service  and  rental  operations,  including training, improved dealer standards, financing, and advertising. As the rental market is a capital-intensive sector and sensitive  to  cyclical  variations,  we  expand  such  activities  gradually,  with  special  attention  to  managing  the  resale  of rental units into the used equipment market by our dealers, who can utilize this opportunity to improve their customer base and generate additional parts and service business.\n\nWe believe that it  is  generally  more  cost-effective  to  distribute  our  agricultural  and  construction  equipment  products through independent dealers, although as of December 31, 2023, we operate a network of owned dealers for Case IH",

We promote a selective dealer development program, in territories with growth potential but underdeveloped representation by our agricultural and construction equipment brands, the program typically  involves  a  transfer  of  ownership  to  a  qualified  operator  through  a  buy-out  or  private  investment  after  a  few years.\n\nPrecision  technology  is  integrated  with  our Agriculture  equipment  as  well  as  offered  as  aftermarket  parts  for  retrofit solutions through our dealer network. The Raven brand is distributed through the CNH dealer network in all the regions and  through  dealer/distributor  networks,  some  of  which  are  affiliated  with  strategic  and  industry  partners.  Raven products  and  services  are  also  sold  to  other  companies.  In  recent  years,  CNH  has  increased  its  investments  in  its technical stack and reduced reliance on third-party suppliers.\n\n## PRICING AND PROMOTION\n\nThe retail price of any piece of equipment is determined by the individual dealer or distributor and generally depends on market conditions, features, options and, potentially, regulatory requirements. Retail transaction prices may differ from the  manufacturer-suggested  list  prices,  as  a  result  of  different  factors  (markets'  demand,  customers'  specific requirements,  local  market  conditions,  general  economic  conditions,  access  to  financing,  etc.).  We  sell  most  of  our products and parts to our dealers and distributors at wholesale prices that reflect a discount from the manufacturersuggested list prices. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in promotional campaigns that may include price incentives or preferential financing terms when a product is sold by a dealer to a final customer.\n\nWe  regularly  advertise  our  products  to  the  community  of  farmers,  builders,  and  agricultural  and  construction contractors, as well as to distributors and dealers in each of our major markets. To reach our target audience, we use a combination of general media, specialized design and trade magazines, the Internet, social media and direct mail. We also  regularly  participate  in  major  international  and  national  trade  shows  and  engage  in  co-operative  advertising programs with distributors and dealers. The promotion strategy for each brand varies according to the target customers for that brand.\n\n## PARTS AND SERVICES\n\nThe quality and timely availability of parts and services are important competitive factors for each of our businesses, as they  are  significant  elements  in  overall  customer  satisfaction  and  important  considerations  in  a  customer's  original equipment purchase decision. We supply parts, many of which are proprietary, to support items in the current product line  as  well  as  for  products  we  have  sold  in  the  past.  We  also  offer  personalized  aftersales  customer  assistance programs that  provide  a  wide  range  of  modular  and  flexible  maintenance  and  repair  contracts,  as  well  as  warranty extension services, to meet a variety of customers' needs and to support the equipment's value over time. Many of our products can have economically productive lives of up to 20 years when properly maintained, and each unit has the potential  to  produce  a  long-term  parts  and  services  revenue  stream  for  us  and  our  dealers.  To  further  support  the productive  life  of  the  equipment,  connected  technology  within  our  machines  have  allowed  us  with  our  cloud-based control rooms and our dealer service shops to obtain results through analytics blended with the professional knowledge of our products experts. We are increasing the number of connected units supported proactively by control rooms that leverage service alarms, operators' insights, predictive repairs and maintenance that enrich a suite of machine and farm data.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we operated and administered 30 parts depots worldwide which support both Agriculture and Construction, either directly, through a joint venture, or through arrangements with warehouse service providers. This network includes 8 parts depots in North America, 10 in EMEA, 3 in South America, and 9 in other regions. These depots supply parts to dealers and distributors, which are responsible for sales to retail customers. Our parts depots and parts delivery systems provide customers with timely access to substantially all the parts required to support our products.\n\n## RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nOur  research,  development  and  engineering  personnel  design,  engineer,  manufacture  and  test  new  products, components, and systems.\n\nIn  a  continuously and rapidly changing competitive environment, our research and development activities are a vital component in our strategic development. Our research and development activities are designed to accelerate time-tomarket while taking advantage of specialization and experience in different markets.\n\nWe own a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to our products and services, and that number is expected to grow as our R&D activities continue. We file patent applications in Europe, the U.S. and in other jurisdictions around the world to protect technology and improvements considered important to the business. Certain trademarks contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services and are an integral part of our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nTechnical  and  operational  synergies  and  rapid  technical  communication  form  the  basis  of  our  research  and development  process.  CNH's  innovation  process  consists  of  a  series  of  clear-cut  steps,  from  the  evaluation  of",

CNH believes innovation is essential to offering customers highly technological, eco-friendly, safe, and ergonomic products with a low Total Cost of Ownership ('TCO').\n\nIn  this  spirit,  research  activities  focus  primarily  on  the  development  of  products  that  can:  reduce  polluting  and  CO2 emissions,  use  biofuels,  adopt  electric  and  hydrogen  traction  systems,  incorporate  advanced  precision  farming functionality and autonomous driving. For this reason, the Company's research and development activities focus mainly on: efficient diesel engines, decarbonization, digitalization, and automation.\n\nEach year the Group makes substantial investments in research and development. Such continuous investment and development activities are critically important to the continuing success of the Group.\n\nIn  2023,  our  expenditure  on  research  and  development (including capitalized development costs and costs charged directly to operations during the year) totaled $1,041 million (*) , or 5% of net revenues from Industrial Activities.\n\nThe following table shows our total research and development expenditures, including capitalized development costs and costs charged directly  to  operations  during  the  year,  by  segment  for  the  years  ended December  31,  2023  and 2022:\n\n| ($ million)                    | 2023 (*)   | 2022 (*)   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Agriculture                    | 937        | 778        |\n| Construction                   | 104        | 88         |\n| Total of Industrial Activities | 1,041      | 866        |\n| Financial Services             | -          | -          |\n| Eliminations                   | -          | -          |\n| Total                          | 1,041      | 866        |\n\nWe own a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to our products and services, and that number is expected to grow as our R&D activities continue.

Certain trademarks contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services and are an integral part of our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n## JOINT VENTURES\n\nAs  part  of  a  strategy  to  enter  and  expand  in  new  markets,  we  are  also  involved  in  several  commercial  and/or manufacturing joint ventures. At December 31, 2023, they included the following:\n\n- \u25aa in Japan, we own 50% of New Holland HFT Japan Inc. ('HFT'), which distributes our products in Japan. HFT imports and sells the full range of New Holland agricultural equipment;\n- \u25aa in Pakistan, we own 43.2% of Al Ghazi Tractors Ltd., which manufactures and distributes New Holland tractors;\n- \u25aa in Turkey, we own 37.5% of T\u00fcrkTrakt\u00f6r ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S., which manufactures and distributes various models of both New Holland and Case IH tractors;\n- \u25aa in Mexico, we own 50% of CNH de Mexico S.A. de C.V., which manufactures New Holland agricultural equipment and distributes our agricultural equipment through one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\n## SUPPLIERS\n\nFor  CNH,  supply  chain  sustainability  means  looking  beyond  corporate  boundaries,  strategically  and  effectively promoting a sense of shared responsibility.\n\nCNH  has  adopted  the  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  that  provides  the  framework  for  responsible  supply  chain management. In addition to compliance with local legislation,  the  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct  calls  for  observance  of human rights, environmental protection, trade restrictions and export controls and business ethics. All suppliers carrying on business with CNH are deemed to agree and accept the contents of the Supplier Code of Conduct, available on CNH's Supplier Portal.\n\nCNH  is  committed  to  fostering  long-term  partnerships  with  its  suppliers  while  integrating  the  respective  business cultures  and  processes,  to  work  jointly  toward  meeting  market  expectations.  The  Company  is  also  committed  to supporting small and local suppliers and minority-owned businesses.\n\n## Supplier profile\n\nCNH manages purchases worth approximately $10 billion, with a total network of 3,192 direct material suppliers; the top 150 suppliers are considered strategic, not only because they generate 62% of the total value of purchases, but also because of the length of the relationships involved, along with the extent of their production capacity and management of spare parts.",

        "page_content": "## Supplier assessment\n\nEnvironmental and social sustainability are part of CNH's suppliers management program. To prevent or minimize any environmental  or  social  impact,  CNH  has  developed  a  process  to  assess  suppliers  on  sustainability  issues.  The assessment process involves three consecutive steps over a 1-year period:\n\n- \u25aa Sustainability self-assessment: during the first step, suppliers are asked to fill out a sustainability self-assessment questionnaire which relates to human rights, environment, compliance and ethics, diversity and health and safety;\n- \u25aa Sustainability  risk  assessment:  the  questionnaires  are  analyzed  and  used  to  perform  a  sustainability  risk assessment  which  allows  identifying  critical  suppliers  whose  compliance  with  sustainability  criteria  needs  to  be addressed. The risk assessment step helps in classifying suppliers into three levels of risk (high, medium and low);\n- \u25aa Sustainability  audits:  sustainability  audits  are  performed  at  suppliers'  plants  by  either  CNH  Supplier  Quality Engineers (SQEs) or independent third-party auditors. Audits are organized in agreement with the suppliers, aim at checking the information submitted in the self-assessment questionnaires and at defining possible improvement plans where necessary.\n\nIn 2023, 100% of the supplier base was invited to access the online sustainability self-assessment questionnaire and 1,495  questionnaires  were  completed. The  average  score  achieved  confirmed  that  social  and  environmental  issues were being properly addressed, especially regarding the adoption of environmental management systems, emergency plans,  and  regulatory  controls.  Results  slightly  improved  comparing  to  the  previous  year's  findings,  confirming  the widespread implementation of sustainability initiatives, with a significant number of suppliers adopting their own social and environmental systems, setting specific targets and drafting periodic reports. Furthermore, in 2023, sustainability audits were conducted on 70 supplier plants .\n\n## Promoting the continuous improvement of environmental aspects\n\nCNH continued to promote numerous initiatives to encourage innovation among suppliers. In particular, the Supplier's Proposal  Program  advocates  a  proactive  approach  to  business  and  involves  acting  on  supplier  suggestions.  With regards to supplier training activities, 165 suppliers were selected to participate in the CDP Supply Chain initiative which offers specific training on the CNH's approach and commitment to fighting climate change, highlighting the importance of a supply chain that is also focused on this issue. CDP questionnaires were centered on the suppliers' strategies to tackle climate change and on their initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nFor further and detailed information on the purchasing process and supplier management, refer to the Sustainability Report which will be issued for 2023.\n\n## FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\nFinancial Services offers a range of financial products and services to dealers and customers in the various regions in which it operates. Retail financing products primarily include retail notes, finance leases and operating leases to end use customers and revolving charge account financing to purchase parts, service, rentals, implements and attachments from CNH dealers. Wholesale financing consists primarily of dealer floorplan financing as well as the management and purchase of trade receivables from CNH subsidiaries. Dealer floorplan financing gives dealers the ability to maintain a representative inventory of products. In addition, Financial Services provides financing to dealers for used equipment and machines taken in trade, equipment utilized in dealer-owned rental yards, parts inventory, working capital and other financing  needs.  As  a  captive  finance  business,  Financial  Services  is  reliant  on  and  supports  the  operations  of Agriculture, Construction, their dealers, and customers.\n\nFinancial Services supports the growth of Industrial Activities by developing and structuring financial products with the objective of supporting equipment and parts sales as well as customer loyalty. Financial Services' strategy is to grow a core financing business to support the sale of our equipment and parts while at the same time maintaining its portfolio credit  quality,  service  levels,  operational  effectiveness  and  customer  satisfaction.  Financial  Services  also  offers products to finance third party equipment and machines sold through our dealer network or within our core businesses. Financed third party equipment include used equipment taken in trade by our dealers or equipment used in conjunction with or attached to our products.\n\nIn  North  America,  retail  customer  and  dealer  financing  activities,  which  support  the  sales  of  Agriculture  and Construction, are managed through our wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries.\n\nIn  Europe,  Middle  East  and  Africa,  CNH  Industrial  Capital  Europe  S.a.S.,  which  is  24.95%  owned  by  CNH Industrial  N.V.  and  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method,  provides  retail  financing  to  customers  of Agriculture  and Construction. Additionally,  there  are  vendor  programs  with  banking  partners  that  provide  customer  financing  to  our industrial segments in certain countries.\n\nIn  Europe,  companies  of  Iveco  Group's  Financial  Services  segment  manage  and  service  CNH  dealer  financing receivables  that  are  funded  through  a  dedicated  securitization.  CNH  Industrial  Capital  Solutions  S.p.A.  retains  the securitization program's junior notes, and therefore retains substantially all the risks and the benefits of the underlying wholesale receivables.",

        "page_content": "For  South America,  retail  customer  and  dealer  financing  activities  are  managed  through  our  wholly-owned  financial services subsidiary which supports the sales of Agriculture and Construction. For retail customer financing in Brazil, Banco CNH Industrial Capital S.A. also serves as a lender for funding provided by BNDES, a federally-owned financial institution linked to the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade. In Argentina, vendor programs with banking partners are also utilized. CNH Financial Services serves as a lender for Iveco Group dealers and end customers.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, CNH Financial Services supports the sales of Agriculture and Construction by providing retail customer and dealer financing activities in Australia, New Zealand and India, managed through wholly-owned financial services companies.  In  China, Agriculture  dealer  financing  activities  are  provided  by  and  managed  through  a  wholly-owned financial services company. CNH Financial Services serves as a lender for Iveco Group and services the sale of Iveco Group in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n## Customer Financing\n\nFinancial Services has certain retail underwriting and portfolio management policies and procedures that are specific to Agriculture  or  Construction.  This  distinction  allows  Financial  Services  to  reduce  risk  by  deploying  industry-specific expertise  in  each  of  these  businesses.  We  provide  retail  financial  products  primarily  through  our  dealers,  who  are trained in the use of the various financial products. Dedicated credit analysis teams perform retail credit underwriting. The terms  for  financing  equipment  retail  sales  typically  provide  for  retention  of  a  security  interest  in  the  equipment financed.\n\nFinancial Services' guidelines for minimum down payments for equipment generally range from 5% to 30% of the actual sales  price,  depending  on  equipment  types,  repayment  terms,  and  customer  credit  quality.  Finance  charges  are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain equipment sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in connection with other sales promotions. For periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases, Financial Services generally receives compensation from the applicable Industrial Activities segment based on Financial Services' estimated costs and a targeted return on equity. The cost is recognized as a reduction in net revenues for the applicable Industrial Activities segment.\n\n## Dealer Financing\n\nFinancial Services provides dealer floorplan financing, and to a lesser extent, the financing of dealer operations. Under the standard terms of the wholesale receivable agreements, these receivables typically have a fixed period of 'interestfree'  financing  to  dealers.  During  the  'interest-free'  period,  the  applicable  Industrial Activities  segment  compensates Financial Services based on Financial Services' estimated costs and a targeted return on equity. The cost is recognized as a reduction in net revenues for the applicable Industrial Activities segment. After the expiration of any 'interest-free' period, interest is charged to dealers on outstanding balances until Financial Services receives payment in full.\n\nA wholesale underwriting group reviews dealer financial information and payment performance to establish credit lines for  each dealer. In setting these credit lines, Financial Services seeks to meet the reasonable requirements of each dealer while managing its own exposure to any one dealer. All risk is underwritten and supported by Financial Services. The credit lines are secured by the equipment financed. Dealer credit agreements generally include a requirement to repay individual receivables at the time of the retail sale of the related unit. Financial Services leverages employees, third -party  contractors,  and  digital  technologies  like  'geo-fencing'  to  conduct  periodic  stock  audits  at  individual dealerships to confirm that the financed equipment is maintained in inventory. These audits are unannounced, and their frequency varies by dealer and depends on the dealer's financial strength, payment history, and prior performance.\n\n## Factoring\n\nFinancial Services also provides intragroup factoring of trade and other receivables. This activity involves the purchase, without recourse, of receivables of CNH subsidiaries, originating from the Industrial Activities segments, and due from third or related parties.\n\n## Sources of Funding\n\nThe long-term profitability  of  Financial  Services'  activities  largely  depends  on  the  cyclical  nature  of  the  industries  in which  we  operate,  interest  rate  volatility,  and  the  ability  to  access  funding  on  competitive  terms.  Financial  Services funds its operations and lending activity through a combination of term receivable securitizations, committed secured and  unsecured  facilities,  uncommitted  lines  of  credit,  unsecured  bonds,  unsecured  commercial  paper,  affiliated financing,  and  retained  earnings.  Financial  Services'  current  funding  strategy  is  to  maintain  sufficient  liquidity  and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments and funding options.\n\nFinancial  Services  has  periodically  accessed  the  asset-backed  securities  ('ABS')  markets  in  the  United  States, Canada, and Australia, as part of its retail note and wholesale financing programs when those markets offer funding opportunities  on  competitive  terms.  Financial  Services  has  also  accessed  the  unsecured  bond  market  in  the  United States,  Canada,  Brazil, Argentina  and Australia  and  commercial  paper  markets  in  the  United  States  to  diversify  its funding  sources.  Financial  Services'  ability  to  access  these  markets  will  depend,  in  part,  upon  general  economic",

These  factors  can  be  negatively affected by cyclical swings in the industries in which we operate.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  financial  services  industry  is  highly  competitive.  Financial  Services  competes  primarily  with  banks,  equipment finance and leasing companies and other financial institutions. Typically, this competition is based upon the financial products and services offered, customer service, financial terms, and interest rates charged. Financial Services' ability to compete successfully depends upon, among other things, the availability and competitiveness of funding resources, the development of competitive financial products and services, and licensing or other governmental regulations.\n\n## HUMAN RESOURCES\n\n## Employees\n\nThe ability to attract, retain, and further develop qualified employees is crucial to the success of CNH's businesses and its ability to create value over the long-term. CNH's business is, by its nature, labor intensive and this is reflected in the high number of hourly employees.\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of the number of employees by segment at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n| (number)                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Agriculture                    | 33,490 | 33,115 |\n| Construction                   | 5,856  | 6,052  |\n| Other Activities               | 46     | 80     |\n| Total of Industrial Activities | 39,392 | 39,247 |\n| Financial Services             | 828    | 823    |\n| Total                          | 40,220 | 40,070 |\n\nThe following table show the breakdown of the number of employees by continent at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n| (number)      | 2023 (*)   | 2022 (*)   |\n|---------------|------------|------------|\n| Europe        | 15,462     | 15,052     |\n| North America | 12,154     | 11,769     |\n| South America | 7,654      | 8,420      |\n| Rest of World | 4,950      | 4,829      |\n| Total         | 40,220     | 40,070     |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, CNH had 40,220 employees, an increase of 150 employees from the 40,070 employees at year-end 2022. The change was mainly attributable to an increase of approximately 280 employees due to changes in scope of operations and the delta between new hires (approximately 6,400 employees) and departures (approximately 6,500 employees) during the year.\n\nFocusing on changes in scope of operations, 2023 has been characterized by the acquisition of Bennamann (U.K.based expert in  solutions  to  capture,  repurpose  and  store  fugitive  methane  emissions  for  energy  use),  Hemisphere (global  satellite  navigation  technology  leader)  and Augmenta  (a  technology  company  that  gives  machines  selective spraying capabilities which precisely directs and regulates spray volume, furthering our Sense and Act capabilities).\n\nBusiness activities in Russia have been divested and the sale of the undercarriage business unit, following the exercise of the call option by former owners, has been completed.\n\nExcluding the changes in the scope of operations, the increase compared to year-end 2022 is mainly attributable to investments  in  Precision  Technology  and  Research  &  Development  personnel,  to  strengthen  the  pool  of  skills  and competencies in view of technology transitions, particularly electrification, autonomous driving, alternative propulsion solutions, digitalization, and cloud web-based software technologies. A new plant has been inaugurated in Cesena, a production site dedicated to mini-excavators and mini track loaders, including electric models.\n\nFor 2024, the Group expects an overall reduction of the total number of employees, in connection with the targeted restructuring action announced during 2023.\n\nAs stated in CNH's Code of Conduct, occupational health and safety is an employee's fundamental right and a key part of Company's sustainability model and included in the Materiality Matrix as one of the most material topics for CNH and its  stakeholders.  Safety  management  engages  all  employees  in  creating  a  culture  of  accident  prevention  and  risk awareness, sharing common occupational health and safety ethical principles to achieve improvement targets. One of the initiatives developed by CNH is an effective health and safety management system that conforms to ISO 45001 international  standard.  As  a  demonstration  of  the  Company's  commitment  in  this  area,  31  plants  are  ISO  45001 certified.  In  2023,  approximately  $68.2  million  was  spent  on  improving  health  and  safety  protection.  To  achieve  the challenging targets that the Company has set, all employees are involved in informational activities and in classroom",

In  2023,  CNH  delivered  330,938  hours  of occupational health and safety training (of which 205,330 on the job). Approximately 27,000 employees were engaged in training on the job activities on occupational health and safety, 84.7% of whom were hourly. Owing to the Company's many initiatives, the overall employee injury frequency rate in 2023 was 0.977 injuries per 1,000,000 hours worked, a 31.5%  decrease  compared  to  the  previous  year.  The  target  set  for  2024  is  to  reduce  by  51%  the  employee  injury frequency rate compared to 2018 data.\n\nThe Group realizes that the nature of today's socio-economic context calls for leaders with the ability to evolve and develop. A solid people management process is the key to success, as it includes employees in the formulation of the Group's  business  goals,  takes  advantage  of  employee  talent  and  fuels  workforce  motivation.  CNH  is  committed  to supporting  its  employees  with  development  opportunities  and  recognizing  and  rewarding  their  achievements  and contribution to business results. In 2023, CNH delivered a total of 558,735 training hours to 34,368 individuals, of whom 78% were men and 22% were women.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nCNH's Board of Directors is committed to diversity and inclusion ('D&I') and adopted a Policy on Diversity and Inclusion in 2023.  This policy applies to all CNH employees globally and provides that CNH rejects all forms of discrimination that  is  based  on  race,  ethnicity,  gender,  sexual  orientation,  personal  or  social  status,  health,  physical  condition, disability, age, nationality, religious or personal beliefs, political opinion or against any other protected group.\n\nCNH's Global Leadership Team (\"GLT\") is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone benefits from equal opportunities based on their abilities and skills. Offering career and advancement opportunities free from  discrimination  while  encouraging  and  respecting  diversity  are  among  the  commitments  emphasized  in  CNH's Human Capital Management Guidelines and Human Rights Policy, available on the Company's website and Intranet portal.\n\nFurther,  the  Global  Leadership  demonstrated its  commitment to diversity and inclusion by preparing and adopting a statement,  which  confirms  the  Company's  commitment  to  rejecting  any  form  of  discrimination  and  creating  an environment where everyone benefits from equal opportunities based on their abilities and skills.\n\nCNH's  commitment  to  people  engagement  is  reflected  in  the  strategic  sustainability  targets  it  incorporated  into  the Strategic Business Plan in 2023: to have women holding 20% of leadership roles by year-end 2024, ensure that 100% of employees are trained in unconscious bias and encouraged to 'speak up' by the same year, institutionalize gender equality practices in career development and compensation, continuously increase the representation of women in the workforce, and expand the participation and scope of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). In 2023, individual targets related  to  the  material  topics  described  above  were  included  in  the  Performance  Management  Process  for  several managers responsible for the projects indicated in the Sustainability Plan, including the people engagement targets. In addition, CNH's Board annually reviews the company's D&I plans. As of December 31, 2023, 50% of CNH's executive directors are women, 43% of its non-executive directors are women, and 9% of its Global Leadership Team are women.\n\n## Collective bargaining\n\nApproximately  700  hourly  production  employees  in  the  United  States  were  covered  by  a  collective  bargaining agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America with an expiration date of May 2, 2026. Additionally, approximately 800 U.S. production employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with International Association of Machinists with an expiration date of April 28, 2024. In Canada, a small number of employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement between with the United Steelworkers Local Union No. 5917, that expires on April 15, 2026. In Europe, most employees are covered by collective labor agreements ('CLAs') stipulated either by a CNH subsidiary or by the employer association for the specific industry to which the CNH subsidiary  belongs.  Outside  North America  and  Europe,  CNH  enters  into  employment  contracts  and  agreements  in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary.\n\nIn 2024, our collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists in the United States will expire, which will require negotiation of new agreements. Refer to \"Risk Factors\" section for a discussion of the risks associated with our employment relationships.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES\n\nCNH makes its product manufacturing processes more efficient through the application of streamlined systems and technologies,  improvements  to  existing  materials  and  processes,  and  through  the  development  of  new  materials, systems, processes and techniques.\n\nThe highest responsibility for initiatives focusing on environmental protection at CNH lies with the Global Leadership Team (GLT).\n\nCNH's Supply Chain function manages cross-segment manufacturing processes and supports segment organizations in ensuring that objectives are met and in line with business targets.\n\nThe Supply Chain function also:\n\n- \u25aa Drives the development, standardization, implementation and improvement if relevant manufacturing processes;",

Protection, information sharing, and people engagement to ensure effective long-term management.\n\nCNH  manages  its  commitment  to  the  environment  with  short,  medium,  and  long-term  target  plans  to  responsibly manage the environmental  aspects  of  manufacturing,  particularly  energy,  natural  resources,  hazardous  substances, polluting emissions, and waste. These aspects are included in CNH's environmental management system and require compliance  with  guidelines,  procedures,  and  operating  instructions,  and  regular  internal  audits  and  reviews  by management. This approach enables the effective management of environmental aspects and the evaluation of results.\n\nSignificant  environmental  aspects  are  monitored,  measured,  and  quantified  to  set  improvement  targets  at  both corporate  and  plant  levels.  As  further  evidence  of  the  Company's  commitment  to  protecting  the  environment,  the indicators for 2023 improved as in previous years, and the improvement targets set were met in line with expectations.\n\nIn  2023,  CNH's  overall  expenditure  on  environmental  protection  was  $30.6  million,  broken  down  as  follows: approximately  $20.9  million  on  waste  disposal  and  emissions  treatment,  and  almost  $9.7  million  on  prevention  and environmental management. A total of $6.1 million was invested in initiatives to reduce the Company's environmental impact, while improvement projects and measures generated $0.9 million in cost savings.\n\n## Process Certification\n\nIn 2023, CNH continued to pursue and maintain the certification of its plants' environmental management systems as per the ISO 14001 international standard. To date, every CNH manufacturing plant currently in operation and falling with the scope of application of the Sustainability Report, is ISO 14001 certified which requires the adoption and regular verification of emergency plans and procedures, and related staff training.\n\nThe  environmental  certification  maintenance  process  entails  a  series  of  external  third-party  audits,  carried  out  by accredited bodies, with annual monitoring and certification renewal every 3 years. Additionally, plants are required to perform an internal audit every year to verify the performance of their environmental management system.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nConsolidated  monitoring  and  reporting  systems  are  used  to  track  environmental  performance,  measure  the effectiveness of actions taken to achieve targets, and plan new improvement initiatives, through the management of appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n## \u25aa Safeguarding Air Quality\n\nReducing  air  emission  is  one  the  CNH's  major  goals,  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  materiality  analysis.  The application of advanced technologies in the manufacturing process is critical to meet the improvement targets set by CNH.  The  main  air  emissions  are  monitored  and  results  systematically  recorded  through  specific  programs  and systems to verify compliance with existing regulations.\n\n## \u25aa Water management\n\nCNH draws water mainly for industrial use, specifically for painting, cooling, washing, and machining, and strives to increase water efficiency within all its industrial processes. Furthermore, CNH's plants operate locally to reduce water requirements and wastewater volumes without compromising quality standards. CNH believes that increasing the use of recycled water can reduce withdrawals from external sources, improving water independence and the availability of water for local communities.\n\nThe impact on water resources is an integral part of each plant's environmental assessment, as required by the ISO 14001 standard; for this reason, all 30 ISO 4001-certifies plants have a water management plan in place.\n\n## \u25aa Waste management\n\nCNH aims to optimize manufacturing processes through improvements to waste management by reducing its waste generation and increasing recovery, both key aspects of its Environmental Policy.\n\nThe manufacturing process at Company plants normally involves numerous raw materials, such as metal, plastic, chemical products, and components, each with its own packaging. Most manufacturing activities, such as assembly, machining, painting. Welding, testing, logistics, etc., can also generate actual and potential waste-related impacts.",

All statements other than  statements  of  historical  fact  included  in  this  Annual  Report  are  forward-looking  statements.  Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. You can identify forward-looking statements as they do not relate to  historical  or  current  facts  and  by  words  such  as  'believe,'  'expect,'  'estimate,'  'anticipate,'  'will,'  'should,'  'plan,' 'forecast,' 'target,' 'guide,' 'project,' 'intend,' 'could,' and similar words or expressions.\n\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or  cautionary  statements, and other important information about forward-looking statements are disclosed under the section 'Risk Factors,' and 'Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,' in this Annual Report.\n\nThe  following  risks  should  be  considered  in  conjunction  with  the  other  risks  described  in  the  Disclaimer,  Risk Management  and  Control  System  section  and  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  following  is  a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material to our business. These risks may affect our operating results and, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from past and projected future results. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of our businesses. Although risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make from time to time in materials filed with the SEC.\n\n## STRATEGIC RISKS\n\n## Global economic conditions impact our businesses\n\nOur  results  of  operations  and  financial  position  are  and  will  continue  to  be  influenced  by  macroeconomic  factors  including changes in gross domestic product, the level of consumer and business confidence, changes in interest rates, the availability  of  credit,  inflation  and  deflation,  energy  prices,  and  the  cost  of  commodities  or  other  raw  materials  which exist in the countries and regions in which we operate. Such macroeconomic factors vary from time to time and their  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  position  cannot  be  specifically  and  singularly  assessed  and/or isolated.\n\nEconomic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In a weaker economic environment, dealers and customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Our suppliers may also be impacted by economic pressures, which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill  their  obligations  to  us  or  the  price  or  availability  of  supplies  we  require.  These  factors  could  result  in  product delays, increased accounts receivable, defaults and inventory challenges. The persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions amongst the individual countries of the European Union, and their implications for the Euro, as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, have led to further pressure on economic growth and may lead to new periods of economic volatility and recession in the European Union. Similarly, in Brazil and Argentina,  macroeconomic  conditions  remain  volatile.  These  adverse  economic  events  have  and  may  continue  to adversely affect the Company's operations .\n\n## We are exposed to political, economic, trade and other risks beyond our control as a result of operating a global business\n\nWe manufacture and sell products and offer services in several continents and numerous countries around the world including  those  experiencing  varying  degrees  of  political  and  economic  instability.  Given  the  global  nature  of  our activities, we are exposed to risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\n- \u25aa changes in laws, regulations and policies that affect, among other things:\n- \u00b7 import and export duties and quotas;\n- \u00b7 currency restrictions;\n- \u00b7 the design, manufacture and sale of our products;\n- \u00b7 interest rates and the availability of credit to our dealers and customers;\n- \u00b7 where,  to  whom,  and  what  type  of  products  may  be  sold,  including  new  or  additional  trade  or  economic sanctions  imposed  by  the  United  States,  European  Union,  the  United  Kingdom  or  other  governmental authorities and supranational organizations (e.g., the United Nations); and\n- \u00b7 taxes;",

More recently, growing populist and nationalist political movements in several major developed countries, changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies  and  other  unanticipated  changes to the previous geopolitical order may have negative effects on the global economy.\n\nFurther, the continuing war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and heightened tensions in the Red Sea has given rise to regional instability which could impact our supply chain and operations.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that we will be able to quickly and completely adapt our business model to changes that could  result  from  the  foregoing,  and  any  such  changes  may  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  results  of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Reduced demand for equipment would reduce our sales and profitability\n\nThe agricultural equipment market is influenced by a number of factors such as:\n\n- \u25aa the general economic conditions and outlook, such as market volatility and rising interest rates;\n- \u25aa the price of agricultural commodities and the ability to competitively export agricultural commodities;\n- \u25aa the cost of farm inputs including the value of land, fertilizers, fuel, labor and other inputs;\n- \u25aa the profitability of agricultural enterprises, farmers' income and their capitalization;\n- \u25aa the demand for food products;\n- \u25aa the availability of stocks from previous harvests; and\n- \u25aa agricultural  policies,  including  aid  and  subsidies  to  agricultural  enterprises  provided  by  governments  and/or supranational organizations, policies impacting commodity prices or limiting the export or import of commodities, and alternative fuel mandates.\n\nIn  addition,  droughts,  floods  and  other  unfavorable  climatic  conditions,  especially  during  the  spring,  a  particularly important period for generating sales orders, could have a negative impact on decisions to buy agricultural equipment and, consequently, on our revenues.\n\nThe construction equipment market is influenced by factors such as:\n\n- \u25aa public infrastructure spending;\n- \u25aa new residential and non-residential construction; and\n- \u25aa capital spending in oil and gas and, to a lesser extent, in mining.\n\nThe above factors can significantly influence the demand for agricultural and construction equipment and consequently, our financial results. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability will suffer, including lower fixed costs absorption associated with lower production levels at our plants. Our business may be negatively impacted if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust on a timely basis our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations.\n\n## Competitive  activity,  or  failure  by  us  to  respond  to  actions  by  our  competitors,  could  adversely  affect  our results of operations\n\nWe operate in highly competitive global and regional markets. Depending on the particular country and product, we compete  with  other  international,  regional  and  local  manufacturers  and  distributors  of  agricultural  and  construction equipment.  Certain  of  our  global  competitors  have  substantial  resources  and  may  be  able  to  provide  products  and services at little or no profit, or even at a loss, to compete with certain of our product and service offerings. We compete primarily on the basis of product performance, innovation, quality, distribution, customer service, and price.

        "page_content": "failure  to  price  our  products  competitively  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial position. Additionally,  there  has  been  a  trend  toward  consolidation  in  the  construction  equipment  industries  that  has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in those industries. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive  in  terms  of  product  quality,  innovation,  pricing,  fuel  economy,  reliability,  safety,  customer  service  and financial services offered. Competition, particularly on pricing, has increased significantly in the markets in which we compete.  Should  we  be  unable  to  adapt  effectively  to  market  conditions,  this  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results\n\nMost countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and  influence  economic  activities,  generally  by  adjusting  interest  rates.  Some  governments  have  implemented measures designed to slow inflationary pressure in their countries (e.g. higher interest rates, reduced financial assets purchases). Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on the overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect demand for our products and our customers' ability to repay obligations to us. Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take further actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could  negatively  affect  the  customers  and  markets  we  serve  or  our  suppliers,  which  could  adversely  impact  our business, results of operations and financial condition. Government initiatives that are intended to stimulate demand for products  sold  by  us,  such  as  changes  in  tax  treatment  or  purchase  incentives  for  new  equipment,  can  significantly influence  the  timing  and  level  of  our  revenues.  The  terms,  size  and  duration  of  such  government  actions  are unpredictable and outside of our control. Any adverse change in government policy relating to those initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our  future  performance  depends  on  our  ability  to  innovate  and  on  market  acceptance  of  new  or  existing products\n\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain or increase our market share in existing markets and to expand into new markets through the development of innovative, high-quality products that provide adequate profitability. Further, customer  preferences  in  certain  markets  are  changing  as  a  result  of  ongoing  social  and  regulatory  focus  on sustainability. We have a strategic plan covering investments in innovation designed to further develop existing, and create new, product and service offerings responsive to customer needs, including developing and delivering connected and  precision  technology  solutions,  automation,  electrification  and  autonomy.  Achievement  of  these  objectives  is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to design and produce products that meet our customers' quality, performance and price expectations, our ability to develop precision technology solutions that improve the profitability and sustainability of customers through their production systems, our ability to develop effective sales, dealer training and marketing programs, and the ability of our dealers to support and service  connected  and  precision  technology  solutions  and  emerging  power  solutions.  Failure  to  develop  and  offer innovative products that compare favorably to those of our principal competitors in terms of price, quality, functionality, features,  mobility  and  connected  services,  equipment  electrification,  fuel  cell  technology  and  autonomy,  or  delays  in bringing strategic new products to market, or the inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or supply products that meet regulatory requirements, including engine emissions requirements, could result in reduced revenue and  market  share,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial condition.\n\n## If we are unable to deliver precision technology solutions to our customers, it could materially adversely affect our performance\n\nOur  precision  technology  solutions  include  both  hardware  and  software  components  that  relate  to  guidance, connectivity,  automation  and  autonomy.  We  must  be  able  to  successfully  acquire  and  develop  and  introduce  new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and result in sustainable farming techniques in order to remain competitive.  We  expect  to  make  significant  investments  in  research  and  development  expenses,  collaborative arrangements and other sources of technology to drive these outcomes. Such investments may not produce attractive solutions  for  our  customers.  We  also  may  have  to  depend  on  third  parties  to  supply  certain  hardware  or  software components or data services in our precision technology products. Our dealers ability to support such solutions also may impact our customers, acceptance and demand of such products.  Further, we utilize automation and machine learning and intelligence in some of our products. While the use of these emerging technologies can present significant benefits, it also creates risks and challenges. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias into  decision-making  algorithms,  security  problems,  and  the  protection  of  privacy  could  impair  the  adoption  and acceptance  of  autonomous  machine  solutions.  If  we  are  not  able  to  deliver  precision  technology  solutions  with differentiated  features  and  functionality,  or  these  solutions  are  not  effective,  customers  may  not  adopt  technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation and business.",

        "page_content": "## We  may  face  challenges  to  our  intellectual  property  rights  which  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation, business and competitive position\n\nWe own important intellectual  property,  including  patents,  trademarks,  copyrights  and  trade  secrets.  Our  intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in the markets that we serve. Our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the intellectual property  that  we  own  or  license.  Despite  our  controls  and  safeguards,  our  technology  may  be  misappropriated  by employees,  competitors  or  third  parties.  The  pursuit  of  remedies  for  any  misappropriation  of  intellectual  property  is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be insufficient. Further, in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property is higher notwithstanding the efforts we undertake to protect it. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect or enforce our rights sufficiently, could adversely affect our business, competitive position and results of operations.\n\n## We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our business and cost reduction initiatives\n\nAs part of our strategic plan, we are actively engaged in a number of initiatives to strengthen our business and increase our productivity, market positioning, efficiency and cash flow, all of which we expect will have a positive long-term effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These initiatives include our enhanced focus on precision technology solutions and alternative propulsion, as well as other initiatives aimed at improving our product portfolio, customer focus and manufacturing and business processes. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from these initiatives or others to the extent anticipated, or that the estimated efficiency or cash flow improvements will be realized to  the  extent  anticipated  or  at  all.  If  these  initiatives  are  not  successful,  they  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our operations. We have announced targeted restructuring actions to optimize our cost structure and improve the efficiency of our operations. In order to complete these actions, we will incur charges. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our business initiatives and cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## We may not be able to realize anticipated benefits from any acquisitions and, further, challenges associated with strategic alliances may have an adverse impact on our results of operations\n\nWe have engaged in the past, and may engage in the future, in investments and mergers and acquisitions or enter into, expand or exit from strategic alliances and joint ventures. These involve risks that could prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of the transactions or the achievement of strategic objectives or could divert management's time and attention. Such risks, many of which are outside our control, include:\n\n- \u25aa technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions not occurring as expected;\n- \u25aa unexpected liabilities;\n- \u25aa incompatibility of operating, information or other systems;\n- \u25aa inability to retain key employees;\n- \u25aa significant costs associated with terminating or modifying alliances; and\n- \u25aa problems in retaining customers and integrating operations, services, personnel, and customer bases.\n\nIf  issues  were  to  arise  with  respect  to  an  acquisition  or  the  parties  to  one  or  more  of  our  joint  venture  or  strategic alliances  or  other  relationships  for  managerial,  financial,  or  other  reasons,  or  if  such  strategic  alliances  or  other relationships  were  terminated,  our  product  lines,  businesses,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  could  be adversely affected.\n\n## Our business may be affected by climate change, unfavorable weather conditions or other calamities\n\nPoor, severe or unusual weather conditions caused by climate change or other factors, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of our agricultural equipment customers. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting crops or may cause growing crops to die, resulting in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding  can  also  prevent  planting  or  harvesting  from  occurring  at  optimal  times  and  may  cause  crop  loss  through increased disease or mold growth. Temperature affects the rate of growth, crop maturity, crop quality and yield.\n\nTemperatures outside normal ranges can cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence. Natural  disasters  such  as  floods,  hurricanes,  storms,  droughts,  diseases  and  pests  can  have  a  negative  impact  on agricultural production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for our agricultural equipment in any given period.\n\nIn  addition,  natural  disasters,  pandemic  illness,  acts  of  terrorism  or  violence,  acts  of  war,  equipment  failures,  power outages, disruptions to our information technology systems and networks or other unexpected events could result in physical  damage  to,  and  complete  or  partial  closure  of,  one  or  more  of  our  manufacturing  facilities  or  distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of parts or component products and disruption and delay in the transport  of  our  products  to  dealers  and  customers.  If  such  events  occur,  our  financial  results  might  be  negatively",

Our existing insurance and risk management arrangements may not protect against all costs that may arise from such events.\n\nFurthermore, the potentially long-term physical impacts of climate change on our facilities, suppliers and customers and therefore  on  our  operations  are  highly  uncertain  and  will  be  driven  by  the  circumstances  developing  in  various geographical  regions.  These  may  include  long-term  changes  in  temperature  and  water  availability.  These  potential physical  effects  may  adversely  impact  the  demand  for  our  products  and  the  cost,  production,  sales  and  financial performance of our operations.\n\nRegulators in Europe and the U.S. have also focused efforts on requiring and promoting enhanced disclosure related to sustainability.  We may face liabilities in connection with our efforts to comply with these disclosure requirements as well as expectations by our stakeholders of enhanced disclosures regarding our climate change initiatives.\n\n## Changes in demand for food and alternative energy sources could impact our revenues\n\nChanging worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world's growing food and alternative energy demands, driven by a growing world population and government policies, including those related to climate change, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which affect sales of agricultural equipment. While higher commodity prices will  benefit our crop producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers.  Lower  commodity  prices  directly  affect  farm  income,  which  could  negatively  affect  sales  of  agricultural equipment. Moreover, changing alternative energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops  they  grow,  with  corresponding  changes  in  equipment  demands.  Finally,  changes  in  governmental  policies regulating  bio-fuel  utilization  could  affect  demand  for  our  equipment  and  result  in  higher  research  and  development costs related to equipment fuel standards.\n\n## International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position\n\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as sanctions, import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether  adopted  by  non-governmental  bodies,  individual  governments  or  addressed  by  regional  trade  blocks,  may affect the demand for our products, technology and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products to certain customers or in certain countries. Trade restrictions, negotiation of new trade  agreements,  non-tariff  trade  barriers,  local  content  requirements,  and  imposition  of  new  or  retaliatory  tariffs against  certain  countries  or  covering  certain  products,  including  developments  in  U.S.-China  trade  relations,  export control and sanctions against Russia, have limited, and could continue to limit, our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets. These trade restrictions, and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may affect our competitive position.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n## We depend on suppliers for raw materials, parts and components\n\nWe rely upon many suppliers for raw materials, parts and components that we require to manufacture our products. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain access to raw materials, parts and components, and in some cases, this access may be affected by factors outside of our control and the control of our suppliers. Certain components and parts used in our products are available from a single supplier and cannot be quickly sourced from other suppliers. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and wholegoods can adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand. For example, recent attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea have lead shipping companies to avoid this region, which could result in increased logistics costs. While we diligently monitor our supply chain risk and seek to respond promptly to address supply chain and logistics bottlenecks, there can be  no  assurance  that  our  mitigation  plans  will  be  effective  to  prevent  disruptions  that  may  arise  from  shortages  of materials that we use in the production of our products. Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business and outlook.\n\nWe use a variety of raw materials in our businesses, including steel, aluminum, lead, resin and copper, and precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. The availability and price of these raw materials fluctuate, particularly during times of economic volatility or regulatory and geopolitical instability or in response to changes in tariffs, and while we seek to manage this exposure, we may not be successful in mitigating these risks. Further, increases in the prices for raw materials have resulted in and could continue to result in significant increases to our costs of production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly if we are unable to offset the increased costs through an increase in product pricing.\n\n## Our existing operations and expansion plans in emerging markets could entail significant risks\n\nOur ability to grow our businesses depends to an increasing degree on our ability to increase market share and operate profitably worldwide and, in particular, in emerging market countries, such as Brazil, India, China, Argentina and Turkey. In addition, we could increase our use of suppliers located in such countries. Our implementation of these strategies will involve a significant investment of capital and other resources and exposes us to multiple and potentially conflicting",

For example, we may encounter difficulties in obtaining necessary governmental approvals in a timely manner. In addition, we may experience delays and incur significant costs in constructing facilities, establishing supply channels, and commencing manufacturing operations. Further, customers in these markets may not readily accept our products  as  compared  with  products  manufactured  and  commercialized  by  our  competitors.  The  emerging  market countries may also be subject to a greater degree of economic and political volatility that could adversely affect our financial  position,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.  Many  emerging market economies have experienced slower growth, volatility, and other economic challenges in recent periods and may be subject to a further slowdown in gross domestic product expansion and/or be impacted by domestic political or currency volatility, potential hyperinflationary conditions, and/or increase of public debt.\n\n## Dealer equipment sourcing and inventory management decisions could adversely affect our sales\n\nWe  sell  our  products  primarily  through  independent  dealers  and  are  subject  to  risks  relating  to  their  inventory management decisions and operating and sourcing practices. Our dealers carry inventories of finished products and parts  as  part  of  ongoing  operations  and  adjust  those  inventories  based  on  their  assessment  of  future  sales opportunities and market conditions, including the level of used equipment inventory. If our dealers' inventory levels are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the  end-user  demand  for  our  products  and  negatively  impact  our  results.  Similarly,  our  sales  could  be  negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers do not maintain inventory sufficient to meet customer demand. Further, dealers who carry other products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and  sales  efforts  on  goods  provided  by  other  suppliers  due  to  industry  demand  or  profitability.  Such  inventory adjustments and sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our  results  of  operations  may  be  adversely  impacted  by  various  types  of  claims,  lawsuits,  and  other contingent obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in litigation and investigations on a wide range of topics, including securities  laws  in  the  U.S.,  dealer  and  supplier  litigation,  intellectual  property  rights  disputes,  product  warranty  and defective product claims, product performance, asbestos, personal injury, regulatory and contract issues, indirect tax issues, and environmental claims. The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. We are subject to regulation and oversight by securities regulatory authorities in the Netherlands and the United States. In the United States, we recently adopted on a voluntary basis the financial reporting standards and practices applicable to  U.S.  domestic  issuers,  which  include  certain  incremental  filing  and  reporting  requirements.  These  additional obligations may increase the cost for ensuring compliance with the applicable reporting requirements and may subject us to an enhanced risk of regulatory investigations and private litigation. The ultimate outcome of these legal matters pending  against  us  is  uncertain,  and  although  such  legal  matters  are  not  expected  individually  to  have  a  material adverse  effect  on  our  financial  position  or  profitability,  such  legal  matters  could,  in  the  aggregate,  in  the  event  of unfavorable  resolutions  thereof,  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition. Furthermore, we could in the future be subject to judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  in  any  particular  period.  In  addition,  while  we  maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain risks, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against claims under such policies.\n\nWe  establish  reserves  based  on  our  assessment  of  contingencies,  including  contingencies  related  to  legal  claims asserted against us. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments that exceed our reserves, which could have a material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and/or  financial  position.  For  further  information  see  Note  27 'Commitments and contingencies' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2023.\n\n## A cybersecurity breach could interfere with our operations, compromise confidential information, negatively impact our corporate reputation and expose us to liability\n\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of our business activities. These systems include supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments from dealers or other purchasers of our products and from customers of our financial services business,  and  connectivity  services  with  and  among  equipment.  We  use  information  technology  systems  to  record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and the proprietary information of our customers, suppliers and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of our dealers, customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. Operating these information technology systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy.

        "page_content": "and more sophisticated computer crime, including through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, pose a significant risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products.\n\nWhile we actively manage information technology security risks within our control through security measures, business continuity plans and employee training around phishing and other cyber risks, our information technology networks and infrastructure  have  been  and  may  be  vulnerable  to  intrusion,  attacks  or  disruptions  or  shutdowns  due  to  attacks  by cyber criminals, employee, supplier or dealer error or malfeasance or supply chain compromise.\n\nA failure or breach in security, whether of our systems and networks or those of third parties on which we rely, could expose us and our customers, dealers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, loss of financial resources, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes  and  operations  disruptions,  which  in  turn  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  competitive  position, businesses and results of operations. Security breaches could also result in litigation, regulatory action, unauthorized release  of  confidential  or  otherwise  protected  information  and  corruption  of  data,  as  well  as  remediation  costs  and higher operational and other costs of implementing further data protection measures. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems and data. The amount  or  scope  of  insurance  coverage  we  maintain  may  be  inadequate  to  cover  claims  or  liabilities  relating  to  a cybersecurity attack.\n\n## Security  breaches  with  respect  to  our  products  could  interfere  with  our  business  and  our  dealers,  and/or customers, exposing us to liability that would cause our business and reputation to suffer\n\nOur  products  increasingly  include  and  depend  on  connectivity  hardware  and  software  typically  used  for  telematics services and remote system updates. While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access  to  these  products,  malicious  actors  have  reportedly  attempted,  and  may  attempt  in  the  future,  to  gain unauthorized  access  to  such  products  including  through  such  connectivity  hardware  in  order  to  gain  control  of  the products,  change  the  products'  functionality,  user  interface,  or  performance  characteristics,  or  gain  access  to  data stored in or generated by the products. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims against us or government investigations. In addition, reports of unauthorized access to our products, systems, and data, regardless of their veracity, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are capable of being hacked, which could harm our brands, prospects, and operating results.\n\n## We face risks associated with our employment relationships\n\nIn  many  countries  where  we  operate,  our  employees  are  protected  by  laws  and/or  collective  labor  agreements  that guarantee  them,  through  local  and  national  representatives,  the  right  of  consultation  on  specific  matters,  including repurposing,  downsizing  or  closure  of  production  facilities  and  reductions  in  personnel.  Laws  and/or  collective  labor agreements  applicable  to  us  could  impair  our  flexibility  in  reshaping  and/or  strategically  repositioning  our  business activities.  Therefore,  our  ability  to  efficiently  deploy  personnel  or  implement  permanent  or  temporary  redundancy measures is subject to government approvals and/or the agreement of labor unions where such laws and agreements are applicable. Furthermore, the failure of the Company to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work interruption or stoppage. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute  with  labor  unions  distracts  management  from  operating  the  business,  may  affect  the  Company's  reputation, could significantly impact the volume of products we manufacture and sell, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our ability to execute our strategy depends upon our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel\n\nOur ability to compete successfully, to manage our business effectively, to expand our business and to execute our strategic direction, depends, in part, on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in key functions and markets.  In  particular,  we  are  dependent  on  our  ability  to  attract,  motivate  and  retain  qualified  personnel  with  the requisite education, skills, background, talents and industry experience. Failure to attract and retain qualified personnel, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new personnel, or the inability to  integrate  and  retain  qualified  personnel,  could  impair  our  ability  to  execute  our  business  strategy  and  meet  our business  objectives.  These  may  be  affected  by  the  loss  of  employees,  particularly  when  departures  involve  larger numbers of employees. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect us through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees.\n\n## COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\n## We are subject to increasingly stringent and evolving laws that impose significant compliance costs\n\nWe  are  subject  to  comprehensive  and  constantly  evolving  laws,  regulations  and  policies  in  numerous  jurisdictions around the world. We expect the extent of legal requirements affecting our businesses and our costs of compliance to continue to increase in the future. Such laws govern, among other things, products - with requirements on emissions of",

        "page_content": "polluting gases and particulate matter, increased fuel efficiency and safety becoming increasingly strict - and industrial plants  -  with  requirements  for  reduced  air  emissions,  treatment  of  waste  and  water,  and  prohibitions  on  soil contamination also becoming increasingly strict. To comply with such laws, we make significant investments in research and development and capital expenditures and expect to continue to incur substantial costs in the future. Failure to comply with such laws could limit or prohibit our ability to sell our products in a particular jurisdiction, expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability  and  sanctions  on  certain  of  our  activities,  as  well  as  damage  to property or natural resources. Liabilities,  sanctions,  damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws, including those that may be adopted or imposed in the future, could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to any subsequently acquired operations.\n\nFurther, environmental, health and safety regulations change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance.  For  example,  changes  in  environmental  and  climate  change  laws,  including  laws  relating  to  engine  and equipment emissions,  safety  regulations,  sustainability,  fuel  requirements,  restricted  substances,  or  greenhouse  gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investments in product designs to comply with these regulations. Our internal combustion engines are mainly supplied by FPT Industrial S.p.A.,  a  company  controlled  by  Iveco  N.V.,  which  is  an independent public company following the 2022 spin-off, and compliance with emissions regulations is contractually allocated to our suppliers. Failure of our suppliers to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations may subject us to  administrative  and  legal  proceedings  and  other  material  consequences.  Further,  we  may  experience  production delays if our suppliers are unable design and manufacture components for our products that comply with environmental standards.  For  instance,  as  we  are  required  to  meet  more  stringent  engine  emission  reduction  standards  that  are applicable to engines we incorporate into our products, we expect to meet these requirements through the introduction of  new  technology  to  our  products,  engines  and  exhaust  after-treatment  systems,  as  necessary.  Failure  to  meet applicable requirements could materially affect our performance.\n\nChanges to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing compliance costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers. For example, so-called 'right to repair' legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the U.S. could require us to provide access to the software code embedded in our products, which, among  other  harmful  consequences,  could  create  product  safety  issues,  compromise  engine  emissions  and performance  controls,  adversely  affect  the  protection  of  our  intellectual  property,  and  limit  our  ability  to  recoup necessary investments in innovation and research and development.\n\n## We  are  subject  to  extensive  laws  and  regulations,  the  violation  of  which  could  expose  CNH  to  potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects\n\nDue to the global scope of our operations, we are subject to many laws and regulations that apply to our operations around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as a range of national anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws that apply to conduct in a particular jurisdiction. These anticorruption laws prohibit improper payments in cash or anything of value to improperly influence third parties to obtain or retain business or gain a business advantage. These laws tend to apply regardless of whether those practices are legal or  culturally  acceptable  in  a  particular  jurisdiction.  Over  the  past  several  years  there  has  been  an  increase  in  the enforcement of anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws both globally and in particular jurisdictions and we have from  time  to  time  been  subject  to  investigations  and  charges  claiming  violations  of  anti-corruption  or  antitrust  or competition laws. We are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable laws, in particular, anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws. We have implemented a program to promote compliance with these laws and to reduce the likelihood of potential violations. Our compliance program, however, may not in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that may violate the applicable laws or regulations of the  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Such  improper  actions  could  subject  us  to  civil  or  criminal  investigations  and monetary, injunctive and other penalties as well as damage claims. Investigations of alleged violations of these laws tend  to  be  expensive  and  require  significant  management  time  and  attention,  and  these  investigations  of  purported violations, as well as any publicity regarding potential violations, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. For further information see Note 27 'Commitments and contingencies' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Changes in privacy laws could disrupt our business\n\nThe  regulatory  framework  for  privacy  and  data  security  issues  worldwide  is  rapidly  evolving  and  is  likely  to  remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect personal information and other data as part of our business operations. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these and other privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations. Any inability to",

In the U.S., for example, the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ('Dodd-Frank Act'), including its regulations, as well as other efforts at regulatory reform in financial services may substantially affect the origination, servicing, and securitization programs of our Financial Services segment as well as limit the ability of our customers to enter  into  hedging  transaction  or  finance  purchases  of  our  equipment.  The  Dodd-Frank  Act  includes  extensive provisions regulating these securities and related capital market activities by the SEC and increases the regulation of the ABS markets through, among other things, a mandated risk retention requirement for securitizers and a direction to regulate credit rating agencies. Future regulations may affect our ability to engage in these capital market activities or increase the effective cost of such transactions, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of this  material  weakness  is  not  effective,  or  if  we  identify  additional  material  weaknesses  in  the  future  or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report  our  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations,  investors  may  lose  confidence  in  the  accuracy  and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our common shares may decline\n\nIn connection with the preparation of our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness  in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a  combination  of deficiencies,  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness relates to the design and implementation of information technology, or IT, general controls in the areas of user access limits and segregation of duties related to enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications. This material weakness has not resulted in an error or misstatement to our financial statements or the need to revise any of our previously published financial results.\n\nWe  are  in  the  process  of  taking  steps  intended  to  remediate  the  material  weakness.  Our  efforts  have  included enhancing our IT general controls framework that addresses risks associated with user access and security, application change management and IT operations. We also expect to engage in focused training for control owners to help sustain effective control operations and comprehensive remediation efforts relating to segregation of duties to strengthen user access controls and security.\n\nWhile  we  believe  these  efforts  will  improve  our  internal  controls  and  address  the  underlying  causes  of  the  material weakness, the material weakness will not be fully remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented and we have concluded that our controls are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or prevent future material weaknesses or control deficiencies from occurring. In addition,  we  cannot  be  certain  that  we  have  identified  all  material  weaknesses  in  our  internal  control  over  financial reporting,  or  that  in  the  future  we  will  not  have  additional  material  weaknesses  in  our  internal  control  over  financial reporting.\n\nIf we fail to effectively remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations. We also could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the securities exchange on which our common shares are listed, the SEC  or  other  regulatory  authorities.  In  addition,  if  we  are  unable  to  assert  that  our  internal  control  over  financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  when  required,  investors  may  lose  confidence  in  the accuracy  and  completeness  of  our  financial  reports,  we  may  face  restricted  access  to  the  capital  markets,  and  the trading price of our common shares may decline.\n\n## FINANCIAL AND TAXATION RISKS\n\n## Difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt could impact our financial performance\n\nOur performance will depend on, among other things, our ability to finance debt repayment obligations and planned investments  from  operating  cash  flow,  available  liquidity,  the  renewal  or  refinancing  of  existing  bank  loans  and/or facilities  and  access  to  capital  markets  or  other  sources  of  financing. A  decline  in  revenues  could  have  a  negative impact  on  the  cash-generating  capacity  of  our  operations.  Consequently,  we  could  find  ourselves  in  the  position  of having to seek additional financing and/or having to refinance existing debt, including in unfavorable market conditions with limited availability of funding and a general increase in funding costs.

        "page_content": "market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate and exchange rate volatility, could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of our short and long-term financing. Any difficulty in obtaining financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nOur ability to access the capital markets or other forms of financing and related costs are highly dependent on, among other things, the credit ratings of CNH Industrial N.V., its subsidiaries, ABS and other debt instruments. Rating agencies may review and revise their ratings from time to time, and any downgrade or other negative action with respect to our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies may increase our cost of capital, potentially limit our access to sources of financing, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## We are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate changes and other market risks\n\nWe operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to market risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and interest rates, including as a result of changes in monetary or fiscal policies of governmental authorities from time to time. We are subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, the reporting currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the U.S.  dollar.  Certain  of  our  assets,  liabilities,  expenses  and  revenues  are  denominated  in  other  currencies.  Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into the U.S. dollar at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency. Changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity as well as on the financial health of our customers,  either  of  which  could  negatively  affect  customer  demand  for  our  products  and  services  as  well  as customers'  ability  to  service  any  financing  provided  by  our  Financial  Services  segment.  In  addition,  credit  market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs, which in turn may make it more difficult for our Financial Services Segment to offer customers competitive financing rates. We also use various forms of financing to cover the funding requirements  of  our  Industrial  Activities  and  for  financing  offered  to  customers  and  dealers  by  Financial  Services. Financial Services normally implements a matching policy to offset the impact of differences in interest rates on the financed portfolio and related liabilities. Nevertheless, any future changes in interest rates can result in increases or decreases in revenues, finance costs and margins.\n\nAlthough we seek to manage our currency risk and interest rate risk, including through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully, and our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates. For additional information, see Note 30 'Information on financial risks' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2023.\n\nWe  also  face  risks  from  currency  devaluations.  Currency  devaluations  result  in  a  diminished  value  of  funds denominated in the currency of the country suffering the devaluation.\n\n## Because Financial Services provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide, our operations and financial  results  could  be  impacted  materially  should  negative  economic  conditions  affect  the  financial services industry\n\nNegative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial services industry in which Financial Services operates. Financial Services, through wholly-owned financial services companies and joint ventures, provides financing for  a  significant  portion  of  our  sales  worldwide.  Financial  Services  may  experience  credit  losses  that  exceed  its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. Financial Services' inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Financial Services' liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash  flow  requirements  and  to  fund  operations  and  costs  associated  with  engaging  in  diversified  funding  activities. Additionally,  negative  market  conditions  could  reduce  customer  confidence  levels,  resulting  in  declines  in  credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact Financial Services' writeoffs  and  provision  for  credit  losses.  Financial  Services  may  also  experience  residual  value  losses  that  exceed  its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher than expected equipment returns at lease maturity.\n\n## An increase in delinquencies or repossessions could adversely affect the results of Financial Services\n\nFundamental  in  the  operation  of  Financial  Services  is  the  credit  risk  associated  with  its  customers/borrowers.  The creditworthiness  of  each  customer,  rates  of  delinquency  and  default,  repossessions  and  net  losses  on  loans  to customers are impacted by many factors, including: relevant industry and general economic conditions; the availability of  capital;  the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  extensions  of  credit;  the  experience  and  skills  of  the  customer's management  team;  commodity  prices;  political  events,  including  government  mandated  moratoria  on  payments; weather; and the value of the collateral securing the extension of credit. An increase in delinquencies or defaults, or a reduction in repossessions could have an adverse impact on the performance of Financial Services and our earnings and cash flows.

The funded status is the balance between the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of related assets, in case of funded plans (plans managed by a separate fund, 'trust'). Consequently, the funded status is subject to many factors, as discussed in the Consolidated Financial Statements at December  31,  2023,  section  'Material  Accounting  Policies'  paragraph  'Use  of  Estimates',  as  well  as  Note  22 'Provisions for employee benefits' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2023.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  our  obligations  under  a  plan  are  unfunded  or  underfunded,  we  will  have  to  use  cash  flows  from operations and other sources to pay our obligations as they become due. In addition, since the assets that currently fund  these  obligations  are  primarily  invested  in  debt  instruments  and  equity  securities,  the  value  of  these  assets  is subject to changes due to market fluctuations.\n\n## We have significant outstanding indebtedness, which may limit our ability to obtain additional funding and may limit our financial and operating flexibility\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  we  had  an  aggregate  of  $28,255  million  (including  $24,344  million  relating  to  Financial Services'  activities)  of  consolidated  gross  indebtedness,  and  our  equity  was $8,811  million,  including  non-controlling interests. The extent of our indebtedness could have important consequences on our operations and financial results, including:\n\n- \u25aa we may not be able to secure additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes;\n- \u25aa we may need to use a portion of our projected future cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which may reduce the amount of funds available to us for other purposes;\n- \u25aa we  may  be  more  financially  leveraged  than  some  of  our  competitors,  which  could  put  us  at  a  competitive disadvantage;\n- \u25aa we may not be able to invest in the development or introduction of new products or new business opportunities;\n- \u25aa our future cash flow may be exposed to the risk of interest rate volatility (see above);\n- \u25aa we may not be able to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions, which may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions; and\n- \u25aa we  may  not  be  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  on  favorable  terms,  which  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to provide competitive retail and wholesale financing programs.\n\nThese risks are exacerbated by the ongoing volatility in the financial markets, in part resulting from perceived strains on the finances and creditworthiness of several governments and financial institutions, particularly in the European Union and South America, and from continued concerns about global economic growth, particularly in emerging markets.\n\nFurther,  due  to  the  cessation  of  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate  ('LIBOR'),  the  Group  has  entered  into  financial transactions such as credit agreements and certain derivative transactions that use the relevant new benchmark rates. These new benchmark rates are calculated differently from LIBOR and have inherent differences, which could give rise to uncertainties, including the limited historical data and volatility in the benchmark rates. The full effects of the transition to these new benchmark rates remain uncertain.\n\n## Restrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility\n\nThe agreements governing our outstanding debt securities and other credit agreements to which we are a party from time to time contain, or may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\n- \u25aa incur additional indebtedness by certain subsidiaries;\n- \u25aa make certain investments;\n- \u25aa enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n- \u25aa sell or acquire certain assets or merge with or into other companies; and/or\n- \u25aa use assets as security in other transactions.\n\nAlthough we do not believe any of these covenants materially restrict our operations currently, a breach of one or more of  the  covenants  could  result  in  adverse  consequences  that  could  negatively  impact  our  businesses,  results  of operations,  and  financial  position. These  consequences  may  include  the  acceleration  of  amounts  outstanding  under certain of our credit facilities, triggering an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to",

For further information, see Note 24 'Debt' to the Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2023.\n\n## CNH Industrial N.V. operates and will continue to operate, as a company that is resident in the U.K. for tax purposes; other tax authorities may treat CNH Industrial N.V. as being tax resident elsewhere\n\nCNH Industrial  N.V.  is  incorporated  in  the  Netherlands.  In  order  to  be  resident  in  the  U.K.  for  tax  purposes,  CNH Industrial N.V.'s central management and control must be located (in whole or in part) in the U.K.  The U.K. and Dutch competent authorities have agreed, following a mutual agreement procedure (as contemplated by the Netherlands-U.K. tax treaty), that CNH will be regarded as solely resident in the U.K. for purposes of the application of the NetherlandsU.K. tax treaty based on the facts and circumstances outlined in the Company's mutual agreement application. If the facts upon which the competent authorities issued this ruling change over time, this ruling may be withdrawn or cease to apply and in that case the Netherlands may impose withholding taxes on dividends distributed to non-residents by CNH Industrial N.V. and may levy Dutch corporate income tax on CNH Industrial N.V., which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. should not be deemed resident in Italy under Italian domestic law except to the extent of CNH Industrial N.V.'s Italian branch, and should be deemed resident exclusively in the U.K. from the date of its incorporation for purposes of the Italy-U.K. tax treaty. Because this analysis is highly factual and may depend on future changes in CNH's management and organizational structure, tax authorities may disagree with our determination of the Company's tax  residence.  Should  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  be  treated  as  an  Italian  tax  resident  beyond  its  Italian  branch,  Italy  may impose  withholding  taxes  on  dividends  distributed  by  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  levy  corporate  income  tax  on  CNH Industrial  N.V.'s  worldwide  income,  which  could  result  in  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations  and financial condition.\n\n## The Company could be characterized as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes\n\nThe U.S. federal  income  tax  rules  provide  specific  tax  rules  applicable  to  shareholders  in  companies  that  meet  the definition of a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC') for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We believe that the Company is not a passive foreign investment company, but this conclusion is a factual determination made annually and may be subject to change. U.S. Holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a PFIC.\n\n## We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure\n\nWe are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions in which we operate around the  world.  Our  tax  liabilities  are  dependent  upon  the  mix  of  earnings  among  these  different  jurisdictions.  Our  future results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected  by  changes  in  the  consolidated  effective  tax  rate  as  a  result  of  a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes to  our  transfer  pricing  approach,  changes  in  tax  legislation  and  rates,  changes  in  generally  accepted  accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or paid, our operating results, cash flows, and financial position could be adversely affected. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits  in  the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  Tax  authorities  may  disagree  with  certain  positions  we  have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of  these  audits,  and  the  actual  outcomes  of  these  audits  could  have  a  material  impact  on  our  business,  results  of operations,  financial  condition,  and  cash  flows,  see    Note  10  'Income  tax  (expense)  benefit'  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of  reported  profits  (Pillar  Two)  that  has  been  agreed  upon  in  principle  by  over  140  countries.  During  2023,  many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws. The Company continues to monitor developments in the Pillar Two legislation and is working to evaluate the impacts of this legislation on its longerterm financial position.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON SHARES\n\n## The loyalty voting program may affect the liquidity of our common shares and reduce our share price\n\nCNH's loyalty voting program was established to reward shareholders for maintaining long-term share ownership by granting at inception initial shareholders and subsequently any other person holding shares continuously for at least three years, the option to elect to receive special voting shares. Issuance of special voting shares is subject to various conditions set forth in the Company's constituting documents, including the registration of the common shares held by each shareholder requesting the issuance of special voting shares in the CNH Loyalty Register. Special voting shares have minimal economic entitlements and cannot be traded. In the event any shareholder holding such special voting shares intends to transfer its common shares from the CNH Loyalty Register, immediately prior to such transfer, any",

        "page_content": "corresponding  special  voting  shares  shall  be  transferred  to  CNH  for  no  consideration (om  niet) .  This  loyalty  voting program  is  designed  to  encourage  a  stable  shareholder  base  and,  conversely,  it  may  deter  trading  by  those shareholders who are interested in gaining or retaining special voting shares. Therefore, the loyalty voting structure may reduce liquidity in our common shares and adversely affect their trading price.\n\nThe loyalty voting program may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common shares may be lower as a result\n\nThe provisions of our Articles of Association establishing the loyalty voting program may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of us, even if a change of control is considered favorably by shareholders holding a majority of our common shares. As a result of the loyalty voting program, a relatively large proportion of the voting power of our common shares could be concentrated in a relatively small number of shareholders who would have significant influence over us. As of February 29, 2024, EXOR N.V. had a voting interest in CNH of approximately 45.4%.  For  further  information,  see  section  'Major  Shareholders'  and  Note  32  \"Related  party  transactions\"  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  at  December  31,  2023.  Such  shareholders  participating  in  the  loyalty  voting program could effectively prevent change of control transactions that may otherwise benefit our shareholders.\n\nThe  loyalty  voting  program  may  also  prevent  or  discourage  shareholders'  initiatives  aimed  at  changes  in  our management.\n\n## CYBERSECURITY\n\nWe assess,  identify  and  manage  risks  from  cybersecurity  threats  through  our  Information  Technology  Security  and Compliance organization ('Cybersecurity Program'), which is part of our larger enterprise risk management framework. The  Cybersecurity  Program  is  currently  overseen  by  the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (the  \"Audit Committee\") and is managed by our Chief Information and Digital Officer ('CIO') and a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO'). Our current CISO has over 10 years of experience in cybersecurity and has held numerous positions in the cybersecurity sector, including serving as a Global Director of Information Security at another global high-tech manufacturing company. The CISO's organization has oversight of cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, architecture and processes for the security of our enterprise network and, information assets. The CISO's organization monitors and manages, and works to identify and assess, cybersecurity risk through various technologies, resources, processes and policies that are updated to align with the changing threat landscape, our evolving business needs and global regulatory requirements. Our strategy includes risk assessments, risk and threat analysis, utilization of security tools, cybersecurity-related tabletop and phishing exercises designed to simulate cybersecurity incidents, and security awareness and technical security trainings.\n\nWe use a range of defenses to help protect against cybersecurity threats and to work to secure our assets, reduce detection  time  and  improve  recoverability  These  include  the  ongoing  monitoring  of  our  systems,  including  with  the assistance  of  third  party  vendors,  conducting  exercises  with  employees  and  senior  management,  including  our executive officers, to promote awareness and improve internal processes. In addition, to promote security awareness throughout  the  Company,  employees  with  an  email  address  received  training  and  access  to  security  awareness materials in 2023. Further, we are implementing a program for the assessment and monitoring of security standards and control procedures for external suppliers and vendors.\n\nUnder the Cybersecurity Program, cybersecurity matters are generally managed by a combination of functional groups that report to the Company's global leadership team, as appropriate, on matters such as enterprise level cybersecurity initiatives, threat intelligence and product cybersecurity risks and remediations.\n\nOur Board of Directors  (the  \"Board\")  addresses  our  cybersecurity  risk  management  as  part  of  its  general  oversight function. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our key risks and controls relating to information systems, including  our  assessment  and  mitigation  of  material  risks  from  cybersecurity  threats.  The Audit  Committee  receives periodic  reports,  summaries  or  presentations  related  to  cybersecurity  threats,  risk,  mitigation  and  related  processes from the Chief Information and Digital Officer and CISO. In addition, on at least an annual basis, the Board receives reports, summaries or presentations from our Chief Information and Digital Officer and CISO related to cybersecurity threats, risk, mitigation and related processes.\n\nThe CISO maintains and periodically updates a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan which is a guide for to respond effectively and efficiently to cybersecurity incidents in a coordinated manner in the interest of minimizing the risk of harm to our customers, operations, partners, employees and third parties, consistent with our legal obligations. As of the date of this report, we do not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially  affect  our  business  strategy,  results  of  operations  or  financial  condition.  However,  we  recognize  the  everevolving cyber risk landscape and cannot provide any assurances that we will not be subject to a material cybersecurity incident in the future. For a description of risks related to our information technology systems, including cybersecurity threats, see section \"Risk Factors - Operational Risks\".",

We also own other significant properties including spare  parts  depots,  research  laboratories,  test  tracks,  warehouses,  and  office  buildings.  We  consider  each  of  our facilities to be in good condition and adequate for its present use. We believe that we have sufficient capacity to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing requirements.\n\nWe make capital  expenditures  in  the  regions  in  which  we  operate  principally  related  to  initiatives  to  introduce  new products, enhance manufacturing efficiency and increase capacity, and for maintenance and engineering. In 2023, our total  capital  expenditures  in  long-lived  assets,  excluding  equipment  on  operating  leases,  were  $852  million  of  which 39%  was  spent  in  EMEA,  46%  in  North  America,  10%  in  South  America  and  5%  in  Asia  Pacific.

The most significant of these matters are described in Note 27 'Commitments and contingencies' to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims or investigations could require CNH to pay substantial damages or  fines  or  undertake  service  actions,  recall  campaigns  or  other  costly  actions.  It  is  therefore  possible  that  legal judgments could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance and could affect CNH's financial position and results.\n\nAlthough  the  ultimate  outcome  of  legal  matters  pending  against  CNH  and  its  subsidiaries  cannot  be  predicted, management believes the reasonable possible range of losses for these unresolved legal matters in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## INSURANCE\n\nWe maintain insurance with third party insurers to cover various risks arising from our business activities including, but not limited to, risk of loss or damage to our assets or facilities, business interruption losses, general liability, automobile liability, product liability and directors' and officers' liability insurance. We believe that we maintain insurance coverage that is customary in our industry.",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## CNH RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk management is an important component of CNH's overall culture and is integral to the achievement of its longterm  business  plan.  Accordingly,  our  Enterprise  Risk  Management  ('ERM')  framework  is  designed  to  assist  in  the identification,  evaluation  and  prioritization  of  business  risks  (including  environmental,  social,  and  governance  risks), followed by a coordinated and balanced application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of adverse events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.\n\nCNH's ERM processes are aligned with the HCC Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO') published framework, as well as the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, further adapted for specific  business  requirements  by  incorporating  Company  management  knowledge  and  best  practices  identified  by third-party risk consulting firms.\n\nCNH's ERM framework has identified 43 primary enterprise risks, further broken down into 134 specific risk drivers. Primary  risk  drivers  include  a  number  of  significant  topics,  such  as  business  strategies  and  operations,  competitive factors,  social  responsibility  and  environmental  issues,  and  regulatory  compliance. The  process  follows  a  bottom-up analysis starting at the business unit level, with risk survey completion by business and function leaders worldwide, followed by cross-functional reviews, one-on-one interviews with Global Leadership Team (\"GLT\"), presentations and risk assessment discussions with the Audit Committee of the Board, and review and discussion with the Board. Direct feedback received from each of these layers up to and including the Board is then used to identify and develop risk mitigation activities as necessary within the business or functional area, which are deployed by management.\n\nInherently,  CNH's ERM framework is not meant to provide a guarantee of the accuracy or completeness of the risk assessments  performed  or  on  the  full  achievement  of  CNH's  objectives.  CNH's  potential  overall  risk  exposure  is described in the Risk Factors section.\n\n## RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES\n\nThe risk mitigation activities initiated by management are designed to mitigate adverse impacts to CNH's business plan, including  financial  and  operational  performance,  during  2023  and  beyond.  The  ERM  framework  is  linked  with  our sustainability program and its strategic sustainability targets, our aspirational goals articulated in the strategic business plan and our employee and customer safety goals. These targets and goals, which are incorporated into the individual segment business plans, provide a framework to address the long-term challenges to increasing stakeholder value and proactively mitigate associated risks.\n\nFor  example,  \"third-party  viability\"  represents  the  risk  that  our  key  suppliers  and  service  providers  may  become insolvent  amid  margin  pressures,  economic  contraction,  or  other  market  forces  such  as  inflation.  Such  risk  can undermine our operational resiliency and ultimately impact our ability to deliver on customer performance obligations. Our ERM processes help to ensure we remain resilient amid such economic uncertainty. Corresponding actions that the Company  has  taken  to  mitigate  third  party  viability  risk  include,  for  example,  implementing  a  Kaizen  approach  on problem solving and root cause analysis performed in coordination with our at-risk suppliers to help the business stay ahead or preventable supply disruptions. Strategic sourcing initiatives are also underway that should further limit our exposure to potential supply chain disruptions caused by economic uncertainty.\n\nOur  ERM  process  also  monitors  emerging  risks,  which  we  define  as  new  risks  or  risks  for  which  the  impacts  are unknown  or  evolving  and  thus  may  be  incorporated  into  risk  assessment  and  mitigation  activities  when  deemed necessary. For example, mass generative AI availability is among the top emerging risks within our industry given its broad  area  of  impact,  thus  requiring  close  monitoring  to  ensure  we  are  readily  able  to  adapt  and  address  aspects related to regulations as well as unintended consequences from AI's increasing use case portfolio. Planned mitigating actions  include  development  of  methodical  approaches  toward  scenario  and  use  case  monitoring  to  ensure organizational alignment of AI usage and our ability to address new or elevated risks that responsible AI failures may cause.",

As part of these efforts, CNH continues to enhance its risk management process, including the ongoing rollout  of  targeted  risk  assessments  conducted  by  subject  matter  experts  within  the  business.  These  assessments, which now cover nearly 70% of our full risk register, help identify important risk exposures outside of predetermined risk tolerance levels and trigger the execution of new or previously identified risk mitigation activities that are intended to reduce or, in certain cases, eliminate the risk exposures altogether. We have also better aligned our oversight functions to improve the internal transparency of our risk profile and increase efficiencies across ERM, Finance, Internal Audit, IT Security, Internal Controls (including Sarbanes-Oxley functions), Sustainability and Legal & Compliance. Quarterly risk reports are delivered to our ERM Supervising Committee as well as the GLT, giving business transparency to our risk management processes and latest risk profiles. Finally, we continue to expand our GRC software platform to provide more intuitive and automated coverage of common high-risk areas such as information technology and cybersecurity, business continuity management and environment, social and governance (\"ESG\") monitoring and reporting.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe Company has in place an internal control system, based on the model provided by COSO and the principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which consists of a set of policies, procedures and organizational structures aimed at  identifying,  measuring,  managing,  and  monitoring  the  principal  risks  to  which  CNH  is  exposed.  The  system  is integrated  within  the  organizational  and  corporate  governance  framework  adopted  by  CNH  and  contributes  to  the protection of corporate assets, as well as to ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes, reliability of financial information, and compliance with laws, regulations, the Company's Code of Conduct, policies, and internal procedures.\n\nThe system, which has been developed on the basis of international best practices, consists of the following three lines:\n\nManagement:\n\n- 1. operating areas, which identify and assess risk and establish specific actions for management of such risk;\n- 2. central  functions  responsible  for  risk  control,  which  define  methodologies  and  instruments  for  managing  and monitoring such risk.\n\nInternal Audit:\n\n- 3. conducts independent evaluations of the system in its entirety.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A periodic evaluation of the system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to ensure the overall effectiveness of the components of the COSO Framework (Governance & Culture; Strategy & Objective-Setting; Performance; Review & Revision; and Information, Communication, & Reporting) in achieving those objectives.\n\nCNH - which is listed on the NYSE and, consequently, is subject to Section 404 of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act since 2014 - has a system of administrative and accounting procedures in place that seeks to ensure a highly reliable system of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe approach adopted by CNH for the evaluation, monitoring and continuous updating of the system of internal control over  financial  reporting,  is  based  on  a  'top-down,  risk-based'  process  consistent  with  the  COSO  Framework.  This enables  focus  on  areas  of  higher  risk  and/or  materiality,  where  there  is  risk  of  significant  errors,  including  those attributable to fraud, in the elements of the financial statements and related documents. The key components of the process are:\n\n- \u25aa identification and evaluation of the source and probability of significant errors in elements of financial reporting;\n- \u25aa assessment of the adequacy of key controls in enabling ex-ante or ex-post identification of potential misstatements in elements of financial reporting; and\n- \u25aa verification of the operating effectiveness of controls based on the assessment of the risk of misstatement in financial reporting, with testing focused on areas of higher risk.\n\nIdentification  and  evaluation  of  the  risk  of  misstatements  which  could  have  material  effects  on  financial  reporting  is carried out through a risk assessment process that uses a top-down approach to identify the organizational entities, processes and the related accounts, in addition to specific activities, which could potentially generate significant errors. Under the methodology adopted by CNH, risks and related controls are associated with the accounting and business processes upon which accounting information is based.\n\n- U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  guidance  allows  companies  to  exclude  acquisitions  from  management's report on internal control over financial reporting for the first year after the acquisition when it is not possible to conduct an assessment. In March 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 89.5% of the capital stock of Augmenta Holding SAS (\"Augmenta\") it did not own and it acquired a controlling interest in Bennamann Ltd (\"Bennamann\"). In October 2023, the Company also acquired 100% of the capital stock of Hemisphere GNSS (\"Hemisphere\") (see Note 2). Due to the  timing  of  the  Augmenta,  Bennamann  and  Hemisphere  acquisitions,  management  has  excluded  Augmenta, Bennamann  and  Hemisphere  from  the  annual  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial reporting  as  of  December  31,  2023.  Augmenta,  Bennamann  and  Hemisphere  represent  less  than  2%  of  the consolidated total net assets (excluding acquired intangible assets and goodwill in purchase accounting) and less than 1% of the consolidated Net revenues.\n\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,  2023,  using  the  criteria  set  forth  in  Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, and the material weakness noted below, management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our 2023 consolidated financial statements  included  in  this  Annual  Report,  has  issued  an  attestation  report  on  our  internal  control  over  financial reporting.\n\n## Material Weakness\n\nIn  connection with the preparation of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2023 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which persisted as of December 31,  2023.  A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a  combination  of  deficiencies,  in  internal  control  over  financial reporting,  such  that  there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  that  a  material  misstatement  of  a  company's  annual  or  interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness relates to the design and implementation of information technology (IT) general controls in the areas of user access limits and segregation of duties related to multiple enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications.\n\nThese control deficiencies have not resulted in an error or misstatements to our financial statements or the need to revise  any  previously  published  financial  results.  However,  these  deficiencies  if  not  timely  remediated,  could  impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated",

    {
        "page_content": "controls that address the risk of material misstatements to one or more assertions, and IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of IT system-generated data and reports).\n\nThe control deficiencies could have resulted in a misstatement of one or more account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.\n\n## Management's Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\n\nSubsequent to the identification of the material weakness, management under the oversight of the Audit Committee has been implementing measures and taking steps to address the underlying causes of the material weakness, including enhancing our IT general controls framework that addresses risks associated with user access and security, application change management and IT operations. We are implementing enhanced compensating controls and providing focused training for control owners to help sustain effective control operations and comprehensive remediation efforts relating to segregation of duties to strengthen user access controls and security.\n\nWhile we believe these efforts have improved our internal controls and address the underlying cause of the material weakness, the material weakness will not be remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented and tested  and  we  have  concluded  that  following  the  improvements  to  our  internal  controls,  our  control  environment  is operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. In particular, the enhanced compensating controls and training will require time to test and assess. We cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or prevent future material weaknesses or control deficiencies from occurring. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have identified all material  weaknesses in  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  or  that  in  the  future  we  will  not  have  additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAs  described  above,  the  Company  is  taking  steps  to  remediate  the  material  weakness  noted  above.  Other  than  in connection with these remediation steps, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Limitations  on  Effectiveness  of  Disclosure  Controls  and  Procedures  and  Internal  Control  over  Financial Reporting\n\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to the costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.",

On January 1, 2022, the On-Highway businesses,  now  known  as  Iveco  Group  was  separated  from  the  Company  and  became  a  public  listed  company independent from the Company through a demerger under Dutch Law. CNH qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the applicable rules of the SEC and its common shares are listed on the NYSE.\n\nWe are subject to, among other things, the laws of the Netherlands and the laws and regulations applicable to foreign private issuers in the U.S., the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the 'Dutch Code' of \"DCGC\") and the NYSE listing standards,  which  are  of  particular  significance  to  our  corporate  governance.  In  accordance  with  the  NYSE  Listed Company  Manual,  we  are  permitted  to  follow  home  country  practice  with  regard  to  certain  corporate  governance standards. In accordance with the article 3, paragraph 1 of the Dutch Decree on establishing further rules regarding the content  of  the  Annual  Report  (Besluit  van  23  december  2004  tot  vaststelling  van  nadere  voorschriften  omtrent  de inhoud  van  het  jaarverslag,  the  Decree)  (the  'Board  Report  Further  Content  Decree'),  in  the  paragraph  \"Board Diversity\" we include a statement relating to our compliance with the principles and best practices of the Dutch Code, including  a  description  and  motivation  of  deviations  from  the  Dutch  Code.  The  significant  differences  between  our corporate governance practices and those required for domestic U.S. listed companies by the NYSE listing standards are described on our website.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Board of Directors (the \"Board\"), as a one-tier board structure under Dutch law comprising both executive directors and  non-executive  directors,  has  collective  responsibility  for  the  strategy  of  the  Company.  During  2023,  the  Board reviewed and discussed with management, among other things, the Company's strategy, and the sustainable long-term value  creation  strategies  of  the  Company's  Agriculture,  Construction  and  Financial  Services  segments  and  their deployment in the regions.\n\nAll Board members are expected to attend not less than 75% of all Board and Committee meetings. In addition, NonExecutive Directors are limited to being on not more than four (4) boards of other public companies.\n\nThe Board met five (5) times during 2023. During 2023, all incumbent directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Boards and Committees on which they served. Overall attendance at Board meetings was 98%.\n\nAt  this  time,  we  do  not  have  a  policy  regarding  the  Board  members'  attendance  at  annual  general  meetings  of shareholders. Directors followed the 2023 Meeting via live webcast.\n\nThe positions of Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chair of the Board are held by two different individuals (Scott W. Wine and Suzanne Heywood, respectively). This structure allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day business while our Chair provides advice to and exercises executive oversight of management. The Board appointed Mr. Vagn S\u00f8rensen as Senior Non-Executive Director, the Non-Executive Chair for purposes of Section 2:219 a(1) of the  Dutch  Civil  Code  and  best  practice  provision  5.1.3,  and  in  compliance  with  best  practice  provision  2.1.9,  of  the Dutch  Code.  The  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  is  responsible  for  the  proper  functioning  of  the  Board  and  its Committees.\n\nThe  Non-Executive  Directors  believe  that  in  consideration  of  the  size  of  the  Company,  the  complexity  and  specific characteristics  of  the  segments  in  which  it  operates  and  the  worldwide  presence  of  its  business,  an  adequate  and diversified mix of skills, experience and cultures and other diversity factors are necessary prerequisites to achieve a Board having the appropriate diversification and collegial capabilities, also assured by an appropriate balance between the  number  of  Executive  Directors  and  Non-Executive  Directors.  Independent  Directors  -  identified  as  such  both pursuant to NYSE and Dutch Code provisions - have an essential role in protecting the interests of all stakeholders and in the proper composition and functioning of the Board Committees, further described below. It is generally recognized that more diverse boards are more effective in performing their monitoring and advisory activities, due to the variety of professional  experience,  perspectives,  insights,  skills  and  connections  to  the  outside  world  that  diversity  can  add. Accordingly, the Board will continue to actively seek diverse candidates for possible appointment to the Board. In 2023, the Board adopted a Policy on Diversity and Inclusion as required by the Dutch Code. The Policy provides that in light of the size of the Company, the complexity and specific characteristics of the segments in which it operates and the geographic  distribution  of  its  businesses,  the  Board  should  be  composed  of  individuals  with  skills,  experience  and cultural  background,  both  general  and  specific,  acquired  in  an  international  environment  and  relevant  to  an understanding of the macro-economy and global markets, more generally, as well as the industrial and financial sectors, more specifically. An appropriate and diversified mix of skills, professional backgrounds, and diversity factors (inclusive of age, nationality, religious or personal beliefs, political opinion or belonging to other protected groups) are fundamental to the proper functioning of the Board as a collegial body. In compliance with article 3d of the Board Report Further",

For this purpose, the GLT, either directly or  through  the  Executive  Directors,  provides  the  Non-Executive  Directors  with  all  information  the  Non-Executive Directors require to fulfill their responsibilities. During 2023, the leaders of various Segments and business units (all GLT members) presented to the Board their operating results, updated strategic business plans, and long-term value creation  strategies  as  well  as  their  top  short-term  and  mid-term  operational  and  strategic  risks.

Such  indemnification  shall  not  be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified persons may be entitled otherwise.\n\n## DIRECTOR'S INDEPENDENCE AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nWe have a one-tier board structure (i.e. board that is composed of both members having responsibility for our day-today  operations,  who  are  referred  to  as  'executive  directors',  and  members  not  having  such  responsibility,  who  are referred  to  as  'non-executive  directors').  Our  executive  directors,  Ms.  Heywood  and  Mr.  Scott  Wine,  and  the  nonexecutive directors were elected at the Company's annual general meeting of shareholders held on April 14, 2023. The term of office of the current Board will expire on May 3, 2024, the date of the Company's next Meeting.\n\nSix directors (67%) qualify as independent for purposes of NYSE rules, Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act') and the Dutch Code and that none of the independent directors has any material relationship with the Company, other than as a director or shareholder of the Company.\n\nThe Board has designed procedures to avoid conflicts of interest by Board members. A Director must without delay report  any  conflict  of  interest  or  potential  conflict  of  interest  to  the  Chair  and  to  the  other  Directors,  or,  in  case  any conflict  of  interest  or  potential  conflict  of  interest  of  the  Chair,  to  the  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  and  to  the  other Directors. The Director in question must provide all relevant information to the Board, so that the Board can decide whether a reported (potential) conflict of interest of a Director qualifies as a conflict of interest within the meaning of the relevant laws. A Director may not take part in the decision-taking process of the Board in respect of any situation in which he or she has a conflict of interest.\n\nIn 2023, there were no conflicts of interest (actual or potential) in relation to the members of the Board between their duties  to  the  Company  and  their  private  interests  and/or  other  duties. The  Company  is  compliant  with  best  practice 2.7.3 to 2.7.4 of the Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe Conflict-of-Interest Policy is available on the Company's website, (www.cnh.com).",

        "page_content": "## LOYALTY VOTING PROGRAM\n\nOur authorized share capital is \u20ac40,000,000 consisting of two billion (2,000,000,000) common shares and two billion (2,000,000,000) special voting shares to be held with associated common shares, each having a par value of one euro cent  (\u20ac0.01).  Our  common  shares  are  registered  shares  represented  by  an  entry  in  the  share  register  of  CNH. Beneficial interests in our common shares traded on the NYSE are held through the book-entry system provided by DTC and are registered in the register of shareholders in the name of Cede & Co., as DTC's nominee.\n\nCNH has a loyalty voting program, pursuant to which shareholders elect to receive one CNH special voting share to be held only with each CNH common share. The CNH common shares held by shareholders that participate in the loyalty voting program are registered in the Company's Loyalty Register. Following this registration, a corresponding number of special voting shares are allocated to such shareholders, and the additional voting rights could be exercised at CNH shareholders' meeting that followed the registration. By signing an election form, whose execution was necessary to elect  to  participate  in  the  loyalty  voting  program,  shareholders  also  agree  to  be  bound  by  the  terms  and  conditions thereof, including the transfer restrictions described below. The terms and conditions applicable to special voting shares are available on the Company's website (www.cnh.com).\n\nA holder of Qualifying Common Shares may at any time request the de-registration of some or all such shares from the Loyalty Register, which will allow such shareholder to freely trade its CNH common shares. From the moment of such request, the holder of Qualifying Common Shares shall be considered to have waived his/her/its rights to cast any votes associated  with  the  loyalty  voting  shares  corresponding  to  its  previously  Qualifying  Common  Shares.  Upon  the  deregistration  from  the  Loyalty  Register,  the  relevant  common  shares  will  therefore  cease  to  be  Qualifying  Common Shares. Any de-registration request would automatically trigger a mandatory transfer requirement pursuant to which the special voting shares will be surrendered to CNH for no consideration.\n\nCNH's common shares are freely transferable. Special voting shares are not admitted to listing and are transferable only in very limited circumstances and only along with the common shares to which they are associated. Any transfer of common shares that are registered on the Loyalty Register will trigger the de-registration of such common shares from that register and any associated special voting shares will automatically be surrendered to CNH for no consideration.\n\nThe purpose of the loyalty voting program is to grant long-term CNH shareholders an extra voting right as qualifying shareholders are entitled to exercise an additional vote through the common share and the associated special voting share held. However, under Dutch law, the special voting shares cannot be excluded from economic entitlements. As a result,  in  accordance  with  the  Articles  of  Association,  holders  of  special  voting  shares  are  entitled  to  a  minimum dividend, which is allocated to a separate special dividend reserve (the 'Special Dividend Reserve'). The distribution of dividends from the Special Dividend Reserve can only be approved by the general meeting of the holders of special voting shares upon proposal of the Board. The power to vote upon the distribution from the Special Dividend Reserve is the only power that is granted to that meeting, which can only be convened by the Board as it deems necessary. No distribution has been made from this reserve. The special voting shares do not have any other economic entitlement.\n\nSection  10  of  the  special  voting  share  terms  and  conditions  includes  liquidated  damages  provisions  intended  to discourage  any  attempt  by  participants  in  the  loyalty  voting  program  to  violate  the  terms  thereof.  These  liquidated damages provisions may be enforced by CNH by means of a legal action brought by the Company in the courts of the Netherlands. A  violation  of  the  provisions  of  the  above-mentioned  terms  and  conditions  concerning  the  transfer  of special voting shares may lead to the imposition of liquidated damages.\n\nPursuant to Section 12 of the special voting share terms and conditions, any amendment to the terms and conditions (other than merely technical, non-material amendments) may only be made with the approval of the general meeting of shareholders of CNH.\n\nA shareholder must promptly notify CNH upon the occurrence of a change of control, which is defined in Article 4(1)(n) of the Articles of Association as including any direct or indirect transfer, carried out through one or a series of related transactions, by a CNH shareholder that is not an individual of (i) the ownership or control of 50% or more of the voting rights  of  such  shareholder,  (ii)  the de  facto ability  to  direct  the  casting  of  50%  or  more  of  the  votes  which  may  be expressed at  the  general  meetings  of  such  shareholder,  or  (iii)  the  ability  to  appoint  or  remove  half  or  more  of  the Directors, Executive Directors or Board members or executive officers of such shareholder or to direct the casting of 50% or more of the voting rights at meetings of the Board, governing body or executive committee of such shareholder. In accordance with Article 4(1)(n) of the Articles of Association, no change of control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) the transfer of ownership and/or control is the result of the succession or the liquidation of assets between spouses or the inheritance, inter vivos donation or other transfer to a spouse or a relative up to and including the fourth degree or (ii) the fair market value of the Qualifying Common Shares held by the relevant CNH shareholder represents less than 20% of the total assets of the Transferred Group at the time of the transfer and the Qualifying Common Shares, in the sole judgment of CNH, are not otherwise material to the Transferred Group or the change of control transaction. Article 4(1)(n) of the Articles of Association defines 'Transferred Group' as comprising the relevant shareholder together with its affiliates, if any, over which control was transferred as part of the same change of control transaction, as such term in defined in Article 4(1)(n) of the Articles of Association. A change of control will trigger the de-registration of the",

In  addition,  the  Board,  the  Chair,  the  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  or  the  Chief  Executive Officer are entitled to convene a general meeting when deemed necessary.\n\n## ISSUANCE OF SHARES\n\nThe  general  meeting  of  shareholders  or  alternatively  the  Board,  if  it  has  been  designated  to  do  so  by  the  general meeting of shareholders, shall have authority, for no longer than five years, to resolve on any issuance of shares and on the conditions thereof. The general meeting of shareholders shall, for as long as any such designation of the Board for this purpose is in force, no longer have authority to decide on the issuance of shares.\n\nThe designation may be extended from time to time for periods not exceeding five years and may not be withdrawn unless otherwise provided in the resolution in which the designation is made.\n\nIf  the  Board  is  designated to have authority to decide on the issuance of shares, such designation shall specify the class of shares and the maximum number of shares that can be issued under such designation.

The  authorization  will  be  limited  to  10%  of  the  Company's  issued  capital  per  the  date  of  the Annual General Meeting of 2023. The authorization may be used in connection with awards under the Company's equity incentive plans, but may also serve other purposes, such as the funding of acquisitions.\n\nIn the event of an issuance of common shares, every holder of common shares shall have a right of pre-emption with regard  to  the  shares  to  be  issued  of  that  class  in  proportion  to  the  aggregate  amount  of  his  shares  of  that  class; provided,  however,  that  no  such  right  of  pre-emption  shall  exist  in  respect  of  shares  to  be  issued  to  Directors  or employees of the Company or of a group company pursuant to any Company equity incentive or compensation plan.\n\nThe  right  of  pre-emption  may  be  limited  or  excluded  by  a  resolution  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  or  a resolution of the Board if it has been designated to do so by the general meeting of shareholders and provided the Board has also been authorized to resolve on the issuance of shares of the company.\n\nAt the AGM held on April 14, 2023, for a period of 18 months beginning April 14, 2023, the Board has been authorized by the shareholders to restrict or exclude the preemptive rights in relation to the issuance of common shares or granting rights to subscribe for shares, pursuant to the share issuance authorization described above.\n\nA shareholder shall have no right of pre-emption for shares that are issued against a non-cash contribution.\n\nIn the event of an issuance of special voting shares to Qualifying Shareholders, shareholders shall not have any right of pre-emption.\n\nEither the general meeting of shareholders or the Board, shall decide when passing the resolution to issue shares in which manner and, subject to paragraph 3 of Article 6 of the Articles of Association, within what period the right of preemption may be exercised.\n\n## PRINCIPAL OFFICE AND HOME MEMBER STATE\n\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. It has its corporate seat in Amsterdam and the place of effective management of the Company is in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Company's principal office and business address is at Cranes Farm Road, Basildon, Essex, SS14 3AD, United Kingdom.\n\nThe  Company  is  registered  with  the  trade  register  of  the  Netherlands  Chamber  of  Commerce  under  file  number 56532474 and at the Companies House in the United Kingdom under file number FC031116 BR016181.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nThe Board is responsible for creating and fostering a culture aimed at long-term value creation for the Group and all its stakeholders,  operating  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  consistent  with  the  Company's  values  and expectations.  Accordingly,  to  clarify  and  make  explicit  the  Company's  values  and  expectations,  in  2014  the  Board adopted the Company's code of conduct (which was renewed and updated in 2019, the 'Code of Conduct') and the Company issued its Supplier Code of Conduct.

The GCEC meets at least quarterly to, among other things, review and discuss compliance and ethics trends and topics, review and discuss compliance risk assessments, discuss compliance-related training to be deployed, consider the need for new or modified compliancerelated  corporate  policies,  and  review  matters  submitted  to  the  Company's  Compliance  Helpline  and  related investigations. The extent to which each employee complies with and promotes such culture and values is assessed each year through, among other things, the Company's performance assessment process.\n\n## CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nOur Board has adopted a Code of Conduct which is applicable to all employees, officers and directors, including our principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer  and  the  principal  accounting  officer  and  controller.  Our  Code  of Conduct  is  intended  to  meet  the  definition  of  'code  of  ethics'  under  the  SEC  rules  and  regulations.  We  intend  to disclose future amendments to certain provisions of our code of conduct, or waivers of these provisions, on our website or in public filings. We require all employees to complete training on our Code of Conduct, and, where permitted by law, also require certification by certain employees regarding compliance with the Code of Conduct. In addition, we maintain a global compliance hotline to allow for concerns of potential violations of the Code, global policies, or the law to be brought forward.\n\nOur Code of Conduct is posted on our website, (www.cnh.com), and may be found as follows: from our main page, first click on \"Our Company\", then on \"Governance\" and then on \"Code of Conduct\".\n\n## RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nCNH respects and promotes human rights in line with national laws, the fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.  In  addition  to  setting  out  principles  of  professional  conduct,  the  Company's  Code  of  Conduct  also underscores the importance of respect for the individual.\n\nThe  Company  is  committed  to  ensuring  respect  for  fundamental  human  rights  wherever  it  operates  and  seeks  to promote respect for these principles by others where it has an influence, particularly among contractors, suppliers, and other entities and individuals with whom it has a business relationship. The Company will not establish or continue a relationship with an entity or individual that refuses to respect the principles of its Code of Conduct.\n\n## COMMUNITY RELATIONS\n\nAs  stated  in  the  Code  of  Conduct,  CNH  is  aware  of  the  potential  direct  and  indirect  impact  of  its  decisions  on  the communities  in  which  it  operates.  For  this  reason,  the  Company  promotes  an  open  dialogue  to  ensure  that  the legitimate  expectations  of  local  communities  are  taken  into  consideration,  and  voluntarily  endorses  projects  and activities that encourage their economic, social, and cultural development. Moreover, CNH acts in a socially responsible manner by respecting the culture and traditions of each country, and by operating with integrity to earn the trust of the community.\n\nThe individual Segments or brands, in consultation with local management, decide which projects to support based on actual local needs, maximizing open dialogue with local stakeholders, and collecting their suggestions for improvement. They also decide whether to act directly or through partnerships with local institutions and organizations working in the social sphere.\n\nThe  CNH  Community  Investment  Policy,  available  on  the  Company's  website,  ensures  that  activities  are  managed consistently, identifying methods, and defining areas of application at a global level.\n\nIn addition, CNH strives to respond rapidly to the needs of people affected by natural disasters. The Company channels resources (vehicles and financial and technical support) to aid impacted communities, and coordinates employees who want to voluntarily assist in relief efforts.\n\n## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY\n\nThe Audit Committee has adopted a written Related Party Transactions Policy that governs reviewing, approving, or ratifying  all  related  person  transactions.  The  written  Related  Person  Transactions  Approval  Policy  applies  to:  (1) executive officers and directors of the Company; (2) any person or enterprise owing, directly, or indirectly an interest in the  voting  power  of  the  Company  that  gives  it  significant  influence  over  the  Company;  and  (3)  immediate  family members of anyone in category (1) or (2).\n\nEach year, our directors and executive officers complete questionnaires designed to elicit information about potential related  person  transactions.  In  addition,  the  directors  and  officers  must  promptly  advise  our  Chief  Legal  and Compliance  Officer  if  there  are  any  changes  to  the  information  they  previously  provided.  Transactions  deemed reasonably likely to be related person transactions are submitted to the Audit Committee for pre-approval at its next meeting.",

For this purpose, the Company has a robust Governance model, to manage all its operations in an ethical and transparent way. Sustainability in CNH is a way of doing business and it involves every area, function and employee within the organization.\n\nThe  main  tools  of  the  sustainability  management  system  are:  the  materiality  analysis,  which  defines  social  and environmental  priorities;  approximately  200  KPIs,  which  are  used  to  help  monitor  sustainability  performance;  the Sustainability Plan, which tracks commitments; and the annual Sustainability Report.\n\nFor further details  see  the  previous  section  on  'Our  Commitment to Sustainable Development and Long-term Value Creation'.\n\n## COMPLIANCE WITH DUTCH CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nWhile CNH endorses the principles and best practice provisions of the Dutch Code, its current corporate governance structure deviates from the following best practice provisions, only with respect to minor aspects as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Under best practice provision 5.1.3, the chairman of the management board should be an independent Director. CNH has adopted a one-tier governance structure with two Executive Directors and, in accordance with section 14(2)  of  the Articles  of Association,  the  Board  has  granted  to  them,  respectively,  the  title  of  'Chair'  and  'Chief Executive Officer'. The Board has entrusted to an independent Director the duties attributed by the Dutch Code to the chairman of the management board in one-tier companies (or to the chairman of the supervisory board in twotier  companies).  The  Board  has  granted  to  such  independent  Director  the  title  of  'Senior  Non-Executive Director' (so as to distinguish such Director from the Chairperson of the Company, who is an Executive Director). As a consequence, despite the difference in corporate titles, the Company believes it complies with best practice provision 5.1.3, as the current Senior Non-Executive Director satisfies the requirements described in best practice provision 5.1.3 of the Dutch Code.\n- \u25aa CNH deviates from best practice provision 2.3.4 in that the Senior Non-Executive Director (who is independent) is the  chairman  of  the  Human  Capital  and  Compensation  Committee,  whereas  the  Dutch  Code  provides  that  the person who chairs the board meeting should not assume the role of chairman of the remuneration committee. The Company believes that such duplication of role enhances the effectiveness of the Senior Non-Executive Director and is consistent with the intent of best practice provision 2.3.4.\n- \u25aa The Board has not appointed a vice-chairman in the sense of best practice provision 2.3.7 of the Dutch Code. Since  the  Company  adopted  a  one-tier  governance  structure  with  a  single  management  board  comprised  of Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors, the Board has granted the title of 'Chairperson' to one Executive Director and designated as 'Senior Non-Executive Director' one of the Non-Executive Directors. The Senior NonExecutive  Director  is  responsible  for  the  proper  functioning  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees.  Furthermore,  the Board  Regulations  provide  that  in  the  absence  of  the  Senior  Non-Executive  Director  any  other  Non-Executive Director chosen by a majority of the Directors present at a meeting shall preside at meetings of the Board. The Company considers the above sufficient to ensure that the role and function assigned by the Dutch Code to the vice-chairman is properly discharged.\n- \u25aa Pursuant  to  best  practice  provision  4.1.8  of  the  Dutch  Code,  every  Executive  and  Non-Executive  Director nominated  for  appointment  should  attend  the  Annual  General  Meeting  at  which  votes  will  be  cast  on  his/her nomination. Since, pursuant to the Articles of Association, the term of office of Directors is approximately one year, such period expiring on the day the first Annual General Meeting of Company shareholders is held in the following calendar year, all members of the Board are nominated for (re)appointment each year. By publishing the relevant biographical  details  and  curriculum  vitae  of  each  nominee  for  (re)appointment,  the  Company  ensures  that  the Company's general meeting of shareholders is well informed in respect of the nominees for (re)appointment and in practice only the Executive Directors, and Non-Executive Directors nominated for the first time for appointment to the Board, will therefore attend the Annual General Meeting.\n- \u25aa The Company does not have a retirement schedule as referred to in paragraph 2.2.4 of the Dutch Code. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the term of office of Directors is approximately one year, such period expiring on the day  the  first  Annual  General  Meeting  of  Company  shareholders  is  held  in  the  following  calendar  year.  This approach is in  line  with  the  general  practice  for  companies  listed  in  the  U.S.. As  the  Company  is  listed  on  the NYSE, it also relies on certain U.S. governance requirements and practices, one of which is the reappointment of Directors at each Annual General Meeting of Company shareholders.",

It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe results presented in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS and use the U.S. dollar as the presentation currency.\n\nCNH is a leading equipment and services company engaged in the design, production, marketing, sale, and financing of agricultural and construction equipment.\n\nDuring  2021,  CNH  completed  a  strategic  project  to  separate  the  Commercial  and  Specialty  Vehicles  business,  the Powertrain  business,  and  the  related  Financial  Services  business  (together  the  'Iveco  Group  Business')  from  the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (jurisdiche afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Demerger\"), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nSince  January  3,  2022  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  Iveco  Group  N.V.  have  been  quoted  separately  on  the  regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management and Board of Directors.\n\nFollowing the voluntary delisting of common shares from Euronext Milan and since January 2, 2024, CNH Industrial N.V. common stock is single listed on the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') under the symbol \"CNHI\".\n\nWe generate  revenues  and  cash  flows  principally  from  the  sale  of  equipment  to  dealers  and  distributors.  Financial Services provides a range of financial products focused on financing the sale and lease of equipment to our dealers and their customers.\n\nRevenues of Industrial Activities are presented net of discounts, allowances, settlement discounts and rebates, as well as  costs  for  sales  incentive  programs,  determined  on  the  basis  of  historical  costs,  country  by  country,  and  charged against profit for the period in which the corresponding sales are recognized. Our sales incentive programs may include the granting by Financial Services of retail financing at discounts to market interest rates. The corresponding cost to Industrial Activities is recognized at the time of the initial sale and the revenues of Financial Services are recognized on a pro rata basis in order to match the cost of funding.\n\n## PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS\n\nOur operating performance is highly correlated to sales volumes, which are influenced by several different factors that vary across our segments.\n\nFor Agriculture, the key factors influencing sales are the level of net farm income, which is influenced by commodity prices, and, to a lesser extent, general economic conditions, interest rates and the availability of financing and related subsidy programs. Variations by region and product are also attributable to differences in typical climate and farming calendars, as well as extraordinary weather conditions.\n\nFor  Construction,  segmentation  varies  by  regional  market:  in  developed  markets,  demand  is  oriented  toward  more sophisticated  machines  that  increase  operator  productivity,  while  in  developing  markets,  demand  is  oriented  toward more utilitarian models with greater perceived durability. Sales levels for heavy construction equipment are particularly dependent on the expected level of major infrastructure construction and repair projects, which is a function of expected economic growth and government spending. For light construction equipment, the principal factor influencing demand is the level of residential and commercial construction, remodeling and renovation, which is influenced in turn by interest rates  and  availability  of  financing,  as  well  as,  in  the  residential  sector,  levels  of  disposable  income  and,  in  the commercial sector, the broader economic cycle.\n\nDemand for services and service-related products, including parts, is a function of the nature and extent of the use of the  related  agricultural  and  construction  equipment.  The  after-sales  market  is  historically  less  volatile  than  the wholegoods market and, therefore, helps reduce the impact on operating results of fluctuations in new sales.\n\nOur cost base principally comprises the cost of raw materials and personnel costs.\n\nRaw material costs are closely linked to commodity markets and largely outside of our control, although we are making a targeted effort to increase procurement and production efficiencies. Historically, we have been able to pass on to our customers most of the increase in the cost of raw materials through increases in product pricing. Nevertheless, even when we are able to do so, there is usually a time lag between an increase in materials cost and a realized increase in",

        "page_content": "product  prices  and,  accordingly,  our  results  are  typically  adversely  affected  at  least  in  the  short-term  until  price increases are accepted in the market.\n\nPersonnel costs change over time and are impacted by the terms of collective bargaining agreements, inflation and average  number  of  employees. A  significant  proportion  of  our  employees  are  based  in  countries  where  labor  laws impose significant protection of employers' rights and, accordingly, we have limited ability to downsize our personnel in response to a decrease in production during periods of market downturn.\n\nOur results are also affected by changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period, mainly due to the difference in geographic distribution between our manufacturing activities and our commercial activities, resulting in cash flows from exports denominated in currencies that differ from those associated with production costs. In addition, our Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and are therefore subject to movements in exchange rates upon translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\n\nFinally, our results may be materially affected, directly or indirectly, by governmental policies, including monetary and fiscal policies and policies on international trade and investment.\n\n## Global Business Conditions\n\nIn  combination  with  the  economic  recovery  factors  and  repercussions  from  geopolitical  events,  the  global  economy continues  to  experience  volatile  disruptions  including  to  the  commodity,  labor  and  transportation  markets.  These disruptions have contributed to an inflationary environment which has affected, and may continue to affect, the price and availability of certain products and services necessary for the Company's operations. For example, the Company experienced supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures in 2022 and, while these trends improved in 2023, the Company continues to experience some disruptions. The reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to improved efficiencies in our manufacturing operations, but purchasing costs remain elevated.\n\nIn addition, the Company continues to monitor global economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from rising interest rates, fluctuating currency exchange rates, inflation and recession fears, on the Company's business, customers and suppliers.\n\nFor a discussion of the Company's risks and uncertainties, see section \"Risk Factors\".\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (OR 'NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES')\n\nCNH monitors its operations through the use of several non-GAAP financial measures. CNH's management believes that  these  non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its operating results and enhance the readers' ability  to  assess  CNH's  financial  performance  and  financial  position.  Management  uses  these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as to make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning under EU-IFRS or U.S. GAAP and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS or U.S. GAAP.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, CNH's non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:\n\n- \u25aa Adjusted  EBIT  of  Industrial  Activities  under  EU-IFRS: is  defined  as  profit/(loss)  before:  taxes,  Financial  Services' results,  Industrial  Activities'  financial  expenses,  restructuring  costs,  and  certain  non-recurring  items.

This increase is primarily due to favorable price realization.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales were $18,604 million in 2023 compared to $18,167 million in 2022. As a percentage of net revenues, cost of sales of Industrial Activities was 76.2% in 2023 (77.9% in 2022), as a result of favorable price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing and purchasing costs. In 2022, these costs included $49 million of asset write-downs and financial receivable allowances as a result of the suspension of operations in Russia.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") costs were $1,782 million in 2023 (7.3% of net revenues) compared to $1,678 million in 2022 (7.1% of net revenues). The year over year increase is primarily due to increased labor costs. In 2022, these costs also included $11 million in write-downs due to the suspension of operations in Russia.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nIn 2023, research and development ('R&D') costs were $1,012 million (compared to $881 million in 2022) and included all  R&D  costs  not  recognized  as  assets  in  the  year  amounting  to  $841  million  ($698  million  in  2022)  and  the amortization of capitalized development cost of $171 million ($183 million in 2022). During 2023, CNH capitalized new expenditures for development costs for $210 million ($175 million in 2022). The costs in both periods were primarily attributable to continued investment in new products, technologies and digital solutions.\n\n## Result from investments\n\nResult from investments was a net gain of $185 million in 2023 and a net gain of $108 million in 2022, respectively, primarily realized form our joint ventures.\n\n## Gains/(losses) on disposal of investments\n\nLosses on disposal of investments were $21 million in 2023 and nil in 2022, respectively.",

In both periods, this item primarily included legal  costs,  indirect  taxes  and  the  benefit  cost  for  former  employees.  In 2023,  this  item  also  included  a  gain  of  $13 million in relation to the fair value remeasurement of previously held investments in Augmenta and Bennamann.\n\nIn 2022, this item included $22 million ($54 million after-tax) of loss on the sale of the Raven Engineered Films and Aerostar  divisions,  net  of  income  from  the  Raven  businesses  held  for  sale  during  the  period,  separation  costs  in connection with the spin-off of the On-Highway business of $25 million and a $65 million gain from the sale of a facility in Canada.\n\n## Financial income/(expenses)\n\nNet  financial  expenses  were  $194  million  in  2023  compared  to  $177  million  in  2022.  The  increase  was  primarily attributable to higher negative foreign exchange impact, partially offset by an increase in interest income on cash due to higher rate and higher intersegment.\n\n## Income tax benefit (expense)\n\n| ($ million)          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before taxes  | 2,927  | 2,635  |\n| Income tax (expense) | (600)  | (758)  |\n| Effective tax rate   | 20.5 % | 28.8 % |\n\nIn 2023, CNH income taxes were an expense of $600 million, based on CNH's profit before taxes of $2,927 million, compared to an income tax expense of $758 million in 2022. The effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were 20.5% and 28.8%, respectively.\n\nThe 2023 tax rate was reduced by the recognition of $80 million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.K., a lower share of consolidated earnings in higher taxing jurisdictions compared to the prior year, higher credits and incentives, and tax benefits related to the sale of CNH Industrial Russia, partially offset by discrete tax expense.\n\nIn 2022, income taxes were an expense of $758 million with an effective tax rate of 28.8%. The Company's 2022 tax rate was increased by greater profitability in high-tax jurisdictions as a percent of total profit, tax expenses associated with  the  disposition  of  Raven's  Engineered  Films  and  Aerostar  Divisions,  and  additional  reserves  for  uncertain  tax positions.\n\nThe Company's tax rate in 2022 was reduced by $5 million related to recognizing deferred tax assets associated with the Company's operations in Italy.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of  reported  profits  (Pillar  Two)  that  has  been  agreed  upon  in  principle  by  over  140  countries.  During  2023,  many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws. The Company continues to monitor developments in the Pillar Two legislation and is working to evaluate the impacts of this legislation on its longerterm financial position.\n\n## Profit/(loss)\n\nNet profit was $2,327 million in 2023 (net profit of $1,877 million in 2022). In 2023, net profit also includes a loss of $23 million on the sale of CNH Industrial Russia and CNH Capital Russia and restructuring costs of $65 million, partially offset by a gain of $13 million in relation to the fair value remeasurement of previously held investments in Augmenta and Bennamann.\n\nIn 2022, net profit was $1,877 million and included $22 million ($54 million after-tax) of loss on the sale of the Raven Engineered Films and Aerostar Divisions, net of income from the Raven businesses held for sale during the period, a charge of $72 million related to asset write-downs, financial receivable allowances and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets as a result of the suspension of operations in Russia, separation costs in connection with the spin-off of the On-Highway business of $25 million ($24 million after-tax), restructuring costs of $34 million and a gain of $65 million from the sale of our Canada parts depot.",

        "page_content": "## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nOur operations are capital intensive and subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for dealer receivables and  dealer  and  company  inventories.  Whenever  necessary,  funds  from  operating  activities  are  supplemented  from external sources. CNH, focuses on cash preservation and leveraging its good access to funding in order to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. See section 'Risk Factors' for additional information concerning risks related to our business, strategy and operations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nThe cash flows, funding requirements and liquidity of CNH are managed on a standard and centralized basis. This centralized system is designed to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of our management of capital resources.\n\nOur  subsidiaries  participate  in  a  company-wide  cash  management  system,  which  we  operate  in  a  number  of jurisdictions. Under this system, the cash balances of our subsidiaries are aggregated at the end of each business day to central pooling accounts. The centralized treasury management offers financial and systems expertise in managing these accounts, as well as providing related services and consulting to our business segments.\n\nOur policy is to keep a high degree of flexibility with our funding and investment options in order to maintain our desired level of liquidity to achieve our rating targets while improving the Group capital structure over time. In managing our liquidity  requirements,  we  are  pursuing  a  financing  strategy  that  aims  at  extending  over  time  our  Industrial Activities debt profile by issuing long-term bonds and retiring short-term debt through opportunistic transactions, deleveraging our Industrial Activities balance sheet by reducing gross debt, and diversifying funding sources.\n\nA summary of our strategy is set forth below:\n\n- \u25aa Industrial Activities  sells  certain  of  its  receivables  to  Financial  Services  and  relies  on  internal  cash  flows  including managing  working  capital  to  fund  its  near-term  financing  requirements.  We  will  also  supplement  our  short-term financing by drawing on existing or new facilities with banks.\n- \u25aa To the extent funding needs of Industrial Activities are determined to be of a longer-term nature, we will access public debt  markets  as  well  as  private  investors  and  banks,  as  appropriate,  to  refinance  borrowings  and  replenish  our liquidity.\n- \u25aa Financial Services' funding strategy is to maintain sufficient liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments. While we expect securitizations and sale of receivables (factoring) to continue to represent a material portion of our capital structure and intersegment borrowings to remain a marginal source of funding, we will continue to diversify our funding sources and expand our investor base within Financial Services to support our investment grade  credit  ratings.  These  diversified  funding  sources  include  secured  and  unsecured  facilities,  a  repurchase agreement, commercial paper and unsecured notes.\n\nOn a global level, we will continue to evaluate alternatives to ensure that Financial Services has access to capital on favorable  terms  to  support  its  business,  including  agreements  with  global  or  regional  partners,  new  funding arrangements or a combination of the foregoing. Our access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of financing, is dependent on various factors, including our credit ratings.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, Fitch Ratings raised its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (\"IDR\") on CNH Industrial N.V. to 'BBB+' from 'BBB-'. Fitch also upgraded CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A.'s senior unsecured rating to 'BBB+' from 'BBB-'. The Outlook is stable. On January 7, 2022, Fitch upgraded the Long-Term IDR and senior long-term debt ratings of CNH Industrial Capital LLC and CNH Industrial Capital Canada Ltd. to 'BBB+' from 'BBB-'. The outlook is stable. Fitch has also upgraded CNH Industrial Capital LLC's short-term IDR and commercial paper ratings to 'F2' from 'F3'.\n\nOn  February  25,  2022,  Moody's  upgraded  the  senior  unsecured  ratings  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  its  supported subsidiaries including CNH Industrial Capital LLC, CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A., CNH Industrial Capital Australia Pty.  Ltd.  and  CNH  Industrial  Capital  Canada  Ltd.  to  Baa2  from  Baa3.  At  the  same  time,  Moody's  withdrew  CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. short term rating of (P)P-3. The rating outlook is stable.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, Standard & Poor's (\"S&P\") Global Ratings raised its long-term issuer credit ratings on CNH Industrial N.V. and its subsidiary, CNH Industrial Capital LLC, to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. S&P Global Ratings also affirmed the 'A-2' short-term issuer credit rating. Additionally, S&P Global Ratings raised the issue-level ratings on CNH Industrial N.V.  and  its  industrial  subsidiaries'  debt,  as  well  as  the  issue-level  ratings  on  CNH  Industrial  Capital  LLC's  senior unsecured debt, to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. The outlook is stable.",

Ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. A  deterioration  in  our  ratings  could  impair  our  ability  to  obtain  debt  financing  and  would  increase  the  cost  of  such financing. Ratings are influenced by a number of factors, including, among others: financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers, the composition of the balance sheet and/or capital structure, material changes in earnings trends and volatility, ability to dividend monies from subsidiaries and our competitive position. Material deterioration in any one, or a combination, of these factors could result in a downgrade of our ratings, thus increasing the cost, and limiting the availability, of financing.\n\n## Debt\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our consolidated Debt was as detailed in the following table:\n\n| ($ million)   | Consolidated       | Consolidated       | Industrial Activities   | Industrial Activities   | Financial Services   | Financial Services   |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|               | December 31,  2023 | December 31,  2022 | December 31,  2023      | December 31,  2022      | December 31,  2023   | December 31,  2022   |\n| Debt          | (28,255)           | (23,652)           | (4,770)                 | (5,252)                 | (24,344)             | (19,385)             |\n\nWe believe that Net Cash/(Debt), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the section \"Alternative performance measures (or 'Non-GAAP financial measures')\", of section \"General\" above, is a useful analytical metric for measuring our effective borrowing requirements. We provide a separate analysis of Net Cash/(Debt) of Industrial Activities and Net (Cash)/Debt of Financial Services to reflect the different cash flow management practices in the two activities.

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Industrial Activities\n\n## Capital Markets\n\nAt December 31, 2023, we had an aggregate amount of $9.4 billion in bonds outstanding, of which $4.0 billion was issued by Industrial Activities.\n\nThe  capital  markets  debt  of  Industrial  Activities  mainly  related  to  notes  issued  under  the  Euro  Medium  Term  Note Programme (and  the  notes  issued  under  its  predecessor,  the  Global  Medium  Term  Notes  Programme),  and  senior unsecured debt securities issued by CNH Industrial N.V. described below.\n\nEuro Medium Term Note (\"EMTN\") Programme . We have a medium-term note programme allowing for the placement of  debt  securities  up  to  a  total  authorized  amount  of  \u20ac10  billion  ($11  billion). At  December  31,  2023,  \u20ac3,200  million ($3,537 million) was outstanding under the programme, all such debt having been issued by CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. and guaranteed by CNH Industrial N.V..\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes . In the United States, CNH Industrial N.V has issued notes from time to time. In 2016, CNH Industrial N.V. issued $600 million of notes at an interest rate of 4.50% due August 2023 (the '2023 Notes') at an issue price of 100 percent of their principal amount, and, in 2017, CNH Industrial N.V. issued $500 million of notes at an interest rate of 3.850% due November 2027 (the '2027 Notes') at an issue price of 99.384% of their principal amount. The 2023 Notes and the 2027 Notes are collectively referred to as the 'CNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes' On August 15,  2023,  the  Company  paid  off  the  2023  Notes  in  cash  on  the  scheduled  due  date  by  utilizing  available  liquid resources.\n\nThe notes issued under the EMTN (and its predecessor the Global Medium Term Notes Programme) as well as the CNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes impose covenants and other obligations on CNH Industrial N.V. as issuer and, in certain cases, as guarantor and CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. as issuer, including: (i) a negative pledge provision which requires that, if any security interest over assets of the issuer or the guarantor is granted in connection with debt that  is,  or  is  capable  of  being,  listed  or  any  guarantee  is  granted  in  connection  with  such  debt,  such  security  or guarantee must be equally and ratably extended to the outstanding notes; (ii) a status (or pari passu ) covenant, under which  the  notes  rank  and  will  rank pari  passu with  all  other  present  and  future  outstanding  unsubordinated  and unsecured obligations of the issuer and/or the guarantor (subject to mandatorily preferred obligations under applicable laws); (iii) an events of default provision setting out certain customary events (such as cross defaults, insolvency related events, etc.) the occurrence of which entitles the holders of the outstanding notes to accelerate the repayment of the notes; (iv) change of control provisions which, when combined with a rating downgrade of CNH Industrial N.V., grant the note holders the right to require immediate repayment of the notes; and (v) other clauses that are generally applicable to  securities  of  a  similar  type.  A  breach  of  these  obligations  may  require  the  early  repayment  of  the  notes.  At December  31,  2023,  CNH  was  in  compliance  with  the  covenants  of  the  notes  issued  under  the  EMTN  (and  its predecessor the Global Medium Term Notes Programme) and the CNH Industrial N.V. Senior Notes.\n\nCNH intends to repay the issued bonds in cash at the due date by utilizing available liquid resources. In addition, CNH may from time to time repurchase or enforce the available call options of issued bonds. Such repurchases, if made, depend upon market conditions, the financial situation of CNH and other factors which could affect such decisions.\n\n## Bank Debt\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  Industrial  Activities  available  committed  unsecured  facilities  expiring  after  twelve  months amounted to $5.4 billion ($4.5 billion at December 31, 2022).\n\nEuro  4  billion  Revolving  Credit  Facility.

CNH exercised the first of the two extension options as of February 28, 2020 and the second extension option as of February 26, 2021. The facility is now due to mature in March 2026 for \u20ac3,950.5 million; \u20ac49.5 million within the facility will mature in March 2025 . The credit facility replaced a five-year \u20ac1.75 billion credit facility scheduled to mature in 2021 and includes:\n\n- \u25aa customary  covenants  (including  a  negative  pledge,  a  status  (or pari  passu )  covenant  and  restrictions  on  the incurrence of indebtedness by certain subsidiaries);\n- \u25aa customary events of default (some of which are subject to minimum thresholds and customary mitigants), including cross-default provisions, failure to pay amounts due or to comply with certain provisions under the loan agreement and the occurrence of certain bankruptcy-related events; and:\n- \u25aa mandatory prepayment obligations upon a change in control of CNH or the borrower;\n- \u25aa a financial covenant (Net debt/EBITDA ratio relating to Industrial Activities) (this covenant is not applicable given the current ratings levels).\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. has guaranteed any borrowings under the revolving credit facility with cross-guarantees from each of the borrowers ( i.e. , CNH Industrial Finance S.p.A., CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. and CNH Industrial Finance North America Inc.). At December 31, 2023, CNH was in compliance with the covenants of the Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nCNH entered into an 18-month committed unsecured credit facility on December 19, 2023, was undrawn at December 31, 2023 and was fully drawn on January 12, 2024.\n\n## Financial Services\n\nTotal debt of Financial Services was $24.3 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $19.4 billion at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Asset-Backed Financing\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Financial Services' committed asset-backed facilities expiring after twelve months amounted to $3.7 billion ($2.9 billion at December 31, 2022), of which $3.7 billion was utilized at December 31, 2023, ($2.1 billion at December 31, 2022).\n\nWe sell certain of our financial receivables to third parties in order to improve liquidity, to take advantage of market opportunities  and,  in  certain  circumstances,  to  reduce  credit  and  concentration  risk  in  accordance  with  our  risk management objectives.\n\nThe sale of financial receivables is executed primarily through ABS transactions and involves retail notes and wholesale receivables originated to our Financial Services subsidiaries from end-use customers and dealers, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, our receivables from financing activities included receivables sold and financed through both ABS and factoring transactions of $14.1 billion ($12.6 billion at December 31, 2022), which do not meet derecognition requirements and therefore are recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position. These receivables are recognized  as  such  in  our  financial  statements  even  though  they  have  been  legally  sold;  a  corresponding  financial liability  is  recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position as debt (see Note 18 'Current receivables and Other current financial assets' to our Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Repurchase Agreement\n\nIn September 2023, CNH Industrial Capital LLC entered into a Global Master Repurchase Agreement which expires in September 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company had CAD 299.9 million ($226.3 million) outstanding under the repurchase  agreement,  with  an  obligation  to  repurchase  the  underlying  receivables  in  30  days.  The  repurchase agreement is treated as a financing arrangement for accounting purposes.\n\n## Capital Markets\n\nIn April 2022, Banco CNH Industrial Capital S.A. issued BRL 600 million of notes in two tranches: BRL 177 million at CDI + 0.90%, due in 2024 and BRL 423 million at CDI +1.10%, due in 2025.\n\nIn May 2022, Banco CNH Industrial Capital S.A. issued BRL 350 million of notes at CDI +1.10%, due in 2025, through a private placement.\n\nIn  May  2022,  CNH  Industrial  Capital  LLC  issued  USD  500  million  of  3.95%  notes  due  in  2025  at  an  issue  price  of 99.469% of their principal amount.\n\nIn  September 2022, Banco CNH Industrial Capital S.A. issued BRL 700 million of notes in three tranches: BRL 268 million at CDI + 0.90%, due in 2024; BRL 193 million at CDI +1.05%, due in 2025; and BRL 239 million at CDI +1.30%, due in 2026.\n\nIn October 2022, CNH Industrial Capital LLC issued USD 400 million of 5.45% notes due in 2025 at an issue price of 99.349% of their principal amount.",

The support agreement is not intended to be, and is not, a guarantee by CNH Industrial N.V. of the indebtedness or other obligations  of  CNH  Industrial  Capital  LLC.  The  obligations  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  to  CNH  Industrial  Capital  LLC pursuant to this support agreement are to the company only and do not run to, and are not enforceable directly by, any creditor of CNH Industrial Capital LLC, including holders of the CNH Industrial Capital LLC's notes or the trustee under the indenture governing the notes. The support agreement may be modified, amended or terminated, at CNH Industrial N.V.'s  election,  upon  thirty  days'  prior  written  notice  to  CNH  Industrial  Capital  LLC  and  the  rating  agencies  of  CNH Industrial  Capital  LLC,  if  (a)  the  modification,  amendment  or  termination  would  not  result  in  a  downgrade  of  CNH Industrial Capital LLC rated indebtedness; (b) the modification, amendment or notice of termination provides that the support agreement will continue in effect with respect to the company's rated indebtedness then outstanding; or (c) CNH Industrial Capital LLC has no long-term rated indebtedness outstanding.\n\nFor more information on our outstanding indebtedness, see Note 24 'Debt' to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Future Liquidity\n\nWe have adopted formal policies and decision-making processes designed to optimize the allocation of funds, cash management processes and financial risk management. Our liquidity needs could increase in the event of an extended economic slowdown or recession that would reduce our cash flow from operations and impair the ability of our dealers and retail customers to meet their payment obligations. Any reduction of our credit ratings would increase our cost of funding and potentially limit our access to the capital markets and other sources of financing.",

        "page_content": "We believe that funds available under our current liquidity facilities, those realized under existing and planned assetbacked securitization programs and issuances of debt securities and those expected from ordinary course refinancing of existing credit facilities, together with cash provided by operating activities, will allow us to satisfy our debt service requirements  for  the  coming  year. At  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  had  available  committed,  unsecured  facilities expiring after twelve months of $5.9 billion ($5.1 billion at December 31, 2022).\n\nFinancial  Services  securitized  debt  is  repaid  with  the  cash  generated  by  the  underlying  amortizing  receivables. Accordingly,  additional  liquidity  is  not  normally  necessary  for  the  repayment  of  such  debt.  Financial  Services  has traditionally relied upon the term ABS market and committed asset-backed facilities as a primary source of funding and liquidity.  At  December  31,  2023,  Financial  Services'  committed  asset-backed  facilities  expiring  after  twelve  months amounted to $3.7 billion ($2.9 billion at December 31, 2022), of which $3.7 billion at December 31, 2023 ($2.1 billion at December 31, 2022) were utilized.\n\nIf  Financial  Services  were  unable  to  obtain ABS  funding  at  competitive  rates  and  at  the  same  time  were  unable  to access  other  sources  of  finding  at  similar  conditions,  its  ability  to  conduct  its  financial  services  activities  would  be limited.\n\n## Pension and Other Post-employment Benefits\n\n## Pension Plans\n\nPension plan obligations  primarily  comprise  the  obligations  of  our  pension  plans  in  the  United  States,  the  U.K.  and Germany.\n\nUnder these plans, contributions are made to a separate fund (trust) which independently administers the plan assets. Our funding policy is to contribute amounts to the plan equal to the amounts required to satisfy the minimum funding requirements pursuant to the laws of the applicable jurisdictions. The significant pension plans that we are required to fund are in the United Sates and the U.K.. In addition, we make discretionary contributions in addition to the funding requirements. To the extent that a fund is overfunded, we are not required to make further contributions to the plan in respect of minimum performance requirements so long as the fund is in surplus.\n\nThe investment strategy for the plan assets depends on the features of the plan and on the maturity of the obligations. Typically,  less  mature  plan  benefit  obligations  are  funded  by  using  more  equity  securities  as  they  are  expected  to achieve long-term growth exceeding inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded using more fixed income securities as they are expected to produce current income with limited volatility. Risk management practices include the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers within each asset class for diversification purposes. Specific guidelines for each asset class and investment manager are implemented and monitored.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the difference between the present value of the pension plan obligations and the fair value of the related plan assets was a deficit of $243 million and $225 million, respectively. In 2023, we contributed $46 million to the plan assets and made direct benefit payments of $12 million for our pension plans. Our expected total contribution to pension plan assets and direct benefit payments is estimated to be $46 million for 2024.\n\n## Healthcare Plans\n\nHealthcare postretirement benefit plan obligations comprise obligations for healthcare and insurance plans granted to our employees working in the United States and Canada. These plans generally cover employees retiring on or after reaching  the  age  of  55  who  have  completed  at  least  10  years  of  employment.  United  States  salaried  and  nonrepresented hourly employees and Canadian employees hired after January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, respectively, are not eligible for postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits under our plans. These plans are not required to be funded. Beginning in 2007, we made contributions on a voluntary basis to a separate and independently managed fund established to finance the North America healthcare plans.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the difference between the present value of the healthcare plan obligations and the fair  value  of  the  related  plan  assets was a deficit of $121 million and $123 million, respectively. In 2023, we did not contribute to the plan assets and made direct benefit payments for healthcare plans of $19 million and we expect to make direct benefit payments of $16 million in 2024.\n\n## Other Post-employment Benefits\n\nOther  post-employment  benefits  consist  of  benefits  for  Italian  Employee  Leaving  Entitlements  up  to  December  31, 2006, loyalty bonus in Italy and various other similar plans in France, Germany and Belgium. Until December 31, 2006, Italian  companies with more than 50 employees were required to accrue for benefits paid to employees upon them leaving the company. The scheme has since changed to a defined contribution plan. The obligation on our consolidated balance  sheet  represents  the  residual  reserve  for  years  until  December  31,  2006.  Loyalty  bonuses  are  accrued  for employees who have reached certain service seniority and are generally settled when employees leave the company. These plans are not required to be funded and, therefore, have no plan assets.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the present value of the obligation for other post-employment benefits amounted to $66 million and $60 million, respectively.",

Our arrangements are described in more detail below. For additional information, see Note 27 'Commitments and contingencies' to the CNH Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Financial Guarantees\n\nOur financial guarantees require us to make contingent payments upon the occurrence of certain events or changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset, a liability or the equity of the guaranteed party. These guarantees include arrangements that are direct obligations, giving the party receiving the guarantee a direct claim against us, as well as indirect obligations, under which we have agreed to provide the funds necessary for another party to satisfy an obligation. CNH provided guarantees on the debt or commitments of third parties and performance guarantees on nonconsolidated affiliates, totaling $37 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments with definitive payment terms that will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of December 31, 2023:\n\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\n\n|                               | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2023          | At December 31, 2023           | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| ($ million)                   | within one  year       | between one  and three  years | between  three and five  years | beyond five  years     | Total                  |\n| Contractual obligations (1)   |                        |                               |                                |                        |                        |\n| Debt obligations: (2)         |                        |                               |                                |                        |                        |\n| Bonds                         | 2,043                  | 4,361                         | 1,848                          | 1,122                  | 9,374                  |\n| Borrowings from banks         | 2,408                  | 740                           | 634                            | 612                    | 4,394                  |\n| Asset-backed financing        | 5,795                  | 4,660                         | 1,199                          | 68                     | 11,722                 |\n| Other debt (3)                | 1,741                  | 469                           | 255                            | -                      | 2,465                  |\n| Total Debt obligations        | 11,987                 | 10,230                        | 3,936                          | 1,802                  | 27,955                 |\n| Undiscounted lease payments   | 86                     | 121                           | 71                             | 73                     | 351                    |\n| Purchase obligations          | 207                    | -                             | -                              | -                      | 207                    |\n| Total Contractual obligations | 12,280                 | 10,351                        | 4,007                          | 1,875                  | 28,513                 |\n\n## Debt Obligations\n\nFor information on our debt obligations, see 'Capital Resources' above and Note 24 'Debt' to the CNH Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe amount reported as Total Debt obligations in the table above consists of our bonds, borrowings from banks, assetbacked  financing  and  other  debt,  which  can  be  reconciled  to  the  amount  in  the  December  31,  2023  consolidated statement of financial position as follows:\n\n|                                                                    |      | At December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------------------------|\n| ($ million)                                                        | Note |                        |\n| Debt reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position | (24) | 28,255                 |\n| Less: Lease liabilities                                            | (24) | (300)                  |\n| Total Debt obligations                                             |      | 27,955                 |\n\n## Undiscounted Lease Payments\n\nOur assets under lease agreements consist mainly of industrial buildings and plant, machinery and equipment used in our businesses.

Headwinds  from  a  slowing  agriculture  cycle,  higher  interest  rates,  and commodity  price  fluctuations  created  lower  demand  in  some  key  markets,  especially  in  South  America.  Given  these conditions, the Company has been proactive in taking actions to drive cost reductions in the production system, initiated a comprehensive  reduction  plan  to  reduce  selling,  general,  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses,  and  drove  margin expansion  through  disciplined  commercial  execution.  Tireless  efforts  to  simplify  the  company,  expand  through-cycle margins, and integrate world-class technology with great iron drives operational excellence. Furthermore, the Company prioritized  investments  in  quality  improvement  and  network  development.  Even  in  this  challenging  year,  the  Company returned an unprecedented $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nThe Company also continues to integrate recent acquisitions and is sustaining elevated investments in R&D relative to prior  years,  seeking  to  further  its  technological  advancements  and  reaffirm  a  commitment  to  digital  integration  and enhancement. The Company launched 72 new products in 2023 and won several significant industry awards including the only Gold Innovation Medal at Agritechnica, seven AE50 awards from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, and four Good Design awards. Additionally, the Company placed in the top 5% of over 9,000 companies rated in S&P's Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment and took second place overall in the Dow Jones World Index in the machinery and electric component category.\n\nOver the last three years, under the leadership of CEO Scott Wine, the Company has achieved strong revenue growth (80th percentile) and net income (90th percentile) relative to companies in both the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Industrials indexes.  The  Company's  rating  was  also  raised  in  2023  to  BBB+  by  S&P  Global  Ratings.  These  results,  and  the momentum  generated  for  future  business  cycles,  position  the  Company  to  continue  creating  value  for  shareholders, dealers, end customers, and team members.",

He held 100% of the 289,119 shares that vested in 2022 and the 289,120 shares that vested in 2023 from LTI grants, electing to pay 1.98 million in cash to cover tax withholding in lieu of selling shares in both 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn December 2023, he invested an additional $5.54 million under the company's nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The  Company's  share  ownership  guidelines  and  executive  compensation  practices  ensure  that  this  alignment  with shareholders' interests will continue over time. Mr. Wine's share ownership significantly exceeds the threshold required by the guidelines, and investment of his own money in the Company's stock demonstrates the alignment between Mr. Wine's and the shareholders' interests during his tenure.",

The policies also reflect the global nature of the executive leadership team and are designed to align with local market norms where relevant.",

The directors are responsible for oversight of executive compensation, the Company's remuneration policy, compensation of non-executive directors, and broader human capital management matters, in accordance with Dutch laws and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the \"DCGC\").\n\nIn undertaking its role, the HCC Committee has continued interaction with the CEO, Executive Chair, and other members of the Global Leadership Team, including the Chief Human Resources Officer (the \"CHRO\") and Head of Total Rewards. No  individual  is  present  when  the  HCC  Committee  considers  and  discusses  matters  concerning  such  individual's compensation. The Company also engages a compensation consultant, WTW, who routinely provides support to the HCC Committee upon request, across a broad range of compensation matters, inclusive of peer group development, market benchmarking,  and  incentive  compensation  design.  The  HCC  Committee  invites  WTW  to  attend  meetings  at  the Committee's discretion.\n\n## Use of Market Data\n\nThe  Company  periodically  benchmarks  its  executive  and  NEO  compensation  programs  utilizing  a  pre-approved  peer group.  In  2022,  the  HCC  Committee  approved  a  revised  peer  group,  reflective  of  CNH's  size  and  primary  industry classification  (the  '2022  Compensation  Peer  Group'). The  Company  has  retained  the  same  peer  group  for  2023  (the '2023 Compensation Peer Group').\n\nAlthough CNH is headquartered in the U.K., the U.S. market has a prominent impact on the business. This is evidenced by a strong commercial presence in the U.S., robust returns generated by such presence, a high concentration of peer companies and competitors in the U.S., relevant talent  markets,  and  nationalities  represented  in  the  leadership  team. Accordingly, the compensation peer group appropriately reflects this reality.\n\nAs in  2022,  the  2023  Compensation  Peer  Group  is  comprised  of  a  combination  of  companies  based  in  the  U.S.  and Europe with a view to positioning CNH around the median of key financial scoping criteria, primarily revenue and market capitalization. When the current Compensation Peer Group was approved by the HCC Committee in 2022, the Company ranked  at  the  46 th percentile  on  projected  2022  revenue,  and  the  38 th percentile  on  market  capitalization  amongst  its peers.",

Similar  principals  are  used  in  identifying  survey  peers based on size and industry applicability.  In  assessing  compensation  levels,  the  Company  primarily  references  median figures, considering various factors, such as location, scope of role, and experience in setting individual NEO pay relative to median.\n\n## Compensation Risk\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining and enhancing a culture focused on integrity and accountability. The Company has  adopted  several  policies,  including  those  detailed  below,  that  reflect  organizational  culture  and  compensation principles of aligning executives' interests with long-term shareholder value creation and encouraging prudent risk taking. Additionally,  the  compensation  tool  used  to  allocate  and  distribute  bonus  and  LTI  awards  to  participants  has  internal safeguards,  like  preventative  budget  caps  for  teams  and  functions,  to  provide  live  audits  of  compensation  practices. Furthermore, an internal risk analysis analyzing multiple variable compensation components was completed and validated for  thoroughness  by  an  external  consultant,  and  control  procedures  have  been  reviewed  and  validated  by  external auditors.  We  have  concluded  that  CNH's  executive  compensation  policies  and  practices  do  not  create  risks  that  are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n## Share Ownership Requirements\n\nNEOs are subject to robust stock ownership guidelines, which require them to build up an interest in CNH stock over time as summarized below.\n\n| Minimum                   | CEO: five-times base salary with an interim milestone of two and a half-times base salary as of December 31, 2022                                                     |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Requirements              | Other NEOs: three-times base salary                                                                                                                                   |\n| Time Horizon              | Within five years of policy implementation (2021) or a NEO's date of appointment as applicable                                                                        |\n| Covered  Equity Interests | Beneficially owned shares or shares in which the executive has a beneficial interest, e.g., owned by a spouse Unvested awards do not count towards the requirement    |\n| Retention  Requirement    | The CEO must hold vested shares for five years from grant date Other NEO's must hold 50% of net shares following vesting until the share ownership requirement is met |\n\nAt the end of 2023, all NEOs were progressing towards their share ownership requirement within the permitted five-year time horizon or in compliance with their respective share ownership requirement.",

Equity incentives support the Company's long-term strategy and recognize the NEOs' leadership and achievement of strategic objectives. Since 2022, the Company grants equity awards on an annual basis, whereas awards granted in and prior to 2021 were made on a 'front-loaded' basis, meaning awards were generally made once every three years. This change was made in response to shareholder feedback, to better align our design with competitive market norms, to enhance the retention impact of awards, and to maximize alignment with strategic priorities. Equity is delivered in a combination of PSUs and RSUs, both of which are subject to the terms of the Compensation Recovery Policy.

(the \"Iveco Group\") separated under Dutch law as a demerger (the \"Demerger\"), splitting into the Off-Highway Business (Agriculture, Construction, and related Financial Services business) and  On-Highway  Business  (Commercial  and  Specialty  Vehicles,  Powertrain,  and  related  Financial  Services  business) respectively. As a result of the Demerger, the performance period of the 2021-2023 PSU awards spans pre- and postDemerger periods. The HCC Committee realigned the performance conditions for the proportional post-Demerger CNH scope  of  business  operations  only.  The  HCC  Committee  sought  to  ensure  that  the  performance  goals  remained challenging and reflected the same degree of stretch after the perimeter adjustment.\n\nThe 2021 PSU awards were subject to a different performance matrix than the one used for the 2023 PSUs, assessing Cumulative  Adjusted  Diluted  EPS,  Average  Industrial  RoIC,  and  a  Cumulative  Relative  TSR  modifier.  To  reflect  the Demerger, the HCC Committee approved updated Adjusted Diluted EPS and Industrial RoIC goals to simply reflect the Company's contributions to the original pre-Demerger targets. In addition, the HCC Committee determined that the TSR component would be assessed relative to the original peer group for 2021 performance, and the updated peer group disclosed  in  respect  of  the  2022  PSUs  for  the  remaining  two  years  of  the  performance  period.  The  resulting  modifier would  be  weighted  one-third  based  on  2021  performance  and  two-thirds  based  on  2022  -  2023  performance  when determining a final outcome.",

Mr. Neilson participates in the CNH Pension Scheme (the 'Scheme') in which all salaried U.K. employees hired prior to December 31, 2002, participate in. The Scheme was closed to future service accruals from January 31, 2020.\n\nThe following table shows the present value of accumulated benefit using assumptions consistent with the Company's financial disclosure on the Scheme.\n\n| NEO & Position                       | Plan Name          |   Number of Years  Credited Service (1) | Present Value of  Accumulated Benefit (2)   | Payments During  Last Fiscal Year   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Derek Neilson President, Agriculture | CNH Pension Scheme |                                    22.8 | \u00a31,002,739                                  | \u00a3 0                                 |\n\n| Features of the Scheme           | Definition/Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Form of Benefit                  | Lifetime benefit begins at retirement based on individual's service and salary.

All such defined contribution plans are tax-qualified plans. The U.S. based NEOs, Messrs. Wine and  Kermisch  also  participate  in  a  nonqualified  deferred  compensation  plan  for  limits  over  the  tax-qualified  plans,  as described in the 'Nonqualified Deferred Compensation' section. Mr. Neilson receives supplemental contributions over the tax-qualified limits which are paid to him directly for his own personal retirement savings.",

Similar deferred compensation benefits are commonly offered by U.S. companies with which we compete for talent. Mr. Wine participates in the Company Deferred Compensation Plan. Mr. Kermisch elected not to participate in the Company Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n## Key Features of the Company Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n## Contributions\n\nEligible  participants  may  elect  annually  to  tax  defer  up  to  90%  of  their  salary  and  eligible  bonus  and  also  elect supplemental contributions over the qualified plan limits under the Company's U.S. Retirement Plan (a 401(k) plan).\n\nThere are two types of supplemental contributions under the Company Deferred Compensation Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Elective Deferrals, also called Excess 401(k) Contributions (made by employees)\n- \u00b7 Employer Matching Contributions (Company matching contributions on Excess 401(k) contributions)\n\nElective Deferrals : Once the participant has reached the elective deferral limit in the Company U.S. Retirement Savings Plan,  supplemental  tax-deferred  contributions  (Excess  401(k)  Contributions)  are  credited  to  their  Company  Deferred Compensation Plan account for the remainder of the year.\n\nEmployer  Matching  Contributions :  Supplemental  Employer  Matching  Contributions  are  made  based  on  Excess  401(k) Contributions. The participant must complete a year of eligibility service to begin receiving matching contributions. The Company matches 200% of the first 2% of eligible pay and then 100% of the next 8% of pay that is contributed to the 401(k) plan and the Company Deferred Compensation Plan, for a maximum match of 12% of eligible pay.\n\nThe first-year eligibility for Company matching contributions was waived for Mr. Wine, as part of his CEO employment agreement. The amounts were credited to Mr. Wine's Company Deferred Compensation Plan account at the end of 2021. No exceptions were made for Mr. Kermisch or other NEOs in the Company Deferred Compensation Plan.\n\nThe U.S. based NEO's 2023 deferral elections are noted in the footnotes to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.",

        "page_content": "## Earnings\n\nThe CNH Industrial Deferred Compensation Plan accounts are credited with a rate of return based on the investment election  made  from  a  list  of  allowable  investment  options  by  the  participant  on  all  participant  and  Company  matching contributions. The earnings are also on a tax-deferred basis, thus maximizing the combined benefit of pre-tax deferrals and tax-deferred growth.\n\nThe  rate  of  return  is  variable  and  the  investment  election  can  be  changed  at  any  time  by  the  participant  within  the selection of the investment portfolio.\n\nUntil September 30, 2023, the Deferred Compensation Plan accounts were credited with a rate of return based on the effective annual yield of 130% of Moody's Corporate Bond Index on all participant and Company matching contributions. Because this rate of return was above the U.S. applicable federal rate (\"AFR\") each year, earnings in excess of the AFR are included on the Summary Compensation Table.\n\nAs of October 1st, the Deferred Compensation Plan was administered by Fidelity and the Moody's Bond Index was no longer  used  for  earnings  on  deferred  balances.  Participants  could  invest  their  deferrals  by  selecting  and  changing elections based on the portfolio available in the Fidelity are able to invest their deferrals in the investment choices offered by Fidelity. The earnings are also on a tax-deferred basis, thus maximizing the combined benefit of pre-tax deferrals and tax-deferred growth.\n\n## Vesting\n\n- \u00b7 Participant deferrals and related earnings are 100% vested.\n- \u00b7 Employer Matching Contributions vest after three years of continued service.\n\n## Forms of Payment\n\nThe Company Deferred Compensation Plan provides flexible payment options for participants who remain employed as of a specific date (a 'scheduled distribution') and/or after the participant retires or otherwise terminates their employment with the Company.\n\nRetirement Accounts: Can be elected to be paid in a lump sum (after six months of termination for key employees such as the NEOs) or in annual installments over a period of up to 10 years.\n\n- \u00b7 If installments are elected, that election will apply if the participant at the time of termination of employment reaches age 62 or reaches age 55 with 10 years of credited service.\n- \u00b7 If the participant is not retirement eligible at the time of termination of employment with the company, accounts will be paid in a lump sum.\n- \u00b7 If  the  participant  becomes  disabled  while  employed,  accounts  are  treated  as  retirement  payments,  regardless  of reaching retirement eligibility.\n\nScheduled Distributions : Can be paid in a lump sum or annual installments up to five years.\n\n- \u00b7 The payment commencement year must be at least five years after the plan year when the schedule is established.\n- \u00b7 All scheduled distribution subaccounts that commence in a year after the participant's termination of employment will be paid according to the participant's retirement election for that plan year.\n\n## Fiscal 2023 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table\n\n| NEO & Position                                       | Plan                                        | Executive  Contributions in  Last FY ($)  (1)   | Registrant  Contributions  in FY ($)  (2)   | Aggregate Earnings in Last FY ($)  (3)   | Aggregate  Withdrawals/ Distributions  in Last FY   | Aggregate  Balance  at Last  FYE ($)  (4)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Scott W.

The amounts reported in the table below assume a change of control and/or termination of employment on December 29, 2023, and the value of equity acceleration reported below is based on a price per share of CNH common stock of $12.18 (the closing price per share on the NYSE on December 29, 2023, the final trading day of the year).\n\nWelfare\n\n| NEO & Position                                       | CIC Provision                                          | Salary (1)   | Bonus      | LTI        | Benefits   | Total      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Scott W.

        "page_content": "The CEO pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.402 based on the methodologies and assumptions described above.\n\n## Compensation of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors consists of a one-tier structure including Executive Directors (the Chair and the CEO roles) with managerial roles and Non-Executive board members with supervisory roles. The Board has collective responsibility for the strategy of the Company and is currently composed of nine Directors. The Board of Directors of the Company appointed the following internal committees: (i) an Audit Committee, (ii) an Environmental, Social and Governance Committee, and (iii) a Human Capital and Compensation Committee.\n\nThe CEO is also the primary NEO in this report whose compensation is disclosed in detail in the CD&A and corresponding compensation tables  section. The  Chair's  compensation  is  disclosed  in  this  section  with  the  Non-Executive  Directors, although her compensation is structured differently, as indicated below.\n\nWe have structured the compensation of our Non-Executive Directors with the following objectives in mind:\n\n- \u00b7 Offer  competitive  compensation  to  attract  and  retain  highly  qualified  leaders  to  guide  and  govern  a  large,  global, complex organization;\n- \u00b7 Recognize the substantial investment of time and expertise necessary for the directors to discharge their duties;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that compensation is easy to understand and is regarded positively by our shareholders and employees; and\n- \u00b7 Comply with Dutch corporate governance best practices and comply with Dutch and U.S. SEC regulations.\n\nThe  compensation  of  Non-Executive  Directors  is  not  dependent  on  the  Company's  financial  results.  Non-Executive Directors  do  not  receive  benefits  upon  termination  of  their  service  as  directors,  nor  any  other  benefit,  perquisites.  No meeting fees are paid, but Directors are reimbursed for expenses related to meeting attendance. For some countries, Non-Executive Directors and the Company are subject to social contributions on the fees earned.\n\nThe compensation of the Chair and Non-Executive Directors was reviewed by the HCC Committee in 2023.\n\n## Compensation for Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe compensation of Non-Executive Directors is governed by the Company's Compensation Plan within the scope of the Company's Remuneration Policy. The following chart describes compensation paid to Non-Executive Directors:\n\n| Non-Executive Director Compensation                      | Total    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Annual cash retainer                                     | $125,000 |\n| Additional retainer for Audit Committee member           | $25,000  |\n| Additional retainer for Audit Committee Chair            | $35,000  |\n| Additional retainer for member of other Board committees | $20,000  |\n| Additional retainer for Chair of other Board committees  | $25,000  |\n\nIn 2019, upon the recommendation of the HCC Committee, the Board resolved to implement share ownership guidelines for  the  Non-Executive  Directors.  Applicable  to  Non-Executive  Directors  appointed  or  reappointed  in  April  2019  or thereafter, Non-Executive Directors are required to own Company shares in an aggregate amount of not less than 1x their annual retainer fee, which is $125,000, within 24 months of first appointment to the Board. The Non-Executive Directors are  expected  to  hold  Company  shares  as  a  long-term  investment  and,  as  such,  are  expected  to  hold  their  Company shares while on the Board and for an additional three months after their Board service terminates. All the Non-Executive Directors have currently met the guideline except for Mr. Kramer and Ms. Bastoni who have until April 2025 to meet the guideline.\n\n## Compensation for the Chair\n\nThe Chair role, held by Suzanne Heywood, is an Executive Director managerial board role, whose compensation differs from  the  Non-Executive  supervisory  board  members.  The  Chair  is  not  a  NEO  and  therefore  her  compensation  is  not included in the CD&A section of this report.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fundamental purpose and features of the Chair's compensation elements for 2023:",

        "page_content": "comparison is set, and trends are tracked. The trend in executives' compensation is evaluated in relation to the trend in employees' compensation.\n\nIn  line  with  the  guidance  under  the  DCGC,  the  CEO  Pay  ratio  and  trend  is  disclosed  in  the  annual  executive compensation  disclosure  of  the  annual  report.  The  basis  of  the  pay  ratio  comparison  uses  the  prevalent  Dutch methodology  of  average  employee  compensation,  including  all  labor  costs.  Consistent  with  prior  years,  CEO compensation and average employee compensation use the accounting value of equity awards. Under this methodology, the value of an equity award is allocated over the period between grant and vesting.\n\nThe  CEO's  pay  in  2023,  2022  and  2021  reflect  the  pay  of  Scott  W.  Wine,  hired  on  January  4,  2021  with  a  highly competitive pay package and hiring incentive awards to attract him to join the Company and leave a highly paid CEO position at his former employer. Additionally, the incentive included one-time highly leveraged performance-based equity awards to align him with Company shareholders and provide upside potential reward linked to performance for the risk he assumed changing from a known company and industry to a much larger, globally diverse, and complex company in a different industry. His performance-based equity awards have experienced above target performance under Mr. Wine's leadership across each of the metrics, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Industrial ROIC, and relative TSR. The 2023 value of the equity awards reflects achievement of PSUs for the 2022-2024 LTI PSUs. Additional explanation of the CEO's pay in 2023 and 2022 can be referenced in the CD&A and the Pay versus Performance section of this report.\n\nThe average employee compensation is the total personnel costs reported in the Annual Report, which excludes CEO compensation, divided by average year headcount reported in the Annual Report, less the CEO who is included in the total average year headcount. Over the five-year period, the average employee compensation has been impacted, due to changing business conditions, by shifts in the labor market in the different geographies.\n\nThe five-year trend of CEO pay versus average employee compensation is shown in the following table:\n\n|                                            | 2023       | 2022       | 2021       | 2020      | 2019      | 5-year trend   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|\n| CEO compensation ($000s) (1)               | 32,712 (1) | 35,176 (2) | 21,805 (2) | 5,702 (3) | 6,632 (4) | 493%           |\n| Average Employee compensation (6)  ($000s) | 81.6       | 76.4       | 69.7       | 60.2      | 60.5      | 135%           |\n| CEO Pay Ratio                              | 400        | 460        | 313        | 95        | 110       | 364%           |\n\nNotes:\n\nFor perspective, the Company's key performance metrics for the same past five years are shown below:\n\n| Selected Performance Data (1)(2)                          | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |   2019 | 5-year trend   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Net Income - US GAAP ($ million)                          | 2,039  | 2,039  | 1,801  | (198)  | 797    | 256%           |\n| Adjusted Diluted Earnings/(Loss) per share ($)            | 1.70   | 1.46   | 1.28   | 0.42   |   0.64 | 266%           |\n| Absolute Total Shareholder Return - Indexed from 2018 (3) | 152    | 208    | 199    | 128    | 118    | 129%           |\n\nNotes:",

As noted above, the special voting shares and associated common shares are not tradable. The associated common shares are only tradable after they are de-registered from the loyalty voting program at which time the associated special voting shares are surrendered to the Company. There is no possibility to hold a special voting share without holding an associated common share.",

Rather, all prospective purchasers and holders of CNH stock, regardless of their country of residency, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of owning and disposing of CNH stock based upon their particular circumstances.\n\n## Taxation of Loyalty Voting Program\n\nThe Company maintains a Loyalty Register which provides for special voting shares to reward long-term ownership of the Company's common shares and to promote stability of its shareholder base, as further defined in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe tax consequences to Shareholders of owning special voting shares are uncertain because no statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the receipt, ownership or disposition of special voting shares should be treated for tax purposes.\n\n## U.S. Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC)\n\nThe U.S. federal  income  tax  rules  provide  specific  tax  rules  applicable  to  shareholders  in  companies  that  meet  the definition of a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC') for U.S. federal income tax purposes. CNH believes that shares of its stock are not stock of a PFIC, but this conclusion is a factual determination made annually and thus may be subject to change. U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.\n\n## Material U.K. Tax Consequences\n\nThis  section  summarizes  the  material  U.K.  tax  consequences  of  the  ownership  of  CNH  common  shares  for  U.S. Shareholders. It is intended only as a general guide and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential U.K. tax  consequences  of  holding  CNH  common  shares.  This  section  is  based  on  current  U.K.  tax  law  and  what  is understood to be the current practice of H.M. Revenue and Customs, as well as applicable tax treaties, as of the date of this form. This law and practice and these treaties are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nThis section applies only to shareholders of CNH that are U.S. Shareholders, that are not resident or domiciled in the U.K., that hold their shares as an investment, and that are the absolute beneficial owner of both the shares and any dividends paid on the shares. This section does not apply to members of any special class of shareholders subject to special rules, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 a pension fund;\n- \u00b7 a charity;\n- \u00b7 persons acquiring their shares in connection with an office or employment;\n- \u00b7 a dealer in securities;\n- \u00b7 an insurance company; or\n- \u00b7 a collective investment scheme.\n\nIn addition, this section may not apply to:\n\n- \u00b7 any shareholders that, either alone or together, with one or more associated persons, such as personal trusts and connected persons, control directly or indirectly at least 10% of the voting rights or of any class of share capital of CNH; or\n- \u00b7 any person holding shares as a borrower under a stock loan or an interim holder under a repurchase agreement.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\n## Withholding from dividend payments\n\nUnder U.K. domestic law, dividend payments on CNH common shares may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of U.K. income tax.\n\n## Non-U.K. - Resident Shareholders\n\nA shareholder of CNH common shares that is not resident in the U.K. for U.K. tax purposes will not be liable to account for income or corporation tax in the U.K. on dividends paid on the shares unless the shareholder carries on a trade (or profession or vocation) in the U.K. and the dividends are either a receipt of that trade (or profession or vocation) or, in the case of U.K. corporation tax, the shares are held by or for a U.K. permanent establishment through which the trade is carried on.",

It does not purport to describe every aspect of Dutch taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder of CNH common shares  and,  if  applicable,  CNH  special  voting  shares.  Tax  matters  are  complex,  and  the  tax  consequences  to  a particular holder of CNH common shares and, if applicable, CNH special voting shares, will depend in part on such holder's circumstances. Shareholders and any potential inventor should consult their own tax advisors regarding the Dutch tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of CNH common shares and, if applicable, CNH special voting shares in their particular circumstances.\n\nWhere  in  this  summary  English  terms  and  expressions  are  used  to  refer  to  Dutch  concepts,  the  meaning  to  be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts under Dutch  tax  law.  Where  in  this  section  the  terms  'the  Netherlands'  and  'Dutch'  are  used,  these  refer  solely  to  the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nThis summary also assumes that the board shall control the conduct of the affairs of CNH and shall procure that CNH is organized in accordance with the facts, based upon which the competent authorities of the U.K. and the Netherlands have ruled that CNH should be treated as solely resident of the U.K. for the application of the tax treaty as concluded between the U.K. and the Netherlands. A change in facts and circumstances based upon which the ruling was issued may invalidate the contents of this section, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.\n\nThis summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the date of this form. The law upon which this summary is based is subject to change, perhaps with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect such changes.\n\n## Scope of the Summary\n\nThe summary of Dutch taxes set out  in  this  section  'Material  Dutch  tax  consequences'  only  applies  to  a  holder  of shares who is a Non-Resident holder of shares. For the purpose of this summary, a holder of shares is a Non-Resident holder of shares if such holder is neither a resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch income tax or corporation tax as the case may be.\n\nThis Dutch taxation discussion does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a holder of CNH common shares and, if applicable, special voting shares, who:\n\n- (1) Is  a  person who may be deemed an owner of CNH common shares and, if applicable, CNH special voting shares for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to specific statutory attribution rules in Dutch tax law;\n- (2) Owns CNH common shares and, if applicable, CNH special voting shares in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role; or\n- (3) Is for Dutch tax purposes taxable as a corporate entity and resident of Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, or Sint Maarten.\n\n## Dividend Withholding Tax\n\nCNH is generally required to withhold Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15 percent from dividends distributed by it. The competent authorities of the U.K. and the Netherlands have ruled that CNH is resident of the U.K. for the application  of  the  tax  treaty  as  concluded  between  the  Netherlands  and  the  U.K.  Consequently,  payments  made  by",

While  projections  vary  among  geographies  and  product  types,  in  the aggregate for key markets where the Company competes, CNH estimates that agriculture industry retail sales will be down 10-15% and construction equipment industry retail sales will be down around 10% when compared to 2023.\n\nCNH  is  continuing  its  efforts  to  improve  through-cycle  margins  with  its  two  previously  announced  cost  reduction programs. The first program is focused on reducing product costs through logistics normalization, lean manufacturing principles, and strategic sourcing, and was first announced at the 2022 Capital Markets Day. The second program is focused on reducing SG&A expenses and was announced in conjunction with Q3 2023 earnings. Both programs are progressing and are expected to partially offset the impact of the lower industry demand.\n\nConsequently, the Company is providing the following 2024 outlook:\n\n- \u25aa Agriculture segment net sales (*) down between 8% and 12% year-over-year including currency translation effects;\n- \u25aa Agriculture segment adjusted EBIT margin between 14.0% and 15.0%;\n- \u25aa Construction segment net sales (*) down between 7% and 11% year-over-year including currency translation effects;\n- \u25aa Construction segment adjusted EBIT margin between 5.0% and 6.0%;\n- \u25aa Free Cash Flow of Industrial Activities (**) between $1.2bn and $1.4bn;\n- \u25aa Adjusted diluted EPS between $1.50 to $1.60.\n\nCNH also announces that its Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million share buyback program to commence after the completion of the existing $1 billion share buyback program. Share repurchases under the program will  be  made from time to time in private transactions, open market purchases or other transactions as permitted by securities  laws  and  other  legal  requirements.  The  timing  and  amounts  of  any  purchases  will  be  based  on  market conditions  and  other  factors  including  but  not  limited  to  price  and  regulatory  requirements.  The  program  does  not require  the  purchase  of  any  minimum  dollar  amount  or  number  of  shares  and  the  program  may  be  modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. (or the 'Company') is incorporated in, and under the laws of, the Netherlands. CNH Industrial N.V. has its corporate seat in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its principal office in Basildon, England, United Kingdom. The Company was formed on September 29, 2013, as a result of the business combination transaction between Fiat  Industrial  S.p.A.  ('Fiat  Industrial')  and  its  majority  owned  subsidiary  CNH  Global  N.V.  ('CNH  Global').  Unless otherwise  indicated  or  the  context  otherwise  requires,  the  terms  \"CNH\"  and  the  \"Group\"  refer  to  CNH  and  its\n\nsubsidiaries.\n\nCNH is a leading company in the capital goods sector that, through its various businesses, designs, produces, and sells agricultural  and  construction  equipment  (see  Note  28  'Segment  reporting').  In  addition,  CNH's  Financial  Services segment offers an array of financial products and services, including retail financing for the purchase or lease of new and  used  CNH  and  other  manufacturers'  products  and  other  retail  financing  programs  and  wholesale  financing  to dealers.\n\nCNH  has  three  reportable  segments  consisting  of:  (i)  Agriculture,  which  designs,  produces  and  sells  agricultural equipment,  (ii)  Construction,  which  designs,  produces  and  sells  construction  equipment  and  (iii)  Financial  Services, which provides financial services to the customers of the Group's products. CNH's worldwide agricultural equipment and construction equipment segments as well as corporate functions are collectively referred to as \"Industrial Activities\".\n\n## MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  together  with  the  notes  thereto  of  CNH  at  December  31,  2023  were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on March 19, 2024 and have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS') and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The designation 'IFRS' also includes International Accounting Standards ('IAS'), as well as all interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC').\n\nThe financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified as required for the measurement of  certain  financial  instruments,  as  well  as  on  a  going  concern  basis.  Despite  operating  in  a  continuously  difficult economic and financial environment, including rising inflation, geopolitical instability and the war in Ukraine, the Group's assessment is that no material uncertainties (as defined in paragraph 25 of IAS 1) exist about its ability to continue as a going concern, in view also of the measures already undertaken by the Group to preserve cash and contain costs, and to preserve its industrial and financial flexibility, and its strong liquidity position.\n\nThese  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  prepared  using  the  U.S.  dollar  as  the  presentation  currency.  The functional currency of the parent company (CNH Industrial N.V.) is the euro. The U.S. dollar presentation currency was elected to be used in order to improve comparability with main competitors, mainly in the agriculture and construction businesses, and to provide more meaningful information to U.S. investors.\n\nDuring  2021,  CNH  completed  a  strategic  project  to  separate  the  Commercial  and  Specialty  Vehicles  business,  the Powertrain  business,  and  the  related  Financial  Services  business  (together  the  'Iveco  Group  Business')  from  the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (jurisdiche afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Demerger\"), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nSince  January  3,  2022  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  Iveco  Group  N.V.  have  been  quoted  separately  on  the  regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management and Board of Directors.\n\nFollowing the voluntary delisting of common shares from Euronext Milan and since January 2, 2024, CNH Industrial N.V. common stock is single listed on the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE') under the symbol \"CNHI\".\n\n## Climate related matters\n\nCNH has an established risk management process that includes the assessment and monitoring of climate-related risk. These assessments are used by CNH to identify not only risk exposure, but also opportunities, on which the Group's climate  change  strategy  is  based.  The  identification  of  these  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities,  along  with  the analysis  of  sustainability  macrotrends,  led  to  the  definition  of  a  decarbonization  strategy,  which  in  turn  has  been incorporated  within,  and  regularly  influences,  the  Group's  Strategic  Business  Plan.

        "page_content": "impacts  of  climate  change,  CNH  has  implemented  relevant  projects  and  a  number  of  other  specific  climate-related topics and has defined long-term strategic targets.\n\nThere  has  been  increasing  interest  in  how  climate  change  will  impact  the  Group's  business.  With  reference  to  the climate  related  matters,  a  critical  review  was  undertaken,  and  a  focused  analysis  performed  to  identify,  and consequently  manage,  the  principal  risks  and  uncertainties  to  which  the  Group  is  exposed.  CNH  recognizes  the importance of climate change risk and promotes a responsible use of resources and a reduction of the environmental impact of production to mitigate climate change. In this context, CNH has adopted an environmental policy that applies to all company locations and divisions and has set up a structure dedicated to control environmental pollution, waste, and water disposal as well as emission reduction.\n\nIn  particular,  considering  the  financial  statements  information  are  presented  through  historical  values  which,  by  their nature, do not fully capture future events, all significant assumptions and estimates underlying the preparation of the following items were subject to an analysis in order to identify and address the new uncertainties related to climate changes  which  could  affect  the  business:  going  concern,  inventory  management,  property,  plant  and  equipment, goodwill, brands, intangible assets with a finite life, tax reliefs, revenue recognition, provisions and onerous contracts. The  analysis  conducted  were  based  on  the  Group  strategy  outlined  in  the  context  of  the  global  supply  chain environmental targets and did not highlight any critical situations that cannot be attributable to and addressed in the ordinary course of the business.\n\n## Global Business Conditions\n\nIn  combination  with  the  economic  recovery  factors  and  repercussions  from  geopolitical  events,  the  global  economy continues  to  experience  volatile  disruptions  including  to  the  commodity,  labor  and  transportation  markets.  These disruptions have contributed to an inflationary environment which has affected, and may continue to affect, the price and availability of certain products and services necessary for the Company's operations. For example, the Company experienced supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures in 2022 and, while these trends improved in 2023, the Company continues to experience some disruptions. The reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to improved efficiencies in our manufacturing operations, but purchasing costs remain elevated.\n\nIn addition, the Company continues to monitor global economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from rising interest rates, fluctuating currency exchange rates, inflation and recession fears, on the Company's business, customers and suppliers.\n\n## Format of the financial statements\n\nCNH presents an income statement using a classification based on the function of expenses (otherwise known as the 'cost of sales' method), rather than one based on their nature, as this is believed to provide information that is more relevant.\n\nFor the statement of financial position, a mixed format has been selected to present current and non-current assets and liabilities, as permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements . Legal entities carrying out industrial activities and those carrying  out  financial  services  are  both  consolidated  in  the  Group's  financial  statements.  The  investment portfolios  of  Financial  Services  are  included  in  current  assets,  as  the  investments  will  be  realized  in  their  normal operating cycle. Financial Services, though, obtains funds only partially from the market; the remainder is obtained from CNH  Industrial  N.V.  through  its  treasury  legal  entities  (included  in  Industrial  Activities),  which  lend  funds  both  to Industrial Activities and to Financial Services legal entities as the need arises. This Financial Services structure within the  Group  means  that  any  attempt  to  separate  current  and  non-current  liabilities  in  the  consolidated  statement  of financial position is not meaningful. Disclosure of the due dates of liabilities is however provided in the notes.\n\nThe statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method.",

        "page_content": "## Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group has power over the investee, when it is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated on a line by line basis from the date which the control is achieved.\n\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\n- \u25aa the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n- \u25aa rights arising from other contractual arrangements;\n- \u25aa the Group's voting rights and potential voting rights.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to  one  or  more  of  the  three  elements  of  control.  The  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries and non-controlling interests in the profit or loss of consolidated subsidiaries are presented separately from the interests of the owners of the parent in the consolidated statement of financial position and income statement respectively. Losses applicable to non-controlling interests which exceed the non-controlling interests in the subsidiary's equity are debited to non-controlling interests.\n\nChanges in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the equity attributable to owners of the parent and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the book value of  the  non-controlling  interests  and  the  fair  value  of  the  relevant  consideration  is  recognized  directly  in  the  equity attributable to the owners of the parent.\n\nIf the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the relevant consideration and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii)  the  carrying  amount  of  the  assets  (including  goodwill)  and  liabilities  of  the  subsidiary  and  any  non-controlling interests. Any profits or losses recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the subsidiary are accounted for as  if  the  subsidiary  had  been  sold  (i.e.,  are  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  or  transferred  directly  to  retained  earnings depending on the applicable IFRS).\n\nSubsidiaries that are either dormant or generate a negligible volume of business, are not consolidated. Their impact on the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit/(loss) attributable to the owners of the parent is immaterial.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists  only  when  decisions  about  the  relevant  activities  require  unanimous  consent  of  the  parties  sharing  control. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates  are  enterprises  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence.  As  defined  in  IAS  28  Investments  in Associates  and  Joint  Ventures ,  significant  influence  is  the  power  to  participate  in  the  financial  and  operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using  the  equity  method  from  the  date  that  significant  influence  commences  until  the  date  that  significant  influence ceases. When the Group's share of losses of an associate, if any, exceeds the carrying amount of the associate in the Group's  statement  of  financial  position,  the  carrying  amount  is  reduced  to  nil  and  recognition  of  further  losses  is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate.\n\n## Investments in other companies\n\nInvestments in other companies are measured at fair value. Equity investments for which there is no quoted market price in an active market and there is insufficient financial information in order to determine fair value are measured at cost  as  an  estimate  of  fair  value,  as  permitted  by  IFRS  9.  The  Group  may  irrevocably  elect  to  present  subsequent changes  in  the  investment's  fair  value  in  other  comprehensive  income  upon  the  initial  recognition  of  an  equity investment that is not held to sell. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis. Dividends received from these investments are included in Other income/(expenses) from investments.",

Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  at  the  balance  sheet  date  are  translated  at  the exchange rate prevailing at that date. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on reporting monetary  items  at  rates  different  from  those  at  which  they  were  initially  recorded  during  the  period  or  in  previous financial statements, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Consolidation of foreign entities\n\nCertain of CNH's non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates maintain their books and accounting records using local currency as the functional currency.\n\nAll  assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for  the  period.  Translation  differences  resulting  from  the  application  of  this  method  are  classified  as  equity  until  the disposal of the investment. Average rates of exchange are used to translate the cash flows of foreign subsidiaries in preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe goodwill, assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from the acquisition of entities with a functional currency other  than  the  U.S.  dollar  are  recognized  in  the  functional  currency  and  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the acquisition date. These balances are subsequently retranslated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 29 Financial  reporting  in  hyperinflationary  economies for  its  subsidiaries  that  prepare  their financial statements in a functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy. According to this standard, non-monetary assets and liabilities  not  yet  translated  into  U.S.  dollar  at  the  reporting  date  are  redetermined  using  a  general  price index. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are then translated at the closing spot rate.\n\nThe principal exchange rates used to translate into U.S. dollars the financial statements prepared in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were as follows:\n\n|                    |   Average 2023 |   At December 31, 2023 |   Average 2022 |   At December 31, 2022 |\n|--------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Euro               |          0.925 |                  0.905 |          0.95  |                  0.938 |\n| Pound sterling     |          0.805 |                  0.786 |          0.81  |                  0.832 |\n| Swiss franc        |          0.899 |                  0.838 |          0.954 |                  0.923 |\n| Polish zloty       |          4.203 |                  3.935 |          4.451 |                  4.397 |\n| Brazilian real     |          4.996 |                  4.842 |          5.165 |                  5.22  |\n| Canadian dollar    |          1.35  |                  1.325 |          1.301 |                  1.354 |\n| Argentine peso (1) |        808.076 |                808.076 |        177.11  |                177.11  |\n| Turkish lira (2)   |         23.802 |                 29.505 |         16.531 |                 18.707 |\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Under this method:\n\n- \u25aa the consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred and liabilities assumed by the Group and the equity interests issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred;\n- \u25aa at the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value at that  date,  except  for  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  employee  benefit arrangements,  liabilities  or  equity  instruments  relating  to  share-based  payment  arrangements  of  the  acquiree  or share-based payment arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquire, assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale, which are measured in accordance with the relevant standard;\n- \u25aa goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities  assumed.  If  the  net  of  the  acquisition-date  amounts  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the",

The  selection  of  the  measurement  method  is  made  on  a  transaction-bytransaction basis;\n- \u25aa any contingent consideration arrangement in the business combination is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included  as  part  of  the  consideration  transferred  in  the  business  combination  in  order  to  determine  goodwill. Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  contingent  consideration  that  qualify  as  measurement  period  adjustments  are recognized  retrospectively,  with  corresponding  adjustments  to  goodwill.  Measurement  period  adjustments  are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the 'measurement period' (which may not exceed one  year  from  the  acquisition  date)  about  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  Any changes in fair value after the measurement period are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen a business  combination  is  achieved  in  stages,  the  Group's  previously  held  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  is remeasured  at  its  acquisition-date  fair  value  and  the  resulting  gain  or  loss,  if  any,  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss. Changes  in  the  equity  interest  in  the  acquiree  that  have  been  recognized  in  Other  comprehensive  income  in  prior reporting periods are reclassified to profit or loss as if the interest had been disposed of.\n\nIf  the  initial  accounting  for  a  business  combination  is  incomplete  by  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  which  the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the above-mentioned measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date which, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date.\n\nBusiness combinations that took place prior to January 1, 2010 were accounted for in accordance with the version of IFRS 3 effective before the 2008 amendments, as permitted by the revised standard.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nSome of the Group's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nIn estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances  and  for  which  sufficient  data  are  available  to  measure  fair  value,  maximizing  the  use  of  relevant observable  inputs  and  minimizing  the  use  of  unobservable  inputs. Additional  information  about  fair  value,  fair  value hierarchy, valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is provided in Note 19 \"Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities\", Note 31 \"Fair value measurement\" and, where required, in the individual notes relating to the assets and liabilities whose fair value were determined.\n\nIn addition, fair value measurements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety:\n\n- \u25aa Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\n- \u25aa Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) on the market;\n- \u25aa Level 3 - inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n\n## Determination of Fair Value\n\nWhen available, CNH uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. In some cases where a market price is not available, CNH will make use of observable market-based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the items are classified as Level 2.\n\nIf  quoted  or  observable  market  prices  are  not  available,  fair  value  is  based  upon  internally  developed  valuation techniques  that  use,  where  possible,  current  market-based  or  independently  sourced  market  parameters  such  as interest rates, currency rates, or yield curves. Items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.",

        "page_content": "## Intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs for agricultural and construction equipment project are recognized as an asset, if and only if, both of the following conditions within IAS 38 - Intangible Assets are met: i) development costs can be measured reliably, and ii)  the  technical  feasibility  of  the  product,  projected  volumes  and  pricing  support  the  view  that  the  development expenditure will generate future economic benefits. Capitalized development costs include all direct and indirect costs that may be directly attributed to the development process. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nCapitalized development costs for agricultural and construction equipment are amortized on a systematic basis over a period of 5 years.\n\n## Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives principally consist of acquired trademarks which have no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factor that limits their useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful life are  not  amortized,  but  are  tested  for  impairment  annually  or  more  frequently  if  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicated that the asset may be impaired.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther  purchased  and  internally-generated  intangible  assets  are  recognized  as  assets  in  accordance  with  IAS  38  Intangible Assets , where it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits for the Group and where the costs of the asset can be determined reliably.\n\nSuch  assets  are  measured  at  purchase  or  manufacturing  cost  and  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  their estimated useful lives, if these assets have finite useful lives.\n\nOther intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of a business are capitalized separately from goodwill if their fair value can be measured reliably.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Cost\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.\n\nCost comprises the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, capitalized borrowing costs and any initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.\n\nSubsequent expenditures and the cost of replacing parts of an asset are capitalized only if they increase the future economic benefits embodied in that asset. All other expenditures are expensed as incurred. When such replacement costs are capitalized, the carrying amount of the parts that are replaced is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:\n\n|                                | Depreciation rates   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                      | 2.5% - 10%           |\n| Plant, machinery and equipment | 4% - 20%             |\n| Other assets                   | 10% - 33%            |\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## Lease accounting policy\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nA lease is a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset (the leased asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The lease term determined by the Group comprises the non-cancellable period of lease contract together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. For real estate leases, this assessment is based on an analysis by management of all relevant facts and circumstances including the leased asset's purpose, the economic and practical potential for replacing and",

For lease agreements, we combine lease and nonlease components.\n\nFor  leases  with  terms  not  exceeding  twelve  months  (short-term  leases)  and  for  leases  of  low-value  assets,  CNH recognizes the lease payments associated with those leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term as operating expense in the income statement.\n\nFor  all  other  leases,  at  the  commencement  date  (i.e.,  the  date  the  underlying  asset  is  available  for  use),  CNH recognizes a right-of-use asset, classified within Property, plant and equipment, and a lease liability, classified within Other Debt.\n\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset includes the amount of lease liability recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. At the same date, the lease liability is measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily  determined,  the  Group's incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is determined considering macro-economic factors such as the  specific  interest  rate  curve  based  on  the  relevant  currency  and  term,  as  well  as  specific  factors  contributing  to CNH's  credit  spread.  The  Group  primarily  uses  the  incremental  borrowing  rate  as  the  discount  rate  for  its  lease liabilities.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated  impairment  losses,  adjusted  for  any  remeasurement  of  the  lease  liability.  The  right-of-use  asset  is depreciated on a straight-line basis. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the  lease  term  or  if  the  cost  of  the  right-of-use  asset  reflects  that  the  Group  will  exercise  a  purchase  option,  CNH depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life  of  the  right-of-use  asset  or  the  end  of  the  lease  term. After  the  commencement  date,  the  lease  liability  is increased to reflect the accretion of interest, recognized within Financial income/(expenses) in the income statement, reduced for the lease payments made, and remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nLease contracts where CNH acts as a lessor, can be classified as either an operating lease or finance lease. Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Leases that  transfer  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  incidental  to  ownership  of  an  underlying  asset  to  the  lessee  are classified as a finance leases.\n\nWhere  CNH  is  the  lessor  in  a  finance  lease,  the  future  minimum  lease  payments  from  lessees  are  classified  as Receivables  from  financing  activities.  Lease  payments  are  recognized  as  repayment  of  the  principal,  and  financial income remunerating the initial investment and the services provided.\n\nWhere CNH is the lessor in an operating lease, income from operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. Leased assets include equipment leased to retail customers by the Group's leasing companies. They are stated at cost and depreciated at annual rates of between 20% and 33%.\n\nCNH evaluates the carrying amount of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when it determines a triggering  event  has  occurred.  When  a  triggering  event  occurs,  a  test  for  recoverability  is  performed  comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset's fair value is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. An impairment  charge  would  be  recognized  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  exceeds  its estimated fair value.\n\nWhen leased assets are no longer leased and become held for sale, the Group reclassifies their carrying amount to Inventories.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition,  construction  or  production  of  qualifying  assets  (as defined under IAS 23 Borrowing Costs ),  which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the class of assets to which they refer.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are expensed when incurred.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group reviews, at least annually, the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets (including capitalized development costs) and property, plant and equipment, in order to determine whether there is any indication that those assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.  Goodwill  and  Intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are  tested  for impairment annually, or more frequently, if there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.",

The recoverable amount is determined for the individual  asset,  unless  the  asset  does  not  generate  cash  inflows  that  are  largely  independent  of  those  from  other assets or group of assets, in which case the asset is tested as part of the cash-generating unit (\"CGU\") to which the asset  belongs.  A  CGU  is  the  smallest  identifiable  group  of  assets  that  generates  cash  inflows  that  are  largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.\n\nIn  assessing  the  value  in  use  of  an  asset  or  CGU,  the  pre-tax  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific  to  the  asset.  An  impairment  loss  is  recognized  if  the  recoverable  amount  is  lower  than  the  carrying amount.\n\nWhere  a  previous  impairment  loss  for  assets  other  than  goodwill  no  longer  exists  or  has  decreased,  the  carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased up to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not in excess of the carrying amount that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Presentation\n\nFinancial instruments held by the Group are presented and measured in the financial statements as described in the following paragraphs.\n\nInvestments and other non-current financial assets comprise investments in unconsolidated companies and other noncurrent financial assets (securities, and other non-current financial receivables).\n\nCurrent  financial  assets  include  trade  receivables,  receivables  from  financing  activities  (retail  financing,  dealer financing, lease financing and other current loans to third parties), current securities and other current financial assets (which include derivative financial instruments stated at fair value as assets), as well as cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCurrent securities include short-term or marketable securities which represent temporary investments of available funds and do not satisfy the requirements for being classified as cash equivalents.\n\nFinancial liabilities refer to debt, which includes asset-backed financing ('ABS'), and derivative liabilities (which include derivative financial instruments stated at fair value as liabilities), trade payables and other liabilities.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInvestments in unconsolidated companies classified as non-current financial assets are accounted for as described in the paragraph 'Basis of consolidation'.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , financial assets are classified as measured at either amortized cost (\"AC\"),  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (\"FVTOCI\")  or  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (\"FVTPL\"), depending  on  the  business  model  for  managing  such  financial  assets  and  the  asset's  contractual  cash  flow characteristics. Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\nFinancial assets and current securities acquired through a regular way purchase are recognized on the basis of the settlement  date  and,  on  initial  recognition,  are  measured  at  fair  value  including  transaction  costs.  Subsequent measurement depends on the business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\nAssets  that  are  held  for  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows,  where  those  cash  flows  represent  solely  payments  of principal and interest, are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Receivables with maturities of over one year which bear no interest or an interest rate significantly lower than market rates are discounted using market rates.\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the asset's cash flows represents solely payments of principal and interests, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.  Gains  and  losses  on  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  are  recognized directly in other comprehensive income until the financial asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired; when the asset  is  disposed  of,  the  cumulative  gains  or  losses,  including  those  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive income, are reclassified to profit or loss; when the asset is impaired, expected credit losses are recognized to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in financial income.\n\nAs a result of the Group's business model, trade receivables and receivables from financing activities are subsequently measured at amortized cost.\n\nAssessments are made regularly as to whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets may  be  impaired.  If  any  such  evidence  exists,  an  impairment  loss  is  included  in  profit  or  loss  for  the  period.  The recognition of an impairment is based on expected credit losses.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at banks, units in liquidity funds, other money market securities and other cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Money market securities",

Cash at banks and Other cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost.\n\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities are measured either at fair value through other comprehensive income (when in a hedging relationship) or at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities hedged by derivative instruments are measured in accordance with hedge accounting principles applicable to fair value hedges: gains and losses arising from remeasurement at fair value, due to changes in the respective hedged risk, are recognized in profit or loss and are offset by the effective portion of the loss or gain arising from remeasurement at fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes, in order to reduce currency, interest rate and market price risks. In accordance with IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting only when, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument  and  the  hedged  item,  credit  risk  does  not  dominate  the  value  changes  that  result  from  the  economic relationship, and the hedging ratio in the hedging relationship reflects the actual quantity of the hedging instruments and the  hedged  item.  Further  details  on  qualifying  criteria  are  included  in  Note  19  'Derivative  assets  and  Derivative liabilities' and Note 30 'Information on financial risks'.\n\nWhen derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, the following accounting treatments applies:\n\n- \u25aa Fair value hedges - where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss, the gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognized in profit or loss. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognized in profit or loss.\n- \u25aa Cash flow hedges - where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the exposure to variability in future cash flows of a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, and could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognized directly in other comprehensive  income  in  the  cash  flow  hedge  reserve.  The  cumulative  gain  or  loss  is  removed  from  other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss at the same time as the economic effect arising from the hedged item affects income. The gain or loss associated with a hedge or part of a hedge that has become ineffective is  recognized in profit or loss immediately. When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss realized to the point of termination remains in  other  comprehensive income and is recognized in profit or loss at the same time as the underlying transaction occurs.  If  the  hedged  transaction  is  no  longer  probable,  the  cumulative  unrealized  gain  or  loss  held  in  other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\n\nIf  hedge  accounting  cannot  be  applied,  the  gains  or  losses  from  the  fair  value  measurement  of  derivative  financial instruments are recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## Transfers of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows arising from the assets are no longer held or if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, as follows:\n\n- \u25aa if the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it derecognizes the financial  asset  and  recognizes  separately  as  assets  or  liabilities  any  possible  rights  and  obligations  created  or retained in the transfer;\n- \u25aa if  the  Group  retains  substantially  all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  of  the  financial  asset,  it  continues  to recognize the financial asset;\n- \u25aa if the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it determines whether it has retained control of the financial asset. In this case:\n- \u25aa if  the Group has not maintained control, it derecognizes the financial asset and recognizes separately as assets and liabilities any possible rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer;\n- \u25aa if  the  Group  has  retained  control,  it  continues  to  recognize  the  financial  asset  to  the  extent  of  its  continuing involvement in the financial asset.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the consideration received or receivable for the transfer of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.",

A provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving raw materials, finished goods, spare parts and other supplies based on their expected future use and realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs for sale and distribution.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be principally recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, with the sale expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and the non-current asset (or the disposal  group)  is  available  for  immediate  sale  in  its  present  condition  subject  only  to  terms  that  are  usual  and customary for sales of such asset (or disposal group). When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe present value of a defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost (and past service cost, where applicable)  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are  determined  on  an  actuarial  basis  using  the  projected  unit  credit method.\n\nThe net defined benefit liability that the Group recognizes in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of any plan assets (deficit). In case of a surplus, a net defined benefit asset is recognized at the lower of the surplus and the asset ceiling.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability/asset (that comprise: a) actuarial gains and losses, b) return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset, and c) any change in the effect  of  the  asset  ceiling,  excluding  amounts  included  in  net  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability/asset)  are recognized directly in other comprehensive income without reclassification to profit or loss in subsequent years.\n\nPast service cost resulting from a plan amendment (the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan)  or  a  curtailment  (a  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  employees  covered  by  a  plan)  and  gain  or  loss  on settlements (a transaction that eliminates all further legal or constructive obligations for part or all of the benefits) are recognized  in  profit  or  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  occur  (or,  in  case  of  past  service  costs,  when  the  entity recognizes related restructuring costs or termination benefits, if earlier).\n\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognized as Financial  income/(expenses)  in  profit  or  loss.  Current  service  cost  and  all  other  costs  and  income  arising  from  the measurement of pension plan provisions are allocated to costs by function in profit or loss.\n\n## Post-employment plans other than pensions\n\nThe Group provides certain post-employment defined benefits, mainly healthcare plans. The method of accounting and the frequency of valuations are similar to those used for defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nCosts arising from defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe  Group  provides  additional  benefits  to  certain  members  of  senior  management  and  employees  through  equity compensation plans (stock option plans and stock grants). In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment , these plans represent a component of recipient remuneration. The compensation expense, corresponding to the fair value of the instruments at the grant date, is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of an award, with the offsetting credit recognized directly in equity. Any subsequent changes to fair value do not have any effect on the initial measurement.",

        "page_content": "## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, to a third party, as a result of a  past  event,  when  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  will  be  required  to  satisfy  the  obligation  and  when  a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nChanges in estimates are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the change occurs.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are presented as a deduction from equity. The original cost of treasury shares and the proceeds of any subsequent sale are presented as movements in equity.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  is  recognized  when  control  of  the  equipment,  services  or  parts  has  been  transferred  and  the  Group's performance obligations to the customers have been satisfied. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Group is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.\n\nThe  timing  of  when  the  Group  transfers  the  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  may  differ  from  the  timing  of  the customer's payment.\n\nRevenues  are  stated  net  of  discounts,  allowances,  settlement  discounts  and  rebates,  as  well  as  costs  for  sales incentive  programs,  which  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  historical  costs,  country  by  country,  and  charged  against profit for the period in which the corresponding sales are recognized.\n\nThe Group also enters into contracts with multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Group allocates revenue from the transaction price to the distinct goods and services in the contract on a relative standalone selling price basis. To the extent the Group sells the goods or services separately in the same market, the standalone selling price is the observable price at which the Group sells the goods or services separately. For all other goods or services, the  Group  estimates  the  standalone  selling  price  considering  all  information,  reasonably  available  (including  market conditions, entity-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer).\n\n## Sales of goods\n\nThe Group has determined that the customers from the sale of equipment and parts are dealers, distributors, public entities and retail customers.\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue at a point in time when control has transferred to the customer at a sales price that the Group  is  entitled  to  receive.  In  most  of  the  jurisdictions  where  CNH  operates,  and  subject  to  specific  exceptions, transfer  of  control  occurs  upon  shipment.  We  have  elected  to  recognize  at  the  time  of  sale  costs  for  shipping  and handling activities that occur after control has transferred. These expenses are presented in Sales of goods.\n\nFor all sales, no uncertainty exists surrounding the purchaser's obligation to pay for equipment and parts. The Group records appropriate allowance for credit losses and anticipated returns as required. Fixed payment schedules exist for all sales, but payment terms vary by geographic market and product line. See note 18 \"Current receivables and Other current financial assets\". The Group records an appropriate allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe cost of incentives, if any, are estimated at the inception of a contract at the amount that is expected to be paid and is  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  revenue  at  the  time  of  the  sale.  If  an  equipment  contract  transaction  has  multiple performance obligations, the cost of incentives is allocated entirely to the equipment. If the estimate of the incentive changes following the sale to the customer, the change in estimate is recognized as an adjustment to revenue in the period of the change. CNH grants certain sales incentives to support sales of its products to retail customers. At the later of the time of sale or the time an incentive is announced to dealers, CNH records the estimated impact of sales allowances in the form of dealer and customer incentives as a reduction of revenue. Subsequent adjustments to sales incentive programs related to products previously sold are recognized as an adjustment to revenues in the period the adjustment  is  determinable. The  determination  of  sales  allowances  requires  management  to  make  estimates  based upon  historical  data,  estimated  future  market  demand  for  products,  field  inventory  levels,  announced  incentive programs, competitive pricing and interest rates, among other things.\n\nWith reference to the sales to dealers accompanied by 'floor plan' agreements under which the Group offers wholesale financing including 'interest-free' financing for a specified period of time (which also vary by geographic market and product  line,  see  note  18  \"Current  receivables  and  Other  current  financial  assets\"),  two  separate  performance obligations exist. The first performance obligation consists of the sale of the equipment from Industrial Activities to the dealer. Concurrent with the sale of the equipment, Industrial Activities offers to the dealer wholesale financing through loans extended by Financial Services. Industrial Activities compensates Financial Services for the cost of the interestfree  period.  This  cost  has  been  determined  to  represent  a  cash  sale  incentive  on  the  initial  sale  of  the  good,  and therefore it is recognized upfront as a reduction of net sales of Industrial Activities. The second performance obligation consists  of  a  credit  facility  extended  by  Financial  Services  to  the  dealer.  The  remuneration  for  this  performance obligation  is  represented  by  the  compensation  received  from  Industrial  Activities  for  the  period  of  the  interest-free",

        "page_content": "financing and by the interest charged to dealer for the remaining period. This remuneration is recognized by Financial Services over the period of the outstanding exposure.\n\nFor  parts  sales,  when  the  Group  provides  its  customers  with  a  right  to  return  a  transferred  product,  revenue  and corresponding cost of sales are recognized for parts that are not expected to be returned. The expected returns are estimated  based  on  an  analysis  of  historical  experience.  The  portion  of  revenue  (and  corresponding  cost  of  sales) related to the parts that are expected to be returned is recognized at the end of the return period. The amount received or receivable that is expected to be returned is recognized as a refund liability, representing the obligation to return the customer's consideration.\n\nFurthermore, at the time of the initial sale, CNH recognizes a return asset for the right to recover the goods returned by the customer. This asset is initially measured at the former carrying amount of the inventory. At each reporting date, both the refund liability and the return asset are remeasured to record for any revisions to the expected level of returns, as well as any decreases in the value of the returned products.\n\n## Rendering of services\n\nRevenues from services provided are primarily comprised of extended warranties and maintenance and repair services and are recognized over the contract period when the costs are incurred, that is when the claims are charged by the dealer. Amounts invoiced to customers for which CNH receives consideration before the performance is satisfied are recognized  as  contract  liability.  These  services  are  either  separately-priced  or  included  in  the  selling  price  of  the equipment. In the second case, revenue for the services is allocated based on the estimated stand-alone selling price. In  the  event  that  the  costs  expected  to  be  incurred  to  satisfy  the  remaining  performance  obligations  exceed  the transaction price, an estimated contract loss is recognized.\n\n## Finance and interest income\n\nFinance and interest income on retail and other notes receivables and finance leases is recorded using the effective yield  method.  Deferred  costs  on  the  origination  of  financing  receivables  are  recognized  as  a  reduction  in  finance revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the effective yield method. When a financial asset becomes credit-impaired  and  is,  therefore,  regarded  as  'Stage  3',  CNH  calculates  interest  income  by  applying  the  effective interest rate to the net amortized cost of the financial asset. If the financial asset cures and is no longer credit-impaired, CNH reverts  to  calculating  interest  income  on  a  gross  basis.  Receivables  are  considered  past  due  if  the  required principal  and  interest  payments  have  not  been  received  as  of  the  date  such  payments  were  due.  Delinquency  is reported on receivables greater than 30 days past due. Charge-offs of principal amounts of receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance at the point when it is estimated that amounts due are deemed uncollectible.\n\n## Rents and other income on operating leases\n\nIncome from operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales comprises the cost of manufacturing products and the acquisition cost of purchased merchandise which has been sold. It includes all directly attributable material and production costs and all production overheads. These include  the  depreciation  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and  the  amortization  of  intangible  assets  relating  to production and write-downs of inventories. Cost of sales also includes freight and insurance costs relating to deliveries to dealers and agency fees in the case of direct sales.\n\nCost of sales also includes provisions made to cover the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of sale to dealer networks or to the end customer.\n\nExpenses which are directly attributable to the Financial Services business, including the interest expense related to their financing as a whole and charges for risk provisions and write-downs, are also reported in cost of sales.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nThis item includes research costs, development costs not eligible for capitalization and the amortization of development costs recognized as assets in accordance with IAS 38.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in the financial statements when there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions for receiving such grants and that the grants themselves will be received. Government grants  are  recognized  as  income  over  the  periods  necessary  to  match  them  with  the  related  costs  which  they  are intended to offset.\n\nThe benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant. The benefit of the below-market rate of interest is measured as the difference between the initial carrying amount of the loan (fair value plus transaction costs) and the proceeds received and is accounted for in accordance with the policies already used for the recognition of government grants.",

        "page_content": "## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group. Taxes on income are recognized in profit or loss except to the extent they relate to items recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, in which case the related tax effects are recognized directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. Provisions for income taxes arising on the distribution of a subsidiary's undistributed profits are only made where there is a current intention to distribute such profits. Deferred taxes are provided using the full liability method. They are calculated on all temporary differences  between  the  tax  base  of  an  asset  or  liability  and  the  carrying  amounts  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements,  except  for  those  arising  from  non-tax-deductible  goodwill  and  for  those  related  to  investments  in subsidiaries  where  it  is  possible  to  control  the  reversal  of  the  differences  and  reversal  will  not  take  place  in  the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets relating to the carry-forward of unused tax losses and tax credits, as well as those  arising  from  temporary  differences,  are  recognized  to  the  extent  it  is  probable  future  profits  will  be  available against which they can be utilized. Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and where there is a legally enforceable right of offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates of the relevant tax jurisdictions that are expected to apply to taxable income during the period or periods in which the temporary differences reverse. The Group recognizes tax liabilities for uncertain tax treatments when tax risks arising from positions taken by the Group are considered probable, assuming the tax authorities have full knowledge of all relevant information when making their examination. In doing so, the Group evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or jointly consider multiple uncertain tax treatments, using the approach that better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. The liabilities recognized correspond to the amounts expected to be paid. Other taxes not based on taxable profits, such as property taxes and taxes on capital, are included in operating expenses.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends payable by the Group are reported as a change in equity in the period in which they are approved by the Company's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ('AGM').\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the Profit/(loss) attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Special voting shares are not included in the earnings per share calculation as they are not eligible for dividends and have only limited economic rights. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is adjusted assuming conversion of dilutive potential common shares.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS which requires to make judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  disclosure  of contingent  assets  and  liabilities,  and  reported  amounts  of  income  and  expenses.  The  estimates  and  related assumptions  are  based  on  available  information  at  the  date  of  preparation  of  the  financial  statements,  historical experience and other relevant factors. Actual results may differ from the estimates.\n\nParticularly  in  light  of  the  current  economic  uncertainty,  developments  may  occur  which  may  differ  from  CNH's estimates  and  assumptions,  and  therefore  might  require  significant  adjustments  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  certain items, which as of the date of these Consolidated Financial Statements cannot be accurately estimated or predicted.\n\nThe principal  items  affected  by  estimates  are  the  allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  receivable  and  inventories,  noncurrent  assets  (tangible  and  intangible  assets),  the  residual  values  of  assets  leased  out  under  operating  lease arrangements, sales allowances, product warranties, pension and other post-employment benefits, deferred tax assets and contingent liabilities.\n\nEstimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of any changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nThe following  are  the  critical  judgments  and  the  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  that  CNH  has  made  in  the process of applying its accounting policies and that may have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  or  that  represent  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n\n## Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nThe allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  for  trade  receivables  and  contract  assets  reflects  CNH's  estimate  of  expected lifetime  credit  losses,  and  it  is  measured  at  an  amount  equal  to  the  present  value  of  the  cash  shortfalls  over  the expected life of the financial asset.\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables from financing activities reflects management's estimate of forward looking  expected  credit  losses  ('ECL')  in  the  retail  and  wholesale  portfolios.  This  requires  considerable  judgement",

        "page_content": "about how changes in economic factors affect ECLs, which is determined on a probability-weighted basis. The ECL model  applies  to  financial  assets  accounted  for  at  amortized  cost  and  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income, lease receivables, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The loss allowances will be measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- \u25aa 12 month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from possible default events within the 12 months after the reporting date; and\n- \u25aa lifetime  ECLs:  these  are  ECLs  that  result  from  all  possible  default  events  over  the  expected  life  of  a  financial instrument.\n\nRefer to Note 18 'Current receivables and Other current financial assets' for additional details on the calculation of allowance for credit losses.\n\n## Allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory\n\nThe allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventory reflects management's estimate of the expected loss in value, and has been determined on the basis of past experience and historical and expected future trends in the used vehicle market. A worsening of the economic and financial situation could cause a further deterioration in conditions in the used vehicle  market  compared  to  that  taken  into  consideration  in  calculating  the  allowances  recognized  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## Recoverability of non-current assets (including goodwill)\n\nNon-current assets include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (including goodwill), investments and other non-current financial assets. The Group reviews the carrying value of non-current assets held and used and that of assets to be disposed of when events and circumstances warrant such a review. For goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives such analysis is carried out at least annually.\n\nThe analysis of the recoverable amount of non-current assets other than goodwill is usually performed using estimates of  future  expected  cash  flows  from  the  use  or  disposal  of  the  asset  and  an  appropriate  discount  rate  in  order  to calculate present value. If the carrying amount is deemed to be impaired, the Group recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated recoverable amount from use or disposal determined by reference to the cash flows included in its most recent business forecasts.\n\nGoodwill impairment test is performed at the cash generating unit level, that have been identified as the segments. The recoverable amount of the cash generating units is determined using multiple valuation methodologies, relying largely on  an  income  approach  (based  on  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows)  but  also  incorporating  value indicators from a market approach. The carrying amount of a cash generating unit is then compared to the recoverable amount to determine if there is an impairment loss. Further details on the goodwill impairment test are included in Note 13 \"Intangible assets\".\n\nIn view of the present economic and financial situation, the Group made the following considerations in respect of its future prospects:\n\n- \u25aa when carrying  out  impairment  testing  of  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  the  Group  took  into  account  its  expected performance in the upcoming years. CNH extended such projections for subsequent years to appropriately cover the period of analysis;\n- \u25aa should the assumptions underlying the forecast deteriorate further, the following is noted: the Group's tangible and intangible  assets  with  a  finite  useful  life  (mostly  development  costs)  relate  to  models  or  products  with  high technological  content  in  line  with  the  latest  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  which  consequently  makes  them competitive  in  the  current  economic  environment,  especially  in  the  more  mature  economies  in  which  particular attention is placed on the eco-sustainability of those types of products. Consequently, despite the fact that the capital goods  sector  is  one  of  the  markets  which  could  be  most  affected  by  a  potential  crisis  in  the  immediate  term, management considers that is highly probable that the life cycle of these products can be lengthened to extend over the  period  of  time  involved  in  a  slower  economic  recovery,  allowing  the  Group  to  achieve  sufficient  cash  flows  to cover the investments, although over a longer period of time.\n\n## Residual values of assets leased out under operating lease arrangements\n\nWe  purchase  equipment  from  our  dealers  and  lease  such  equipment  to  retail  customers  under  operating  leases. Income from these operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease. Our decision on whether or not to offer lease  financing  to  customers  is  based,  in  part,  upon  estimated  residual  values  of  the  leased  equipment,  which  are estimated at the lease inception date and periodically updated. Realization of the residual values, a component in the profitability of a lease transaction, is dependent on our ability to market the equipment at lease termination under the then  prevailing  market  conditions.  Equipment  model  changes  and  updates,  as  well  as  market  strength  and  product acceptance, are monitored and adjustments are made to residual values in accordance with the significance of any",

        "page_content": "such  changes.  Although  realization  is  not  assured,  management  believes  that  the  estimated  residual  values  are realizable.\n\n## Sales allowances\n\nCNH provides sales incentives and discounts to dealers. At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, CNH records an estimate of future sales incentive costs and discounts as a reduction of revenue. These incentives may be based on a dealer's  purchase  volume,  or  on  retail  sales  incentive  programs  and  financing  programs  that  will  be  due  when  the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimated cost of the these programs is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs and field inventory levels. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in \"Net revenues\".\n\n## Product warranties\n\nFor  most  equipment  and  service  parts  sales,  CNH  provides  a  standard  warranty  to  provide  assurance  that  the equipment will function as intended for a specified period of time. At the time a sale is recognized, CNH records the estimated future warranty costs. CNH determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to  the  estimated  amount  of  equipment  that  has  been  sold  to  end-users  and  is  still  under  warranty  based  on  dealer inventories and retail sales. Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. Estimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are based on historical claims rate leveraging the last rolling 12 months and consideration of current quality developments.\n\n## Pension and other post-employment benefits\n\nGroup  companies  sponsor  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits  in  various  countries,  mainly  in  the  United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.\n\nEmployee benefit liabilities, related assets, costs and net interest connected with them are measured on an actuarial basis which requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the net defined benefit liability/asset for the Group. The actuarial method takes into consideration parameters of a financial nature such as the discount rate, the rate for expected return on plan assets, the rate of salary increases and the healthcare costs trend rate and takes into consideration the likelihood of potential future events by using certain demographic parameters such as mortality rates and  dismissal  or  retirement  rates.  The  discount  rates  selected  are  based  on  yields  or  yield  curves  of  high  quality corporate bonds in the relevant market. Trends in healthcare costs are developed on the basis of historical experience, the  near-term  outlook  for  costs  and  likely  long-term  trends.  Rates  of  salary  increases  reflect  the  Group's  long-term actual expectations in the reference market and inflation trends. Changes in any of these assumptions may have an effect on future contributions to the plans.\n\nThe effects resulting from revising the estimates for the above parameters ('re-measurements') are recognized directly in  other  comprehensive  income  without  reclassification  to  profit  or  loss  in  subsequent  years;  refer  to  'Employee benefits' section above for further details.\n\nSignificant future changes in the yields of corporate bonds, other actuarial assumptions referred to above and returns on plan assets may significantly impact the net liability/asset.\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nAt December 31, 2023, CNH had net deferred tax assets, including tax loss carry forwards, of $244 million, of which $244 million are not recognized in the financial statements. The corresponding totals at December 31, 2022 were $534 million and $346 million.\n\nManagement has recognized deferred tax assets it believes are probable to be realized. In determining the amount of deferred tax assets probable to be realized management has considered figures from budgets and plans consistent with  those  used  for  other  purposes  within  CNH,  for  example  impairment  testing,  as  discussed  in  the  paragraph 'Recoverability of non-current assets (including goodwill)' above. CNH believes the amount of recognized deferred tax assets  is  appropriate,  despite  the  risk  of  actual  future  results  potentially  being  less  than  results  included  in  these forecasts, considering many of the recognized net deferred tax assets relate to temporary differences and tax losses which, to a significant extent, may be recovered over an extended time period, but do not expire based on currently enacted tax law. As in all financial reporting periods, CNH assessed the realizability of its various deferred tax assets, which related to multiple tax jurisdictions in all regions of the world.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  of  2023,  we  recognized  a  significant  portion  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  related  to  our operations in the U.K., resulting in a $80 million non-cash tax benefit, as those operations had consistently returned to pre-tax profitability, with that trend anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized substantially all the deferred tax assets related to our agricultural and construction  equipment  operations  in  Italy,  resulting  in  a  $5  million  non-cash  tax  benefit,  as  those  operations  had consistently returned to pre-tax profitability, with that trend anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future.",

Due to the uncertainty inherent in such matters, it is difficult to predict the final outcome of such matters.

In the normal course of business management consults with legal counsel and other experts on matters related to litigation, taxes and other similar contingent liabilities. The Group accrues a liability when it is determined that an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event an adverse outcome is possible or an estimate is not determinable, the matter is disclosed.\n\n## New standards and amendments effective from January 1, 2023\n\n- \u25aa On February 12, 2021, the IASB issued the Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice  Statement  2:  Disclosure  of  Accounting  policies, requiring  companies  to  disclose  the  material  accounting policy  information  rather  than  the  significant  accounting  policies.  Furthermore,  the  amendments  to  IFRS  Practice Statement  2  provide  guidance  on  how  to  apply  the  concept  of  materiality  to  accounting  policy  disclosures.  The amendments are effective from January 1, 2023.

The amendments clarify  how  to  distinguish  changes  in accounting policies (generally also applied retrospectively to past transactions and other past events) from changes in accounting estimates (applied prospectively only to future transactions and other future events). This amendment is effective from January 1, 2023. These amendments had no impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- \u25aa On May 7, 2021, the IASB issued Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) ,  which specifies how companies should account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations.

The requirement that an entity applies the mandatory exception and the requirement to disclose that it has applied the exception may be applied immediately, while remaining disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. These amendments had no impact on these Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company continues to monitor developments in the Pillar Two legislation and is working to evaluate the impacts of this legislation on its longer-term financial position.\n\n## Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not early adopted by the Group\n\nThe main accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet applicable and not early adopted by the Group are the following:\n\n- \u25aa On  October  31,  2022,  the  IASB  has  published  \"Non-current  Liabilities  with  Covenants\" Amendments  to IAS  1  Presentation of Financial Statements, to clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the reporting periods, affect the classification of a liability.

The  amendments  will  be  effective  for  annual  reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n- \u25aa On  June  26,  2023,  the  ISSB  issued IFRS  S1 -General  Requirements  for  Disclosure  of  Sustainability-related Financial Information and IFRS S2 -Climate-related Disclosures. These sustainability standards provide respectively, a set of sustainability-related financial information that is useful to investors regarding the sustainability-related risks and  opportunities  over  the  short,  medium  and  long  term  and  specific  climate-related  disclosures  objectives  and requirements.

The amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025.\n\n## SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group as of December 31, 2023 include CNH Industrial N.V. and 102 consolidated subsidiaries over which CNH Industrial N.V., directly or indirectly, has control. A total of 102 subsidiaries were consolidated at December 31, 2022.\n\nExcluded from consolidation are 9 subsidiaries that are either dormant or generate a negligible volume of business: their proportion of the Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and earnings is immaterial. In particular, 9 of such subsidiaries  are  accounted  for  using  the  cost  method,  and  represent  in  aggregate  less  than  0.01  percent  of  Group revenues, equity and total assets.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\n\nEffective October 12, 2023, CNH closed on its purchase of Hemisphere, a global satellite navigation technology leader, for  a  total  consideration  of  $181  million.  The  acquisition  of  Hemisphere  consolidates  our  guidance  and  connectivity capabilities  to  advance  CNH's  in-house  precision,  automation  and  autonomy  technology  for  the  agriculture  and construction  industries.  At  December  31,  2023,  CNH  recorded  preliminary  estimates  for  the  fair  value  of  assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including $111 million and $51 million in preliminary goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not been finalized as of December 31, 2023. Thus, goodwill associated with the acquisition is subject to adjustments during the measurement period. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the Hemisphere acquisition were  not  material  to  the  Company's  consolidated  results  of  operations.  Additionally,  Hemisphere's  post-acquisition results were not material.\n\nOn March 15, 2023, CNH acquired a controlling interest in Bennamann (ownership interest of 50.0085%) by purchasing an additional 34.4% interest through cash consideration of approximately $51 million. At March 31, 2023, CNH recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including $118 million and $46 million in preliminary goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was not finalized as of December 31, 2023. Thus, goodwill associated with the acquisition is subject to adjustment during the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments were made during the year, reducing goodwill by $3 million, primarily offset by increases in intangible assets as a result of updates of certain of the valuations. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the Bennamann acquisition were not material to the Group's consolidated results of operations. Additionally, Bennamann's post-acquisition results were not material.\n\nOn March 13, 2023, CNH purchased Augmenta. CNH acquired the remaining 89.5% of Augmenta it did not own, for cash  consideration  of  approximately  $80  million  and  a  deferred  payment  of  $10  million.  At  March  31,  2023,  CNH recorded preliminary estimates for the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, including $76 million and $35 million in preliminary goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. The valuation of assets acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  was  not  finalized  as  of  December  31,  2023  Thus,  goodwill  associated  with  the acquisition is subject to adjustment during the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments were recorded during the year, reducing goodwill by $14 million, primarily offset by increases in intangible assets as a result of updates of  certain  of  the  valuations.  Pro  forma  results  of  operations  have  not  been  presented  because  the  effects  of  the Augmenta  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  Group's  consolidated  results  of  operations. Additionally, Augmenta's post-acquisition results were not material.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, CNH acquired Specialty Enterprises LLC, a manufacturer of agricultural spray booms and sprayer boom accessories. Total consideration was approximately $50 million. The results of Specialty Enterprises have been included in the CNH's Agriculture segment.",

Income tax (expense) benefit\n\nCNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  its  subsidiaries  have  substantial  worldwide  operations  and  incur  tax  obligations  in  the jurisdictions  in  which  they  operate.  CNH's  provision  for  income  taxes  as  reported  in  its  consolidated  statements  of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 of $600 million consists almost entirely of income taxes related to subsidiaries of CNH Industrial N.V..\n\nIncome taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n\n| ($ million)                        | 2023    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Current taxes                      | (1,162) | (847)  |\n| Deferred taxes                     | 538     | 80     |\n| Taxes relating to prior periods    | 24      | 9      |\n| Total Income tax (expense) benefit | (600)   | (758)  |\n\nCNH  Industrial  N.V.  is  incorporated  in  the  Netherlands  but  is  a  tax  resident  of  the  United  Kingdom  (\"U.K.\").

The lower tax expense in 2023, as compared to 2022, was largely attributable to items that reduced the tax rate in 2023, including recognition of $80 million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.K., lower profitability in high-tax jurisdictions as a percent of total profit, higher credits and incentives, and the tax benefit related to the sale of CNH Industrial Russia, offset by increases in the tax rate due to discrete tax expense associated with prior periods.\n\nThe tax rate in 2022 was increased by taxes associated with the disposition of Raven's Engineered Films Division and Raven's Aerostar Division and additional reserves for uncertain tax positions, but was decreased by the recognition of $5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in Italy.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, undistributed earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.K. totaled approximately $2 billion ($9  billion  at  December  31,  2022)  for  which  no  deferred  tax  liability  has  been  recorded  because  the  remittance  of earnings from those jurisdictions would incur no tax or such earnings are indefinitely reinvested. CNH has determined the  amount  of  unrecognized  deferred  tax  liability  relating  to  the  $2  billion  undistributed  earnings  was  approximately $224  million  and  was  attributable  to  withholding  taxes  and  incremental  local  country  income  taxes  in  certain jurisdictions. Further, CNH evaluated the undistributed earnings from its joint ventures in which it owned 50% or less and recorded $13 million of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2023. The repatriation of undistributed earnings to the U.K. is generally exempt from U.K. income taxes and as such there is no deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings from non-U.K. jurisdictions.\n\nCNH recognizes in its consolidated statement of financial position within Deferred tax assets, the amount of deferred tax assets less the deferred tax liabilities of the individual consolidated legal entities, where these may be offset.\n\n| The  components  of                                                          | net  deferred  tax  assets   | at  December  31,                             | 2023  and          | 2022                                        | are  as  follows:     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| ($ million)                                                                  | 31, 2022                     | At December  Recognized in  income  statement | Charged to  equity | Translation  differences and  other changes | At December  31, 2023 |\n| Deferred tax assets arising from:                                            |                              |                                               |                    |                                             |                       |\n| Taxed provisions                                                             | 653                          | 209                                           | -

For  this  reason,  the  total  theoretical  future  tax  benefits  arising  from  deductible temporary differences of $1,675 million at December 31, 2023 and of $1,269 million at December 31, 2022, and tax loss carryforwards and tax credits of $267 million at December 31, 2023 and of $266 million at December 31, 2022, were reduced by $244 million at December 31, 2023 and by $346 million at December 31, 2022.\n\nOf the $267 million of loss carryforwards at December 31, 2023 ($266 million at December 31, 2022), $135 million are not  recognized  ($203  million  at  December  31,  2022),  for  a  Net  tax  loss  carryforward  of  $132  million  ($74  million  at December 31, 2022).\n\nTax liabilities primarily include uncertain income tax amounts of $246 million and other tax payables.\n\nCNH has gross tax loss carry forwards in several tax jurisdictions. These tax losses expire as follows: $23 million in 2024; $24 million in 2025; $4 million in 2026; $15 million in 2027; $266 million in 2028 and beyond. CNH also has tax loss carry forwards of approximately $688 million with indefinite lives. CNH has tax credit carry forwards of $45 million of which $5 million will expire in 2026, $3 million will expire in 2027, and $37 million will expire in 2028 and beyond.\n\nCNH files income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. CNH has open tax years from 2006 through 2023. Due to the global nature of CNH business, transfer pricing disputes may arise and CNH may seek correlative relief through competent authority processes. CNH has considered the possibility of correlative relief when booking contingencies related to transfer pricing.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of  reported  profits  (Pillar  Two)  that  has  been  agreed  upon  in  principle  by  over  140  countries.  During  2023,  many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws. The Company continues to monitor developments in the Pillar Two legislation and is working to evaluate the impacts of this legislation on its longerterm financial position.\n\n## 11.

The following table presents the allocation of goodwill across the segments:\n\n| ($ million)                  | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Agriculture                  | 3,470                  | 3,179                  |\n| Construction                 | 47                     | 46                     |\n| Financial Services           | 115                    | 115                    |\n| Goodwill net carrying amount | 3,632                  | 3,340                  |\n\nDuring 2023, the acquisitions of Augmenta, Bennamann and Hemisphere, led to an increase in goodwill for Agriculture of $76 million, $118 million and $111 million, respectively, and to an increase in other intangible assets of $35 million, $46  million  and  $51  million,  respectively.  The  recorded  intangibles  comprised  for  developed  technology,  in-process R&D, and customer relationships. Goodwill related to the acquisitions was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. During the fiscal year 2023, measurement period  adjustments  were  recorded  reducing  goodwill  by  $14  million  and  $3  million  for  Augmenta  and  Bennamann, respectively  and  increasing  other  intangible  assets  by  $12  million  and  $5  million  for  Augmenta  and  Bennamann, respectively.

Thus, goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisitions are subject to adjustment during the measurement period.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if a triggering  event  occurs.  At  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  CNH  completed  its  annual  impairment  assessment  and concluded there were no impairment to goodwill for any of the cash generating units.\n\nCNH determines the recoverable amount of these cash-generating units using multiple valuation methodologies, relying largely on an income approach but also incorporating value indicators from a market approach, with reference to the cash-generating units with the most significant allocated goodwill.\n\nUnder the income approach, CNH calculates the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on several critical management assumptions, including estimates of future sales in the discrete future period, the weighted average cost of capital (discount rate) and terminal value growth rates, and also less significant assumptions such as gross margins, operating costs, income tax rates,  capital  expenditures  and  changes  in  working  capital  requirements.  Discount  rate  assumptions  include  an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective cash-generating units.\n\nThe following discount rates before taxes were selected:\n\n|                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Agriculture        | 13.9 % | 14.7 % |\n| Construction       | n.a.   | n.a.   |\n| Financial Services | 20.7 % | 20.3 % |\n\nExpected  cash  flows  used  under  the  income  approach  are  developed  in  conjunction  with  CNH  budgeting  and forecasting processes. CNH used nine years of expected cash flows for Agriculture, and five years of expected cash flows for Financial Services, as management believes that these periods generally reflect the underlying market cycles for  its  businesses.  Under  the  market  approach,  CNH  estimates  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  Agriculture  cashgenerating  unit,  using  earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation  and  amortization  multiples,  and  estimates  the recoverable  amount  of  the  Financial  Services  cash-generating  unit  using  book  value  multiples.  The  multiples  are derived  from  comparable  publicly-traded  companies  with  similar  operating  and  investment  characteristics  as  the respective  cash-generating  units.  The  guideline  company  method  makes  use  of  market  price  data  of  corporations whose stock is actively  traded  in  a  public,  free  and  open  market,  either  on  an  exchange  or  over-the-counter  basis. Although it  is  clear  no  two  companies  are  entirely  alike,  the  corporations  selected  as  guideline  companies  must  be engaged in the same, or a similar, line of business or be subject to similar financial and business risks, including the opportunity for growth.\n\nA terminal value is included at the end of the projection period used in the discounted cash flow analysis in order to reflect the remaining value that each cash-generating unit is expected to generate. The terminal value represents the present value in the last year of the projection period of all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth  rate  is  a  key  assumption  used  in  determining  the  terminal  value  as  it  represents  the  annual  growth  of  all subsequent cash flows into perpetuity. The terminal value growth rate was 1.0% in 2023 and 2022 for the Agriculture cash-generating unit, and 1.5% in 2023 and 2022 for Financial Services.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  estimated  recoverable  amounts,  (excluding  the  balance  of  the  2022  acquisitions) calculated  using  the  above  method,  of  the  Agriculture  and  Financial  Services  cash-generating  units  exceeded  the carrying  values  by  approximately  118.1%  and  46.1%,  respectively.  Thus,  CNH  did  not  recognize  an  impairment  for these cash-generating units.\n\nThe sum of the recoverable amounts of CNH's cash generating units was in excess of CNH's market capitalization at December 31, 2023. CNH believes that the difference between the recoverable amount and market capitalization is reasonable (in the context of assessing whether any asset impairment exists) when market-based control premiums are taken into consideration.\n\nThe Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of each of the Group cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated.\n\nCNH believes that any reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which the estimated recoverable amount of Agriculture and Financial Services is based, would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the related cash-generating units.\n\nAt the beginning of the financial year the estimated recoverable amount of the Agriculture and Financial Services cashgenerating units exceeded the carrying value by approximately 294% and 75%, respectively.\n\nA  16%  underperformance  against  forecast  sales  growth  rates  for  both  Agriculture  and  Financial  Services  cashgenerating units is considered reasonably possible based on recent experience and would not result in an impairment charge.\n\nTrademarks  and  Other  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are  mainly  attributable  to  Agriculture  and Construction  and  consist  of  acquired  trademarks  and  similar  rights  which  have  no  legal,  contractual,  competitive  or",

No impairment loss was recognized.\n\nFinally,  the  estimates  and  budget  data  to  which  the  above-mentioned  parameters  have  been  applied  are  those determined by management based on past performance and expectations of developments in the markets in which CNH  operates.  Impairment  assessments  inherently  involve  management  judgments  regarding  a  number  of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a cash generating unit's  recoverable  amount,  differences  in  assumptions  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  estimated  recoverable amount  and  could  result  in  a  goodwill  impairment  loss  in  a  future  period.  Circumstances  and  events,  which  could potentially cause further impairment losses, are constantly monitored by CNH.\n\n## Development costs and other intangible assets with finite useful lives\n\nThe amortization of development costs and impairment losses are reported in the income statement as Research and development costs.\n\nDevelopment costs are tested for impairment at the cash-generating unit level.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  are  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  and  tested  for  impairment  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.\n\n## 14.

The terms of retail notes and finance leases generally range from two to seven years, and interest rates vary depending on prevailing market  interest  rates  and  certain  incentive  programs  offered  on  behalf  of  and  sustained  by  Industrial  Activities. Revolving  charge  accounts  are  generally  accompanied  by  higher  interest  rates  than  CNH's  other  retail  financing products, require minimum monthly payments, and do not have pre-determined maturity dates.\n\nWholesale  receivables  arise  primarily  from  dealer  floorplan  financing,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  from  the  financing  of dealer operations. Under the standard terms of the wholesale receivable agreements, these receivables typically have 'interest-free' periods of up to twelve months and stated original maturities of up to twenty-four months, with repayment accelerated upon the sale by the dealer of the underlying equipment. For the 'interest-free' period, Financial Services is compensated by Industrial Activities based on market interest rates. After the expiration of any 'interest-free' period, interest is charged to dealers on outstanding balances until CNH receives payment in full. The 'interest-free' periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. CNH evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their credit worthiness. CNH may be obligated to repurchase the dealer's equipment upon  cancellation  or  termination  of  the  dealer's  contract  for  such  causes  as  change  in  ownership,  closeout  of  the business, or default. There were no significant losses in 2023 and 2022 relating to the termination of dealer contracts.\n\nFinance lease receivables mainly relate to equipment leased out under finance lease arrangements. The interest rate implicit in the lease is determined at the commencement of the lease for the whole lease term. The average interest rate implicit in total finance lease receivables varies depending on prevailing market interest rates.\n\nThe item may be analyzed as follows stated gross of an allowance of $19 million at December 31, 2023 ($34 million at December 31, 2022):\n\n| ($ million)                                                      | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Less than one year                                               | 99                     | 93                     |\n| One to two years                                                 | 71                     | 65                     |\n| Two to three years                                               | 54                     | 59                     |\n| Three to four years                                              | 40                     | 36                     |\n| Four to five years                                               | 26                     | 23                     |\n| More than five years                                             | 9                      | 9                      |\n| Total Undiscounted receivables for future minimum lease payments | 299                    | 285                    |\n| Unearned finance income                                          | (51)                   | (48)                   |\n| Present value of future minimum lease payments                   | 248                    | 237                    |\n\nFinancing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and construction business sectors. On a geographic basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. CNH typically retains, as collateral, a security interest in the equipment associated with retail and wholesale receivables, while revolving charge accounts are generally not related to or secured by an identified piece of equipment.\n\n## Transfers of financial receivables\n\nAs part of its overall funding strategy, the Group periodically transfers certain receivables into special purpose entities (\"SPEs\") as part of its asset backed securitization (\"ABS\") programs or into factoring transactions.\n\nThe SPEs finance the purchase of receivables by issuing asset-backed securities (i.e., securities whose repayment and interest flow depend upon the cash flow generated by the portfolio). Asset-backed securities are divided into classes according to their degree of seniority and rating: the most senior classes are placed with investors on the market; the junior class, whose repayment is subordinated to the senior classes, is normally subscribed by the seller.",

In  accordance  with  IFRS  10  Consolidated Financial Statements ,  all  securitization  vehicles  are  included  in  the scope of consolidation because the subscription of the junior asset-backed securities by the seller implies its control in substance over the structured entity.\n\nFactoring  transactions  may  be  either  with  recourse  or  without  recourse;  certain  without  recourse  transfers  include deferred  payment  clauses  (for  example,  when  the  payment  by  the  factor  of  a  minor  part  of  the  purchase  price  is dependent on the total amount collected from the receivables), requiring first loss cover, meaning that the transferor takes priority participation in the losses, or requires a significant exposure to the cash flows arising from the transferred receivables  to  be  retained.

At December 31, 2022, the amount of discounted receivables and bills without recourse with due dates beyond that date, was $17 million.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nCNH's allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio products: retail and wholesale. A portfolio product is the level at which CNH develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. Further, the class of receivables by which CNH evaluates its portfolio products is by geographic region. Typically, CNH's receivables within a geographic region have similar risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring risk. These classes align with management reporting.\n\nCNH utilizes  three  categories  for  receivables  from  financing  activities  that  reflect  their  credit  risk  and  how  the  loss provision is determined.\n\n| Internal risk grade   | IFRS 9 classification   | Definition                                                                                                                | Basis for recognition of  expected credit loss provision   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performing            | Stage 1                 | Low risk of default; payments are generally  less than 30 days past due                                                   | 12 month expected credit losses                            |\n| Performing            | Stage 2                 | Significant increase in credit risk; payments  generally between 31 and 90 days past due                                  | Lifetime expected credit losses                            |\n| Non-performing        | Stage 3                 | Accounts are credit impaired and/or a legal  action has been initiated; payments generally  greater than 90 days past due | Lifetime expected credit losses                            |\n\nThe Group accounts for its credit risk by appropriately providing for expected credit losses on a timely basis. In calculating the expected credit loss rates, CNH considers historical loss rates for each category of customers and adjusts for forward looking macroeconomic data.\n\nIn calculating the expected credit losses, CNH's calculations depend on whether the receivable has been individually identified as being impaired. The first component of the allowance for credit losses covers the receivables specifically reviewed  by  management  for  which  CNH  has  determined  it  is  probable  that  it  will  not  collect  all  of  the  contractual principal and interest.",

        "page_content": "Receivables are individually reviewed for impairment based on, among other items, amounts outstanding, days past due and prior  collection  history.  Expected  credit  losses  are  measured  by  considering:  the  unbiased  and  probabilityweighted amount; the time value of money; and reasonable and supportable information (available without undue costs or  effort)  at  the  reporting  date  about  past  events,  current  conditions  and  forecasts  of  future  economic  conditions. Expected credit losses are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of each financial asset.\n\nThe  second  component  of  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  covers  all  receivables  that  have  not  been  individually reviewed for impairment. The allowance for these receivables is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by financial product. The allowance for wholesale and retail credit losses is based on loss forecast models that consider a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, historical loss experience, collateral value, portfolio balance and delinquency. The loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis. The calculation is adjusted for forward looking macroeconomic  factors.  In  addition,  qualitative  factors  that  are  not  fully  captured  in  the  loss  forecast  models  are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.\n\nCharge-offs of principal amounts of receivables outstanding are deducted from the allowance at the point when it is estimated that amounts due are deemed uncollectible.\n\n| Allowance  for  credit  losses         | activity  for         | the  years                   | ended                     | December  Retail   | 31,                       | 2023                    | is  as                   | follows: Wholesale   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| ($ million) Opening balance            | Stage 1 12 months  94 | ECL Stage 2 Lifetime  ECL 15 | Stage 3 Lifetime  ECL 108 | Total 217          | Stage 1 12 months  ECL 29 | Stage 2 Lifetime  ECL -

Receivables are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not yet been received as of the date such payments were due. Delinquency is reported on financing receivables greater than 30 days past due. Non-performing financing receivables represent receivables for which CNH has ceased accruing finance income. These receivables are generally 90 days past due. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrued interest is charged-off to interest income. Interest income charged-off was not material for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nInterest  accrual  is  resumed  if  the  receivable  becomes  contractually  current  and  collection  becomes  probable. Previously suspended income is recognized at that time.",

As a collateral-based lender, CNH typically  will  repossess  collateral  in  lieu  of  restructuring  receivables. As  such,  for  retail  receivables,  concessions  are typically provided based on bankruptcy court proceedings. For wholesale receivables, concessions granted may include extended contract maturities, inclusion of interest-only periods, modification of a contractual interest rate to a below market interest rate and waiving of interest and principal.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, CNH's TDRs for retail and wholesale receivables were immaterial.\n\n## Other current receivables\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Other current receivables mainly consisted of other tax receivables for VAT and other indirect taxes of $294 million ($308 million at December 31, 2022), and receivables from employees of $19 million ($15 million at December 31, 2022).\n\n## Other current financial assets\n\nAt December 31, 2023, and 2022, Other current financial assets primarily consist of current securities and short-term deposits and investments.\n\nRefer to Note 30 'Information on financial risks' for additional information on the credit risk to which CNH is exposed and the way it is managed by the Group.\n\n## 19. Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities\n\nThese items consist of derivative financial instruments measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.\n\nCNH utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivatives used as hedges are effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and are designated as a hedge  at  the  inception  of  the  derivative  contract.  CNH  does  not  hold  or  enter  into  derivative  or  other  financial",

The credit and market risk related to derivatives is reduced through diversification among various counterparties, utilizing mandatory termination clauses and/or collateral support agreements. Derivative instruments are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting only when, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, there is an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from the  economic  relationship,  and  the  hedging  relationship's  hedging  ratio  reflects  the  actual  quantity  of  the  hedging instrument  and  the  hedged  item.  Hedge  effectiveness  is  determined  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship  and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nFurther description of the risk management exposures and strategies for interest rate and currency risk is presented in Note  30  'Information  on  financial  risks',  paragraph  'Market  risk'  together  with  sensitivity  analysis  assessing  the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currencies.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Derivatives\n\nCNH has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps in order to manage and preserve the economic value of cash flows in a currency different from the functional currency of the relevant legal entity. CNH conducts its business on a global basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies and hedges foreign currency exposures arising from various receivables, liabilities, and expected inventory purchases and sales. Derivative instruments utilized to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with anticipated inventory purchases and sales in foreign currencies are designated as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses on these instruments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss) and recognized in earnings when the related transaction occurs.\n\nFor hedging cash flows in a currency different from the functional currency, the hedge relationship reflects the hedge ratio of 1:1, which means that relationship is characterized by the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item moving in the opposite direction as a result of the common underlying of hedged risk.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u25aa the effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the foreign exchange derivatives, which  is  not  reflected  in  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  cash  flow  attributable  to  the  change  in  the exchange rates, and\n- \u25aa changes in timing of the hedged transaction.\n\nIneffectiveness  related  to  these  hedge  relationships  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  in  the  line 'Financial income/(expenses)' and was not significant for all periods presented. The maturity of these instruments does not exceed 24 months and the after-tax gains/(losses) deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) that will  be recognized in net revenues and cost of sales over the next twelve months, assuming foreign exchange rates remain  unchanged,  is  approximately  $(17)  million.  If  a  derivative  instrument  is  terminated  because  the  hedge relationship is no longer effective or because the hedged item is a forecasted transaction that is no longer determined to  be  probable,  the  cumulative  amount  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  is  recognized immediately in earnings. Such amounts were insignificant in all periods presented.\n\nCNH also uses forwards and swaps to hedge certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Such derivatives  are  considered  economic  hedges  and  not  designated  as  hedging  instruments.  The  changes  in  the  fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in income in 'Financial income/(expenses)' and are expected to offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the exposures being managed.\n\nAll of CNH's foreign exchange derivatives are considered Level 2 as the fair value is calculated using market data input and can be compared to actively traded derivatives. The notional amount of CNH's foreign exchange derivatives was $6.1 billion and $5.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Interest Rate Derivatives\n\nCNH has entered into interest rate derivatives (swaps and caps) in order to manage interest rate exposures arising in the normal course of business. Interest rate derivatives that have been designated as cash flow hedges are being used by CNH to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates related to existing debt and anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt in future periods. Gains and losses on these instruments, to the extent that the hedge relationship has been effective, are deferred  in  other  comprehensive  income/(loss)  and  recognized  in  'Financial  income/(expenses)'  over  the  period  in which  CNH  recognizes  interest  expense  on  the  related  debt.  The  after-tax  gains  (losses)  deferred  in  other comprehensive income/(loss) that will be recognized in interest expense over the next twelve months are insignificant.\n\nInterest  rate  derivatives  that  have  been  designated  as  fair  value  hedge  relationships  have  been  used  by  CNH  to mitigate the volatility in the fair value of existing fixed rate bonds and medium-term notes due to changes in floating interest rate benchmarks. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in 'Financial income/(expenses)' in the",

Unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes in these instruments are recognized directly in income. Net gains and losses on these instruments were insignificant for the years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nAll of CNH's interest rate derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are considered Level 2. The fair market  value  of  these  derivatives  is  calculated  using  market  data  input  and  can  be  compared  to  actively  traded derivatives. The total notional amount of CNH's interest rate derivatives was approximately $9 billion and $6.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, as a result of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, CNH renegotiated its contract terms on its interest rate derivatives, by changing the floating interest rate swap from LIBOR to SOFR. In accordance with  the  EU-IFRS  amendments  on  this  topic  included  in  IFRS  9,  these  changes  can  be  treated  under  a  practice expedient.\n\nCNH elected to apply the practical expedient that enables the company to account for a change in the contractual cash flows that are required by the reform, by updating the effective interest rate to reflect the change in an interest rate benchmark, without de-designation and apply no change to the cumulative basis adjustment reflected in earning. The elections did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Financial statement impact of CNH derivatives\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  gross  impact  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivatives  had  on  other comprehensive income and profit or loss during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n| ($ million)                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fair value hedges                                                 |        |        |\n| Interest rate derivatives - Financial income/(expenses)           | (7)    | (104)  |\n| Gains/(losses) on hedged items - Financial income/(expenses)      | 7      | 104    |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                  |        |        |\n| Recognized in Other comprehensive income (effective portion):     |        |        |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives                                      | (65)   | (162)  |\n| Interest rate derivatives                                         | (82)   | 57     |\n| Reclassified from other comprehensive income (effective portion): |        |        |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives - Net revenues                       | (7)    | (1)    |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives - Cost of sales                      | (33)   | (219)  |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives - Financial income/(expenses)        | 7      | 2      |\n| Interest rate derivatives - Cost of sales                         | 6      | 30     |\n| Not designated as hedges                                          |        |        |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives - Financial income/(expenses)        | (67)   | (16)   |",

Terms and Conditions.\n\nFurthermore, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company delivered 1.9 million and 0.6 million common shares, respectively, under the Company's stock compensation plan, primarily due to the vesting or exercise of share-based awards. See paragraph below 'Share-based compensation' for further discussion.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain a special capital reserve to be credited against the share premium exclusively for the purpose of facilitating any issuance or cancellation of special voting shares. The special voting shares do not carry any entitlement to the balance of the special capital reserve. The Board of Directors is authorized to resolve upon (i) any distribution out of the special capital reserve to pay up special voting shares or (ii) re-allocation of amounts to credit or debit the special capital reserve against or in favor of the share premium reserve.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain a separate dividend reserve for the special voting shares. The special voting shares shall not carry any entitlement to any other reserve of the Company. Any distribution out of the special voting shares dividend reserve or the partial or full release of such reserve will require a prior proposal from the Board of Directors and a subsequent resolution of the general meeting of holders of special voting shares.\n\nFrom the profits, shown in the annual accounts, as adopted, such amounts shall be reserved as the Board of Directors may determine.\n\nThe profits remaining thereafter shall first be applied to allocate and add to the special voting shares dividend reserve an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate nominal amount of all outstanding special voting shares. The calculation of the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve shall occur on a timeproportionate basis. If special voting shares are issued during the financial year to which the allocation and addition pertains, then the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve in respect of these newly  issued  special  voting  shares  shall  be  calculated  as  from  the  date  on  which  such  special  voting  shares  were issued until the last day of the financial year concerned. The special voting shares shall not carry any other entitlement to the profits.\n\nAny  profits  remaining  thereafter  shall  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  for  distribution  of dividend  on  the  common  shares  only  subject  to  the  provision  that  the  distribution  of  profits  shall  be  made  after  the adoption of the annual accounts, from which it appears that the same is permitted.\n\nSubject  to  a  prior  proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  may  declare  and  pay dividends in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors having been designated as the body competent to pass a resolution for the issuance of shares in accordance with Article 5 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may decide that a distribution shall be made in the form of shares or that shareholders shall be given the option to receive a distribution either in cash or in the form of shares.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  winding-up,  a  resolution  to  dissolve  the  Company  can  only  be  passed  by  a  general  meeting  of shareholders pursuant to a prior proposal of the Board of Directors. In the event a resolution is passed to dissolve the Company, the  Company  shall  be  wound-up  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  unless  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders would resolve otherwise.\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders shall appoint and decide on the remuneration of the liquidators.",

No distribution of profits may be made to the Company itself for shares that the Company holds in its own share capital.\n\nThe Board of Directors has the power to declare one or more interim dividends, provided that the requirements of the Article 22 paragraph 5 of the Articles of Association are duly observed as evidenced by an interim statement of assets and liabilities as referred to in Article 2:105 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and provided further that the policy of the Company on additions to reserves and dividends is duly observed. The provisions of the Article 22 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Articles of Association shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nThe Board of Directors may determine that dividends or interim dividends, as the case may be, shall be paid, in whole or in part, from the Company's share premium reserve or from any other reserve, provided that payments from reserves may only be made to the shareholders that are entitled to the relevant reserve upon the dissolution of the Company.\n\nDividends and other distributions of profit shall be made payable in the manner and at such date(s) - within four weeks after declaration thereof - and notice thereof shall be given, as the general meeting of shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, the Board of Directors shall determine, provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the right to determine that each payment of annual dividends in respect of shares be deferred for a period not exceeding five consecutive annual periods. Dividends and other distributions of profit, which have not been collected within five years and one day after the same have become payable, shall become the property of the Company.\n\n## Effects of the Demerger on the share capital of CNH Industrial N.V.\n\nOn January 1, 2022, the share capital of CNH Industrial N.V. did not change as result of the Demerger. CNH Industrial N.V. also did not receive any shares in Iveco Group N.V. as a part of the Demerger, as the portion of the shares held in treasury buy CNH Industrial N.V. was not eligible to be part of the Demerger and consequent allotment of Iveco Group N.V. shares.\n\n## Policies and processes for managing capital\n\nThe objectives identified by the Group for managing capital are to create value for shareholders as a whole, safeguard business continuity and support the growth of the Group. As a result, the Group endeavors to maintain an adequate level  of  capital  that  at  the  same  time  enables  it  to  obtain  a  satisfactory  economic  return  for  its  shareholders  and maintain access to external sources of funds, including by means of achieving an adequate rating.\n\nThe Group regularly monitors its debt/equity ratio and in particular the level of net debt and the generation of cash from Industrial Activities.\n\nTo reach these objectives the Group aims at a continuous improvement in the profitability of the business in which it operates. Further, in general, the Group may sell part of its assets to reduce the level of its debt, while the Board of Directors  may  make  proposals  to  shareholders  in  general  meeting  to  reduce  or  increase  share  capital  or,  where permitted by law, to distribute reserves.\n\nThe Company shall at all times have the authority to acquire fully paid-up shares in its own share capital, provided that such acquisition is made for no consideration ( om niet ).\n\nThe Company shall also have authority to acquire fully paid-up shares in its own share capital for consideration, if:\n\n- \u25aa the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  has  authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  to  make  such  acquisition  -  which authorization shall be valid for no more than eighteen months - and has specified the number of shares which may be acquired, the manner in which they may be acquired and the limits within which the price must be set;\n- \u25aa the Company's equity, after deduction of the acquisition price of the relevant shares, is not less than the sum of the paid-up portion of the share capital and the reserves that have to be maintained by provision of law; and",

Such own shares must be officially listed on a price list of an exchange.\n\nThe preceding provisions shall not apply to shares which the Company acquires under universal title of succession ( algemene titel ).\n\nNo voting rights may be exercised in the general meeting of shareholders for any share held by the Company or any of its  subsidiaries.  Beneficiaries  of  a  life  interest  on  shares  that  are  held  by  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  are  not excluded from exercising the voting rights provided that the life interest was created before the shares were held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Company or any of its subsidiaries may not exercise voting rights for shares in respect of which it holds a usufruct.\n\nAny acquisition by the Company of shares that have not been fully paid up shall be void.\n\nAny disposal of shares held by the Company requires approval of the Board of Directors. Such approval shall also stipulate the conditions of the disposal.\n\n## Loyalty voting program\n\nIn order to reward long-term ownership of the Company's common shares and promote stability of its shareholder base, the Articles  of Association  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  provide  for  a  loyalty-voting  program  that  grants  eligible  long-term shareholders the equivalent of two votes for each CNH Industrial N.V. common share that they hold. This has been accomplished through the issuance of special voting shares.\n\nA shareholder may at any time elect to participate in the loyalty voting program by requesting the registration of all or some of the common shares held by such shareholder in a separate register (the 'Loyalty Register') of the Company. If such common shares have been registered in the Loyalty Register for an uninterrupted period of three years in the name of the same shareholder, such shares will become 'Qualifying Common Shares' and the relevant shareholder will be entitled to receive one special voting share for each such Qualifying Common Share which can be retained only for so long as the shareholder retains the associated common share and registers it in the Loyalty Register.\n\nShareholders are not required to pay any amount to the Company in connection with the allocation of the special voting shares.\n\nThe  common  shares  are  freely  transferable,  while,  special  voting  shares  are  transferable  exclusively  in  limited circumstances and they are not listed on the NYSE. In particular, at any time, a holder of common shares that are Qualifying Common Shares who wants to transfer such common shares other than in limited specified circumstances (e.g., transfers to affiliates or relatives through succession, donation or other transfers) must request a de-registration of such  Qualifying  Common  Shares  from  the  Loyalty  Register.  After  de-registration  from  the  Loyalty  Register,  such common shares no longer qualify as Qualifying Common Shares and, as a result, the holder of such common shares is required to transfer the special voting shares associated with the transferred common shares to the Company for no consideration.\n\nThe special voting shares have minimal economic entitlements as the purpose of the special voting shares is to grant long-term  shareholders  with  an  extra  voting  right  by  means  of  granting  an  additional  special  voting  share,  without granting such shareholders with any additional economic rights. However, as a matter of Dutch law, such special voting shares cannot be fully excluded from economic entitlements. Therefore, the Articles of Association provide that only a minimal  dividend  accrues  to  the  special  voting  shares,  which  is  not  distributed,  but  allocated  to  a  separate  special dividend reserve. The impact of this special dividend reserve on the earnings per share of the common shares is not material.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nIn order to maintain the necessary operating flexibility over an adequate time period, including the implementation of the program in place, on April 13, 2022, the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') granted to the Board of Directors the authority to acquire common shares in the capital of the Company through stock exchange trading on the Euronext Milan and the NYSE or otherwise for a period of 18 months. The program reached its conclusion on November 6, 2023. Upon the completion of the program, on November 7, 2023, CNH's Board of Directors approved a new share buy-back program. Under the new program, CNH will repurchase up to $1 billion worth of its common shares between November 8, 2023 and March 1, 2024.\n\nUnder such authorization the Board's authority is limited to a maximum of up to 10% of the issued common shares as of  the  date  of  the  AGM  and,  in  compliance  with  applicable  rules  and  regulations,  subject  to  a  maximum  price  per",

The launch of any new program will be subject to a further resolution of the Board of Director. In any event, such programs may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason and without previous notice, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 55,198,371 shares of its common stock on the Euronext  Milan  and  on  multilateral  trading  facilities  under  the  buy-back  program.

Depending on market and business conditions and other factors, the Company may continue or suspend purchasing its common stock at any time without notice.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired, for no consideration, 72,343 special voting shares following the de-registration of qualifying common shares from the Loyalty Register, net of the transfer and allocation of special voting shares to those shareholders whose qualifying common shares became eligible to receive special voting shares  after  the  uninterrupted  three-year  registration  period  in  the  Loyalty  Register.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, CNH recognized a total tax  benefit  relating  to  share-based  compensation  expense  of  $14  million  and  $11  million,  respectively.  As  of December  31,  2023,  CNH  had  unrecognized  share-based  compensation  expense  related  to  non-vested  awards  of approximately $103 million based on current assumptions related to achievement of specified performance objectives, when applicable. Unrecognized share-based compensation costs will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.\n\nCNH's equity awards are governed by the CNH Industrial N.V. Equity Incentive Plan ('CNH EIP') and CNH Industrial N.V. Directors' Compensation Plan ('CNH DCP').\n\nAt the AGM held on April 16, 2014, the Company's shareholders approved the adoption of the CNH EIP, an umbrella program defining the terms and conditions for any subsequent long-term incentive program. The EIP allows grants of the following specific types of equity awards to any current or prospective executive director, officer, employee of, or service provider to, CNH: stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted share units, restricted stock, performance",

        "page_content": "shares or performance share units and other stock-based awards that are payable in cash, common shares or any combination thereof subject to the terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee.\n\nIn February 2020, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of up to 50 million common shares under the EIP. At the AGM on April 16, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the issuance of up to 7 million common shares to executive directors under the 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (described below) in accordance with and under the EIP.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Demerger,  any  awards  outstanding  under  the  CNH  EIP,  and  held  by  directors,  officers  and  other employees vesting in 2022 were accelerated in December 2021 and the related equity incentives were issued by CNH in CNH stock. As a result of the Demerger, remaining outstanding awards vesting in 2023 and 2024 were converted to the entity the participant is employed with post Demerger. As such, for Iveco Group employees, the underlying stock awards under the CNH EIP vesting in 2023 and 2024 were converted at the effective date of the Demerger, subject to its  terms,  to  Common Shares of Iveco Group N.V.. The conversion of the CNH EIP includes appropriate adjustment mechanisms to ensure that the value of the unvested awards granted to all the beneficiaries under such plan remain unchanged pre and post demerger for employees in both the Iveco Group N.V. and CNH Industrial N.V..\n\n## Performance Share Units (\"PSU\")\n\n## 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn  February  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  2021-2023  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan  under  the  EIP.  In December 2020, CNH issued a new grant of PSUs to its key executive officers and select employees with the financial performance goals covering a three-year period culminating with a cliff vest date of February 28, 2024. Two internal financial  metrics,  Industrial  ROIC  (the  ratio  of  Industrial  Activities  Adjusted  EBIT  (after-tax)  over  Average  Industrial Invested Capital) and Adjusted EPS (the net profit (loss) excluding any nonrecurring items (after-tax), divided by the weighted average outstanding number of common shares on a fully diluted basis), weighted 50% each, and a multiplierbased on CNH's percentile ranking of Total Shareholder Return among a comparator group, will determine the total PSUs earned. The internal financial metrics have a payout factor of up to 200% and the market based TSR determinant has a payout factor of 125%. These metrics are considered performance vesting conditions. As such, compensation cost will be accrued based on whether it is considered probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. The fair value of the PSU awards issued under this plan will be calculated by using the CNH Industrial N.V. stock price on the grant date adjusted for the present value of future dividends that would not be received during the vesting period.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020 CNH issued 5 million PSUs. The total number of shares that will eventually be issued may vary from the original estimate due to forfeiture or the level of achievement of the performance goals. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2020 was $10.83 per share. The 2020 PSU awards distributed under this plan were issued on December 4, 2020 to key executive officers and select employees and on December 14, 2020 to the Chair of CNH. During 2021, CNH issued an additional 3 million PSUs to key executive officers and select employees. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2021 was $13.13 per share.\n\nEffective  January  1,  2022,  the  Iveco  Group  Business  was  separated  from  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  by  way  of  a  legal statutory demerger to Iveco Group N.V. (the Demerger) and Iveco Group became a public listed company independent from CNH. As part of the Demerger, any awards outstanding under the CNH Equity Incentive Plan (or 'CNH EIP'), and held  by  directors,  officers  and  other  employees  vesting  in April  2022  were  accelerated  in  December  2021  and  the related  equity  incentives  were  issued  by  CNH  in  CNH  stock.  Further,  as  a  result  of  the  Demerger,  remaining outstanding  awards  vesting  in  2023  and  2024  were  converted  to  the  entity  the  participant  is  employed  with  post Demerger. The conversion of the CNH EIP includes appropriate adjustment mechanisms to ensure that the value of the unvested  awards  granted  to  all  the  beneficiaries  under  such  plan  remain  unchanged  pre  and  post  demerger  for employees in both the Iveco Group N.V. and CNH Industrial N.V..\n\n## 2022 & 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the Board of Directors approved the 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2023-2025 Long Term Incentive Plan, respectively, under the EIP. Just as the previous 2021-2023 EIP, both the 2022 and 2023 Long Term Incentive Plan feature that same three year vesting period, two internal financial metrics, and financial multiplier as  the  2021  Long-Term  Incentive  plan.  Additionally  the  two  internal  financial  metrics  and  financial  multipliers  are calculated as specified in the 2021 Long Term Incentive plan. However, differences between all plans exist in regards to the  performance  achievement  threshold  for  both  ROIC  and  EPS.  Furthermore,  the  2022  and  2023  plans  feature  a smaller list of comparator groups for its TSR percentile ranking when compared to the 2021 plan. In 2024 the Board of Directors approved the 2024-2026 Long-Term Incentive Plan under the EIP.\n\nIn  2022  and  2023  CNH  issued  2.5  million  and  2.8  million  PSUs,  respectively.  The  total  number  of  shares  that  will eventually  be  issued  may  vary  from  the  original  estimate  due  to  forfeiture  or  the  level  of  achievement  of  the performance goals. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2022 and 2023 was $14.04 and $12.29 per share, respectively.",

The  fair  value  of  the  award  is measured using the CNH Industrial N.V. stock price on the grant date adjusted for the present value of future dividends that employees will not receive during the vesting period. The RSUs vest upon a time-based service requirement.\n\n## 2021-2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nOn December 4, 2020, CNH issued two separate RSU grants to key executive officers and select employees. Under the first RSU grant, 1.1 million RSUs were awarded to select employees with a weighted average fair value of $11.43. These awards vested on December 31, 2020. Under the second RSU grant, 3.3 million RSUs were awarded to select employees and are set to vest in three equal installments over a three-year period. The first tranche which consisted of 1.1 million RSUs was set to vest on April 30, 2022. The second and third tranches are set to vest on April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2024, respectively. The weighted average fair value for the December 2020 three tranche award group are $11.23, $11.02, and $10.82, respectively.\n\nOn  December  14,  2020,  CNH  issued  120  thousand  RSUs  to  the  Chair  of  CNH,  of  which  17  thousand  vested  on December 31, 2020. The weighted average fair value for these awards is $10.96. The remaining 103 thousand RSUs vest in three equal installments on April 30, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The fair value for these awards are $10.76, $10.55 and $10.35, respectively.\n\nDuring 2021, CNH issued an additional 1.5 million RSUs to select employees and key executive officers. Of the awards that were issued, 1.2 million are set to vest in three equal installments over a three year period. The first tranche, which consists of 0.4 million RSUs, was set to vest on April 30, 2022. The second and third tranches are set to vest on April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2024, respectively. The weighted average fair value of these awards are $14.04 per share for the first  tranche,  $13.84  per  share  for  the  second  tranche,  and  $13.66  per  share  for  the  third  tranche.  The  remaining awards issued in 2021 had a cumulative weighted average fair value of $16.73. In 2021, CNH, in anticipation of the Demerger, accelerated the vesting of awards with a vest date of April 31, 2022, to December 1, 2021, excluding shares awarded to the CEO and Chairperson. As a result, CNH recorded $5 million of expense due to the acceleration of these awards. The weighted average fair value of the shares vested during 2021 was $11.75 per share.\n\n## 2022-2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2022 and 2023 CNH issued 2 million and 2 million RSUs, respectively. The total number of shares that will eventually be issued may vary from the original estimate due to forfeiture or the level of achievement of the performance goals. The weighted average fair value of the awards that were issued in 2022 and 2023 was $13.90 and $11.87 per share, respectively.",

Provisions for employee benefits\n\nCNH provides pension, healthcare and insurance plans and other post-employment benefits to their employees and retirees,  either  directly  or  by  contributing  to  independently  administered  funds. The  way  these  benefits  are  provided varies according to the legal, fiscal and economic conditions of each country in which the Group operates, the benefits generally being based on the employees' remuneration and years of service. CNH provides post-employment benefits under defined contribution and defined benefit plans.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  contribution  plans,  CNH  makes  contributions  to  publicly  or  privately  administered  pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been made, CNH has no further payment obligations. CNH recognizes the contribution cost when the employees have rendered their service and includes this cost by function in Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative costs and Research and development costs. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, CNH recorded expenses of $423 million and $351 million, respectively, for its defined contribution plans, inclusive of social security contributions.\n\nDefined benefit plans may be unfunded, or they may be wholly or partly funded by contributions made by an entity, and sometimes by its employees, into an entity, or fund, that is legally separate from the employer from which the employee benefits are paid. Benefits are generally payable under these plans after the completion of employment. Defined benefit plans are classified by CNH on the basis of the type of benefit provided as follows: Pension plans, Healthcare plans, and Other post-employment benefits.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nPension obligations primarily comprise the obligations of CNH's pension plans in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany.\n\nUnder these plans, contributions are made to a separate fund (trust) that independently administers the plan assets. CNH's funding policy is to contribute amounts to the plan equal to the amounts required to meet the minimum funding requirements pursuant to the laws of the applicable jurisdictions. The significant pension plans that we are required to fund are in the United States and the U.K.. CNH may also choose to make discretionary contributions in addition to the funding requirements. To the extent that a fund is overfunded, the Group is not required to make further contribution to the plan in respect of minimum performance requirements so long as the fund is in surplus.\n\n## Healthcare plans\n\nHealthcare  plan  obligations  comprise  obligations  for  healthcare  and  insurance  plans  granted  to  CNH  employees working in the U.S. and Canada. These plans generally cover employees retiring on or after reaching the age of 55 who have  completed  at  least  10  years  of  employment.  CNH  U.S.  salaried  and  non-represented  hourly  employees  and Canadian employees hired after January 1, 2001 and January 1, 2002, respectively, are not eligible for postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits under the CNH plans. These benefits may be subject to deductibles, co-payment provisions and other limitations, and CNH has reserved the right to change or terminate these benefits, subject to the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement. These plans are not required to be funded. However, beginning in 2007,  CNH  began  making  contributions  on  a  voluntary  basis  to  a  separate  and  independently  managed  fund established to finance the North American healthcare plans.\n\nIn 2021, CNH communicated plan changes for the U.S. retiree medical plan. The plan changes resulted in a reduction of the plan liability by $100 million, recognized immediately in profit or loss as a pre-tax plan amendment gain of the same amount.\n\nEffective January 1, 2022, post-retirement medical coverage for certain U.S. employees who retired prior to December 2004  was  transitioned  to  an  individual  marketplace.  In August  2022,  CNH  settled  the  benefits  obligation  related  to RHRA benefits for this group. In connection with this transaction, $27 million of plan obligations and plan assets were transferred.",

Until December 31, 2006, Italian  companies with more than 50 employees were required to accrue for benefits paid to employees upon them leaving  Italian  legal  entities.  The  scheme  has  since  changed  to  a  defined  contribution  plan.  The  obligation  on  our consolidated  balance  sheet  represents  the  residual  reserve  for  years  until  December  31,  2006.  Loyalty  bonus  is accrued for employees who have reached certain service seniority and are generally settled when employees leave the company.

CNH selects its assumed discount rates based on the consideration of equivalent yields on high-quality fixed income investments at the measurement date. The assumed discount  rate  is  used  to  discount  future  benefit  obligations  back  to  today's  dollars.  The  discount  rates  for  the  U.S., European, U.K. and Canadian obligations are based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represent the rates at which the benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of the measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing CNH's projected cash flows against a high-quality bond yield curve, mainly calculated using a wide population of AA-grade corporate bonds subject to minimum amounts outstanding and meeting other defined selection criteria. The discount rates for the CNH's remaining obligations are based on benchmark yield data of high-quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments approximate the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments.\n\nThe assumed healthcare trend rate represents the rate at which healthcare costs are assumed to increase. Rates are determined based on CNH's specific experience, consultation with actuaries and outside consultants, and various trend factors  including  general  and  healthcare  sector-specific  inflation  projections  from  the  United  States  Department  of Health and Human Services Healthcare Financing Administration. The initial trend is a short-term assumption based on recent experience and prevailing market conditions. The ultimate trend is a long-term assumption of healthcare cost inflation based on general inflation, incremental medical inflation, technology, new medicine, government cost-shifting, utilization changes, an aging population, and a changing mix of medical services.\n\nCNH  annually  reviews  the  mortality  assumptions  and  demographic  characteristics  of  its  U.S.  pension  plan  and healthcare plan participants. In 2023 and 2022 CNH continued to use the adopted the MP-2021 mortality improvement scale as it continues to be the most current. At this time, CNH is not making adjustments to the MP-2021 for any shortterm or long-term impacts COVID may have on mortality improvements scales issued in the future.",

Typically,  less  mature  plan  benefit  obligations  are  funded  by  using  more  equity  securities  as  they  are  expected  to achieve long-term growth exceeding the rate of inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded using more fixed  income  securities  as  they  are  expected  to  produce  current  income  with  limited  volatility.  Risk  management practices include the use of multiple asset classes and investment managers within each asset class for diversification purposes.  Specific  guidelines  for  each  asset  class  and  investment  manager  are  implemented  and  monitored.  Plan assets do not include treasury shares of CNH Industrial N.V. or properties occupied by Group companies.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2023 may be disaggregated by asset class and level as follows.

This provision also includes management's best estimate of the costs that are expected to be incurred in connection with product defects that could result in a larger recall of equipment.

This provision is estimated based on information available for the sales made by the dealers during the calendar year.\n- \u25aa Commercial risks - this provision relates to risks arising in connection with the sale of products and services.\n- \u25aa Legal proceedings and other disputes -  this  provision represents management's best estimate of the liability to be recognized by the Group with regard to:\n- \u00b7 Legal  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  with  dealers,  customers,  suppliers  or  regulators (such as contractual, patent or antitrust disputes).\n- \u00b7 Legal proceedings involving claims with active and former employees.\n\nNone of these provisions is individually significant. Each Group company recognizes a provision for legal proceedings when it  is  deemed  probable  that  the  proceedings  will  result  in  an  outflow  of  resources.  In  determining  their  best estimate of the probable liability, each Group company assesses its legal proceedings on a case-by-case basis to estimate the probable losses that typically arise from events of the type giving rise to the liability. Their estimate takes into account, as applicable, the views of legal counsel and other experts, the experience of the company and others in  similar  situations  and  the  company's  intentions  with  regard  to  further  action  in  each  proceeding.  CNH's consolidated provision combines the individual provisions established by each of the Group's companies.\n\n- \u25aa Environmental risks - this provision represents management's best estimate of the Group's probable environmental obligations. Amounts included in the estimate comprise direct costs to be incurred in connection with environmental obligations associated with current or formerly owned facilities and sites. This provision also includes costs related to claims on environmental matters.\n\n## 24.  Debt\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nLenders  of  committed  credit  facilities  have  the  obligation  to  make  advances  up  to  the  facility  amount.  Lenders  of uncommitted facilities have the right to terminate the agreement with prior notice to CNH. At December 31, 2023, CNH had  available  committed  unsecured  facilities  expiring  after  twelve  months  amounting  to  $5.9  billion  ($5.1  billion  at December 31, 2022).\n\nIn March 2019, CNH signed a five-year committed revolving credit facility for \u20ac4 billion ($4.5 billion at March 31, 2019 exchange rate) due to mature in 2024 with two extension options of 1-year each, exercisable on the first and second anniversary of the signing date. CNH exercised the first of the two extension options as of February 28, 2020 and the second extension option as of February 26, 2021. The facility is now due to mature in March 2026 for \u20ac3,950.5 million; \u20ac49.5 million within the facility will mature in March 2025. The credit facility replaced the existing five-year \u20ac1.75 billion credit facility due to mature in 2021. The \u20ac4 billion facility is guaranteed by the parent company with cross-guarantees from  each  of  the  borrowers  (i.e.,  CNH  Industrial  Finance  S.p.A.,  CNH  Industrial  Finance  Europe  S.A.  and  CNH Industrial  Finance  North America  Inc.),  and  includes  typical  provisions  for  contracts  of  this  type  and  size,  such  as: customary covenants mainly relating to Industrial Activities including negative pledge, a status (or pari passu ) covenant, restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness by certain subsidiaries, customary events of default (some of which are subject  to  minimum  thresholds  and  customary  mitigants)  including  cross-default,  failure  to  pay  amounts  due  or  to comply  with  certain  provisions  under  the  loan  agreement,  the  occurrence  of  certain  bankruptcy-related  events  and mandatory obligations upon a change in control of CNH or the borrower and a financial covenant (Net Debt/EBITDA ration  relating  to  Industrial Activities)  that  is  not  applicable  with  the  current  ratings  levels. The  failure  to  comply  with these provisions, in certain cases if not suitably remedied, can lead to the requirement to make early repayment of the outstanding advances. At December 31, 2023, CNH was in compliance with all covenants in the revolving credit facility.",

A breach of these commitments can lead to the early repayment of the applicable notes. The bonds guaranteed by CNH Industrial N.V. under the Euro Medium Term Note Programme (and its predecessor the Global Medium Term Note Programme), as well as the notes issued by CNH Industrial N.V., contain clauses which could lead to  early  repayment  if  there  is  a  change  of  control  of  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  leading  to  a  rating  downgrading  of  CNH Industrial N.V..\n\n## Commercial Paper Programs\n\nCNH Industrial Capital LLC outstanding commercial paper totaled $351 million as of December 31, 2023 ($299 million outstanding at December 31, 2022).\n\nBanco CNH Industrial S.A. outstanding commercial paper totaled $488 million as of December 31, 2023 ($230 million outstanding at December 31, 2022).",

Commitments and contingencies\n\nCNH in the ordinary course of business is exposed to numerous legal risks, including, without limitation, dealer and supplier litigation, intellectual property right disputes, product liability, asbestos, personal injury, emissions and/or fuel economy regulatory, competition law and other regulatory investigations and environmental claims. The most significant of these matters are described below.\n\nThe outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims or investigations could require CNH to pay substantial damages or  fines  or  undertake  service  actions,  recall  campaigns  or  other  costly  actions.  It  is  therefore  possible  that  legal judgments could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered, by insurance and could affect CNH's financial position and results.\n\nWhen it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle obligations and this  amount can be reliably estimated, CNH recognizes specific provisions for this purpose. At December 31, 2023, contingent  liabilities  estimated  by  the  Group  amount  to  approximately  $28  million  (approximately  $43  million  at December 31, 2022), for which no provisions have been recognized since an outflow of resources is not considered probable at the present time.\n\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of legal matters pending against CNH and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted, CNH believes the reasonable possible range of losses for these unresolved legal matters in addition to the amounts accrued would not have a material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other litigation and investigation\n\nFollow-up on Damages Claims: in 2011 Iveco S.p.A. (\"Iveco\"), a subsidiary of Iveco Group N.V., and its competitors in the  European  Union  were  subject  to  an  investigation  by  the  European  Commission  (the  'Commission')  into  certain business practices in the European Union (in the period 1997-2011) in relation to Medium & Heavy trucks. On July 19, 2016, the Commission announced a settlement with Iveco (\"the Decision\"). Following the Decision, the Company, Iveco and  Iveco  Magirus  AG  (\"IMAG\")  have  been  named  as  defendants  in  proceedings  across  Europe.  Following  the Demerger,  CNH  cannot  be  excluded  from  current  and  future  follow  on  proceedings  originating  from  the  Decision because  under  EU  competition  law  a  company  cannot  use  corporate  reorganizations  to  avoid  liability  for  private damage claims. In the event one or more of these judicial proceedings would result in a decision against CNH ordering it to compensate such claimants as a result of the conduct that was the subject matter of the Decision, and Iveco and IMAG do not comply with such decisions, as a result of various intercompany arrangements, then CNH will ultimately have recourse against Iveco and IMAG for the reimbursement of the damages effectively paid to such claimants. The Company believes that the risk of either  Iveco  or  IMAG  or  Iveco  Group  defaulting  on  potential  payment  obligations arising from such follow-up on damage claims is remote.\n\nFPT Emissions Investigation :  on  July  22,  2020,  a  number  of  the  Company's  (pre-Demerger)  offices  in  Europe  were visited  by  investigators  in  the  context  of  a  request  for  assistance  by  the  public  prosecutors  of  Frankfurt  am  Main, Germany and Turin, Italy in relation to alleged noncompliance of two engine models produced by FPT Industrial S.p.A., which is a wholly-controlled subsidiary Iveco Group N.V. The Italian criminal investigation has been dismissed in 2023. As a result of FPT Industrial's full cooperation and ongoing discussions with the investigative authorities, all German criminal investigation have also been concluded in December 2023. In certain instances CNH and other third parties have also received various requests for compensation by German and Austrian customers on various contractual and tort grounds, including requests for damages resulting from the termination of the purchase contracts, or in the form of requests for an alleged lower residual value of their vehicles as a consequence of the alleged non-compliance with other approval regulations regarding emissions. In certain instances, other customers have brought judicial claims on",

While the Company had no role in the design and sale of such engine models and vehicles, the Company cannot predict at this time the extent and outcome of these requests and directly or indirectly related legal proceedings, including customer claims or potential class actions alleging emissions non-compliance. The Company believes that the risk of either FPT Industrial or Iveco Group N.V. defaulting on potential payment obligations arising from such proceedings is remote.\n\n## Commitments\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  Financial  Services  has  various  agreements  to  extend  credit  for  the  following  financing arrangements:\n\n|                                |                    | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| ($ million)                    | Total Credit Limit | Utilized               | Not utilized           |\n| Facility                       |                    |                        |                        |\n| Wholesale and dealer financing | 8,874              | 5,715                  | 3,159                  |\n| Revolving charge accounts      | 2,557              | 210                    | 2,347                  |\n\n## Guarantees\n\nCNH  provided  guarantees  on  the  debt  or  commitments  of  third  parties  and  performance  guarantees  on  nonconsolidated affiliates as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaling $37 million and $19 million, respectively.\n\n## 28.  Segment reporting\n\nThe operating segments through which CNH manages its operations are based on the internal reporting used by the CNH Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to assess performance and make decisions about resource allocation.\n\nCNH has three operating segments:\n\n- \u25aa Agriculture designs, manufactures and distributes a full line of farm machinery and implements, including two-wheel and  four-wheel  drive  tractors,  crawler  tractors,  combines,  grape  and  sugar  cane  harvesters,  hay  and  forage equipment,  planting  and  seeding  equipment,  soil  preparation  and  cultivation  implements,  and  material  handling equipment. We are also a leading provider of technology dedicated to Precision Agriculture. Agricultural equipment is sold  under  the  New  Holland  Agriculture  and  Case  IH  brands.  Regionally  focused  brands  include:  STEYR,  for agricultural  tractors;  Flexi-Coil  specializing  in  tillage  and  seeding  systems;  Miller  manufacturing  application equipment. The Raven brand supports Precision Agriculture, digital technology and the development of autonomous systems. Hemisphere, acquired in 2023, provides high-performance satellite positioning technology for the agriculture and construction industries.\n- \u25aa Construction designs,  manufactures  and  distributes  a  full  line  of  construction  equipment  including  excavators, crawler dozers, graders, wheel loaders, backhoe loaders, skid steer loaders, and compact track loaders along with a wide variety of attachments. Construction equipment is sold under the CASE Construction Equipment, New Holland Construction and Eurocomach brands.\n- \u25aa Financial  Services provides  and  administers  financing  to  end-use  customers  for  the  purchase  of  new  and  used agricultural and construction equipment and components sold through CNH's dealer network, as well as revolving charge account financing and other financial services. Financial Services also provides wholesale financing to CNH dealers and distributors primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. Further, Financial Services provides trade receivables factoring services to CNH subsidiaries. The European Financial Services operations are supported by the Iveco Group's Financial Services segment. Financial Services also provides financial services to Iveco Group companies in the North America, South America and Asia Pacific regions.\n\nRevenues for each reported segment are those directly generated by or attributable to the segment as a result of its business activities and include revenues from transactions with third parties as well as those deriving from transactions with other segments, recognized at normal market prices. Segment expenses represent expenses deriving from each segment's business activities both with third parties and other operating segments or which may otherwise be directly attributable  to  it.  Expenses  deriving  from  business  activities  with  other  segments  are  recognized  at  normal  market prices.\n\nWith reference to the Agriculture and Construction segments, the CODM assesses segment performance and makes decisions about resource allocation based upon Adjusted EBIT calculated using U.S. GAAP. CNH believes Adjusted EBIT  more  fully  reflects  Agriculture  and  Construction  segments  profitability.  Adjusted  EBIT  of  the  Agriculture  and Construction  segments  under  U.S.  GAAP  is  defined  as  net  income/(loss)  before:  Income  taxes,  Financial  Services' results, Industrial Activities' segments interest expenses/(net), foreign exchange gains/losses, finance and non-service component  of  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefit  costs,  restructuring  expenses,  and  certain  non-recurring items.  In  particular,  non-recurring  items  are  specifically  disclosed  items  that  management  considers  to  be  rare  or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities.\n\nWith reference to Financial Services, the CODM assesses the performance of the segment and makes decisions about resource allocation on the basis of net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",

Information on financial risks\n\nWe are exposed to the following financial risks connected with our operations:\n\n- \u25aa credit risk related to our financing activities;\n- \u25aa market risk (primarily exchange rates and interest rates).\n\nWe attempt to actively manage these risks.\n\nThese risks could significantly affect the Group's financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and for these reasons the Group identifies and monitors these risks, in order to detect potential negative effects in advance and take the necessary action to mitigate them, primarily through the Group's operating and financing activities and if required, through the use of derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe following section provides qualitative and quantitative disclosures on the effect that these risks may have upon the Group.\n\nThe  quantitative  data  reported  in  the  following  paragraphs  does  not  have  any  predictive  value.  In  particular,  the sensitivity analysis on market risks does not reflect the complexity of the market or the reaction, which may result from any changes that are assumed to take place.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nOur credit concentration risk differs in relation to the activities carried out by the segments and end markets in which we operate; in all cases, the risk is mitigated by the large number of counterparties and customers. Considered from a global point of view, however, there is a concentration of credit risk in trade receivables and receivables from financing activities, in particular dealer financing in the European Union market and in North America, as well as in South America for Agriculture and Construction.\n\nCNH measures the loss allowance for  its  trade  receivables  and  contract  assets  at  an  amount  equal  to  the  lifetime expected credit losses, which are the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life of the financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position net of write-downs for the risk that counterparties may be unable to  fulfill  their  contractual  obligations,  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  available  information  as  to  the creditworthiness of the customer and historical data.\n\nThe maximum credit risk to which we were theoretically exposed at December 31, 2023 is represented by the carrying amounts  stated  for  financial  assets  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  and  the  nominal  value  of  the  guarantees provided on debt or commitments of third parties, as discussed in Note 27 \"Commitments and contingencies\".\n\nDealers and final customers are generally subject to specific assessments of their creditworthiness under a detailed scoring  system.  In  addition  to  carrying  out  this  evaluation  process,  we  may  also  obtain  financial  and  non-financial guarantees  for  risks  arising  from  credit  granted  for  the  sale  of  agricultural  equipment,  construction  equipment  and related parts. These guarantees are further secured, where possible, by retention of title clauses or specific guarantees on financed equipment sales to the distribution network and on equipment under finance or leasing agreements.\n\nA financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk when the customer shows signs of operational or financial weakness including past dues, which requires significant collection effort and monitoring and generally occurs when the customer becomes past due greater than 30 days. The assessment considers available information regarding the financial stability of the customer and other market/industry data. An account is typically considered in default when they are 90 days past due.\n\nCNH utilizes three categories for receivables from financing activities that reflect their credit risk and the loan",

The aim of this centralized system is to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of our capital resources.\n\nAdditionally, as part of our activities, we regularly carry out funding operations on the various financial markets which may take on different technical forms and which are aimed at ensuring that it has an adequate level of current and future liquidity.\n\nMeasures  taken  to  generate  financial  resources  through  operations  and  to  maintain  an  adequate  level  of  available liquidity  are  an  important  factor  in  ensuring  normal  operating  conditions  and  addressing  strategic  challenges.  We therefore plan to meet our requirements to settle liabilities as they fall due and to cover expected capital expenditures by using cash flows from operations and available liquidity, renewing or refinancing bank loans and making recourse to the bond market and other forms of funding.\n\nThe two main factors that determine our liquidity situation are the funds generated by or used in operating and investing activities and the debt lending period and its renewal features or the liquidity of the funds employed and market terms and conditions.\n\nCNH has adopted a series of policies and procedures whose purpose is to optimize the management of funds and to reduce the liquidity risk, as follows:\n\n- \u25aa centralizing  the  management  of  receipts  and  payments,  where  it  may  be  economical  in  the  context  of  the  local statutory, currency and fiscal regulations of the countries in which we are present;\n- \u25aa maintaining an adequate level of available liquidity;\n- \u25aa diversifying the means by which funds are obtained and maintaining a continuous and active presence on the capital markets;\n- \u25aa obtaining adequate credit lines; and\n- \u25aa monitoring future liquidity on the basis of business planning.\n\nDetails  as  to  the  repayment  structure  of  the  CNH's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  provided  in  Note 18  'Current Receivables and Other current financial assets' and in Note 24 'Debt'. Details of the repayment structure of derivative financial instruments are provided in Note 19 'Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities'.\n\nManagement believes that the funds currently available, together with the funds that will be generated from operating and financing  activities,  will  enable  CNH  to  satisfy  its  requirements  resulting  from  their  investing  activities  and  their working capital needs and to fulfill their obligations to repay their debts at their natural due date.\n\n## Market risk\n\nWe operate in numerous markets worldwide and are exposed to market risks stemming from fluctuations in currency and interest rates.\n\nThe  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk  arises  both  in  connection  with  the  geographical  distribution  of  our  industrial activities  compared  to  the  markets  in  which  we  sell  our  products,  and  in  relation  to  the  use  of  external  borrowing denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  arises  from  the  need  to  fund  industrial  and  financial  operating  activities  and  the necessity  to  deploy  surplus  funds.  Changes  in  market  interest  rates  may  have  the  effect  of  either  increasing  or decreasing our profit/(loss), thereby indirectly affecting the costs and returns of financing and investing transactions.\n\nWe regularly assess our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk and manage those risks through the use of derivative financial instruments in accordance with its established risk management policies.\n\nOur policy permits derivatives to be used only for managing the exposure to fluctuations in exchange and interest rates connected with future cash flows and assets and liabilities, and not for speculative purposes.\n\nWe utilize derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, mainly to hedge:\n\n- \u25aa the currency risk on financial instruments denominated in foreign currency;\n- \u25aa the interest rate risk on fixed rate loans and borrowings.\n\nThe  instruments  used  for  these  hedges  are  mainly  currency  swaps,  forward  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps  and combined interest rate and currency financial instruments.\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges for the purpose of pre-determining:\n\n- \u25aa the exchange rate at which forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies will be accounted for;",

Interest rate exposures are usually hedged by interest rate swaps and, in limited cases, by forward rate agreements.\n\nCounterparties to these agreements are major and diverse financial institutions.\n\nInformation on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is provided in Note 19 'Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities'.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in exchange rates, which can affect our earnings and equity.\n\nWhere one of our subsidiaries incurs costs in a currency different from that of its revenues, any change in exchange rates can affect the profit/(loss) of that company. In 2023, the total net trade flows exposed to currency risk amounted to the equivalent of 21% of CNH's revenue (19% in 2022).\n\nThe principal exchange rates to which we are exposed are the following:\n\n- \u25aa EUR/USD, in relation to the production/purchases of Agriculture and Construction in the euro area;\n- \u25aa USD/BRL and EUR/BRL, in relation to production in Brazil and the respective import/export flows;\n- \u25aa AUD/USD, mainly in relation to sales made by Agriculture and Construction in Australia;\n- \u25aa EUR/GBP, predominately in relation to sales on the U.K. market.\n\nTrade  flows  exposed  to  changes  in  these  exchange  rates  in  2023  made  up  approximately  73%  of  the  exposure  to currency risk from trade transactions.\n\nIt  is  our  policy  to  use  derivative  financial  instruments  to  hedge  a  certain  percentage,  on  average  between  55%  and 85%, of the forecasted trading transaction exchange risk exposure for the coming 12 months with additional flexibility to reach 0% or 100% (including forecasted risk exposure beyond that timeframe where it is believed to be appropriate) and to hedge completely the exposure resulting from firm commitments.\n\nCertain subsidiaries may hold trade receivables or payables denominated in a currency different from the subsidiary's functional  currency.  In  addition,  in  a  limited  number  of  cases,  subsidiaries  may  obtain  financing  or  use  funds  in  a currency different from their functional currency. Changes in exchange rates may result in exchange gains or losses arising from these situations. It is our policy to hedge fully, whenever possible, the exposure resulting from receivables, payables, and securities denominated in currencies different from the subsidiary's functional currency.\n\nCertain  of  our  subsidiaries'  functional  currency  is  different  than  the  U.S.  dollar,  which  is  the  Group  presentation currency. The income statements of those subsidiaries are converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate for the period, and while revenues and margins are unchanged in local currency, changes in exchange rates may lead to effects on the converted balances of revenues, costs and the results reported in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of consolidated companies whose functional currency is different from the U.S. dollar may acquire converted values in U.S. dollars which differ as a function of the fluctuation in exchange rates. The effects of these  changes  are  recognized  directly  in  the  Cumulative  Translation  Adjustments  reserve,  included  in  Other comprehensive income (see Note 21 \"Equity\").\n\nWe monitor our principal  exposure  to  translation  exchange  risk,  although  there  was  no  specific  hedging  in  place  at December 31, 2023.\n\nThere were no substantial changes in 2023 in the nature or structure of exposure to currency risk or in our hedging policies.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe potential loss in fair value of derivative financial instruments held for currency risk management (currency swaps/ forwards,  currency  options,  interest  rate  and  currency  swaps)  at  December  31,  2023  resulting  from  a  hypothetical change of 10% in the exchange rates amounted to approximately $167 million ($276 million at December 31, 2022). The valuation model for currency options assumes that market volatility at year-end remains unchanged.\n\nReceivables, payables, and future trade flows whose hedging transactions have been analyzed were not considered in this analysis. It is reasonable to assume that changes in exchange rates will produce the opposite effect, of an equal or greater amount, on the underlying transactions that have been hedged.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nOur  Industrial  Activities  make  use  of  external  funds  obtained  in  the  form  of  financing  and  invest  in  monetary  and financial market instruments. In addition, we sell receivables. Changes in market interest rates can affect the cost of financing, including the sale of receivables, or the return on investments of funds, causing an impact on the level of net financial expenses incurred by us.",

        "page_content": "In addition, Financial Services provides loans (mainly to customers and dealers), financed primarily using various forms of external borrowings or asset-backed financing (e.g., securitization of receivables). Where the characteristics of the variability  of  the  interest  rate  applied  to  loans  granted  differ  from  those  of  the  variability  of  the  cost  of  the  financing/ funding obtained, changes in the current level of interest rates can affect our profit/(loss).\n\nIn  order  to  mitigate  these  risks,  we  use  interest  rate  derivative  financial  instruments,  mainly  interest  rate  swaps  and forward rate agreements.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn September 2019 IASB amended IFRS 9 and IAS 39 by issuing Interest Rate Benchmark Reform to provide specific exceptions to hedge accounting requirements in IFRS 9 and IAS 39 for (a) highly probable requirement; (b) prospective assessments; (c) retrospective assessment (IAS 39 only); and (d) separately identifiable risk components.\n\nInterest  Rate  Benchmark  Reform  also  amended  IFRS  7  to  add  specific  disclosure  requirements  for  hedging relationships to which an entity applies the exceptions in IFRS 9 or IAS 39.\n\nIn August 2020 the Board issued Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 which amended requirements in IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to:\n\n- \u25aa changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities;\n- \u25aa hedge accounting; and\n- \u25aa disclosures.\n\nThe  Phase  2  amendments  apply  only  to  changes  required  by  the  interest  rate  benchmark  reform  to  financial instruments and hedging relationships.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, as a result of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, CNH renegotiated its contract terms on its interest rate derivatives, by changing the floating interest rate swap from LIBOR to SOFR. In accordance with  the  EU-IFR  amendments  on  this  topic  included  in  IFRS  9,  these  changes  can  be  treated  under  a  practical expedient.\n\nCNH elected to apply the practical expedient that enables the company to account for a change in the contractual cash flows that are required by the reform, by updating the effective interest rate to reflect the change in an interest rate benchmark, without de-designation and apply no change to the cumulative basis adjustment reflected in earning. The elections did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 .\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nIn assessing the potential impact of changes in interest rates, we separate fixed rate financial instruments (for which the impact is assessed in terms of fair value) from floating rate financial instruments (for which the impact is assessed in terms of cash flows).\n\nThe fixed rate financial instruments used by us consist of retail receivables, debt, ABS securities, and other instruments.\n\nThe potential loss in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments (including the effect of interest rate derivative financial instruments)  held  at  December  31,  2023,  resulting  from  a  hypothetical,  unfavorable  and  instantaneous  change  of 10% in market interest rates, would have been approximately $21 million ($29 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nFloating rate financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, wholesale receivables, debt, and ABS securities. The effect of the sale of receivables is also considered in the sensitivity analysis as well as the effect of hedging derivative instruments.\n\nA hypothetical change of 10% in short-term interest rates at December 31, 2023, applied to floating rate financial assets and liabilities, operations for the sale of receivables and derivative financial instruments, would have caused increased net expenses before taxes, on an annual basis, of approximately $10 million ($15 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nThis  analysis  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  there  is  a  hypothetical  change  of  10%  in  interest  rates  across homogeneous categories. A homogeneous category is defined on the basis of the currency in which the financial assets and liabilities are denominated.\n\n## 31.

        "page_content": "## Receivables from financing activities\n\nThe fair value of Receivables from financing activities is based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at market  discount  rates  that  reflect  conditions  applied  in  various  reference  markets  on  receivables  with  similar characteristic, adjusted to take into account the credit risk of the counterparties.\n\n## Debt\n\nAll Debt is classified as a Level 2 fair value measurement, with the exception of the bonds issued by CNH Industrial Finance  Europe  S.A.  and  the  bonds  issued  by  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  that  are  classified  as  a  Level  1  fair  value measurement. The fair value of these bonds has been estimated making reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe fair value of Asset-backed financing, Borrowings from banks, Payable represented by securities and Other debt are included in  the  Level  2  and  has  been  estimated  based  on  discounted  cash  flows  analysis  using  the  current  market interest rates at year-end adjusted for the Group non-performance risk over the remaining term of the financial liability.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  Lease  liabilities  classified  within  Level  3  of  the  fair  value  hierarchy  has  been  estimated  using discounted cash flow models that require significant adjustments using unobservable inputs.\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  Cash  at  banks,  Restricted  cash,  Other  cash  equivalents,  Trade  receivables,  Other  current receivables  and  financial  assets,  Trade  payables  and  Other  current  liabilities  included  in  the  statement  of  financial position approximates their fair value, due to the short maturity of these items.\n\n## 32.  Related party transactions\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures , CNH's related parties are companies and persons capable of exercising control, joint control or significant influence over the Group.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  CNH's  related  parties  were  primarily  EXOR  N.V.  and  the  companies  that  EXOR  N.V. controlled or had a significant influence over, including Iveco Group N.V. post-Demerger, Stellantis N.V. (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. which, effective January 16, 2021, merged with Peugeot S.A. by means of a cross-border legal  merger)  and  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  (\"Stellantis\")  and  Iveco  Group  N.V.  which  effective  January  1,  2022 separated  from  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  by  way  of  a  demerger  under  Dutch  law  and  became  a  public  listed  company independent  from  CNH's  unconsolidated  subsidiaries,  associates  or  joint  ventures.  In  addition,  the  members  of  the Board  of  Directors  and  managers  of  CNH  with  strategic  responsibility  and  members  of  their  families  were  also considered related parties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, based on public information available and in reference to the Company's files, EXOR N.V. held 44.2% of CNH's voting power and had the ability to significantly influence the decisions submitted to a vote of CNH's shareholders, including approval of annual dividends, the election and removal of directors, mergers or other business  combinations,  the  acquisition  or  disposition  of  assets,  and  issuances  of  equity  and  the  incurrence  of indebtedness. The percentage above has been calculated as the ratio of (i) the aggregate number of common shares and  special  voting  shares  owned  by  EXOR  N.V.  to  (ii)  the  aggregate  number  of  outstanding  common  shares  and special voting shares of CNH as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn  addition,  CNH  engages  in  transactions  with  its  unconsolidated  subsidiaries,  joint  ventures,  associates  and  other related parties on commercial terms that are normal in the respective markets, considering the characteristics of the goods or services involved.\n\nThe Company's Audit Committee reviews and evaluates all significant related party transactions.\n\n## Transactions with EXOR N.V. and its subsidiaries and affiliates\n\nEXOR N.V. is an investment holding company in Europe. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, among other things, EXOR N.V. managed a portfolio that includes investments in Stellantis, Iveco Group and Ferrari. CNH did not enter into any significant transactions with EXOR N.V. during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  establishment  of  Fiat  Industrial  (now  CNH)  through  the  demerger  from  Fiat  (which  was subsequently merged into Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. which is now Stellantis), the two companies entered into a Master Services Agreement ('Stellantis MSA') which sets forth the primary terms and conditions pursuant to which the service  provider  subsidiaries  of  CNH  and  Stellantis  provided  services  to  the  service  receiving  subsidiaries.  As structured,  the  applicable  service  provider  and  service  receiver  subsidiaries  became  parties  to  the  Stellantis  MSA through the execution of an Opt-in letter that may contain additional terms and conditions. Pursuant to the Stellantis MSA, service receivers are required to pay to service providers the actual cost of the services plus a negotiated margin. During the first six months of 2023 and all of 2022, Stellantis subsidiaries provided CNH with administrative services such  as  accounting,  cash  management,  maintenance  of  plant  and  equipment,  security,  information  systems  and training under the terms and conditions of the Stellantis MSA and the applicable Opt-in letters. At June 30, 2023, the Stellantis MSA was terminated. Costs incurred by CNH related to the termination of the contract were not material.",

Under  U.S.  GAAP,  development  costs  are expensed as incurred. As a result, costs incurred related to development projects that have been capitalized under EU-IFRS  are  expensed  as  incurred  under  U.S.  GAAP.  Amortization  expenses,  net  of  result  on  disposal  and impairment charges of previously capitalized development costs recorded under EU-IFRS, have been reversed under U.S. GAAP.",

        "page_content": "## (b) Other adjustments\n\nIt mainly includes the following items:\n\n- \u25aa Goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets :  goodwill  is  not  amortized  but  rather  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually under both EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP. The difference in goodwill and other intangible assets between the Group's two sets of financial statements is primarily due to the different times when EU-IFRS and ASC 350 -Intangibles - Goodwill and Other , were adopted. CNH transitioned to EU-IFRS on January 1, 2004. Prior to the adoption of EU-IFRS, goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset and amortized to income on a straightline  basis  over  its  estimated  period  of  recoverability,  not  exceeding  20  years.  CNH  adopted  ASC  350  on January 1, 2002. Under U.S. GAAP through December 31, 2001, goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset and amortized to income on a straight-line basis over a period not exceeding 40 years.\n- \u25aa Defined  benefit  plans: the  differences  related  to  defined  benefit  plans  are  mainly  due  to  the  different accounting for actuarial gains and losses and the net interest component of the defined benefit cost between EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP. Under EU-IFRS, actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income without reclassification to profit or loss in subsequent years; net interest expense or income is recognized by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit  liability  or  asset  (the  defined benefit  obligation  less  the  fair  value  of  plan  assets,  allowing  for  any  assets  ceiling  restriction).  Under  U.S. GAAP, actuarial gains and losses are deferred through the use of the corridor method; interest cost applicable to the liability is recognized using the discount rate, while an expected return on assets is recognized reflecting management's expectations on long-term average rates of return on funds invested to  provide  for  benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.\n- \u25aa Restructuring provisions: the main difference between EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP with respect to accruing for restructuring costs is that EU-IFRS places emphasis on the recognition of the costs of the exit plan as a whole, whereas U.S. GAAP requires that each type of cost is examined individually to determine when it may be accrued. Under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , a provision for restructuring costs is recognized when the Group has a constructive obligation to restructure. Under U.S. GAAP, termination benefits are recognized in the period in which a liability is incurred. The application of U.S. GAAP often results in different timing recognition for the Group's restructuring activities.\n- (c) Tax impact on adjustments and other income tax differences\n\nThis item includes the tax effects of adjustments included in (a) and (b), primarily related to development costs, as well as other differences arising in the accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Group's policy for accounting for deferred income taxes under EU-IFRS is described in section 'Material accounting policies'. This policy is similar to U.S. GAAP, which states that a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future  tax  effects  attributable  to  temporary  differences  and  tax  loss  carry  forwards.  Valuation  allowances  are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized based on available evidence. The most significant accounting difference between EU-IFRS and U.S. GAAP relates to development costs, which also has a significant impact on accumulated deferred tax assets or liabilities and on U.S. GAAP pre-tax book income or loss in certain jurisdictions. As a result, the assessment of tax contingencies and recoverability  of  deferred  tax  assets  in  each  jurisdiction  can  vary  significantly  between  EU-IFRS  and  U.S. GAAP for financial reporting purposes. This adjustment relates primarily to jurisdictions with U.S. GAAP pre-tax book losses higher than those recorded for EU-IFRS purposes.\n\n## 35. Subsequent events\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share buyback program under which the Company may repurchase its common shares commencing after the maturity or exhaustion of the limit of the existing $1 billion share buyback program in the open market or through privately negotiated or other transactions, including at the Company's election trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchanges Act of 1934 depending on share price, market conditions and other factors.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, CNH Industrial Capital LLC repaid the principal amount of $500 million of its 4.200% unsecured note due in 2024.",

(the 'Company' and collectively with its subsidiaries, 'CNH' or the 'CNH Group' or the 'Group') is the  company  formed  by  the  business  combination  transaction  (the  'Merger'),  completed  on  September  29,  2013, between Fiat Industrial S.p.A. ('Fiat Industrial' and, together with its subsidiaries, the 'Fiat Industrial Group') and its majority owned subsidiary CNH Global N.V. ('CNH Global'). CNH Industrial N.V. is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands.  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  has  its  corporate  seat  in Amsterdam,  the  Netherlands,  and  the  place  of  effective management of the Company is in the United Kingdom. The Company's principal office and business address is at Cranes  Farm  Road,  Basildon,  Essex,  SS14  3AD,  United  Kingdom.  The  Company  is  registered  at  the  Commercial Register kept at the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under file number 56532474 and at the Companies House in the United Kingdom under file number FC031116 BR016181. The Netherlands is the Company's home member state for the purposes of the EU Transparency Directive (Directive 2004/109/EC, as amended). CNH is a leading company in the capital goods sector that, through its various businesses, designs, produces, and sells agricultural and construction equipment  (see  Note  28  'Segment  reporting').  In  addition,  CNH's  Financial  Services  segment  offers  an  array  of financial products and services, including retail financing for the purchase or lease of new and used CNH and other manufacturers' products and other retail financing programs and wholesale financing to dealers.\n\nAs parent company, CNH Industrial N.V. has also prepared Consolidated Financial Statements for CNH Group for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## History of CNH\n\nDuring 2013, the process of combining the activities of CNH and Fiat Industrial was completed with the following steps:\n\n- \u25aa the cross-border merger of Fiat Netherlands Holding N.V. ('FNH') with and into Fiat Industrial (the 'FNH Merger') which occurred on August 1, 2013;\n- \u25aa the  cross-border  reverse  merger  of  Fiat  Industrial  with  and  into  FI  CBM  Holdings  N.V.  (CNH  Industrial  after  the Merger) (the 'FI Merger'); and\n- \u25aa the Dutch merger of CNH Global with and into FI CBM Holdings N.V. (the 'CNH Merger').\n\nA primary objective of the Merger was to simplify the capital structure of Fiat Industrial (CNH Industrial subsequent to the Merger) by creating a single class of liquid stock listed on the NYSE and on the Euronext Milan.\n\nAll the companies (i.e., Fiat Industrial, FI CBM Holdings N.V., FNH and CNH Global N.V.) involved in the Merger were part of Fiat Industrial; in particular: (i) FNH was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Fiat Industrial; (ii) FI CBM Holdings N.V.  was  a  wholly-owned  direct  subsidiary  of  Fiat  Industrial;  and  (iii)  CNH  Global  was  an  indirect  subsidiary  of  Fiat Industrial (controlled through FNH which owned approximately 87% of CNH Global's capital stock).\n\nThe deeds of merger for the merger of Fiat Industrial and CNH Global with and into CNH Industrial N.V. were executed, respectively, on September 27 and 28, 2013. The effective date of the Merger was September 29, 2013.\n\nDuring 2014, the Company acquired the activities of the plant located in Basildon, United Kingdom. These activities, which were previously held by a subsidiary, were transferred to the Company. The principal activity of the plant is the manufacture and sale of tractors and the sale of agricultural and construction equipment and machinery in the local market  acting  as  distributor  of  product  manufactured  in  other  Group  companies.  With  effect  May  1,  2014  and  as  a consequence of the transfer, CNH Industrial N.V. shows in the Company financial statements the figures related to the operations of the Basildon plant.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe 2023 Company financial statements of the parent company, CNH Industrial N.V., together with the notes thereto were authorized for issuance by the Board of Directors on March 19, 2024, and have been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nSection 362 (8), Book 2, Dutch Civil Code, allows companies that apply IFRS as adopted by the European Union in their  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  to  use  the  same  measurement  principles  in  their  company  financial statements.  The  accounting  policies  are  described  in  a  specific  section,  'Material  accounting  policies',  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. In these Company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method. The Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with paragraph 25 of IAS 1.\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. financial statements are presented in euros, the Company's functional currency. The euro functional currency of the Company financial statements differs from the U.S. dollar presentation currency of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which was elected to be used in order to improve comparability with main competitors, mainly in agricultural  equipment  and  construction  equipment  businesses,  and  to  provide  more  meaningful  information  to  U.S. investors.",

        "page_content": "Receivables are mainly referred to subsidiaries. The accounting policy on trade and other receivables is included in the section 'Material accounting policies' of the consolidated financial statements. The expected credit losses, if any, are accounted as a reduction in the carrying amount of these receivables.\n\n## Iveco Group Business Spin-off\n\nDuring  2021,  CNH  completed  a  strategic  project  to  separate  the  Commercial  and  Specialty  Vehicles  business,  the Powertrain  business,  and  the  related  Financial  Services  business  (together  the  'Iveco  Group  Business')  from  the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business.\n\nThe Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with Section 2:334a (3) of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) by way of a legal statutory demerger (jurisdiche afsplitsing) to Iveco Group N.V. (the \"Demerger\"), effective January 1, 2022.\n\nSince  January  3,  2022  CNH  Industrial  N.V.  and  Iveco  Group  N.V.  have  been  quoted  separately  on  the  regulated markets and operate as independent listed companies, each with its own management and Board of Directors.\n\n## Climate related matters\n\nCNH has an established risk management process that includes the assessment and monitoring of climate-related risk. These assessments are used by CNH to identify not only risk exposure, but also opportunities, on which the Group's climate  change  strategy  is  based.  The  identification  of  these  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities,  along  with  the analysis  of  sustainability  macrotrends,  led  to  the  definition  of  a  decarbonization  strategy,  which  in  turn  has  been incorporated  within,  and  regularly  influences,  the  Group's  Strategic  Business  Plan.  To  further  address  the  potential impacts  of  climate  change,  CNH  has  implemented  relevant  projects  and  a  number  of  other  specific  climate-related topics and has defined long-term strategic targets.\n\nThere  has  been  increasing  interest  in  how  climate  change  will  impact  the  Group's  business.  With  reference  to  the climate  related  matters,  a  critical  review  was  undertaken,  and  a  focused  analysis  performed  to  identify,  and consequently  manage,  the  principal  risks  and  uncertainties  to  which  the  Group  is  exposed.  CNH  recognizes  the importance of climate change risk and promotes a responsible use of resources and a reduction of the environmental impact of production to mitigate climate change. In this context, CNH has adopted an environmental policy that applies to all company locations and divisions and has set up a structure dedicated to control environmental pollution, waste, and water disposal as well as emission reduction.\n\nIn  particular,  considering  the  financial  statements  information  are  presented  through  historical  values  which,  by  their nature, do not fully capture future events, all significant assumptions and estimates underlying the preparation of the following items were subject to an analysis in order to identify and address the new uncertainties related to climate changes  which  could  affect  the  business:  going  concern,  inventory  management,  property,  plant  and  equipment, goodwill, brands, intangible assets with a finite life, tax reliefs, revenue recognition, provisions and onerous contracts. The  analysis  conducted  were  based  on  the  Group  strategy  outlined  in  the  context  of  the  global  supply  chain environmental targets and did not highlight any critical situations that cannot be attributable to and addressed in the ordinary course of the business.\n\n## Global Business Conditions\n\nIn  combination  with  the  economic  recovery  factors  and  repercussions  from  geopolitical  events,  the  global  economy continues  to  experience  volatile  disruptions  including  to  the  commodity,  labor  and  transportation  markets.  These disruptions have contributed to an inflationary environment which has affected, and may continue to affect, the price and availability of certain products and services necessary for the Company's operations. For example, the Company experienced supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures in 2022 and, while these trends improved in 2023, the Company continues to experience some disruptions. The reduction in supply chain disruptions contributed to improved efficiencies in our manufacturing operations, but purchasing costs remain elevated.\n\nIn addition, the Company continues to monitor global economic conditions and the impact of macroeconomic pressures, including repercussions from rising interest rates, fluctuating currency exchange rates, inflation and recession fears, on the Company's business, customers and suppliers.\n\n## Format of the financial statements\n\nAs a consequence of the acquisition in 2014 of the manufacturing activity carried out in Basildon, CNH Industrial N.V. presents an income statement using a classification based on the function of expenses (otherwise known as the 'cost of sales' method), rather than one based on their nature, as this is believed to provide information that is more relevant.\n\nCertain prior year amounts included in the comparative Income Statement have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation and to improve the clarity of the Company Financial Statements. These reclassifications have had no impact on the comparative profit for the year and comparative shareholders' equity.",

In particular, from July 1, 2018, Argentina's economy was considered to be hyperinflationary.\n\nA list of the Company's investments has been included under the Appendix of this Annual Report.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Other financial assets totaled \u20ac454,959 thousand, as represented below:\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                          | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2022   | Change    |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------|\n| Other financial assets                | 454,959                | 824,944                | (369,985) |\n| Fees receivable for guarantees issued | -                      | 32,218                 | (32,218)  |\n| Total Other financial assets          | 454,959                | 857,162                | (402,203) |\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Other financial assets are represented by a U.S. dollar term loan facility granted to Case New Holland Industrial Inc.. In addition, Case New Holland Industrial Inc. issued a Promissory Note to the Company.\n\nThe U.S. dollar term loan was issued on November 14, 2017, with maturity date November 15, 2027, for a principal amount of $500 million or \u20ac452,489 thousand ($500 million or \u20ac468,779 thousand in 2022). The interest rate is fixed.\n\nThe  decrease  of  the  carrying  value  of  the  U.S.  dollar  term  loan  of  \u20ac16,291  thousand  is  due  to  foreign  exchange movement as the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro during the current year.\n\nThe decrease of \u20ac369,985 thousand compared to last year is mainly due to the fact that the Promissory Note in the principal amount of $350 million issued by Case New Holland Industrial Inc., with maturity date August 25, 2024, was reclassified to Current financial receivables.\n\nMoreover,  Other  financial  assets  include  accrued  interest  income  related  to  the  U.S.  term  loan  facilities  for  \u20ac2,470 thousand (\u20ac2,739 thousand in 2022).\n\nLast year, Other financial assets included also the item financial guarantees for \u20ac32,218 thousand that represented the present value of the fees that the Company would have collected in future years based on specific agreements for guarantees issued in favor of third parties in  the  interest  of  Group  companies,  mainly  for  bonds  issued  from  Group companies and credit facilities granted to Group companies (see also Note 21 \"Non-current debt\").\n\nDuring 2023, due to a change within the Intercompany recharges process, the Company discontinued the recharge to Group subsidiaries of the guarantees fees. As a result, the fair value of the guarantees and the liabilities assumed in relation to guarantees issued by the Company was considered to be nil.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nFor Deferred tax assets comment see Note 7 \"Income taxes\".\n\n## 13.

Trade receivables\n\nAt December 31, 2023, trade receivables totaled \u20ac173,610 thousand, a net decrease of \u20ac61,252 thousand over yearend 2022, and they are essentially attributable to the operations of Basildon plant and almost entirely related to Group companies. These amounts are net of a provision of \u20ac68 thousand (\u20ac4 thousand for 2022).\n\nThe carrying amount of trade receivables is deemed to approximate their fair value.\n\nAll trade receivables are due within one year and there are no significant overdue balances.",

No distribution of profits may be made to the Company itself for shares that the Company holds in its own share capital.\n\nThe Board of Directors has the power to declare one or more interim dividends, provided that the requirements of the Article 22 paragraph 5 of the Articles of Association are duly observed as evidenced by an interim statement of assets and liabilities as referred to in Article 2:105 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and provided further that the policy of the Company on additions to reserves and dividends is duly observed. The provisions of the Article 22 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Articles of Association shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n\nThe Board of Directors may determine that dividends or interim dividends, as the case may be, shall be paid, in whole or in part, from the Company's share premium reserve or from any other reserve, provided that payments from reserves may only be made to the shareholders that are entitled to the relevant reserve upon the dissolution of the Company.\n\nDividends and other distributions of profit shall be made payable in the manner and at such date(s) - within four weeks after declaration thereof - and notice thereof shall be given, as the general meeting of shareholders, or in the case of interim dividends, the Board of Directors shall determine, provided, however, that the Board of Directors shall have the right to determine that each payment of annual dividends in respect of shares be deferred for a period not exceeding five consecutive annual periods.

This has been accomplished through the issuance of special voting shares.\n\nA shareholder may at any time elect to participate in the loyalty voting program by requesting the registration of all or some of the common shares held by such shareholder in a separate register (the 'Loyalty Register') of the Company. If such common shares have been registered in the Loyalty Register for an uninterrupted period of three years in the name of the same shareholder, such shares will become 'Qualifying Common Shares' and the relevant shareholder will be entitled to receive one special voting share for each such Qualifying Common Share which can be retained only for so long as the shareholder retains the associated common share and registers it in the Loyalty Register.\n\nShareholders are not required to pay any amount to the Company in connection with the allocation of the special voting shares.\n\nThe  common  shares  are  freely  transferable,  while,  special  voting  shares  are  transferable  exclusively  in  limited circumstances and they are not listed on the NYSE. In particular, at any time, a holder of common shares that are Qualifying Common Shares who wants to transfer such common shares other than in limited specified circumstances (e.g., transfers to affiliates or relatives through succession, donation or other transfers) must request a de-registration of such  Qualifying  Common  Shares  from  the  Loyalty  Register.  After  de-registration  from  the  Loyalty  Register,  such common shares no longer qualify as Qualifying Common Shares and, as a result, the holder of such common shares is required to transfer the special voting shares associated with the transferred common shares to the Company for no consideration.\n\nThe special voting shares have minimal economic entitlements as the purpose of the special voting shares is to grant long-term  shareholders  with  an  extra  voting  right  by  means  of  granting  an  additional  special  voting  share,  without granting such shareholders with any additional economic rights. However, as a matter of Dutch law, such special voting shares cannot be fully excluded from economic entitlements. Therefore, the Articles of Association provide that only a minimal  dividend  accrues  to  the  special  voting  shares,  which  is  not  distributed,  but  allocated  to  a  separate  special dividend reserve. The impact of this special dividend reserve on the earnings per share of the common shares is not material.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nIn order to maintain the necessary operating flexibility over an adequate time period, including the implementation of the program in place, on April 13, 2022, the Annual General Meeting ('AGM') granted to the Board of Directors the authority to acquire common shares in the capital of the Company through stock exchange trading on the Euronext Milan and the NYSE or otherwise for a period of 18 months. The program reached its conclusion on November 6, 2023. Upon the completion of the program, on November 7, 2023, CNH's Board of Directors approved a new share buy-back program. Under the new program, CNH will repurchase up to $1 billion worth of its common shares between November 8, 2023 and March 1, 2024.\n\nUnder such authorization the Board's authority is limited to a maximum of up to 10% of the issued common shares as of  the  date  of  the  AGM  and,  in  compliance  with  applicable  rules  and  regulations,  subject  to  a  maximum  price  per common share equal to the average of the highest price on each of the five trading days prior to the date of acquisition, as shown in the Official Price List of the NYSE (as the case may be) plus 10% (maximum price) and to a minimum price per  common  share  equal  to  the  average  of  the  lowest  price  on  each  of  the  five  trading  days  prior  to  the  date  of acquisition, as shown in the Official Price List of the NYSE (as the case may be) minus 10% (minimum price).\n\nNeither the renewal of the authorization, nor the launch of any program obliges the Company to buy-back any common shares. The launch of any new program will be subject to a further resolution of the Board of Director. In any event, such programs may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason and without previous notice, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 55,198,371 shares of its common stock on the Euronext  Milan  and  on  multilateral  trading  facilities  under  the  buy-back  program.  As  of  December  31,  2023,  the Company held 73.5 million common shares in treasury, net of transfers of common shares to fulfill its obligations under its stock compensation plans, at an aggregate cost of $865 million. Depending on market and business conditions and other factors, the Company may continue or suspend purchasing its common stock at any time without notice.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company acquired, for no consideration, 72,343 special voting shares following the de-registration of qualifying common shares from the Loyalty Register, net of the transfer and allocation of",

In addition, the cash flow hedge reserve is also part of OCI and this year the amount is positive for \u20ac12 million (\u20ac64 million negative at December 31, 2022). As a result, the net amount of OCI is \u20ac77 million positive amount at December 31, 2023. This part is considered distributable reserve, but being negative it reduces the overall reserve.\n\nAs a consequence, the total amount considered not distributable as of December 31, 2023, equaled to \u20ac1,635 million (\u20ac1,502 million at December 31, 2022). As a result, the distributable reserves as at December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac6,262 million.\n\nOther reserves are made up by research and development costs capitalized by the Company for \u20ac67 million and by the equity investments for \u20ac675 million (\u20ac71 million and \u20ac645 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022), earnings from affiliated companies subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of funds to the parent company in form of dividend or otherwise for \u20ac511 million (\u20ac415 million at December 31, 2022) and earnings from subsidiaries that due to local law requirements cannot be distributed as dividend, unless the subsidiary is liquidated, for \u20ac381 million (\u20ac354 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, limitations exist relating to the distribution of shareholders' equity for the entire amount of the legal reserves. By their nature, unrealized losses relating to currency translation differences reduce shareholders' equity and thereby distributable amounts.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nCNH's equity awards are governed by the CNH Industrial N.V. Equity Incentive Plan ('CNH EIP') and CNH Industrial N.V. Directors' Compensation Plan ('CNH DCP').\n\nFor more information on Share-based compensation see Note 21 \"Equity\" of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 19. Provisions for employee benefits\n\nCNH Industrial  N.V.  provides  pension,  healthcare  and  insurance  plans  and  other  post-employment  benefits  to  their employees  and  retirees,  either  directly  or  by  contributing  to  independently  administered  funds.  These  benefits  are generally based on the employees' remuneration and years of service.\n\nThe Company provides post-employment benefits under defined contribution and defined benefit plans.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Company  makes  contributions  to  publicly  or  privately  administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been made, the Company has no further  payment  obligations.  The  Company  recognizes  the  contribution  cost  when  the  employees have rendered their service and includes this cost by function in Cost of sales, Selling, general and administrative costs and Research and development costs. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, CNH Industrial N.V. recorded  expenses  of  \u20ac13,485  thousand  and  \u20ac13,017  thousand,  respectively,  for  its  defined  contribution  plans, inclusive of social security contributions in the categories as described above.\n\nDefined benefit plans may be unfunded, or they may be wholly or partly funded by contributions made by an entity, and sometimes by its employees, into an entity, or fund, that is legally separate from the employer from which the employee benefits  are  paid.  Benefits  are  generally  payable  under  these  plans  after  the  completion  of  employment.  Defined",

        "page_content": "benefits plans are classified by the Company as Pension plans or Other post-employment benefits on the basis of the type of benefit provided.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe item Pension plans principally comprise the obligations towards certain employees and former employees of the CNH Group in the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder these plans, contributions are made to a separate fund (trust) which independently administers the plan assets. The Company's funding policy is to meet the minimum funding requirements pursuant to the laws and regulations of each individual country. The Company may also choose to make discretionary contributions in addition to the funding requirements. To the extent that a fund is overfunded, the Company is not required to make further contribution to the plan in respect of a minimum performance requirements so long as the fund is in surplus.\n\nFollowing  collective  consultation  with  members  of  the  United  Kingdom  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  these arrangements  closed  to  future  accrual  on  January  31,  2020. Active  employees  were  transferred  to  the  Company's, market competitive, defined contribution arrangement.\n\nThe benefits accrued for active members up to January 31, 2020, were not affected by the closure. The closure to future accrual also had no impact on deferred or pensioner members of the plans.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nOther post-employment benefits consist of obligations for Italian Employee Leaving Entitlements up to December 31, 2006.  The  TFR  scheme  has  since  changed  to  a  defined  contribution  plan.  The  obligation  on  our  balance  sheet represents the residual reserve for years prior to December 31, 2006 relating to the Italian employees of the Italian branch.  Loyalty  bonuses  are  accrued  for  employees  who  have  reached  certain  service  seniority  and  are  generally settled when employees leave the Company. These plans are not required to be funded and, therefore, have no plan assets.\n\nProvisions for employee benefits at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                          | At December 31, 2023   | At December 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Post-employment benefits:             |                        |                        |\n| Pension plans                         | 107,811                | 112,808                |\n| Other                                 | 295                    | 326                    |\n| Total Post-employment benefits        | 108,106                | 113,134                |\n| Other long-term employee benefits     | 185                    | 182                    |\n| Total Provision for employee benefits | 108,291                | 113,316                |\n\nThe item Other long-term employee benefits consists of the Company's obligation for those benefits generally payable during  employment  on  reaching  a  certain  level  of  seniority  in  the  Company  or  when  a  specified  event  occurs,  and reflects the probability of payment and the length of time over which this will be made.\n\nIn 2023 and in 2022 changes in Other long-term employee benefits are as follows:\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                      | At December 31, 2022   | Provision   | Utilization   | Other changes   | At December 31, 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Other long-term employee benefits | 182                    | 51          | (20)          | (28)            | 185                    |\n| Total                             | 182                    | 51          | (20)          | (28)            | 185                    |\n| (\u20ac thousand)                      | At December 31, 2021   | Provision   | Utilization   | Other changes   | At December 31, 2022   |\n| Other long-term employee benefits | 405                    | (1)         | (65)          | (157)           | 182                    |\n| Total                             | 405                    | (1)         | (65)          | (157)           | 182                    |",

CNH selects its assumed discount rates based on the consideration of equivalent yields on high-quality fixed income investments at the measurement date. The discount rates are based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represent the rates at which the benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of the measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing the CNH's projected  cash  flows  against  a  high-quality  bond  yield  curve,  mainly  calculated  using  a  wide  population  of AA-yield corporate bonds subject to minimum amounts outstanding and meeting other defined selection criteria. The discount rates for CNH's remaining obligations are based on benchmark yield data of high-quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments approximate the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments.\n\nAssumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amount recognized in the 2023 financial statements. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rates would have the following effects:\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                                                            | One percentage  point increase   | One percentage  point decrease   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Effect on pension plans defined benefit obligation at December 31, 2023 | (78,000)                         | 94,000                           |",

Typically,  less  mature  plan benefit obligations are funded by using more equity securities as they are expected to achieve long-term growth while exceeding the rate of inflation. More mature plan benefit obligations are funded using more fixed income securities as they  are  expected  to  produce  current  income  with  limited  volatility.  Risk  management  practices  include  the  use  of multiple  asset  classes  and  investment  managers  within  each  asset  class  for  diversification  purposes.  Specific guidelines for each asset class and investment manager are implemented and monitored.\n\nPlan assets do not include treasury shares of CNH Industrial N.V. or properties occupied by it.

The  outstanding  amount  at  year  end  is  $500  million.  The  bond  is  valued  using  the  amortized  cost,  for  a corresponding amount of \u20ac424,957 thousand at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac431,555 thousand at December 31, 2022). At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the bond is \u20ac437,955 thousand (\u20ac441,493 thousand at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe Bond is classified as a Level 1 fair value measurement. Their fair value has been estimated making reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe bonds issued by the Company contain commitments of the issuer which are typical of international practice for bonds issues of this type such as, in particular, negative pledge (in relation to quoted indebtedness), a status (or pari passu) and cross default clauses. A breach of these commitments can lead to the early repayment of the issued notes.\n\nIn addition, the bonds contain clauses which could lead to early repayment if there is a change of control of CNH  Industrial  N.V.  leading  to  a  rating  downgrading.  At  December  31,  2023  there  were  no  breaches  of  such\n\ncommitments.\n\nThe  Company intends  to  repay  the  issued  bonds  in  cash  at  the  due  date  by  utilizing  available  liquid  resources.  In addition,  it  can  buy  back  its  issued  bonds.  Such  buy  backs,  if  made,  depend  upon  market  conditions,  the  financial situation of the Group and other factors which could affect such decisions.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Non-current debt also included \u20ac32,218 thousand of Financial guarantees which represented the  fair  value  of  liabilities  assumed  in  relation  to  guarantees  issued  by  the  Company.  Following  an  assessment  of potential risks requiring recognition of contingent liabilities and given those liabilities are related to guarantees issued in favor of third parties in the interest of Group companies, mainly for bonds issued from Group companies and loans granted to Group companies, the present value of fees receivable (see Note 12 'Financial fixed assets') was considered the best estimate of the fair value of those guarantees.",

The relevant provisions of the Articles of Association read as follows:\n\n- 1. The Company shall maintain a special capital reserve to be credited against the share premium exclusively for the purpose of facilitating any issuance or cancellation of special voting shares. The special voting shares shall not carry any entitlement to the balance of the special capital reserve. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to resolve upon  (i)  any  distribution  out  of  the  special  capital  reserve  to  pay  up  special  voting  shares  or  (ii)  re-allocation  of amounts to credit or debit the special capital reserve against or in favour of the share premium reserve.\n- 2. The Company shall maintain a separate dividend reserve for the special voting shares. The special voting shares shall not carry any entitlement to any other reserve of the Company. Any distribution out of the special voting shares dividend reserve or the partial or full release of such reserve will require a prior proposal from the Board of Directors and a subsequent resolution of the general meeting of holders of special voting shares.\n- 3. From  the  profits,  shown  in  the  annual  accounts,  as  adopted,  such  amounts  shall  be  reserved  as  the  Board  of Directors may determine.\n- 4. The profits remaining thereafter shall first be applied to allocate and add to the special voting shares dividend reserve an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate nominal amount of all outstanding special voting shares. The calculation of the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve shall occur on a time-proportionate  basis.  If  special  voting  shares  are  issued  during  the  financial  year  to  which  the  allocation  and addition pertains, then the amount to be allocated and added to the special voting shares dividend reserve in respect of these newly issued special voting shares shall be calculated as from the date on which such special voting shares were issued until the last day of the financial year concerned. The special voting shares shall not carry any other entitlement to the profits.\n- 5. Any profits  remaining  thereafter  shall  be  at  the  disposal  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  for  distribution  of dividend on the common shares only, subject to the provision of paragraph 8 of this article.\n- 6. Subject  to  a  prior  proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders  may  declare  and  pay dividends in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, subject to the approval of the general meeting of shareholders and the Board of  Directors  having  been  designated  as  the  body  competent  to  pass  a  resolution  for  the  issuance  of  shares  in accordance with Article 5 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may decide that a distribution shall be made in the form of shares or that shareholders shall be given the option to receive a distribution either in cash or in the form of shares.\n- 7. The Company shall only have power to make distributions to shareholders and other persons entitled to distributable profits  to  the  extent  the  Company's  equity  exceeds  the  sum  of  the  paid-up  portion  of  the  share  capital  and  the reserves that must be maintained in accordance with provision of law. No distribution of profits may be made to the Company itself for shares that the Company holds in its own share capital.\n- 8. The distribution of profits shall be made after the adoption of the annual accounts, from which it appears that the same is permitted.\n- 9. The Board of Directors shall have power to declare one or more interim dividends, provided that the requirements of paragraph 5 hereof are duly observed as evidenced by an interim statement of assets and liabilities as referred to in Article 2:105 paragraph 4 of the Dutch Civil Code and provided further that the policy of the Company on additions to reserves and dividends is duly observed. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 hereof shall apply mutatis mutandis.\n- 10. The Board of Directors may determine that dividends or interim dividends, as the case may be, shall be paid, in whole or in part, from the Company's share premium reserve or from any other reserve, provided that payments from",

The following statements for 2023: the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statements of comprehensive  income,  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position,  consolidated  statement  of  cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n- 3. The notes comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.\n\nThe company financial statements comprise:\n\n- 1. The company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023.\n- 2. The company income statement for 2023.\n- 3. The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n## Basis for our opinion\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  Dutch  law,  including  the  Dutch  Standards  on  Auditing.  Our responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  'Our  responsibilities  for  the  audit  of  the financial statements' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of CNH Industrial N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe  believe  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our opinion.\n\n## Information in support of our opinion\n\nWe designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon.

        "page_content": "## Materiality\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at $  135,000,000.  The  materiality  is  based  on  5%  of  profit  before  tax.  We  have  also  taken  into  account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nCNH Industrial N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of CNH Industrial N.V..\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant group entities. Our assessment of entities that are significant to the group was done as part of our audit planning and was aimed to obtain sufficient coverage of the risks of a material  misstatement  for  the  significant  account  balances,  classes  of  transactions  and  disclosures  that  we have identified. In addition, we considered qualitative factors as part of our assessment.\n\nFor the selected component audit teams, the group audit team provided detailed written instructions, which, in addition to communicating our requirements of component audit teams, also detailed significant audit areas, including  awareness  for  risks  related  to  management  override  of  controls  and  revenue  recognition. Furthermore, we developed a plan for overseeing component audit teams based on its relative significance and specific risk characteristics. Our oversight procedures included a combination of live and virtual meetings with the component auditor, including working paper reviews. We also reviewed component audit team deliverables to gain a sufficient understanding of the work performed based on our instructions. The nature, timing and extent of our oversight procedures varied based on both quantitative and qualitative considerations.\n\nBy performing the procedures at group entities, together with additional procedures at a group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Audit approach fraud risks\n\nWe  identified  and  assessed  the  risks  of  material  misstatements  of  the  financial  statements  due  to  fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the non-executive directors exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control  and  in  particular  the  fraud  risk  assessment,  as  well  as  among  others  the  code  of  conduct,  whistle blower  procedures  and  incident  registration.  We  evaluated  the  design  and  the  implementation  of  internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs  part  of  our  process  of  identifying  fraud  risks,  we  evaluated  fraud  risk  factors  with  respect  to  financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists.  We  evaluated  whether  these  factors  indicate  that  a  risk  of  material  misstatement  due  fraud  is present.\n\nWe identified management override of controls as a presumed fraud risk. Our audit procedures to respond to these fraud risks include, amongst others, detailed testing of journal entries and top-side adjustments based on supporting documentation. We have used data-analytics to perform a selection of journal entries based on risk-based characteristics to address the identified fraud risk.\n\nFurthermore, we identified a significant fraud risk related to the revenue recognition, specifically related to the cutoff assertion. Our procedures to respond to the fraud risk identified are included in our Key Audit Matter below.\n\nAdditionally, we performed, among others, the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We incorporated  elements  of  unpredictability  in  our  audit.  We  also  considered  the  outcome  of  our other  audit  procedures  and  evaluated  whether  any  findings  were  indicative  of  fraud  or  noncompliance.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 We  considered  available  information  and  made  enquiries  of  relevant  personal,  including  (non-) executive  directors,  lower  management,  accounting  personnel,  general  counsel,  director  internal audit, compliance and corporate affairs officer and others.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the group, particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated whether the judgments and decisions made by management in making the accounting estimates included in the financial statements indicate a possible bias that may represent a risk of material  misstatement  due  to  fraud.  For  significant  accounting  estimates,  we  have  performed retrospective  reviews  on  management  judgements  and  assumptions.  Management's  insights, estimates  and  assumptions  that  might  have  a  material  impact  on  the  financial  statements  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 For  significant  transactions  during  the  year,  we  evaluated  whether  the  business  rationale  of  the transactions suggest that they were entered into to engage in fraudulent financial reporting of conceal misappropriation of assets.\n\nThe  above  mentioned  procedures  did  not  lead  to  indications  for  fraud  potentially  resulting  in  material misstatements.\n\n## Audit approach compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe  assessed  the  laws  and  regulations  relevant  to  the  entity  through  discussion  with,  amongst  others, management, group legal counsel, internal audit and those charged with governance, and reading minutes and reports of internal audit.\n\nAs a result of our risk assessment procedures, and while realizing that the effects from non-compliance could considerably vary, we considered the following laws and regulations: adherence to (corporate) tax law, the requirements under the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EUIFRS)  and  Part  9  of  Book  2  of  the  Dutch  Civil  Code  with  a  direct  effect  on  the  financial  statements  as  an integrated part of our audit procedures, to the extent material for the financial statements.\n\nWe obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding provisions of those laws and regulations generally recognized to have a direct effect on the financial statements.\n\nApart from these, CNH Industrial N.V. is subject to other laws and regulations where the consequences of noncompliance  could  have  a  material  effect  on  amounts  and/or  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,  for instance, through imposing fines or litigation.\n\nGiven the nature of the entity's business and the complexity of these other laws and regulations, there is a risk of non-compliance with the requirements of such laws and regulations. In addition, we considered major laws and regulations applicable to listed companies.\n\nOur procedures are more limited with respect to these laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be fundamental to the operating aspects of the business, to the entity's ability to continue its business, or to avoid material penalties (e.g., compliance with the terms of operating licenses and permits or compliance with environmental regulations) and therefore non-compliance with such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our responsibility is limited to undertaking specified audit procedures to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements. Our procedures are limited to (i) inquiry of the board of directors and others within the  entity  as  to  whether  the  entity  is  in  compliance  with  such  laws  and  regulations  and  (ii)  inspecting correspondence, if any, with the relevant licensing or regulatory authorities to help identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nNaturally, we remained alert to indications of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit.",

Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.\n\nBy performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.\n\nThe  Board  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  of  the  other  information,  including  the  Board's  Report  in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, and the other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Engagement\n\nWe were engaged by the annual meeting of shareholders as auditor of CNH Industrial N.V. on April 13, 2022 for audit of the year 2023 and have therefore operated as statutory auditor for the first year.\n\n## No prohibited non-audit services\n\nWe have not provided prohibited  non-audit  services  as  referred  to  in  Article  5(1)  of  the  EU  Regulation  on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.\n\n## Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Board is responsible for  such  internal  control  as  the  Board  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  the  financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board is responsible for assessing the Company's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  Based  on  the  financial  reporting  frameworks  mentioned,  the  Board should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.",

        "page_content": "## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.\n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial  statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in  accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board.\n- \u00b7 Concluding  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  Board's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting,  and based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and  content  of  the  financial  statements,  including  the disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating  whether  the  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to  be  carried  out  for  group  entities.  Decisive  were  the  size  and/or  the  risk  profile  of  the  group  entities  or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified  during  our  audit.  In  this  respect  we  also  submit  an  additional  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of publicinterest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding  independence,  and  to  communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  the  Audit  Committee,  we  determine  the  key  audit  matters:  those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our  auditor's  report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure  about  the  matter  or  when,  in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",
