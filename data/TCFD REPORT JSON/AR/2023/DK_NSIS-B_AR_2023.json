Growth in developed markets was driven by innovation in both laundry and dishwash and was achieved despite industry volume softness and consumer downtrading. Growth in emerging markets was driven by increased penetration of enzyme solutions and innovation across regions.

        "page_content": "## Food, Beverages & Human Health\n\n## 2023 performance\n\nSales in Food, Beverages & Human Health declined 2% organically and by 4% in reported DKK in 2023. Organic sales were negatively impacted by roughly 2 percentage points as last year's first-quarter comparator included sales of a specific enzyme solution, which is not sold this year.\n\nUnderlying growth trends across subareas with the focus on health, clean label and efficiencies remained intact with solid progress on recent launches as well as a solid innovation pipeline in collaboration with customers. The flat underlying sales growth was driven by pricing, offset by the negative impact of destocking across the value chain in Food and Beverages and reduced consumer demand. Food delivered the strongest underlying performance while Beverages and Human Health were soft. Human Health was impacted by supply chain constraints affecting the ability to accommodate demand in the robust healthcare practitioner channel and, additionally, general softness in demand for probiotic solutions in North America.\n\n## Public product launches\n\n- \u00b7 MenaquinGold\u2122 - a natural vitamin K2-7 produced via fermentation that can be seamlessly integrated with supplements and foods to help people maintain bone strength and heart health.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Vertera \u00ae Probite - an innovative solution to the plant-based meat industry that improves the texture and mouthfeel of plant-based meat products, while enabling a cleaner label.\n- \u00b7 ProSilience\u2122 HU58 - a unique and stable probiotic solution for a broad range of food products that provides health benefits related to digestion and immunity.\n- \u00b7 Lumista \u00ae Gold - is a solution that helps brewers prevent haze formation and achieve an appealing clear beer throughout the product's shelf life, while reducing energy consumption and waste in the brewery.\n\n## SDG impact\n\nOur biosolutions in Food and Beverages lower the environmental footprint of food production and consumption by reducing food waste and enabling the use of local raw materials. Our proactive and preventative biosolutions in Human Health enable consumers to live healthier lives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about our work with the Sustainable Development Goals on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bioenergy\n\n## 2023 performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SDG impact\n\nSales in Bioenergy grew 23% organically and by 19% in reported DKK in 2023. The strong performance was driven by the continued penetration of the broad and innovative solution toolbox allowing for higher yields, throughput, and byproduct value-capture for producers in a favorable market environment. In particular, the North American market experienced strong developments supported by a favorable market environment and roughly a 2% increase in U.S. ethanol production in 2023, as reported by the EIA.\n\nPerformance was also strong outside of North America, driven by innovation as well as capacity expansion of corn-based ethanol production in Latin America. Additionally, growth was supported by solutions for biodiesel production and sales of enzymes used in second-generation biofuels, commonly referred to as biomass conversion. Overall, pricing had a positive impact on growth.\n\nOur biosolutions in Bioenergy promote the development and deployment of low-carbon fuels for the transport sector. They enable better use of raw materials, while saving energy in the production of bioethanol, corn oil, feed protein and biodiesel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about our work with the Sustainable Development Goals on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Grain & Tech Processing\n\n## 2023 performance\n\nIn 2023, Grain & Tech Processing sales declined 6% organically and by 12% in reported DKK. The decline was driven by the negative development in Tech with sales of enzymes used for Covid-19 test kits significantly lower, as expected, and reduced sales to a much softer-than-expected textile market. Strong growth in vegetable oil processing and distilling driven by increased penetration was partly offset by somewhat softer sales in the grain processing subarea impacted by destocking in the food-exposed parts of this business. Pricing had a positive impact across subareas.\n\n## Public product launches\n\n- \u00b7 Quara \u00ae LowP - a biosolution that makes fuel production more efficient by changing how feedstock producers pre-treat the vegetable oils used to make fuel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SDG impact\n\nOur biosolutions in Grain & Tech Processing optimize processes across a variety of industries while reducing the environmental footprint. They help improve yields and reduce the use of chemicals, water usage, steam and electricity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about our work with the Sustainable Development Goals on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition\n\n## 2023 performance\n\nSales in Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition grew 3% organically and by 1% in reported DKK in 2023. Pricing had a positive impact and growth was led by Animal Health & Nutrition and driven by innovation and healthy demand for yield-enhancing solutions. This was partly offset by a soft performance in Agriculture, impacted by general destocking in the value chain and volatile end-market demand.\n\n## Public product launches\n\n- \u00b7 Protide \u00ae L a natural protease that helps customers raise the nutritional value of their feed ingredients, while reducing production cost.\n\n## SDG impact\n\nOur biosolutions improve yields in agriculture by improving plants' access to nutrients in the soil and by improving animals' uptake of energy, proteins and minerals in feed. The result is better use of arable land for food and feed production, reduced use of chemicals, and reduced emissions to the environment from manure in livestock production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more about our work with the Sustainable Development Goals on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For decades, our biosolutions have helped address climate change, transform food systems, and support healthier populations while sustainably growing our company and remaining committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Our 2023 results clearly reflect this journey. It is on this strong legacy and foundation that we are building our new future. A future with an even greater impact for our employees, customers, shareholders and the world.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Growing our business\n\nOn January 29, 2024, we successfully completed the combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen and came together as one leading global biosolutions partner. Novonesis combines our joint strengths and the wonders of biology, and we are set to lead a new era of biosolutions. We will continue to create powerful biosolutions for our customers and partners based on our more than 100 years of innovation and application expertise. Together, we will serve as a growth partner to our customers; a value creator to our shareholders; and a company that has a significant, positive impact on society and the planet.\n\nTwo years after launching our strategy 'Unlocking growth - powered by biotech,' we are delivering solid growth and earnings in a volatile market environment, clearly demonstrating Novozymes' return to higher growth rates.\n\nIn 2023, we generated 5% organic sales growth and delivered a solid EBIT margin of 25.4% before special items, reflecting the positive impact of our pricing efforts in another year affected by high input costs. Our free cash flow before acquisitions was DKK 2.1 billion, a sound cash generation considering the substantial impact of special items related to the combination.\n\nThe strength of Novozymes' diversified portfolio and end-market exposure enable us to capture growth opportunities when they arise, creating overall stability. We delivered strong double-digit\n\ngrowth in Bioenergy and solid growth in Household Care and Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition in difficult markets. Food, Beverages & Human Health and Grain & Tech Processing declined in markets impacted by inventory adjustments.\n\nWe achieved these results by leveraging our broad market presence, diverse portfolio, strong innovation muscle and our robust and unique scale-up capabilities. Throughout the year, we continued our pricing efforts by engaging in dialogue with customers to capture the fair share of the value that our biosolutions bring.\n\n## Delivering on our strategic ambitions\n\nMeeting customer needs across both developed and emerging markets, we achieved organic sales growth of 6% in developed markets and 4% in emerging markets in 2023. We launched 18 innovative biosolutions to meet customer needs, and by leveraging capabilities across technologies and markets we launched new biosolutions including in the human health and functional foods space to enable bone strength and heart health, aid digestion and immunity, and improve plant-based foods.\n\nThrough our unique innovation capabilities, we enabled our customers in bioenergy to optimize the performance of their plants and achieve higher yields. Our customers highly value the ability to diversify their revenue streams through our biosolutions, which allow them to capture more protein, corn oil, and fiber. As the market for low carbon\n\nNovonesis builds on more than one hundred years of innovation, unparalleled biotech capabilities, and the ability to deliver high quality biosolutions at scale to meet customer needs across the world.\n\nfuels expands, we see an accelerating impact from our biosolutions for biomass conversion.\n\nIn Household Care, we delivered solutions for several segments and markets, including laundry, dishwash, and fabric care.\n\nWe announced an exclusive long-term strategic global partnership with Carbios to enable biological recycling of plastic waste, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions and represents an important step towards the circular economy that we so greatly need.\n\nAn important achievement in 2023 was to finalize the construction of our state-of-the-art advanced protein production facility in Nebraska, U.S., which was done on time and according to plan. The site will enable us to meet the growing demand for alternative protein solutions.\n\nIn 2023, we joined a new innovative consortium together with the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and other relevant players to convert carbon dioxide into protein for human consumption. On this important longterm journey, we are committed to contributing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour innovation power and biotech expertise to fight the rising global problems of food security and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.\n\nWe also joined forces with Arla Food Ingredients to develop advanced protein ingredients using precision fermentation. The initial focus of the collaboration will be protein ingredients for medical nutrition, but we aim to expand into other segments in the future.\n\n## Novonesis to lead a new era of biosolutions\n\nBiosolutions are key to addressing the challenges our world is currently facing. They help tackle climate change, repair and improve broken food systems, and enable healthier lifestyles. To unleash the full potential of biosolutions and generate significant value for all stakeholders and society, we have taken an important strategic step to combine Novozymes and Chr. Hansen into Novonesis.",

Most importantly, it has a pool of more than 10,000 talented employees, all with a passion to better our world with biology. These strengths will enable Novonesis to lead a new era of biosolutions and unlock additional growth opportunities.\n\nShort-term revenue and cost synergies will come from leveraging our commercial excellence to cross-sell biosolutions in an expanded market and from an optimized production setup, portfolio efficiencies, procurement savings and a more streamlined organization. Our unmatched biotech toolbox, diversified portfolio, and global reach will over the long term enable us to accelerate customer value creation and make us an unequalled partner to our customers.\n\nHalf of Novonesis' portfolio is focused on enabling healthier lives, while the other half is directed at enabling a healthier planet. We are better together, and the future will demonstrate the impact of our shared purpose and powerful capabilities. We are excited to have embarked on this next step of our journey as a leading global biosolutions  partner.\n\n## Continuing our sustainability leadership\n\nBiosolutions hold enormous opportunity for sustainable growth and will benefit societies worldwide. According to the World Economic Forum, the current addressable market for biosolutions is\n\naround EUR 15 billion, and its economic impact is expected to triple by 2040. We see significant opportunities across our portfolio to address global needs while at the same time accelerating our growth ambitions. For example, biosolutions for carbon capture, biomass conversion, plastics recycling and advanced proteins can unleash our longterm growth potential and enable a more sustainable future.\n\nWe continue to advocate for biosolutions as a key enabler of a green transition across public and private sectors. In 2023, we attended the World Economic Forum, the U.N. General Assembly and COP28 to promote cross-sector collaboration for a healthier planet. We serve on the Board of Trustees of the Science Based Targets initiative and in the leadership of World Economic Forum's CEO Climate Leaders Alliance. Positions that enable us to push for corporate climate action across sectors.\n\nIn addition to our climate-related efforts, we also work on addressing challenges to biodiversity. We are committed to using nature's resources with the utmost care to ensure that our net impact benefits nature and our planet. In 2023, we worked closely with partners to support the development of scientific frameworks for companies to address their impact on nature, and going forward, we will deepen our engagement in this space.\n\nNovozymes has walked the talk as a sustainability leader and we are proud to have achieved a 67%\n\nreduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations, relative to our 2018 baseline, and sourced 84% of our electricity from renewable sources. These efforts are aligned with our goal of reaching net-zero emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050, targets which have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nOur scores on employee engagement and development were at 84, which was above the industry benchmark of 81. We are especially proud of this achievement during what has been a year of change at Novozymes. Diversity and inclusion also remained a priority, and we conducted several initiatives across our regions, including trainings and changing HR policies. In 2023, the share of women in senior management increased to 36%, compared with 33% last year.\n\nAs a combined entity, Novonesis is well-positioned to continue the path of sustainability leadership, and we will strive to do even better for our planet and our people. We will remain committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 while nurturing diversity and inclusion and aiming to achieve gender balance across all professionals and senior management by 2030.\n\n## Building a future on a strong legacy\n\nDuring the past 23 years, Novozymes has made a positive mark on the world, driven by a strong and powerful purpose. We are building our future on this strong legacy and foundation.\n\nIn May 2023, we announced the appointment of Rainer Lehmann as CFO and Executive Vice President. Rainer joined Novozymes in November 2023, and will be a strong partner to the whole organization as we execute on our integration with Chr. Hansen and drive our operating results to secure sustainable value creation. Rainer succeeds Lars Green, who left Novozymes in 2023. We are immensely grateful for everything Lars has contributed to Novozymes and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\nWe extend our thanks to Novozymes' Executive Leadership Team and Board of Directors for their contributions. We are deeply appreciative of the lasting impact you have had on Novozymes. We also thank our dedicated employees, customers, partners, and shareholders for their trust in and support for Novozymes and our exciting journey ahead.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCees de Jong , Chair\n\nEster Baiget, CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

(Recommendation 1.3.1).\n\nUnder the Danish Financial Statements Act (sections 99a), large companies are required to report on corporate social responsibility. The Notes on\n\nEnvironmental data and Social and governance in this report meet the requirements of section 99a in the Danish Financial Statements Act. The mandatory reporting is placed in the Notes as the content is provided with reasonable assurance by our auditors.\n\nFurthermore, the statutory report is available on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReporting according to the EU Taxonomy can be found on page 45.\n\nWe have a data ethics policy, which sets out the overall principles for the ethical management of data by the company and supplements our commitment to integrity and compliance.\n\nThe statutory report on Novozymes' policy for, and work with, data ethics pursuant to section 99d of the Danish Financial Statements Act can be found on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNovozymes is also committed to the ten principles of the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) and as an active member of the UNGC, we continue to report our annual Communication on Progress (CoP).\n\nOur UNGC CoP reports can be found on the UNGC website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other governance-related information\n\nAny amendments to the Articles of Association require that shareholders representing at least two thirds of the total number of votes in the company are represented at the Annual Shareholders' Meetings, and that at least two thirds of the votes, as well as two thirds of the voting capital represented at the meeting, are cast in favor of the proposal to amend the Articles of Association.\n\nThe Board of Directors has been authorized by the shareholders to allow the company to acquire treasury stock on an ongoing basis, provided the nominal value of the company's total holding of treasury stock does not exceed 10% of its share capital at any time, cf. section 198 of the Danish Companies Act. The purchase price must not deviate by more than 10% from the price quoted on Nasdaq Copenhagen at the date of acquisition. This authorization applies until April 1, 2024. In addition, the Board of Directors is authorized to increase the share capital.\n\nFurther, the Extraordinary General Meeting in 2023 approved the adoption of the implementation of the statutory merger of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen Holding A/S, as well as indemnification of management in connection with this merger.",

        "page_content": "Each year, one of the responsibilities of the Board of Directors is to assess whether the capital and share structure of Novozymes is optimal. In 2023, the Board of Directors assessed that the share structure with A and B common stock continues to be the best way to safeguard the company's longterm strategy and development for the benefit of the company's shareholders and other stakeholders. Regarding its capital structure, the company favored a rather modestly leveraged balance sheet, as reflected by a target for net inter-\n\nest-bearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. Thus, the capital structure is in line with the target.\n\nNovozymes is party to several partnership contracts that can be terminated by the other party in the event of significant changes to the ownership or control of Novozymes. A few of these contracts contain provisions that restrict Novozymes' licenses to use specific forms of technology in such situations.\n\n## Evaluation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts an annual evaluation, and every three years, the evaluation is conducted by an external third party, which was done most recently in 2021. In 2023, the evaluation of the Board of Directors was conducted by the Chair who interviewed each member of the Board and the Executive Leadership Team. The evaluation revealed an overall good performance by the Board and good collaboration between the Board\n\nand the Executive Leadership Team. The recommendations from the interviews included continuing the strong focus on the merger between Novozymes and Chr. Hansen, maintaining the right balance between short and long-term focus on the Board and ensuring a strong focus by the Board on innovation strategy.\n\n| Board member               | Audit Committee  member   | Nomination and Remuneration  Committee member   | Innovation   Committee member   |   Board meetings  attended % |   Board tenure |   End of  Board tenure | Share trading  in 2023   | Number of shares  end of 2023   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen  1,4 |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2011 |                   2023 | -                        | -                               |\n| Cees de Jong  1,2          |                           | (Chair)                                         |                                 |                          100 |           2020 |                   2024 | 2,000                    | 5,000                           |\n| Kim Stratton  1,2          |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2017 |                   2024 | -                        | -                               |\n| Heine Dalsgaard  1         | (Chair)                   |                                                 |                                 |                           90 |           2020 |                   2024 | -                        | 3,000                           |\n| Sharon James  1,2          |                           |                                                 | (Chair)                         |                          100 |           2020 |                   2024 | -                        | -                               |\n| Kasim Kutay  1             |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2017 |                   2024 | 829                      | 1,046                           |\n| Morten Sommer  1,2         |                           |                                                 |                                 |                           80 |           2022 |                   2024 | 1,000                    | 1,000                           |\n| Anne Breum  3              |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2021 |                   2025 | 145                      | 464                             |\n| Anders Hentze Knudsen  3   |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2013 |                   2025 | -                        | -                               |\n| Preben Nielsen  3          |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2021 |                   2025 | -                        | 426                             |\n| Jens \u00d8bro  3               |                           |                                                 |                                 |                          100 |           2021 |                   2025 | -                        | 557                             |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nWe operate on a global scale across a range of industries, which exposes our business to a diverse set of risks. To effectively navigate this landscape, we have a risk management framework in place, which enables us to identify, assess, and mitigate potential business risks that may impact our ability to grow our business sustainably and be a reliable partner to our customers, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\nIn addition to addressing key business risks, which could potentially materialize within the next three years, we also identify long-term and strategic risks across categories such as sustainability and technology. Our approach is to consider both financial and non-financial risks in an integrated and holistic manner, treating all risks on similar terms.\n\n## 2023 risk overview\n\nThe key business risks described in this section are based on Novozymes' Risk Management Framework applied in 2023, which means that the risks are based on Novozymes' business. However, due to the emergence of new risks following the announcement of the combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen, we include the combination itself in Novozymes' Risk Management reporting in 2023. As a result, we mention combi-\n\nnation-related risks and mitigation actions under 'Data protection and cyberthreats' and we have also added a new integration risk, which covers the period from pre-closing and up to three years after the combination of the two companies.\n\nAside from this additional risk, the four key business risks identified for 2024 are the same as for 2023 as we see continued volatility in the markets in which we operate, spurred by ongoing and escalating global political and economic instability and uncertainty. Novozymes' key business risk and mitigating actions are described on the following pages.\n\nClimate-related risks, such as extreme weather events, are also important factors when we look at the risks to our business. We address them in a structured way, and they are identified, managed,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand reported at different levels of our organization in the same manner as other business risks. As per our commitment to the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we provided an overview of our approach to governance, strategy, targets and risk management related to climate change. Read more about our reporting to the TCFD here. In 2024, we increased our focus on how to further strengthen our management and capture ESG perspectives.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nThe Novozymes Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for overseeing risks and for maintaining a robust risk management and internal control system. The company operates an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process in which key enterprise risks (financial and non-financial) are identified, assessed, reported on, and mitigat-\n\ned at different levels of the organization. Each key risk is assigned to a risk owner by the Executive Leadership Team and a Risk Responsible.\n\nThe Risk Management & Controls department is responsible for ensuring that senior management promotes risk awareness, engagement, and ownership across the organization. Risks are assessed based on a two-dimensional heat map rating system that estimates the potential impact of a given risk on financials and reputation, and the likelihood of that risk materializing. The most significant key risks are reviewed and assessed by the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors.\n\nSee note 5.1 for information on financial risk factors and risk management.",

        "page_content": "## Key business risks for 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Volatility of agriculture-related business\n\n## Description of risk\n\nSeveral of our businesses may potentially be affected by agriculture-related events such as weather, volatile commodity prices, changes in the agricultural market cycle, and regulations for ethanol blending, all of which may impact the agricultural value chain.\n\nA substantial economic downturn or a down-cycle in agriculture could pressure commodity prices and lead to reduced demand and lower margins in commodity-related business areas where we operate, such as BioAg, grain and oil processing and bioethanol production. For example, reduced economic activity in North America or Europe could lead to reduced demand for bioethanol blending and starch processing. Significant upward pressure on commodity prices due to shortages could also impact our customers' ability to source and process commodities such as grains. This could put our sales of biosolutions under pressure.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nFlexibility is key to adapting to changing markets. Our biosolutions help producers achieve higher yields from the same inputs and to generate valuable co-products, such as corn oil, fiber and protein.\n\nDuring the year, we worked with customers to enable such diversification to find new revenue streams and to futureproof their operations. We also continued to explore opportunities to use bioenergy feedstocks for other products, such as renewable fuels for heavy transport and as building blocks for renewable chemicals.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise to help customers address agricultural challenges with biosolutions and to diversify their revenue streams, as well as bring forward digital tools for process optimization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate related risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data protection and cyber threats\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe threat of cyberattacks is considered to be high due to the increasing global demand for fast adaptation of digitalization and new information technology. Furthermore, the use of cyberattacks as a tool in wars and other conflicts has increased that threat.\n\nThe combination with Chr. Hansen represents an additional exposure to cyber threats. With the introduction of a new company name, domain, email address, and governance structures, there is an increased risk that cyber criminals may exploit any resulting confusion.\n\nWe are a technology-driven and fully IT-supported business, and our supply chain, logistics and production capabilities are highly digitalized. Cyberattacks could have a negative impact on our productivity if systems are not accessible for an extended period.\n\nOur business may also be adversely affected if information about our unique technologies or production strains is disclosed. It is extremely important that we ensure that our business continues to run, and that we safeguard sensitive business data and critical assets against this global threat.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIt is essential to increase our ability to identify, protect, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. In 2023, we implemented numerous organizational and technical security controls to protect digital assets, including enhanced protection of PCs and servers as well as the continued operation of a dedicated Cyber Defense Center, which ensures rapid detection and response to cyber and information security incidents. Furthermore, we run continuous security scans of systems and networks to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access, while providing comprehensive training to all employees on how to recognize and avoid phishing attempts. Since the announcement of the combination, actions have been taken to protect data and prevent cyberattacks, specifically those that may arise due to potential exposures following the combination.\n\nTo protect our business opportunities from the threat of global theft, we maintain a strong focus on patents and IP management, as exemplified by our more than 6500 granted or pending patents.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to ensure that security tools and monitoring platforms are continuously upgraded in order to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape and to enable the detection and prevention of advanced cyberattacks. We will also continue to roll out security improvements to our systems and manufacturing sites, while always remaining focused on incident response and awareness. In 2024, our focus is on integrating Novozymes' and Chr. Hansen's systems and data in a safe manner.",

The war in Ukraine continued, impacting trade conditions and increasing volatility in raw materials and energy prices.\n\nDuring the year, other geopolitical events arose that could potentially have a similar impact. These conditions may impact our business and make it difficult to optimize decisions beyond the short term.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur diversified portfolio and global footprint enable us to mitigate this risk to some degree, as we are not overly exposed to economic downturns in specific sectors or countries.\n\nWe continue to advocate for the benefits of globalization and a shared commitment to sustainability on the global stage, such as the U.N. General Assembly and COP28.\n\nWe closely monitor political and economic developments to ensure that fast action can be taken as and when needed. We also deploy global versus local scenarios and considerations in short- and long-term capacity planning.\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to improve and identify scenarios and potential preparatory measures for our business, assets and people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe geopolitical environment is dynamic and continues to be impacted by volatility in energy and raw material prices. Such factors could impact global supply chains and, by extension, companies. If prices remain volatile and at a higher price level than previously, we could be exposed to significant price fluctuations. This could imply a risk to our gross margin level, among other things.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2023, we continued to work with customers on pricing based on price trends in the market to ensure that we capture a fair share of value from our biosolutions. These efforts contributed to sales growth and helped mitigate increased input costs.\n\nWe also continued to monitor our key material levels, conducted high risk material reviews and initiated mitigating actions. For example, we planned for substitution with alternative materials where relevant and reduced our dependency on critical and single-sourced raw materials.\n\nFinally, productivity improvements during the year also helped mitigate high input costs. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and secure supplies of raw materials and energy.",

Hansen provides opportunities, the complexity during the integration period exposes the business to several risks.\n\nA strong emphasis on integration planning and execution may lead to a risk of the company losing focus on ongoing business areas, while too little emphasis could hinder synergy realization and timely work on long-term initiatives. Uncertainty regarding job security or the new company could also impact employee retention and talent attraction. Furthermore, the integration of systems may expose the new company to increased attempts of cyber-attacks.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nIn 2023, dedicated teams from both Novozymes and Chr. Hansen collaborated at arm's length with consultants to develop integration plans that would ensure a seamless combination of the two businesses.\n\nTo ensure the full operational capability of the new company, focus has been on business continuity from day one. This involved establishing and maintaining the necessary structures, frameworks and tools, while also ensuring that the employees were well-informed and consistently updated.\n\nEmployee retention was a key focus in 2023, and during the integration planning phase. As a result, there were no significant changes in staff turnover over the year.\n\nIntegration efforts will also be anchored at the highest level in Novonesis. The Board of Directors will establish a dedicated integration committee to oversee the integration of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen and their respective businesses. In addition, the Novonesis Executive Leadership Team will include an EVP for Strategy and Integration to ensure delivery on synergies and integration progress in close collaboration with functions and businesses. The Enterprise Management reporting already includes risk reporting related to the combination.\n\n## Long-term risks\n\nIn addition to the key business risks, we also monitor strategic and fundamental risks that may potentially impact the business in the long term (beyond three years), the impact and likelihood of which can be difficult to quantify at the present time.\n\nSuch risks span across different risk categories, including sustainability and technology. Through our integrated sustainability trendspotting exercise, we identify long-term risks and opportunities, the risks being also assessed through our Enterprise Risk Management process.\n\nWe engage with relevant stakeholders in a timely manner to develop strategies and ensure that we are prepared to take adequate action and respond to key long-term risks. Based on our 2023 risk assessment, the following continue to be some of the most significant long-term risks, which will likely not change following the combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company's research and business are based on innovation and delivering biosolutions that can tackle some of today's biggest challenges.\n\nGoing forward, we expect to see the emergence of new technologies and innovative uses of current technologies, including gene editing, to find safe and innovative answers for carbon capture, sustainable food systems or replacing chemicals with biodegradable solutions.\n\nNew or rapidly changing technologies could pose a risk to our technology base.\n\n## Water scarcity due to climate change\n\n## Description of risk\n\nClimate change is becoming increasingly visible through more extreme weather events. The effect of climate change on water access through extreme weather events is currently a top concern.\n\nOur technology relies on the availability of fresh water across our value chain as many of our raw materials are agricultural and water-intensive to produce. Increased long-term pressure on fresh water is a key risk driven by climate change. A severe drought, reduced water supply, poor water quality, or flooding all lead to water stress and limit our ability to meet customer demand by directly impacting our own operations or our supply chain.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe continue addressing this long-term risk through our water stewardship strategy, which is guided by SDG #6, aiming to ensure access to water and sanitation for all. Our long-term ambition is to manage water in balance with local conditions at our production sites by 2030.\n\nEffective water management needs a local approach that is informed by science and context, and enables collective action from various stakeholders. This is why we have context-based water programs for our production sites, and we intend to pursue a scientific approach for addressing water quality and quantity challenges at our priority sites. We also aim to improve our freshwater withdrawal by focusing on recycling within our own operations. Learn more about our non-financial targets.\n\nTo help achieve overall water security in the basins where our production sites are located, we work with external stakeholders to address relevant water challenges. In 2023, we initiated an ambitious wetland conservation project, in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and local authorities. This project is expected to improve ecosystem services and restore 300 to 500 million liters of volumetric water. At our site in Mumbai, India, we work with local communities to restore ground water in the region and to solve water, sanitation, and hygiene challenges.\n\nWe disclose more details annually in CDP's Climate Change and Water Security questionnaires.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe continuously monitor and assess new technologies, and we apply and promote safe and responsible use of biotech. We are committed to continuously learn and share our knowledge about the potential of biotech and its safe use.\n\nThrough proactive engagement with influencers and policy makers, we broaden the understanding of biotech, paving the way for future solutions to pressing challenges. We engage with industry associations and through the World Economic Forum to advocate for science-based and innovation-friendly policy frameworks that support the green transition the world needs.\n\nThrough our cooperation with the Novo Nordisk Foundation, we explore ways to provide new documentation and insights into biotech. In addition, we also engage in partnerships and collaborate with academia, foundations, and other companies to drive a transformative research agenda. For example, in 2023, we became part of an innovation consortium to develop a climate-neutral way of converting carbon dioxide into protein, bypassing the use of agricultural land, water and fertilizer.\n\nWe will accelerate the actions above in the coming years to mitigate any potential impacts.\n\nLearn more in our position statement on Industrial biotechnology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate related risk",

The aim of the Regulation is to help the EU in guiding sustainable investments by requiring companies to report on the parts of revenue*, capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), which are associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. The defined activities are centered around six environmental objectives (climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems).\n\nFor 2023, all six objectives are in scope for reporting eligibility as the technical annexes for the last four environmental objectives was adopted in 2023 by the European Commission. This means that companies must assess whether they have economic activities that qualify as eligible under the Regulation ('eligible activities') and report the proportion of revenue, CAPEX, and OPEX related to the eligible activities. For economic activities included in the two climate objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, companies must further assess the alignment of the eligible activities to the Regulation. Alignment is deter-\n\nmined by the technical screening criteria through 'substantially contributing' to at least one of the objectives and ensuring to 'do no substantial harm (DNSH)' to the remaining objectives, while also meeting the 'minimum social safeguards'.\n\nDespite the positive environmental impact of Novozymes' biosolutions and our focus on minimizing our environmental footprint, Novozymes' core activities do not fall within the scope of the activities defined in the EU Taxonomy. However, we have screened our non-core activities against the six environmental objectives to identify the proportion of any eligible and potentially aligned activities.\n\nWe screened the activities listed in the technical annexes under the Delegated Regulations 2021/2139 and 2023/2486, including amendments to Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 as set forth in the Delegated Regulation 2023/2485 to identify eligible and aligned activities.\n\n## Revenue\n\nWe identified no relevant eligible revenues. Revenue is defined as revenue included in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2023, see the Note on Revenue.\n\n## Capital expenditures (CAPEX)\n\nWe identified eligible capital expenditures of DKK 70 million, corresponding to 3.4% of total CAPEX. Of the eligible activities, DKK 33 million was assessed as Taxonomy-aligned with substantial contribution to the objective for climate change mitigation, corresponding to 1.6% of total CAPEX. The Taxonomy-eligible CAPEX includes activities related to 'renewal of wastewater collection and treatment' (CCM 5.4. and CCA 5.4.) and 'material recovery from non-hazardous waste' (CCM 5.9. and CCA 5.9.). CAPEX is defined as additions of tangible and intangible assets as included in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2023. Please see the Note on Property, plant, and equipment and Note on Intangible assets.\n\n## Operational expenditures (OPEX)\n\nWe identified eligible operating expenditures of DKK 9 million, corresponding to 0.4% of total OPEX. Of the eligible activities, DKK 2 million was assessed as Taxonomy-aligned with substantial contribution to the objective for climate change mitigation, corresponding to 0.1% of total OPEX. The Taxonomy-eligible OPEX includes activities related to 'close to market research, development and innovation' (CCM 9.1.), 'renewal of wastewater collection and treatment' (CCM 5.4. and CCA 5.4.)  and 'nature-based solutions for flood and\n\ndrought risk prevention and protection' (WTR 3.3.). Operating expenditures as per the EU Taxonomy are defined as directly incurred, non-capitalizable costs in 2023 relating to research and development, building renovations, short-term leases, and the repair and maintenance of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n## Full reporting tables\n\nThe full reporting tables as specified in Article 2 of Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 can be found in our EU Taxonomy reporting disclosure on Novozymes.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2023                                                    | Revenue   | CAPEX   | OPEX   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|--------|\n| Taxonomy-aligned  activities                            | 0%        | 1.6%    | 0.1%   |\n| Taxonomy-eligible  activities but not  Taxonomy-aligned | 0%        | 1.8%    | 0.3%   |\n| Total Taxonomy- eligible activities                     | 0%        | 3.4%    | 0.4%   |\n| Taxonomy-non- eligible activities                       | 100%      | 96.6%   | 99.6%  |\n\n- *   The EU Taxonomy Regulation applies the term turnover.

The content of the Remuneration Report has been prepared to meet the requirements of section 139b of the Danish Companies Act and holds information and details on the remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management. The Novozymes Remuneration Report 2023 will be presented for an advisory vote at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2024. The\n\nNovozymes Remuneration Report 2022 was approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in March 2023 without  comments.\n\nAll remuneration of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management in 2023 was in line with the scope of the approved remuneration policy.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2023.\n\n## General remuneration policy\n\nNovozymes' remuneration policy for managers and other employees is designed both to encourage strong individual performance and to support Novozymes' overall value creation. Remuneration consists of a base salary, pension contributions, a cash bonus and stock-based incentive programs. These components are linked to employees' individual performance and to the level of achievement of Novozymes' financial, social and environmental targets. The remuneration policy aims to provide managers and other employees with a competitive financial package, which we review regularly against external benchmarks.\n\nThe remuneration policy is unchanged from 2022, except for an addition to our articles of association regarding indemnification of Board members and Executive Management as approved at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting in 2023.\n\n## Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not incentive-based. This ensures that the Board of Directors safeguards the company's long-term interests without taking into consideration what these may mean in terms of the value of incentive-based remuneration. The Board of Directors' fee is set at a market-conformant level\n\n## Board of Directors and committee memberships\n\n| Board member             | Audit  Committee   | Nomination and  Remuneration  Committee   | Innovation   Committee   | Board  meetings  attended %   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cees de Jong  1,2        |                    | (Chair)                                   |                          | 100%                          |\n| Heine Dalsgaard  1       | (Chair)            |                                           |                          | 90%                           |\n| Sharon James  1,2        |                    |                                           | (Chair)                  | 100%                          |\n| Kasim Kutay  1           |                    |                                           |                          | 100%                          |\n| Kim Stratton  1,2        |                    |                                           |                          | 100%                          |\n| Morten Sommer  1,2       |                    |                                           |                          | 80%                           |\n| Anders Hentze Knudsen  3 |                    |                                           |                          | 100%                          |\n| Anne Breum  3            |                    |                                           |                          | 100%                          |\n| Preben Nielsen  3        |                    |                                           |                          | 100%                          |\n| Jens \u00d8bro  3             |                    |                                           |                          | 100%                          |\n\n1.

The Chair receives a fee that is three times the base fee, and the Vice Chair receives a fee that is two times the base fee.\n\nFor committee work, the committee Chair and other committee members receive a further base fee and half a base fee respectively. However, the Chair and the Vice Chair of the Board do not receive such additional fee if appointed to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in 2023 or prior years.\n\nThe Board of Directors consists of 10 members, six of whom are shareholder-elected, while four are employee-elected. The total remuneration paid to the Board of Directors in 2023 amounted to DKK 9.8 million compared to DKK 10.2 million in 2022. The decrease is a consequence of the reduced number of Board members. Despite significant extra workload and responsibilities related to the combination with Chr. Hansen, the Board did not grant any additional pay or fee to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2023, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee conducted a benchmark review of board remuneration in both a Danish peer group (C20 companies excluding financial institutions) and a\n\nEuropean sector peer group (excluding Swiss companies) to evaluate the board fees paid to the Chair, Vice Chair, and Board members, respectively.\n\nThe individual Board members' fees and their shareholdings can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration of the Executive Management\n\nAs per 31 December 2023, the Executive Management of Novozymes A/S consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Ester Baiget, President & Chief Executive Officer (CEO)\n- \u00b7 Rainer Lehmann, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\n\nRainer Lehmann replaced Lars Green as CFO of Novozymes on November 1, 2023. Remuneration numbers shown below cover remuneration of Lars Green for ten months and of Rainer Lehmann for two months.\n\nThe total remuneration of members of the Executive Management comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 A base salary plus pension, company car and certain other benefits\n- \u00b7 A short-term incentive program (cash bonus) - STIP\n- \u00b7 A long-term incentive program (stock-based program) - LTIP\n\nIn April 2023, the members of the Executive Management received a 4.0% increase in their base salary.\n\nIn addition to their regular remuneration, Ester Baiget and Lars Green received compensation for lost incentives from their previous employers.\n\nOver the period 2020-2023, Ester Baiget received a total of DKK 9.6 million in extraordinary sign-on compensation for lost incentives from her previous employer, of which DKK 1.4 million was paid out in 2023 and DKK 8.2 million was paid out in previous years. Over the period 2020-2023, Lars Green received a total of DKK 14.5 million in extraordinary sign-on compensation for lost incentives from his previous employer, of which DKK 3.8 million was paid out in 2023 and DKK 10.7 million was paid out in previous years. Over the period 20232024, Rainer Lehmann will receive a total of DKK 6.2 million in sign-on fee, of which DKK 3.1 million was paid out in 2023.\n\nThe targets for the short-term incentive program (STIP) are typically set by the Board of Directors in connection with the review of the business plan for the year. Good performance will result in target payout (65%) while maximum payout is only achieved for delivering an extraordinary performance. Maximum payout equals 9.5 months' salary.\n\nIn 2023, the targets for the STIP were split on the financial performance of the company at 50%\n\nweight (sales 30% weight and EBIT margin before special items 20% weight), and a target for strategy contribution at 20% weight. Individual performance targets are set for each executive and account for the remaining 30%.\n\nThe sales performance of Novozymes in 2023 almost met the target and led to a payout of 60%. The EBIT margin before special items achieved in 2023 exceeded the target and resulted in a payout of 88%. The level of achievement of the contribution to strategy was 100% based on an assessment of progress on the company's must-win battles.\n\nThe level of achievement of individual performance targets, and thus the size of remuneration payment to the individual executive, is determined by the Board of Directors based on recommendations from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nBased on its assessment, the Board determined that the pay-out based on individual targets are 100% for Ester Baiget, 85% for Rainer Lehmann, and 87.5% for Lars Green.",

Hansen being completed. The bonus will be paid in cash, with 50% following the final closing of the statutory merger and the remaining 50% being paid after the release of the Annual Report for the first full financial year of the combined company. As the conditions for the bonus was not yet fulfilled at the end of 2023, the bonus is not included in the reported remuneration for 2023.",

        "page_content": "Since 2020, the Board of Directors has issued annual long-term incentive program (LTIP) grants with overlapping three-year performance periods. This allows the Board of Directors to reassess targets for each annual grant cycle to ensure the targets are sufficiently demanding, incentivizing, and aligned with the strategy.\n\nThe new LTIP for the Executive Management covering the performance period 2023-2025 took effect in 2023. The LTIP consists of 50% shares and 50% share options, similar to the LTIP 2022. Like the previous LTIP, the targets of LTIP 2023 reflect 40% weight on organic sales growth, 20% weight on EBIT margin before special items, 20% weight on ROIC, and 20% weight on non-financial targets. Non-financial targets are set on four parameters covering environmental and social perspectives: Climate, Water stewardship, Workplace and Diversity.\n\nThe annual LTIP cannot exceed 19 months' base salary. Further, the program includes a maximum-value clause allowing the Board of Directors to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nThe LTIP program covering the performance period 2021-2023 was finally allocated in 2023. The targets of LTIP reflected 40% weight on the target for organic sales growth, 40% weight on the target for economic profit generation, and 20% weight on sustainability targets. Average organic sales\n\ngrowth during the three-year period was 6.7%, resulting in 100% of the target being met (40% of the total program). The accumulated economic profit generated during the three-year period was DKK 7.1 billion, resulting in 100% of the economic profit pool (40% of the total program) being awarded. 82% of the non-financial targets were reached (20% of the total program). In total 96% of the maximum allocation is being awarded.\n\nFor the current and former members of the Executive Management in 2023, this means that a total of 26,667 shares will be released in February 2024. The number of stock options granted for the three-year period is 151,845, reflecting the realized target achievement.\n\nThe members of the Executive Management have contracts of employment containing standard conditions for executive officers of Danish listed companies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give and noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive officer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions.\n\nFurther details on the Executive Management's remuneration and their shareholdings etc. can be found in the Novozymes Remuneration Report 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration of senior leadership\n\nThe remuneration of Novozymes' senior leadership (207 vice presidents and directors) is consistent with the general remuneration policy. Incentive programs for vice presidents and directors have been established for the 2023-2025 period. The programs follow the same mechanisms as the program for the Executive Management. The realized target achievement for the LTIP program cov-\n\nering the period 2021-2023 is the same as for the Executive Management and thus 96% of the program is being awarded.\n\nFurther information on the incentive programs for these employee groups can be found in the Note on Stock-based payment to the consolidated financial statements, which also includes an overview of outstanding stock options.",

Growth was further supported by a solid development in Household Care driven by innovation and penetration of enzymatic solutions in emerging markets. The macroeconomic situation in 2023 with higher inflation and rising interest rates impacted consumer demand and led to inventory adjustments\n\n## Sales and sales growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSales growth, organic (%)\n\nin many food-related industries, having a negative impact on the food-related parts of Food, Beverages & Human Health, Grain & Tech Processing and Agriculture, Animal Health & Nutrition.\n\n## Gross profit and gross margin\n\nGross profit increased by 2% to DKK 9,722 million from DKK 9,577 million in 2022. The gross margin was 54.3%, down from 54.6% in 2022. The decrease in the gross margin compared to last year was driven by higher input and logistics costs, partly offset by a positive pricing impact.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nOperating costs increased by 2% to DKK 5,341 million. Operating costs as a percentage of sales were 30%.\n\n- \u00b7 Sales and distribution costs increased by 4%, accounting for 13% of sales.\n- \u00b7 Research and development costs increased by 1%, accounting for 11% of sales.\n- \u00b7 Administrative costs increased by 1%, accounting for 5% of sales.\n\nThe increase in operating costs in 2023 was mainly due to higher sales and distribution costs and strategic investments to support long-term growth.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income was DKK 171 million, compared with DKK 276 million in 2022. Other operating income in 2023 was positively impacted by DKK 88 million from the divestment of selected waste-water treatment solutions. In 2022, other operating income was positively impacted by DKK 201 million from the non-cash accounting gain related to the 21st.BIO transaction.\n\n## EBIT before special items\n\nEBIT before special items was DKK 4,552 million, down from DKK 4,629 million in 2022. The EBIT margin before special items ended at 25.4%, down from 26.4%. The EBIT margin before special items was adversely impacted by a lower gross margin resulting from higher input prices, somewhat mitigated by higher selling prices. Additionally, currencies had a negative impact.\n\n## EBIT\n\nEBIT decreased by 13% to DKK 3,976 million, down from DKK 4,561 million in 2022. The decline was driven by special items related to the combination with Chr. Hansen. The EBIT margin ended at 22.2%, down from 26.0% in 2022.\n\n## EBIT before special items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- EBIT before special items\n- EBIT magin before special items (%)\n\n## Net finance\n\nNet financial costs were DKK 49 million in 2023, compared to net financial income of DKK 2 million in 2022. In 2023, a net loss of DKK 51 million on currency hedging/revaluation and other foreign exchange losses was realized.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe effective tax rate was 22.3%, up from 19.1% in 2022. In 2023, the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by merger-related costs not deductible for tax purposes, while being positively impacted by the settlement of a long-standing tax case. The effective tax rate for 2022 was positively impacted by various taxexempt accounting gains that were one-offs.",

The increase was mainly driven by lower net investments.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nThe free cash flow was DKK 2,019 million in 2023, compared with DKK 1,334 million in 2022.\n\n## Net investments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financing activities\n\n## Cash position\n\nThe cash flow from financing activities was negative at DKK 1,889 million, compared with a negative cash flow of DKK 1,250 million in 2022. The negative cash flow from financing activities was mainly due to increased dividend payments due to interim dividend payments, which was partly offset by the fact that no stock buyback programs were executed in 2023 due to the combination with Chr. Hansen.\n\n## Free cash flow before acquisitions\n\nDKK million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023, amounted to DKK 1,116 million, up from DKK 1,041 million at December 31, 2022.

The consumption of energy and water decreased by 9% and 11% respectively compared to 2022. The decrease was driven by changes in product mix towards less resource consuming products, lower production volumes and implementation of efficiency-enhancing projects.\n\nNovozymes strives to decouple environmental impact from business growth, and we define targets and metrics that measure and drive our sustainability performance.\n\n## Five-year operational emissions (CO2-eqv.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change\n\nNovozymes' total scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 143,000 tonnes in 2023, an 11% decrease from 161,000 tonnes in 2022. The major contributor was Novozymes' site in Blair, US, for which we procured green electricity during 2023.\n\n## Energy by source 2023 (2022)\n\n%\n\nElectricity\n\nconventional\n\n9%\n\n(10%)\n\nElectricity\n\nrenewable\n\n47%\n\n(47%)\n\nSteam\n\n22%\n\n(22%)\n\nFuel\n\nconventional\n\n17%\n\n(17%)\n\nHeat\n\nconventional\n\n1%\n\n(1%)\n\nHeat\n\nrenewable\n\n4%\n\n(3%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy\n\n## Waste\n\nIn 2023, Novozymes' energy consumption was 4,396,000 GJ, a decrease of 9% compared with 2022.\n\nRenewable sources accounted for 51% of the energy consumption in 2023 compared with 50% in 2022. Renewables made up 84% of the total electricity in 2023, up from 82% in 2022. The main contributor to this increase was our site in Blair, US which started to procure renewable energy certificates.\n\n## Water\n\nNovozymes' water withdrawal decreased by 11%, from 8,720,000 m3 in 2022 to 7,793,000 m3 in 2023.\n\nThe total volume of wastewater generated in 2023 decreased by 7% compared to 2022.\n\nSimilar to 2022, 100% of our biomass was re-circulated as compost, fertilizer, feedstock for biogas or the like in 2023.\n\nFor non-biomass waste, the rate of recycling across our global production sites increased to 74%, from 63% in 2022.\n\n## Environmental compliance\n\nThe number of breaches of regulatory limits recorded worldwide in the Novozymes organization increased to 23 in 2023 from 21 in 2022. Most of them were related to wastewater discharge and biomass processing, handling and distribution.\n\nNovozymes is addressing these incidents. Novozymes received 14 neighbor complaints in 2023, compared to 23 received in 2022. Most of them pertained to noise and light related to construction activities.",

Accounting policies and critical accounting estimates and judgments are described in the notes to which they relate to enhance understanding. The descriptions of accounting policies in the notes form part of the overall description of accounting policies.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Novozymes A/S (the Parent Company) and subsidiaries controlled by Novozymes A/S, prepared in accordance with\n\nGroup accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining items of a uniform nature and subsequently eliminating intercompany transactions, internal stockholdings and balances, and unrealized intercompany profits and losses.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of subsidiaries' net profit for the year and equity are included in the Group's net profit and total equity, but are disclosed separately.\n\nConsolidation of the environmental, social and governance data follows the same principles as the financial reporting.\n\n## Translation of foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is also the functional and presentation currency of the parent company.\n\nExchange rate differences arising between exchange rates at the transaction date and the reporting date are recognized as Financial income or Financial costs.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency defined for each company using the exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nFinancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into DKK at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date for assets and liabilities, and at average exchange rates for income statement items.\n\nThe following exchange rate differences, arising from translation using the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date, are recognized in Other comprehensive income:\n\n- \u00b7 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' net assets at the beginning of the year.\n- \u00b7 Translation of foreign subsidiaries' income statements from average exchange rates.\n\n## iXBRL reporting\n\nNovozymes is required to file its annual report in the European Single Electronic Format ('ESEF') and The Novozymes Report is therefore prepared\n\nin the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements and notes in the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe Novozymes Report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named NOVOZYMES2023-12-31-en.zip.",

These financial measures may therefore be defined and calculated differently from similar measures in other companies, and may thus not be comparable.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented in The Novozymes Report are:\n\n- \u00b7 Organic sales growth\n- \u00b7 Special  items\n- \u00b7 Operating profit (EBIT) before special items\n- \u00b7 Operating  costs\n- \u00b7 Economic  profit\n- \u00b7 ROIC\n- \u00b7 ROIC before special items\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow before acquisitions\n\nDefinitions of non-IFRS financial measures are provided in the Glossary section of The Novozymes Report.\n\nROIC before special items is the adjusted operating profit (NOPAT) before special items after tax for the last 12 months as a percentage of average invested capital.\n\n## ROIC before special items\n\n| DKK million                                            | Note 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Adjusted operating profit (NOPAT) before special items | 3,481       | 3,471  |\n\n| DKK million                            | Note   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Intangible assets                      | 3.1    | 4,532  | 4,698  |\n| Property, plant and equipment          | 3.2    | 12,325 | 12,074 |\n| Investments in associates              |        | 205    | 223    |\n| Net working capital*                   |        | 4,710  | 4,244  |\n| Financial assets, non-interest-bearing |        | 40     | 80     |\n| Provisions                             | 3.4    | (112)  | (129)  |\n| Contingent consideration               | 3.6    | (72)   | (382)  |\n| Derivatives                            |        | (48)   | (101)  |\n| Tax, net                               |        | (90)   | (4)    |\n| Invested capital                       |        | 21,490 | 20,703 |\n| Average invested capital               |        | 21,097 | 19,411 |\n| ROIC before special items              |        | 16.5%  | 17.9%  |\n\n- *  Net working capital includes Inventories, Trade receivables, Contract assets, Other receivables, Assets held for sale, Deferred income, Trade payables, Contract liabilities and Other liabilities.",

The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe application of the Group's accounting policies may require Management to make judgments that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is required in particular when assessing the substance of transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form.\n\nThe critical accounting estimates and judgments could potentially have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or if more detailed information becomes available. Such changes are recognized in the period in which the estimate in question is revised.\n\nThe table shows critical accounting estimates and judgments and their level of potential impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n| Note                                                     | Critical accounting  estimates and judgments   | Estimate/  judgment   | Potential impact from  estimates and judgments   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 2.2 Revenue                                              | Revenue recognition                            | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 2.6 Special items                                        | Classification of   special items              | Judgment              |                                                  |\n| 2.7 Tax                                                  | Group tax charge and  deferred tax assets      | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 3.1  Intangible assets and  impairment test of goodwill  | Impairment of intangible  assets and goodwill  | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 3.5  Business acquisitions 3.6  Contingent consideration | Fair value measurement                         | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 6.5  Non-controlling interests                           |                                                |                       |                                                  |\n| 4.1 Inventories                                          | Cost of work in progress  and finished goods   | Estimate              |                                                  |\n| 4.2   Trade receivables and  contract assets             | Allowances for doubtful  trade receivables     | Estimate              |                                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The financial year for the Group is January 1 - December 31. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the board of directors on 8 February 2024 and the general assembly, who has the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, with the exception of derivatives, securities, contingent consideration and share purchase liability, which are measured at fair value. The accounting policies are unchanged from last year.\n\nThe consolidated environmental, social and governance data have been prepared in accordance with policies that adhere to internationally recognized voluntary reporting standards and principles such as the UN Global Compact (UNGC). Novozymes is a signatory to the Ten Principles and a member to the UNGC, a voluntary initiative for businesses committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted\n\nprinciples in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. We also take inspiration from the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for climate-related disclosures.\n\nOur reporting and materiality assessments were also inspired by the GRI framework.\n\nThe policies are unchanged from last year.\n\n## Defining materiality\n\nThe Novozymes Report is based on the concept of materiality, to ensure that the content is material and relevant.\n\nIf items are individually immaterial, they are aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the statements or in the notes. Novozymes provides the specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is considered immaterial to the economic decision-making of the readers of The Novozymes Report.\n\nAs for environmental, social and governance matters, we disclose information on issues that are identified by our materiality assessment. The disclosures in the notes include information on\n\nour management approach, targets, initiatives, and related progress.\n\nNovozymes' materiality assessment is a systematic and rigorous process that takes double materiality into account. It allows us both to evaluate whether Novozymes has an impact on the\n\n## Selected material issues for Novozymes\n\nInnovation\n\nProfitable growth\n\nSolid capital structure\n\nSupply chain security\n\nClimate change & Energy\n\nLabor practices and human rights\n\nCorporate governance\n\nBusiness ethics\n\n## Issue category\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEconomic\n\nEnvironmental\n\nGovernance\n\nSocial\n\nWater\n\nWaste\n\nDiversity  & inclusion\n\nEmployee safety & well-being\n\nCompliance\n\nenvironment and society and to identify how ESG issues affect the creation of long-term value.

This process results in a materiality matrix of financial and non-financial issues. The matrix reflects the importance of those issues to our key stakeholders versus their impact on Novozymes, and it is used to guide our strategy and reporting.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a light refresh of our materiality assessment. No new issues were added to our materiality matrix.\n\n## Limited reporting scope\n\nThe environmental data cover those activities that could have a significant impact on the environment. Sites with activities considered not to have a significant environmental impact are not included. Such sites comprise sales offices, R&D labs, and sites with limited blending and storage of products. However, measures are taken to ensure that at least 97% of the total Novozymes quantity of the measured environmental parameter is included in the reported numbers.\n\n## Impact of new accounting standards\n\nNovozymes has adopted the following new or amended standards and interpretations from January 1, 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure of Accounting Policies that requires an entity to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates clarifying the definition of accounting estimates and when changes in accounting estimates are a correction of an error and when it is a change in accounting estimate.\n\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS 12 - Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a single transaction clarifying how to account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations.\n- \u00b7 Amendment to IAS 12 - Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules implementing temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two rules issued by the OECD.\n\nThe adoption of the new and amended standards and interpretations has not had a significant impact on recognition, measurement, or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and is not anticipated to have a significant impact on future periods.\n\n## New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nIASB has issued new or amended accounting standards and interpretations that have not yet become effective and have consequently not been implemented in the consolidated financial statements for 2023. Novozymes expects to adopt the accounting standards and interpretations as they become mandatory. None of the new or amended standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) including the European Sustainability Reporting Standards developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) has not yet become effective and has consequently not been implemented in the Annual Report for 2023. Novozymes expects to report on the ESRS standards as part of the adoption of the directive in 2024 as it becomes mandatory.\n\nFor more information, refer to:\n\nwww.novozymes.com/en/about-us/sustainability/materiality\n\n<!-- image -->",

For a number of customers, central deliveries are made to specified locations and the final destination is unknown. The stated geographical distribution of revenue may therefore vary from one year to the next if delivery destinations for these customers change.\n\nMost of the Group's intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are located in Denmark, U.S., India and China.\n\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, largest  single countries:   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Denmark                                                                           | 41%    | 40%    |\n| U.S.                                                                              | 36%    | 33%    |\n| India                                                                             | 10%    | 11%    |\n| China                                                                             | 6%     | 9%     |\n\n## Revenue 2023 (2022)\n\nDKK million\n\n- Denmark 233 (211)\n- Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa 6,003 (5,884)\n- North America 6,061 (5,829)\n- Latin America 2,296 (2,063)\n- Asia Pacific 3,306 (3,566)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment 2023 (2022)\n\nDKK million\n\n- Denmark 6,957 (6,747)\n- Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa 745 (788)\n- North America 6,238 (5,804)\n- Latin America 131 (121)\n- Asia Pacific 2,786 (3,312)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2,862\n\n## Net investments 2023 (2022)\n\nDKK million\n\n- Denmark 877 (754)\n- Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa 11 (3)\n- North America 994 (1,941)\n- Latin America 23 (26)\n- Asia Pacific 147 (138)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Net operating profit after tax\n\n## 2.2 Revenue (continued)\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNovozymes produces a wide range of industrial enzymes, microorganisms and probiotics. Revenue includes the sale of goods and related services and royalties, and is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Novozymes expects to be entitled. Revenue from the straightforward sale of goods to customers is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, i.e. when goods are delivered. Variable considerations are included in revenue to the extent that they are not subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe performance obligations in the contracts are to deliver enzymes, microorganisms and probiotics to customers, and each batch delivered is considered a separate performance obligation, as each batch is distinct.\n\n## Rebates\n\nEnzymes, microorganisms and probiotics are sometimes sold at a rebate. A rebate agreement can be set up in various ways, but common to all agreements is that revenue is\n\nrecognized based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated rebate. The rebates are estimated based on experience, as well as information related to expected orders 3-12 months in advance. The estimated rebates are reassessed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## Returns\n\nA few of Novozymes' markets are granted a right of return. No revenue is recognized for the goods expected to be returned, as a refund liability is recognized. Estimates of the expected level of returns are based on analysis of historical returns and knowledge of the relevant markets/products. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period. As the goods returned are usually scrapped, no inventory asset is recognized.\n\n## Profit split\n\nNovozymes has entered into partnerships where Novozymes manufactures and sells products to a partner, who undertakes the sale to end customers. The profit on products sold\n\nto end customers is shared between the partner and Novozymes based on predetermined profit-sharing mechanisms.\n\nRevenue from these arrangements consists of the sale of products to the partner and the shared profit, and is recognized in full when the goods are delivered to the other contracting party. This is done by calculating the expected profit based on insights, experience and other input factors. The calculated profit is recognized as a contract asset or contract liability until an invoice is issued. The profit realized is settled periodically.\n\n## Commission\n\nNovozymes has entered into commission agreements where agents undertake sales to third parties in return for a commission on realized sales. Revenue from such agreements is recognized when the goods are delivered, as the nature of the performance obligation is to provide the specified goods.\n\n## Other\n\nRevenue collected on behalf of third parties is not recognized as revenue.\n\nNovozymes' obligation to provide a refund for products that are not of the agreed quality or according to agreed specifications under the standard warranty terms is recognized as contract liabilities.\n\nA trade receivable is recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods and an invoice is issued, as this is the point in time when the consideration becomes unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payment is due. Typical payment terms are around 60 days.\n\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments, deferred revenue and liabilities for refund goods. The contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as the performance obligations under the contracts are fulfilled.",

These items are classified separately in the income statement as Special items in order to provide a more transparent view of Novozymes' operating profit.\n\nThe use of special items entails management judgment in the separation from other items in the income statement.\n\nManagement considers individual items in order to ensure that special items include significant non-recurring income or costs not related to Novozymes' recurring operating profit.\n\nSpecial items include income or costs from the combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen.\n\n## 2.7 Tax\n\n## Tax risks\n\nIn many markets, Novozymes operates through sales companies and distributors, whereas production is located in only a few countries. This leads to transactions between group companies. Novozymes follows the OECD principles in setting internal transfer prices for these transactions. This is a complex area and entails a tax risk, because the transactions are subject to judgment in each country. The tax controversy risk for Novozymes is significantly reduced through the use of bilateral advance pricing agreements (APAs).\n\n## Bilateral APAs\n\nAs stated in our tax policy, Novozymes proactively engages in bilateral APAs negotiated at competent authority level to increase predictability and to mitigate transfer pricing risks. Most of the intercompany transaction value within the Novozymes Group is covered by bilateral APAs.\n\nAn APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and a tax authority determining the transfer pricing methodology for pricing the taxpayer's international transactions for future years.\n\nThe methodology is applied for a certain period based on the fulfilment of certain terms and conditions (called critical assumptions). An APA can\n\nbe unilateral or bilateral. Novozymes only enters into bilateral APAs, meaning that they are negotiated between the competent tax authorities of the two countries involved in the transaction. An APA provides assurance with respect to the tax outcome of our international transactions, by determining in advance arm's length pricing and the pricing methodology to be applied to the international transactions.\n\nNovozymes has entered into bilateral APAs with the tax authorities in the countries where internal transactions are most significant. Included in APA-covered transactions are group internal transactions between Denmark and the U.S., China and India, respectively.\n\n## Joint taxation\n\nNovozymes A/S and its Danish subsidiaries are jointly taxed with the Danish companies of the Novo Holdings A/S Group. Joint taxation also covers withholding taxes in the form of dividend tax, royalty tax and interest tax. The Danish companies are jointly and individually liable for the joint taxation liability. Any subsequent adjustments to income taxes and withholding taxes may increase the liability. Tax for the individual companies is allocated in full on the basis of the expected taxable income.",

There was a positive impact from the settlement of a long-standing tax case.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2022 was positively impacted by the accounting gain related to 21 st .BIO and the divestment of Novozymes' minority ownership in Albumedix. In addition,\n\nthere was a positive impact from a fair value adjustment of contingent consideration. The total positive impact of 3.3 percentage points was recognized in Other adjustments.\n\n## Global minimum top-up tax\n\nThe OECD has published Pillar Two model rules designed to implement a global minimum effective tax rate.

The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings, coutryby-country reporting and financial statements for the constituent entities of the Group.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nAs the Group operates across many different countries, the calculation of the Group's total tax charge in the income statement inherently involves estimation. Tax and transfer-pricing disputes with authorities in various countries may occur, and Management's assessment is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes.\n\nThe Group recognizes deferred tax assets, including the expected tax value of tax loss carryforwards, if management assesses they can be offset against positive taxable income\n\nBased on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%. There are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief does not apply. Novozymes does not expect any material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes in those jurisdictions.\n\nin the foreseeable future. This judgment is made annually and based on budgets and business plans for the coming years, including planned commercial initiatives.\n\nPayments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items. As a result, there may be substantial differences between the tax charge recognized in the consolidated income statement and actual tax payments.",

Uncertain tax positions are assessed individually and recognized if it is probable that an amount will be paid or received.

The impairment loss was recognized in Cost of goods sold and\n\nResearch and development costs at DKK 13 million and DKK 15 million respectively.\n\n## Impairment test of goodwill\n\nAn impairment test of goodwill of Novozymes' cash-generating units (CGUs) is performed for the entire Group, as cost bases of the cash-gen-\n\nerating units cannot be measured at CGU level. As the market value of Novozymes is significantly higher than its equity, no further key assumptions are used to determine whether impairment of goodwill exists (2022: no impairment).\n\n<!-- image -->",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be lower than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount.

If, at inception, it is assessed that a contract contains a lease, a lease asset is recognized. Lease assets are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, plus the cost of obligations to refurbish the asset. Payments include fixed payments, variable lease payments depending on an index or a rate and the exercise price of purchase options that are reasonably certain to be excercised.\n\nLease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the expected lease term and the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease assets are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nLease assets are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings: 1-12 years\n- \u00b7 Land: 10-90 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and machinery: 1-10 years\n- \u00b7 Other equipment: 1-10 years\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low value are recognized as expenses in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNovozymes' portfolio of leases covers leases of land, buildings, plant and machinery and other equipment such as cars and transportation containers.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are initially recognized at the present value of future lease payments including payments from extension or purchase options that are considered reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured using the implicit borrowing rate in the contracts or, where this is not available, the marginal borrowing rate in the countries in which Novozymes operates. Novozymes applies a single discount rate to portfolios of leases in the countries in which Novozymes operates based on contract currency and loan periods.\n\nIf a lease contract is modified, the lease liability is remeasured. For building leases, lease terms are estimated taking the size of the building and its strategic importance into consideration. Novozymes has entered into several open-ended building leases and building leases with extension options. Lease terms of such agreements are estimated based on the strategic importance of the buildings and the estimated time frame necessary to vacate the premises. The estimated lease term is reassessed at each reporting date. The estimated lease terms for such contracts do not exceed 12 years.",

Novozymes aims for its production sites not to have a negative environmental impact. These liabilities relate to established circumstances, and the costs are expected to be incurred either when concrete measures are implemented or when a site is vacated. The expected costs and timing are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Legal and other obligations\n\nNovozymes is involved in a number of ongoing legal disputes, and provisions are made for the estimated costs based on a current evaluation of the outcomes. Current ongoing cases are expected to be finalized in 2024-2025. In Management's opinion, the outcomes of these cases are not expected to give rise to any significant losses beyond the amounts provided for at December 31, 2023.\n\nOther obligations include other long-term employee benefits and other contractual obligations.\n\nOther long-term employee benefits account for only a minor amount, as most of Novozymes' pension plans are defined contribution plans, covering almost all employees. These obligations are mainly expected to be incurred over a relatively long period of time.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognized where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that it will lead to an outflow of financial resources. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected expenditure required to settle the obligation.",

Hansen Holding A/S ('Chr. Hansen') successfully completed with the Danish Business Authority.\n\nThe combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen will create a leading global biosolutions partner with a broad biological toolbox and a diversified portfolio in attractive markets. The combination is an important step towards unlocking additional growth opportunities as the combined scale, know-how, commercial strengths, and innovation excellence will drive value for the shareholders, customers, and society at large.\n\nThe statutory merger was effected through an exchange of all shares of Chr. Hansen ('Chr. Hansen Shares') with a total of 187,298,646 Merger Consideration Shares. The total consideration for Chr. Hansen Holding A/S amounts to DKK 67.7 billion based on a share price of DKK 361.4.\n\nThe merger will be accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method under IFRS 3 where Novozymes A/S was identifies as the acquirer and Chr. Hansen Holding A/S was identified as the acquiree.\n\nThe combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen only just closed on January 29, 2024. Management has not had access to financial information in Chr. Hansen prior to closing and therefore a provisional purchase price allocation has not been prepared and no further disclosures are available.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nFair value measurement of the acquired assets and liabilities as well as contingent consideration requires Management to make estimates and use assumptions, as observable\n\nmarket prices are not available. The determined fair values are associated with uncertainty and may be subject to subsequent adjustments.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nOn acquisition of companies, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. The consideration transferred includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nNon-controlling interests in an acquired company is recognized either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired company's net identifiable assets.\n\nThis decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.\n\nGoodwill may subsequently be adjusted for changes in the fair value of the consideration transferred and/or changes in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired until 12 months after the acquisition date, to the extent such changes relate to facts and circumstances present at the acquisition date. Acquired companies are consolidated from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.",

The fair value adjustment was recognized in Financial income.\n\nFair value is assessed by using the earn-out from the realized sales in 2023 discounted at a rate of 7% (2022: 7%). An interest expense of DKK 12 million has been recognized in Financial costs (2022: DKK 14 million).\n\nThe contingent liability related to PrecisionBiotics Group is denominated in EUR.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Indirect production costs are assessed on an ongoing basis to ensure reliable measurement of employee costs, capacity\n\nutilization, cost drivers and other relevant factors. Changes in these parameters may have an impact on the gross margin and the overall valuation of Work in progress and Finished goods.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost determined on a first-in first-out basis and net realizable value.\n\nThe cost of Work in progress and Finished goods comprises direct production costs such as raw materials and consumables, energy and labor directly attributable to production as well as indirect production costs such as employee costs, maintenance and depreciation of plants, etc.\n\nIf the expected selling price less any completion costs and costs to execute the sale (net realizable value) of inventories is lower than the carrying amount, inventories are written down to net realizable value.\n\nNovozymes has entered into a few agreements where Novozymes supplies goods to a customer's premises but retains title to the inventory until the goods are consumed in the customer's production. Such goods are derecognized from inventories in the period when they are consumed in the customer's production.",

Furthermore, an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables is recognized on initial recognition.\n\nNo allowance for expected credit losses had been made for contract assets at December 31, 2023 (2022: no allowance).\n\nFor contract assets, the credit risk is based on an individual assessment.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets are written off when all possible options have been exhausted and there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nThe cost of allowances for expected credit losses and write-offs for trade receivables and contract assets are recognized in Sales and distribution costs.",

Financial risks are managed centrally for the entire Group. The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors and sets the limits for the various financial risks and the derivatives used to hedge risk. The Treasury Policy is adjusted on an ongoing basis and adapted to the market situation. It contains rules for which derivatives can be used for hedging, which counterparties can be used, and the risk profile that is to be applied.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk arises due to imbalances between cash flows.\n\nTreasury will hedge expected net exposure (cash flow exposure), if it is determined that a movement in a foreign exchange rate will have a material impact on expected earnings/cash flow.\n\nHedging of currency risk is carried out in the currencies in which Novozymes has the largest exposures. Hedging is managed by entering into derivatives such as forward contracts, currency options and swaps. Loans and deposits in foreign currencies are also utilized for hedging purposes.\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis by comparing changes in the timing and value of the expected exposure in the relevant currencies with the timing and value changes for the designated cash flow hedging transaction.\n\nWhere deemed appropriate, currency risk related to net investments in foreign subsidiaries is hedged by taking out loans and entering into swaps. Currently, there are no open transactions used to hedge equity investments.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2023\n\nThe sensitivity analysis shows the impact on net profit and other comprehensive income of a 5% change in DKK versus the key currencies to which Novozymes was exposed on December 31, 2023. The sensitivity analysis comprises effects from the Group's cash, trade receivables, trade payables, loans, current and non-current financial investments, lease liabilities and derivatives. Anticipated currency transactions, investments in foreign subsidiaries and non-current assets are not included.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes that exchange rates change on December 31, 2023, while all other variables remain constant.

A decrease in the exchange rates would have the opposite effect.\n\n## Foreign exchange sensitivity - 2024 estimate\n\nOperating profit (EBIT) is exposed to exchange rate developments, as the effect of hedges is included in financial income/costs. EBIT is mainly exposed to USD and EUR. A movement of 5% in the USD/DKK exchange rate would result in a change in the expected EBIT for 2024 of around DKK 150-180 million (2023: DKK 130-160 million). A 5% movement in the EUR/DKK exchange rate\n\nwould result in a change in expected EBIT for 2024 of around DKK 200 million (2023: DKK 200 million).\n\nOf the expected USD cash flows for 2024, 88% has been hedged by forward contracts at an average rate of DKK 6.75. As a result, the impact on net profit from changes in the USD/DKK exchange rate has been reduced significantly compared with the impact on EBIT.",

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Financial risk factors and risk management (continued)\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises in relation to interestbearing assets and liabilities. In accordance with Novozymes' Treasury Policy, a minimum of 30% of loans must be at fixed interest rates. Hedging of the interest rate risk is managed by entering into fixed-rate loans and interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2023, 53% (2022: 62%) of the loan portfolio carried fixed interest rates.\n\nWith the current hedging of interest rate risk, an increase of 1 percentage point in the average interest rate on Novozymes' net interest-bearing debt would have a negative effect on net profit of DKK 23 million (2022: negative effect of DKK 14 million).\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises especially on cash and cash equivalents, derivatives, trade receivables and contract assets. The credit risk on trade receivables is countered by thorough, regular analysis based on customer type, country and specific conditions. The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents as well as derivatives is mitigated by the Treasury Policy, which limits exposure solely to counterparties that have an investment-grade credit rating. The credit risk is calculated on the basis of net market values and is governed by the\n\nTreasury Policy. Novozymes has entered into netting agreements (ISDA or similar) with all the banks used for trading in financial instruments, which means that Novozymes' credit risk is limited to net assets. At December 31, 2023, the Group considered its maximum credit risk to be DKK 5,155 million (2022: DKK 5,036 million), which is the total of the Group's financial assets. At December 31, 2023, the maximum credit risk related to one counterparty was DKK 440 million (2022: DKK 386 million).\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIn connection with the Group's ongoing financing of operations, including refinancing, efforts are made to ensure adequate and flexible liquidity. This is guaranteed by using committed credit facilities and placing free funds in deposits, government bonds or ultra-liquid mortgage bonds in accordance with the Treasury Policy.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Novozymes' financial resources amounted to DKK 6,372 million (2022: DKK 18,543 million), consisting of net cash, cash equivalents, and undrawn committed credit facilities of DKK 5,256 million, which expire in 20242027. The decrease in undrawn committed credit facilities compared to 2022 is related to the facility obtained to refinance existing debt following\n\ncompletion of the combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen. The facility was reduced by DKK 12,000 million during 2023.\n\nWith the exception of debt to credit institutions, the maturity dates are primarily within one year.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nNovozymes favors having a conservative balance sheet, which is reflected by a target for net interest-bearing debt of around 1x EBITDA. The target has been adjusted to 1.3-1.7x after the combination with Chr. Hansen in 2024. At December 31, 2023, the ratio was 1.2x and thus the target is considered as met in 2023. The capital structure is mainly managed using two instruments: 1) Dividend payments, through which Novozymes aims for a payout ratio of around 50%. In October 2023, an interim dividend of DKK 4.20 per share was paid out for the period January 1 August 31, 2023, and proposed dividend for the period September 1 - December 31, 2023 will be announced by the Board of Directors of Novonesis in connection with the notice of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The payout ratio for 2023 based on reported net profit adjusted for special items is expected to be in line with the communicated target. 2) Stock buybacks. No program were executed in 2023 due to the combination with Chr. Hansen.",

Derivatives are  recognized at the transaction date.\n\nDerivatives used for fair value hedges are measured at fair value at the reporting date, and value adjustments are recognized as Financial income or Financial costs. Derivatives used for cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in subsidiaries are measured at fair value at the reporting date, and value adjustments are recognized in Other comprehensive income.\n\nIncome and costs relating to cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in subsidiaries are transferred from Other comprehensive income. On realization, foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized as Financial income and Financial costs, and electricity price agreements covering production-related electricity are recognized as part of Cost of goods sold.",

Further, significant proportions of their remuneration packages are based on performance-related pay through short and long-term incentives. Most of the variable remuneration is weighted towards the long term, in line with Novozymes' strategic focus and mirroring the long-term nature of Novozymes' investments in the business.\n\nThe short and long-term incentive programs are designed to incentivize performance against selected financial, environmental, social and operational key performance indicators and individual objectives, which are directly linked to Novozymes' strategy, and to incentivize longterm value creation and alignment with the longterm interests of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders. The annual cash bonus cannot exceed 9.5 months' fixed base salary, of which 65% is expected to be payable at target\n\nperformance. The stock-based incentive programs are described in Note 6.2.\n\nMembers of the Executive Management have contracts of employment containing standard conditions for executives of Danish listed companies, including the periods of notice that both parties are required to give, and noncompetition clauses. If an executive officer's contract of employment is terminated by the company without any misconduct on the part of the executive officer, the executive officer has a notice period of 12 months. In addition to the notice period, the executive officer has a right to termination compensation of 12 months' base salary and pension contributions.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Board of Directors comprises a fixed fee and is not based on incentives.\n\n## Changes to the Executive Management\n\nIn November 2023, Rainer Lehmann, joined Novozymes as new Chief Financial Officer. Rainer Lehmann replaced CFO Lars Green, who left Novozymes at the end of 2023 to pursue a non-executive career.",

The purpose of these programs is to ensure an alignment of interests of the Management, employees and shareholders. Allocation of programs has been, and remains, dependent on profit, value creation and, in most cases, sustainability targets being achieved, and are made based on individual base salaries. The exercise price and the share price of a stock option are identical at the date of grant. In order to exercise the options, the employees must still be employed at the exercise date. This does not apply to persons who have retired, taken voluntary early retirement or been given notice.\n\nThe 2023 program for the Executive Leadership Team covering the performance period 2023-2025 is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock options and half in stock. The total number of stock options and stock achievable is divided into two categories: 'target stock options and target stock' and 'extra stock options and extra stock'. The target stock options, and target stock correspond to 65% of the maximum stock options and stock, and extra stock options and extra stock\n\ncorrespond to 35% of the maximum stock options and stock. The targets have 40% weight on organic sales growth, 20% weight on EBIT margin before special items, 20% weight on ROIC, and 20% weight on non-financial targets. The non-financial targets are measured in relation to Climate, Water stewardship, Workspace and Diversity. Each of the targets has a weight of 5%. The performance targets are as protocolled in the minutes of the board meeting approving the annual group financial statement for the year prior to the performance period.\n\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes manages to outperform the targets, some or all of the extra stock options and extra stock may be granted.\n- \u00b7 If Novozymes does not meet the targets for 2023-2025 or if Novozymes is significantly below the targets on one or more of the targets, then none or only part of the target stock options and the target stock will be granted.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock options and stock if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\nThe total target-level fair value of the program at the date of grant was approximately DKK 42 million. The value of the stock will be expensed over the three-year qualifying period (2023-2025) and will be released in 2026. The stock options have a vesting period of four years, followed by an exercise period of five years. The fair value of the stock options will be expensed over the fouryear vesting period.\n\nA new program was also established in 2023 for vice presidents and directors covering the performance period 2023-2025 (207 vice presidents and directors). The total target level fair value at grant date was approximately DKK 55 million and based on the same requirements and targets as for the Executive Leadership Team. The program is a combination of stock options and stock, with half of the incentive program allocated in stock and half in stock options. The stock options have a four-year vesting period, while the stock will be released in 2026.\n\nThe program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Executive Leadership Team to choose to limit the total allocation of stock and stock options if the intrinsic value of the program exceeds twice the annual conditional grant.\n\n## Finally awarded programs\n\nAwards in the programs covering the performance period 2021-2023 were finalized in 2023.\n\nAverage organic sales growth during the threeyear period was 6.7%, resulting in 100% of the sales growth pool (40% of the total program) being awarded. The accumulated economic profit generated in the three-year period (2021-2023) was DKK 7.1 billion, resulting in 100% of the economic profit pool (40% of the total program) being awarded. 82% of the sustainability targets were reached (20% of the total program). In total, 96% of the maximum of the program is being awarded.\n\nFor the Executive Leadership Team, this means that a total of 57,324 shares will be released in February 2024. The number of stock options granted over the three-year period is 326,398 reflecting the realized target achievement. The program contains a maximum-value clause, allowing the Board of Directors to choose to limit the total allocation of stock and stock options if the intrinsic value exceeds twice the annual conditional grant at the end of the program. There will be no limitation on the total allocation, as the intrinsic value is DKK 26 million.",

If allocations under the programs are made in countries where ownership of foreign stock is not permitted, the value of stock options is settled in cash instead, and a liability of DKK 23 million was recognized for this in 2023 (2022: DKK 21 million). The intrinsic value of exercisable cash-settled programs in 2023 was DKK 9 million (2022: DKK 9 million).\n\nThe fair value of employee services received is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Fair value at grant date is measured in accordance with the BlackScholes model, using the average exercise price, the option term and the following significant assumptions:\n\n| DKK million                                | Note   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expected future dividends per share        | DKK    |   39.6 |   38.9 |\n| Volatility                                 | %      |   32   |   25.9 |\n| Annual risk-free interest rate             | %      |    2.3 |    0.3 |\n| Weighted average share price at grant date | DKK    |  355   |  416   |\n\nFurthermore, the options are assumed to be exercised two years after expiry of the vesting period, on average, or at the option's expiry date if within one year. Volatility is estimated using\n\nthe historical volatility over the last three years. The risk-free interest rate is based on Danish government bonds with a maturity equivalent to the option's term to maturity.\n\n## Stock awards\n\nThe stock allocated under the programs is used for stock awards. In 2023, 137,305 stock awards with an aggregate fair value of DKK 49 million were granted (2022: DKK 45 million) which will be expensed over the three-year period (20232025).\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group has established stock-based incentive programs comprising equity-settled and cash-settled programs.\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of stock options and stock awards is measured with reference to the fair value of the stock options and stock awards granted. The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\n\nThe fair value of stock-based payment at the grant date is recognized as an employee cost over the period in which the stock options vest. In measuring the fair value, account is taken of the number of employees expected\n\nThe total number of outstanding stock awards at December 31, 2023 was 389,590 (2022: 314,029).\n\nThe fair value of these at December 31, 2023 was DKK 145 million (2022: 111 million).\n\nto gain entitlement to the options as well as the number of options the employees are expected to gain. This estimate is adjusted at the end of each reporting period such that only the number of options to which employees are entitled or expected to be entitled is recognized.\n\nThe value of equity-settled programs is recognized in equity. The value of cash-settled programs, which are recognized as Other liabilities, is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, and the subsequent adjustment is recognized in the income statement under Financial income or Financial costs.",

We actively invest to lower the carbon footprint of our operations and deliver low-carbon solutions to our customers. Our solutions play a key role in addressing many of the climate-related challenges facing the world.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes is committed to decarbonizing in line with a science-based pathway and to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our operations and value chain by 2050.\n\nWe are committed to a 75% reduction of emissions from our operations (scopes 1+2) and a 35% reduction from our supply chain (scope 3) by 2030 from a 2018 baseline. In addition, to deliver on our long-term ambition, we work with milestone targets. Thus, by 2025, we aim to source 100% renewable electricity and reduce absolute GHG emissions from operations by 65% from a 2018 baseline.\n\nIn 2022, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) re-validated our 2030 emissions reduction targets and our 2025 renewable electricity targets. Novozymes was among the first companies\n\nin the world to receive validation of our net-zero targets by SBTi.\n\nFurther information on our science-based targets is available in the Targets section of this report.\n\nWe are committed to improve our climate data quality and transparency. We conduct peerreviewed cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to document the environmental impact of our solutions. These studies are used to keep our stakeholders informed and to demonstrate to our customers ways to reduce their GHG emissions and leverage the positive impact on climate change that Novozymes' biosolutions can enable. Our published LCAs are available on our website. We also use this data to help our customers' improve their climate transparency by providing product carbon footprint data on request.\n\nWe disclose our climate change impacts through CDP every year. In 2023, Novozymes was recognized in CDP's Climate Change A List (leadership ranking) for our commitment to environmental transparency and climate action.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, the GHG emissions from our operations (scopes 1+2) decreased by 11% to 143,000 tonnes from 161,000 tonnes in 2022. This reduction was mainly driven by changes in product mix towards less resource consuming products, slightly lower production volumes, and implementation of efficiency-enhancing projects.\n\nWe have reduced our absolute emissions from our operations (scopes 1+2) by 67% from a 2018 baseline and are thus on track to achieving our 2025 target.\n\n| CO2-equivalent emissions  1,000 tonnes   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Natural gas                              |     35 |     40 |\n| Gas oil, light fuel oil, and diesel oil  |      4 |      4 |\n| HCFCs                                    |      1 |      2 |\n| Scope 1                                  |     40 |     46 |\n| District heat                            |      1 |      1 |\n| Electricity                              |     42 |     50 |\n| Steam                                    |     60 |     64 |\n| Scope 2 (market-based)                   |    103 |    115 |\n| Scopes 1 and 2, total                    |    143 |    161 |\n\n| Market-based vs. location-based scope 2 emissions 1,000 tonnes   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (market-based)                             |    103 |    115 |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (location-based)                           |    291 |    332 |",

For its operations, Novozymes relies on electricity, heat, and steam. Many of our biosolutions enable downstream users to save energy in certain applications compared with conventional methods, such as in detergents and textile applications.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe manage energy in our operations through a two-pronged approach: increasing the sourcing of renewable energy and reducing energy consumption in production by implementing optimization or energy-saving projects. Relevant targets drive our performance in these areas.\n\nAll energy efficiency and renewable energy sourcing efforts are managed and monitored by our Operations, Supply and Quality function. In addition to internal energy savings, Novozymes focuses on recovering energy from waste to use in operations and to distribute to our local communities.\n\nNovozymes has a target to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. This target was revalidated by the Science Based Targets initiative\n\n(SBTi) in 2022 and is in accordance with the best practice guidance defined by the RE100 initiative. We take a holistic approach in our end-to-end sourcing process, ensuring high quality and impactful projects for local communities, and we strive to purchase from the best electricity projects available.\n\nFurther information on our science-based targets is available in the Targets section of this report.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, our organic sales growth was recorded at 5%, while energy consumption decreased by 9%, compared to 2022 due to slightly lower production volumes, changes in product mix towards less resource consuming products, and the implementation of energy saving projects.\n\nIn 2023, projects driving process optimization and energy efficiency undertaken at our sites resulted in energy savings of approximately 56,000 GJ. The biggest drivers of this include heat recovery and installation of a heat pump at our site in China as well as energy savings from the reverse osmosis project in Kalundborg.\n\nWe also conducted smaller initiatives. For example, in Denmark, we initiated the 'Freezer Challenge' in collaboration with the NGO MyGreenLabs where lab teams were invited to come up with ideas to reduce the environmental footprint of cold storage units while maintaining the integrity of the samples stored in them.\n\n## Five-year energy consumption\n\n1,000 GJ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Energy consumption by primary source  1,000 GJ   | Energy consumption by primary source  1,000 GJ   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Natural gas                                      | Natural gas                                      | 678    | 762    |\n| Biogas                                           | Biogas                                           | 30     | 30     |\n| Gas oil, light fuel oil and diesel oil           | Gas oil, light fuel oil and diesel oil           | 49     | 39     |\n| Internally generated energy, total               | Internally generated energy, total               | 757    | 831    |\n| Electricity - conventional                       | Electricity - conventional                       | 392    | 506    |\n| Electricity - renewable                          | Electricity - renewable                          | 2,070  | 2,264  |\n| District heat - conventional                     | District heat - conventional                     | 57     | 56     |\n| District heat - renewable                        | District heat - renewable                        | 134    | 141    |\n| Steam                                            | Steam                                            | 986    | 1,042  |\n| Externally purchased energy, total               | Externally purchased energy, total               | 3,639  | 4,009  |\n| Energy consumption, total                        | ESG                                              | 4,396  | 4,840  |\n| Energy production from waste                     | Energy production from waste                     | 15     | 66     |",

Electricity accounts for more than half of the total energy consumed, and 84% of the electricity came from renewable sources, compared to 82% in 2022. The major contributor to this improvement was our site in Blair, U.S., which began to procure green electricity in 2023, converting approximately 145,000 GJ from conventional to renewable electricity.\n\n## Renewable electricity sources 2023 (2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn some of our sites we are still dependent on fossil-based steam and natural gas as a fuel source. We are exploring greener alternatives such as flex burners, electric boilers, and heat pumps to replace them. At our site Hongda, China, we now produce steam from a new high temperature heat pump technology which reduces the consumption of fossil-based heat at the site. We have also identified additional steam-saving projects in China that will be implemented in the coming years.\n\nMoving forward, we will seek to implement our strong portfolio of projects to further invest in renewable electricity, to find cleaner alternatives for natural gas and coal-based steam and to save and recover energy.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nEnergy consumption includes quantities consumed both in the production process and in other areas.\n\nInternally generated energy is measured as fuel consumption converted to energy based on the lower of combustion value and weight by volume, except in the U.S., where legal requirements for reporting carbon dioxide state that the higher of combustion value and weight by volume is to be applied. Fuel consumption comprises all types of fuel used to produce electricity, heat and steam on site and is converted to energy using factors supplied by utility providers or local authorities. Fuel for transportation purposes is not included.\n\nExternally generated energy is the input to Novozymes of externally generated electricity, heat and steam.\n\nEnergy produced from waste or wastewater is renewable and corresponds to the total energy (heat, electricity or steam) produced by an internal or external utility provider. An example is energy produced from biomass waste or biogas.\n\nReported quantities are based on meter readings, with the exception of steam, which may be subject to calculation.\n\nThe renewable energy percentage is calculated by dividing renewable energy consumed by total energy consumption. Renewable energy used at Novozymes sites comprises energy generated from natural processes and continuously replenished. Sources include solar, wind and hydropower-based electricity and energy from biogas and biomass.\n\nDistrict heat - renewable is primarily generated from biomass.",

The production, development, and processing of our solutions depends on the availability of water. We use water as a coolant, solvent, cleaning agent and as a component of our final products. Additionally, many of the raw materials required in our operations are agriculture-based and depend on water for production. Many of our biosolutions in textile, brewing, household care, and grain processing enable customers to reduce their water consumption compared with conventional methods or prevent water pollution by reducing dependence on hazardous chemicals.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur approach towards water stewardship is driven by science and our ambition to manage water in balance with local conditions at all our sites. We are committed to achieving overall water security by preserving water as a resource, addressing water challenges through biosolutions, and driving collective action with communities.\n\nFor our operations, we seek to reduce dependence on freshwater by implementing recycling and water efficiency projects, while ensuring compliance with local regulations. All our production sites have context-based water management plans drawn up based on site-specific risks\n\nand opportunities. These plans were developed in partnership with water experts and contain actions to improve the health of the water basins near our production sites and address sitespecific challenges including scarcity, quality and changing regulations. Our wastewater is biologically treated internally or externally before being discharged or before being recycled after secondary filtration. We aim to improve freshwater withdrawal by recycling 10% more water by 2025, 15% more by 2030, and 20% more by 2035 from a 2021 baseline.\n\nAt community level, we drive collective action with communities and organizations within our production basins. Our actions address shared water challenges such as flooding, impaired ecosystem services, water quality and scarcity, through collective action on Water, Sanitization and Hygiene (WASH), nature restoration, and watershed restoration. In addition, in basins close to our production sites where WASH is a challenge, we aim to restore 10 billion liters of water by 2025 and 30 billion liters by 2030 from a 2021 baseline.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, our water withdrawal decreased by 11% compared with 2022 and wastewater discharge decreased by 7% compared with 2022.

Among the activities, we build together loose boulder structures, gabion bunds, check dams, and recharge trenches. Since its start, the project has benefited approximately 3,100 people across five villages. In 2023, we continued restoring ground water in the region, and we are on track to meet our target of restoring 10 billion liters of water by 2025 in areas where WASH is a challenge.\n\nIn light of our ambition to manage water in balance with local conditions at all our sites, we carried out a pilot internally of the science-based targets for water methodology at our Hongda site. This included having a dialogue with our key Chinese suppliers on water management.\n\nHere, we have integrated the actual situation of water resource management in the Taihu basin and have set site level targets for water withdrawal which are in alignment with local basin conditions.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue to have site specific initiatives and aim for active engagement to identify hotspots, develop water efficiency projects, and reduce our dependence on freshwater.\n\n## Five-year wastewater by treatment method\n\n1,000 m\u00b3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Novozymes-treated to external water recipient\n- Novozymes-treated to irrigation\n- Novozymes-treated to external treatment\n- Untreated to external treatment\n\n| Wastewater discharged  1,000 m3          |     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Wastewater to irrigation                 |     | 634    | 825    |\n| Wastewater to surface water or treatment |     | 5,661  | 5,941  |\n| Wastewater discharged, total             | ESG | 6,295  | 6,766  |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWater withdrawal refers to the sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of Novozymes from all sources.

In our operations, we take a holistic approach towards circularity, by improving the recyclability of our packaging and by implementing site-specific initiatives to reduce and recover waste. In addition, our biosolutions enable our customers to adopt practices that help minimize waste from their operations. For example, our grain and vegetable oil processing biosolutions enable customers to optimize resource utilization by unlocking additional starch, protein, and oils from feedstock.\n\n## Our approach\n\nResponsible packaging and waste management at Novozymes is a key element in reducing the environmental impact of our operations. We remain committed to ensuring zero waste to landfill from our operations by 2030. In addition, we are committed to having three key circular projects successfully implemented by 2030. To deliver on these long-term ambitions, we work with milestone targets. By 2025, we aim to have two key circular projects in pilot stage with demonstrated benefit.\n\nGuided by our aim to achieve zero waste to landfill, we have a site-specific approach to waste\n\nmanagement with clearly outlined risks, opportunities, and prioritized actions. Regulations on waste management are complex and vary by region. To ensure compliance, we actively work with local experts and service providers to explore localized opportunities to manage waste.\n\nWe are also committed to minimizing the impact of the waste generated by our packaging materials. We strive to use less virgin plastic wherever possible. We have clear processes to assess new materials on specific recyclability and reusability criteria before they are approved for enzyme packaging.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, we continued to work towards our target to have zero waste to landfill from our operations by 2030. The total recycling and composting rate of our waste was above 99%, and less than 1% was sent to landfill or incineration without energy recovery. The total waste decreased to 544,000 tonnes in 2023 from 559,300 tonnes in 2022. The main driver for this change was the slightly reduced production volumes.\n\nOur waste is composed of biomass waste and non-biomass waste, and a small fraction of this non-biomass waste is treated as hazardous waste.\n\n## Total waste by disposal method 2023 (2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Biomass waste\n\nMost of the waste generated during the production of our biosolutions is biomass. It has essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, making it ideal for supporting agricultural activities. In 2023, 100% of our biomass was managed in a circular manner, just as in 2022.\n\nOur biomass waste is utilized as a raw material in fertilizer production for agriculture with or without prior biogas production. In Blair, U.S., we launched a disposal solution that will enable us to maintain our performance by disposing it towards land applications in spite of projected higher waste volumes due to ongoing plant expansion.\n\nThe weight of the biomass upon exit from our facilities varies depending on the site and the biosolutions produced there. To facilitate transportation and application of biomass waste, we adjust its water content in accordance with local requirements, ranging from 5% to 85%. In 2023, the total dry matter content for biomass used in agriculture was 61,000 tonnes.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue to focus on circular management of all of our biomass.\n\n|                     | Biomass wet (actual)   | Biomass wet (actual)   | Biomass dry matter (excl. water)   | Biomass dry matter (excl. water)   |\n|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Biomass             |                        |                        |                                    |                                    |\n| 1,000 tonnes        | 2023                   | 2022                   | 2023                               | 2022                               |\n| Used in agriculture | 529                    | 539                    | 61                                 | 53                                 |\n| Landfill            | -                      | -                      | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Biomass, total      | 529                    | 539                    | 61                                 | 53                                 |",

In 2023, the recycling rate of non-biomass waste was 74% compared with 63% in 2022. The remaining 26% of the waste was sent to landfill or incineration.\n\nTo further reduce, recycle, reuse, and recover the waste generated in 2023, we have undertaken various initiatives such as process improvements,\n\nresource optimization, process planning and waste sorting in order to optimize waste management. For example, at our site in Saskatoon, Canada, we use sterilized peat as a substrate to grow our microbes used in production processes. However, bags that are damaged are no longer considered sterile and were previously discarded. In 2023, we started segregating damaged peat bags and re-sterilizing them, which has enabled us to recover waste and turn it back into raw material.\n\nAcross regions, we implemented various initiatives in waste management. At one of our North American sites, cross-functional collaboration has led to increased recycling and eliminated the majority of the waste generated locally, which previously was sent to landfills.\n\nAt our sites in Denmark, in response to regulatory requirements, household-like waste (from canteens, coffee stations and workspaces) is now sorted in up to 10 fractions.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nBiomass is measured or calculated based on volume or weight produced. At each site, biomass is produced with a different dry matter to water ratio. The quantity of biomass dry matter is calculated based on spot checks of the dry matter content present in the wet biomass.\n\nNon-biomass waste is the registered volume of waste broken down into hazardous and nonhazardous waste, and by disposal method. The amount recycled is the quantity recycled internally or sent to an external service provider for recycling.\n\nAt our site in TEDA, China, we have reduced waste by quickly connecting departments digitally to enable them to exchange furniture, IT accessories, printers, etc. Moving forward, this initiative will be rolled out to other sites in China.\n\n## Circular Packaging\n\nIn 2023, we took action drawing from our previously developed circular packaging plans to make our key packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable. We have identified and started working on two strategic circular projects, and are on track to have both projects in pilots with demonstrated benefit by 2025.",

We take the well-being of the communities we operate in seriously. We do our best to implement meaningful solutions effectively so as to address any complaints we may receive from our neighbors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur commitment to environmental compliance is outlined in our Sustainability Policy. All activities to ensure environmental compliance are anchored in the Quality, Environment & Safety function. Novozymes' main production sites are certified to the ISO14001 Environmental Management System standard. Our management system is based on this standard and is applied to most of our operations.\n\nFurther details on ISO-certified companies can be found in Note 6.9 Group Companies.\n\nEnvironmental incidents and neighbor complaints are recorded in CAPTURE, our global incident management system. This system enables us to implement suitable remedial action to correct and prevent re-occurrence in the future. We strive to minimize the number of non-compliance and neighbor complaints.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nA total of 23 environmental breaches of regulatory limits were registered across our facilities in 2023, compared with 21 in 2022. Most of them were related to wastewater discharge and biomass processing, handling and distribution. None resulted in environmental fines. Plans for preventive action for these incidents have been agreed with the relevant authorities.\n\nNovozymes received 14 neighbor complaints in 2023, compared to 23 received in 2022. Most of them pertained to noise and light related to construction activities. The odor issues reported in 2022 have been resolved.\n\nTo support the growth of our human health business, we purchased two small production facilities in India at the end of 2021. Some of their environmental permits and consents were incomplete. We have begun the lengthy process of\n\namending these permits to align with production expectations, and implementing the actions needed to fulfil current and future environmental conditions.

We have interfaces with nature and biodiversity across our business from research and development to operations and product use.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' approach to biodiversity and nature is guided by the principles of the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity. We have defined systems and processes, housed by an internal committee, that ensure compliance with local and global regulations, guidelines, and protocols.\n\nTogether with our stakeholders, we work to ensure that guidance and requirements from regulatory authorities on biotech innovation is duly followed. We adhere to the globally recognized principles on the utilization of genetic resources. Our scientists are committed to using scientifically sound tools and developing solutions that are safe for humans, animals, and the environment.\n\nAs the world's leading biotech powerhouse, we are fully aware of our responsibility to see beyond the possibilities of our solutions and understand the broader impact we may have on nature and biodiversity as a company. This is why we support a science-based approach and follow developments in this area to take action on nature and biodiversity. We regularly assess how to incorporate best practices into our solutions, operations, and reporting through constant dialogue with relevant business groups and UN organizations.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, we continued to closely monitor and participate in ongoing discussions and dialogues on nature and biodiversity loss across the globe. This includes discussions around the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, a global vision and roadmap to halt and reverse biodiversity loss and live in harmony with nature. This framework was adopted by global leaders at the 2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference\n\nAs an active member of multilateral organizations, we follow developments of new methodologies for companies to monitor and establish targets to prevent and reverse nature and biodiversity loss. For example, we continued to\n\nbe a part of the technical dialogues on the changing reporting landscape through industry and business groups such as the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWe established a cross functional working group to understand how these developments could impact the way we develop, produce, and market our biosolutions. The group includes representatives from Operations, Public Affairs, Research & Development, and Sustainability, and it reports to the Corporate Sustainability Committee when relevant.\n\nAs a responsible producer, we take action in our efforts to restore water and biodiversity. In the TEDA industrial park, we are making an innovative attempt to improve overall water stewardship by fostering collaboration across companies to increase the use of recycled water within the park.\n\nMoving forward, we will explore additional ways to support the implementation of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Product stewardship is a priority for our business given that many of our biosolutions serve as ingredients in consumer products such as detergents or are used to manufacture consumer products such as food, textiles, paper, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.\n\n## Our approach\n\nProduct stewardship is an integral part of Novozymes' Quality Management System, and our approach is outlined in our Quality and Product Safety Policy.\n\nProcedures ensuring product stewardship for customers and end-users are enforced globally and audited by an independent external body. We collaborate with our customers, suppliers, and various trade associations to drive product safety and stewardship.\n\nNovozymes has internal targets on product stewardship that guide our progress. We evaluate performance in the areas of product safety and hazardous substance management and constantly strive to reduce risks for humans, animals, and the environment.\n\nFor example, we seek to improve our products to ensure enzymes release a minimum amount of dust and prevent allergies. We also educate our employees and customers on the safe handling of our products using multiple communication channels, such as safety data sheets, videos, posters, brochures, and safety catalogues.\n\nWherever feasible, we substitute hazardous substances in our operations with safer alternatives. Through a rigorous and comprehensive crossfunctional process, new and existing chemicals are screened annually for human health and environmental safety aspects, followed by risk and feasibility assessments to determine candidates for potential phase-out from our products.\n\nTo make it easier for our customers to ensure compliance of their products, we have a structured approach to key topics such as product information, labeling, and traceability. Novozymes' products comply with regulatory requirements such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals), one of the most advanced chemical legislations in the world, and food legislations such as FIAP (Food Improvement Agents Package).\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, we completed the implementation of our new Regulatory Information Management System, allowing us to retire legacy tools for product stewardship activities across Regulatory Affairs. It means that documents, communication, and registration activities are now digitally linked, enabling more transparency and smoother communication on regulatory compliance internally.\n\nTo address increasing societal concerns about Endocrine Disruptors (EDs), we decided to phase out both EDs and potential EDs from our products and have begun to screen relevant materials.\n\nWe continued to expand the list of our OEKOTEX\u00ae certified products, which is key for our textile and leather customers to bring certified greener products to the market. It requires proving the absence of unwanted chemicals such as carcinogens, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals, organotins, and flame retardants.\n\nChemical legislations similar to REACH are being implemented in other countries. In 2023, Novozymes successfully registered under such new legislation in T\u00fcrkiye. In response to new regulations in South Korea, Novozymes established a new process with Only Representatives\n\n(OR) that simplifies the regulatory obligations for customers. Novozymes is also a leading member of the South Korean Enzyme REACH Council, contributing to the discussion with authorities based on our own experience.\n\nNovozymes continued to lead discussions on enzyme safety implementation across the enzyme industry and customers' industries through various trade associations globally. As an outcome of these discussions, the association of enzyme producers, AMFEP (Association of Manufacturers Fermentation Enzyme Products), launched an updated guideline on safe handling of industrial enzyme preparations as well as a specific guideline for the safe handling of enzymes within the feed industry. AMFEP also launched a state-of-the-art module for supporting and managing the development of product claims and hazardous substance management.\n\nIn addition, Novozymes was part of the development of a new guideline on how to conduct risk assessments of enzyme-containing products for professional cleaning. It is being developed collaboratively by AMFEP, AISE (European detergent industry), ACI (American Cleaning Institute), and HCPA (Household & Commercial Product Association).",

Our employees embrace shared values to form a vibrant culture. Nurturing an inclusive and diverse organization where employees thrive is the foundation from which we continue to bring the power of biosolutions to the world.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe are committed to nurture a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. By 2030, we aim to achieve gender balance. This means that we will strive for a minimum of 45% women and 45% men across all professionals and in senior management.\n\nWe recognize that focusing on diversity of representation alone is not enough. For diverse teams to succeed, people need to feel that they are valued, respected, and have a shared sense of purpose, and thus we focus on inclusion. We take a regional approach to developing and defining programs based on local demographics to address diversity dimensions beyond gender. Many of our sites have Employee Resource Groups which aim to foster Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) locally.\n\nAt Novozymes, we have a policy for diversity and equal opportunities, which applies to our entire workforce. Our People and Organization (P&O) function, together with regional leaders across Novozymes are responsible for ensuring equal opportunities and for promoting DE&I.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nIn 2023, our senior management consisted of 215 employees of which 36% were women, an increase compared to 33% in 2022. In addition, gender balance across all professionals remained at 43% women and 57% men, as in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we promoted gender diversity among leaders in the company. As an example, our newest leadership program, Leading Tomorrow, was offered to an equal number of female and male leadership talents, which provides a gender balanced leadership talent pool for the future. Furthermore, we introduced specific requirements in our succession management systems to monitor diversity among the potential successors for leadership positions.\n\n| Gender diversity         |    | 2023   | 2023   | 2022   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------|----|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                          |    | Women  | Men    | Women  | Men    |\n| In senior management     | %  | 36     | 64     | 33     | 67     |\n| In management            | %  | 41     | 59     | 40     | 60     |\n| At professional levels   | %  | 46     | 54     | 45     | 55     |\n| Across all professionals | %  | 43     | 57     | 43     | 57     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, across Asia Pacific, we initiated local cultural festivals to create opportunities for employees to learn from, respect, and appreciate each other's countries in nurturing an inclusive regional workforce. The festivals included trainings on cultural awareness and unconscious bias along with hosting Country Cultural Shows.\n\nIn the Middle East and India, the focus on gender equity included a mentoring program focusing on leadership development for female employees. We hosted educational events, especially during Pride Month and International Women's Month, to enable greater understanding. In these countries, we also made changes to our benefits policy with regards to medical, bereavement, and parental leave.\n\nIn North America, managers were trained in inclusive leadership and asked to host inclusion-related team talks across the region. In Latin America, employee resource group leaders received training on effective sponsorship of DE&I, and all employees were encouraged to join a training session on the importance of promoting minority groups. In addition, an entire week in September was dedicated to workshops and engagements on DE&I.\n\nIn Denmark, we discontinued the nine-month seniority requirements for full pay during parental leave (birth and adoption) to provide equal access to all employees to this benefit. Our employees volunteered during Copenhagen Pride week, which raised awareness of human rights, equity, diversity, and inclusion through a series of workshops and seminars with external speakers. We also facilitated a 'girl takeover' initiative in cooperation with Plan B\u00f8rnefonden where a young woman gets to be leader for a day.\n\nMoving forward, we will continue our region specific approach and focus on being an inclusive and diverse organization.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nGender diversity in senior management measures the percentage of women and men in director positions or higher (i.e. director, vice president or executive vice president).\n\nGender diversity in management measures the percentage of women and men in middle management and specialist manager positions.\n\nGender diversity at professional levels measures the percentage of women and men in positions typically requiring an academic background or team lead positions.\n\nGender diversity across all professional levels measures the percentage of women and men across professional, manager, and senior leadership levels.\n\nAll of the above classifications are based on internal job categories.",

We want them to have a positive work-life synergy and bring out their best at work and beyond. This is crucial to our success as a business and for sustaining our reputation as a great place to work.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur ambition is to have a workplace where employees stay safe, thrive, and grow. To deliver on this long-term ambition, we have a health & safety strategy toward 2030 that includes initiatives on leadership, culture, behaviors, workplace, tools, and training.\n\nTo support our culture, our People and Health & Safety Policies set the guidelines, and our employee survey serves as an important tool to track the organization's disposition and support better team conversations that focus on how we work together at Novozymes.\n\nOur Health & Safety management system aims to ensure that robust safety processes, equipment, standards, tools, and training are fully integrated into the way we work. Our global incident\n\nhandling system, CAPTURE, enables us to monitor incidents and anchor improvements, corrective actions, and inspections. The data helps us develop targeted, theme-based safety initiatives, relevant to a specific site. Injury prevention is a focal point for Novozymes, and our preventive programs for enzyme and biological safety aim to protect both employees and customers.\n\nOur global and regional health and well-being groups address local challenges, using our Wellbeing Portal to roll out relevant initiatives.\n\nLearning and development is a key managerial responsibility with support from the People & Organization function.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nOur Thrive Index showed a score of 84, which is three points higher than the industry benchmark, indicating that our employees are learning, developing and feel connected to Novozymes' purpose and strategy.\n\n## Safety\n\nOur three-year rolling average frequency of occupational injuries with absence per million working hours was 1.5, equal to 1.5 in 2022. We are also on track to achieve our target for 2025 of \u22641.5.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted an analysis of incidents from previous years to develop a new strategy for health and safety with strengthened targets and several defined initiatives. For example, we had a global mandatory safety e-learning for all employees. We launched three new tools focused on safety during maintenance as well as performing and documenting risk assessments. These aim to ensure we have a 360-degree view of safety conditions and can take appropriate action, specific to each location and jobs being performed.\n\nThe results of our employee survey on safety were very positive, indicating that our employees feel physically safe and secure in their work environment. Moving forward, we will continue to drive a safety culture, to ensure that safety behaviors are part of our organization and to proactively prevent injuries.\n\n## Well-being\n\nIn 2023, we continued to roll out our researchbased e-learning program called Mindstrain.

Business ethics is integrated into everything we do and plan for the future. It is reflected in our purpose, values, policies, and position statements. We promote a strong compliance culture and take relevant measures to ensure compliance to the highest standards across all material environmental, social, governance, and financialrelated issues.\n\nOur purpose, values, and business integrity principles act as our code of conduct in business integrity matters. Our code of conduct forms the basis of our efforts to ensure a compliant business and eliminate all forms of corruption. It applies to all employees across the world and lays the ground rules for conducting business with honesty and fairness in compliance with laws and recognized standards for responsible and ethical business practices.\n\nIt contains principles, which among other things underline our zero tolerance position towards bribery and define clear rules for gifts and hospitality.\n\nAll employees have access to relevant guidance on business integrity and are encouraged to raise any concerns through the relevant grievance channels. In addition, annual compliance training in business integrity and competition law is conducted, which is mandatory for employees in scope. It focuses on anti-corruption, and it is based on questions raised during the year, including real-life case studies, to ensure relevance and applicability. We also provide targeted training on an ad-hoc basis, depending on needs or risks detected or foreseen.\n\nWe have a Committee responsible for the oversight of business integrity matters across the company. Members include executive and senior management representatives from both business and compliance functions. They meet on a regular basis to make strategic decisions and to follow up on the state of business integrity compliance and relevant initiatives.\n\nThe committee also engages with external advisors, when relevant, for a thorough and qualified decision-making process.\n\nWe work proactively to prevent, detect, and respond to fraud, corruption, and other business integrity violations. We have a global corporate whistleblower hotline which allows employees and external partners to report any concerns on illegal or unethical misconduct or other business integrity violations. The whistleblower hotline is supplemented by various internal reporting channels and screening activities. All allegations of fraud, corruption, and other business integrity cases are thoroughly investigated. Substantiated violations lead to proportionate disciplinary sanctions for the parties involved and an internal review on compliance gaps or potential improvements of policies and procedures.\n\nOur responsibility for ensuring ethical business practices also extends to our business partners. Our third-party due diligence processes seek to ensure that our commercial partners conduct business with integrity and share our values regarding legal compliance.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nThis year, Novozymes' business integrity training was completed by 98% of employees in scope, compared to 97% in 2022. The training provided a general reminder of the principles we abide by to mitigate the risk of bribery and corruption,\n\nwith a particular focus on conflicts of interest. The competition law compliance training in 2023 served as a general reminder of do's and don'ts and had a focus on competition law aspects associated with interactions with customers, which may also be competitors.\n\nAs in previous years, Novozymes had no reported violations of competition law in 2023.\n\nAdvanced data analytics remains the main channel for revealing potential fraud, and we have greatly enhanced our ability to rapidly detect and respond to cyberattacks. Read more in our Risk Management section. In 2023, investigations based on whistleblower reports and tip-offs increased compared to 2022. The increase is impacted by an increase in non-fraud related whistleblower reports. None of the substantiated cases had material business or financial impact for Novozymes. The increased threat from cybercrime led to an increase in the number of detected cybercrime cases in 2023 to 29 from 23 in 2022.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews quarterly information on all whistleblower reporting and other tipoffs on potential fraud and corruption.",

The centers have the space and tools to make high-quality prototypes in-house and help us collaborate faster with our customers. A key highlight was the Nutrition Claims tool that we developed to give customers a quick and simple overview of the regulatory scenario for potential nutritional claims on food labels in each EU member state, based on nutritional data from customer or pilot products.\n\nLearn more about customer co-creation in the Strategy & commitments section of this report.\n\nThis year, we also invested in seamless digital solutions and advanced analytical tools to enable commercial teams to deliver on targets. Further, we started a program to refresh our go-to-market strategy to increase growth, improve customer satisfaction, and build a stronger commercial model.\n\nWe continued to invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to secure insights, create efficiency, and develop better digital solutions and self-service options for our employees and customers.\n\nWhen it comes to sustainability disclosures, we received more requests in 2023 than previous years for sustainability data and information from our customers. It represents a clear signal of the growing importance of sustainability to companies today. In addition to these requests, Novozymes also worked closely with a few strategic partners on innovating together for sustainability.",

Novozymes supports LIBY's initiatives with advisory and data, where possible. In 2023, the collaboration between both companies were among the Top 100 Cases in the '2023 Chinese Enterprises Report on Low Carbon Transition and High-Quality Development'.\n\nIn 2023, Novozymes was one of the first companies to sign Unilever's Climate Promise, signaling our commitment to support their net-zero journey. We have championed their supplier engagement program at two separate Unilever supplier events. We conducted a joint decarbonization workshop to share knowledge and identify additional opportunities for Unilever to leverage biosolutions to deliver on their net-zero journey.\n\nTogether with our partners, we are shaping the future of energy. Ra\u00edzen is a leader in the production of low-carbon fuels and power from sugar cane, biomass, biogas, and biomethane. In 2023, Ra\u00edzen launched its second biomass ethanol plant with a capacity of producing 75 million liters of cellulosic ethanol per year with a minimal carbon footprint, powered by Novozymes' biosolutions. This is the first of many new plants they plan to build and operate by 2031.\n\nFS, one of our biofuels partners in Brazil, aims to be the largest producer of negative carbon biofuel in the world by building ethanol refineries with carbon capture and storage. These plants produce bioenergy, while removing carbon dioxide permanently from the atmosphere, by capturing the emissions released during the fermentation process and storing them underground. We provided vital carbon footprint data and supported their certification process because we strive to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is derived from an annual questionnaire measuring on a scale from 1-10 how likely the customer is to recommend Novozymes to others. The NPS is\n\ncalculated as the share of promoters (rating us 9 or 10) less the share of detractors (rating us 1-6). The resulting score is a value between -100 and +100.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe we have a responsibility for the well-being of the communities we operate in and to invest strategically in programs that create value to society. We inspire each other to make change happen and deliver on our promise of better lives in a growing world, both inside and outside the workplace.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs part of our strategy, we aim to nurture a working environment that empowers employees to give back to society and nature. We encourage this by pledging 1% of our work time to outreach activities that support community needs, help educate the next generation, and enable our employees to live more sustainably.\n\nNovozymes' global community outreach initiative 'Inspire' is driven by passionate employees, who are encouraged to contribute to better lives via initiatives which they are enthusiastic about. All regions have groups coordinating the local agenda with the regional leadership team.\n\nFurther philanthropic contributions are done indirectly through our dividend payments to the Novo Nordisk Foundation, through Novo Holdings A/S,\n\nwhich in 2023 held 29.2% of the shares in Novozymes (see The Novozymes Stock). The Foundation's objective is to support scientific, social, and humanitarian purposes, and it contributes to communities in large scale through donations and impact investments.\n\nIn addition, all employee-elected candidates serving on the Board of Directors donate the majority of their board remuneration to a foundation in the Novo Group called 'Medarbejdernes Honorarfond'. The excess capital of the foundation is granted for urgent humanitarian purposes or to humanitarian relief organizations.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\n## Engaging with our local communities\n\nTo support the people affected by the earthquake in February in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria, employees in T\u00fcrkiye purchased and packed supplies and in Germany, they raised funds for relief organizations. Novozymes also donated monetary support to T\u00fcrkiye Red Crescent and the Turkish NGO, Ahbap Platformu Resmi Sitesi.\n\nAs part of the welcome package, Novozymes Kenya introduced an initiative where every new employee plants 10 trees at a local high school to help the school become self-reliant in food for\n\nstudents. In North America, employees continued to facilitate numerous donations as well as volunteering at a food bank and a nursery.\n\n## Helping to educate the next generation\n\nNovozymes engaged with students all over the world to share the story about biosolutions, spread knowledge about study and career opportunities within STEM and by being passionate role models breaking prejudices and other barriers.\n\nIn Denmark, South Korea, Japan, South Africa and other countries, employees engaged with students from high school to university level, showcasing and teaching them the captivating aspects of our work with biosolutions, as well as engaging in career talks. In China, employees developed courses for the public to raise awareness on biology and sustainable development.\n\nIn North America, employees hosted demos at local libraries or schools, staffed a mobile innovation lab, and we also hosted over 100 elementary school children participating in STEM activities in our labs in Davis, U.S. In Brazil, we joined the 'Impulsione um Jovem' initiative, which provides support and mentorship to students in vulnerable situations to ensure continuity of their studies and reinforce their professional development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmpowering employees to live more sustainably Sustainable living is a common theme for team building activities. In China, employees organized a street survey to raise awareness about food security and build an understanding of the community's needs. In Denmark, employees went sailing in kayaks to collect trash across the harbor in Copenhagen, while others joined an initiative that promoted carpooling to and from our site to reduce traffic and personal carbon footprint. Across our Asia Pacific region, more than 800 employees joined an internal physical exercise campaign to raise awareness about environmental issues such as Earth Overshoot Day, as well as promoting healthy and sustainable living.",

        "page_content": "Social and governance data\n\n## 8.7 Responsible sourcing\n\nNovozymes' responsible sourcing practices are focused on environmental, social, and governance issues across our value chain. Agricultural raw materials are a major component of our production processes and having a responsible and secure supply of them is crucial for production at Novozymes.\n\n## Our approach\n\nNovozymes' sourcing department drives our supplier management and responsible sourcing program, anchored within Novozymes' Operations, Supply and Quality function. Our approach to responsible sourcing is defined by our Responsible Purchasing Standards (RPS) and managed through our Supplier Performance Management (SPM) process and the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (SEDEX) platform. Through the SPM process, Novozymes monitors suppliers and classifies their risk based on spend, country, and category. Novozymes uses the SEDEX collaboration platform to engage with suppliers and manage sustainability risks in our supply chain.\n\nIn addition, our suppliers of directly sourced agricultural raw materials are required to adhere to our requirements on zero net deforestation and zero tolerance for land grabbing. In case a supplier does not meet our assessment criteria,\n\neither an action plan is established, or an alternate supplier is identified.\n\nResponsible sourcing is a key driver of Novozymes' journey towards becoming net-zero by 2050. We aim to secure 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We are committed to reducing our supply chain (scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030, from a 2018 baseline. Furthermore, we recognize that the climate maturity of suppliers is critical for Novozymes' efforts to reduce emissions, and therefore engage with them on their own decarbonization efforts.\n\nFurther information on our efforts can be found in Note 7.1 Climate change.\n\n## 2023 summary\n\nWe are continuing to focus on progressing the existing opportunities to purchase renewable energy and identifying further long-term solutions. These initiatives require years of preparation. In 2023, 84% of our overall electricity consumption came from renewable sources, and we are well on track to meet our target for 2025.\n\nAs a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), 100% of the palm-derived products we sourced in 2023 were RSPO's mass\n\nbalance (MB) or Segregated (SG) certified. In 2023, Novozymes received its first RSPO supply chain (MB) certification in Denmark. We have now started working towards getting our Franklinton site certified in 2024. This certification further enables our customers to sell RSPO certified products themselves.\n\nAs part of our Human Rights commitments, our sourcing teams are given sustainability training on an annual basis, with a focus on human rights and modern slavery issues that may exist in our supply chain. In 2023, through this interactive training, the teams engaged with various online tools to improve our understanding of reporting violations, work with suppliers to resolve issues, and find common sustainability themes for engagement.\n\nThroughout 2023, our sourcing teams have initiated various activities to promote sustainability across our sites. For example, in India, we implemented new initiatives to reduce the amount of paper used, lower the carbon footprint of employee commuting, and by partnering with a warehouse partner to convert over half of their electricity consumption to renewable sources.\n\nOur suppliers of conference venues in Denmark are required to comply with high sustainability standards, such as acquiring a Green Key certificate. In 2023, over 90% of suppliers lived up to this requirement, and the rest have concrete action plans to fulfill it.\n\nAt the end of 2023, we introduced a code of conduct for our external business partners. The document covers broader themes such as business ethics, human and labor rights, occupational health and safety and environmental stewardship, including climate action. Going forward, it will replace our Responsible Purchasing Standard (RPS), and we will require all our external business partners, not just suppliers, to comply with this code of conduct.\n\nThis year, we adopted a new platform, ARAVO, which has now taken over the SPM process, which will enable better responsible sourcing data integration in the years to come. In 2024, we will work to deliver on our responsible sourcing strategy while ensuring compliance with emerging supply chain regulations.",

Additionally, the volume of transactions and geographical spread of the Group's operations increase complexity, including  in  respect  of          occurrence  and  timing  of  revenue.\n\nWe focus on this area because of the significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the inherent complexity in both revenue recognition and individual sales agreements including different terms therein.\n\nRefer to Note 2.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe considered the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policies for revenue recognition and assessed compliance with applicable financial reporting standards.\n\nWe performed risk assessment procedures with the purpose of achieving an understanding of IT-systems, business procedures and relevant controls regarding recognition of revenue. In respect of controls, we assessed whether they were designed and implemented effectively to address the risk of material misstatement. For selected controls, which we planned to rely on, we tested whether these controls had been performed on a consistent basis.\n\nWe discussed the judgments related to the recognition and classification of revenue with Management.\n\nWe performed substantive procedures regarding returns, delivery terms and rebates in order to assess the principles applied for   occurrence and timing of revenue.\n\nWe applied data analysis in our testing of revenue transactions in order to identify and test transactions outside the ordinary transaction flow.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of disclosures relating to revenue recognition.",

For a description of the Group's accounting policies, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies are unchanged from 2022.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for Novozymes A/S; please refer to the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Recognition and measurement in general\n\nIncome is recognized in the income statement as earned.\n\nAll costs incurred in generating the year's revenue are also recognized in the income statement, including depreciation, amortization and impairment losses.\n\nValue adjustments of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value or amortized cost are also recognized in the income statement.\n\nAssets are recognized in the balance sheet when it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the value of the asset can be reliably measured. Liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet when they are considered probable and can be reliably measured. On initial recognition, assets and liabilities are measured at cost. Assets and liabilities are subsequently measured as described below for each item.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThe accounting policies for intangible fixed assets follow those of the Group with the exception of goodwill, which is amortized over a period of 10 years using the straight-line method.\n\nAn amount equal to the total capitalized development costs after tax is recognized under Equity in Reserve for development costs.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recognized initially at cost and subsequently measured using the cost method. Dividends from investments in subsidiaries are recognized in the income\n\nstatement of the Parent Company in the financial year in which the dividend is declared. If the carrying amount of an investment in a subsidiary exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets in the subsidiary's financial statements, or the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary in the period in which the dividend is declared, the carrying amount of the subsidiary is tested for impairment.\n\nShare-based payments granted to employees of the Company's subsidiaries are recognized as contributions to the investment in the respective subsidiaries.\n\nInvestments in associates are initially recognized at cost and subsequently measured using the equity method. If the equity of associates is negative and Novozymes A/S has a legal or constructive obligation to cover their negative equity, a provision is recognized.\n\nShare purchase liabilities are obligations to invest in subsidiaries and are disclosed as a contractual obligation. The derivative embedded in the share purchase obligation is measured at fair value through the income statement.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend proposed for the financial year is shown as a separate item under Equity.\n\n## Treasury stock\n\nTreasury stock is used to reduce the common stock and to hedge employees' exercise of granted stock awards and stock options.",
