This situation has also had an impact on the operation of AcBel Polytech. However, we have also seen hidden important opportunities. At this time of fluctuation, we actively transformed to improve our adaptability, strengthen internal management, enhance product competitiveness, and ensure that we can flexibly respond to market fluctuations, and we would like to report to all shareholders AcBel's operating results in 2023 and business outlook for 2024.\n\n## 2023 Operating Results\n\nAcBel Polytech. achieved a consolidated revenue of $27,845 million for the entire year of 2023, an increase of 12.33% compared to the previous year of $24,789 million. The revenue has been growing continuously for six years. Due to one-time expenses and amortization generated by the acquisition of overseas targets, the consolidated net income before tax was $45.79 thousand, and EPS was $0.07.\n\nThe successful acquisition of the former ABB Power Conversion Division (now OmniOn Power) at the beginning of last year injected growth momentum into AcBel's revenue in the second half of the year. In the second half of the year, both parties have engaged in strategic cooperation in aspects of procurement, business, research and development, and manufacturing. We can expect this cooperation to generate a comprehensive effect of one plus one greater than two, and ensure that we continue to create value in this time of uncertainty.\n\nThe revenue of the power supply industry was lower than expected, mainly due to the dual impact of sluggish overall demand for consumer power supplies in the terminal market and  customer  inventory  adjustments,  resulting  in  sales  performance  below  expectations. Although there was a slight growth in demand for fuel cells and network communication products for enterprise power supplies, the revenue performance remained unchanged from last year. In addition, the telecommunications power supply business from OmniOn Power not only adds new customer groups to the company, but also brings a considerable degree of revenue contribution. In terms of overall consolidated revenue, the merger with OmniOn Power still leads to a historic high in revenue for the power supply industry.",

        "page_content": "In response to the global trend of net zero carbon emissions and revolutionary changes in transportation methods, it has become an inevitable trend for vehicles to switch from fuel internal combustion engines to electric power drives. AcBel has been deeply involved in the field of electric energy conversion for vehicles for many years and successfully won key electric module orders from international electric vehicle manufacturers in 2023. In addition, AcBel has collaborated with the largest charging station partner in the United States, from design to manufacturing,  and  has  a  key  position  as  a  Total  Solution  in  the  entire  electric  vehicle ecosystem.\n\nSince last year, the new energy industry has launched a new business model of light asset to  service  conversion,  no  longer  just  building  solar  power  plants,  but  transforming  into managers of solar power plants. Through the joint venture with the life insurance industry, 'AcSun  Energy  Inc.'  has  launched  a  continuous  operation  with  asset  management  and maintenance services as the main axis, which has brought great revenue injection.\n\nUnder  market  tightening,  the  metal  stamping  industry  significantly  increased  its automation equipment ratio last year to improve production efficiency and quality. Despite facing market challenges for the year 2023, profits remained at a certain level.\n\n## Business Environment and Development Strategy\n\nThe Company has been committed to practicing ESG in multiple fields for a long time.

Our main services include 'Power Supply Solutions', 'Intelligent Green Energy Services' and 'Electric Power Solutions'.\n\nIn the field of 'Power Supply Solutions', we mainly produce power supply products for consumer and enterprise applications. After the successful acquisition of the former ABB Power Conversion Division (now OmniOn Power) in 2023, we have further strengthened our comprehensive deployment in the power supply industry by combining its technological strength and product lines in the telecom power supply industry.\n\nAs the issue of global warming becomes increasingly serious, AcBel actively responds to the trend of energy saving and carbon reduction as well as government policies, and actively expands into emerging fields such as green energy and electric vehicles in recent years. Leveraging on its decades-long foundation in power supply, AcBel has successfully entered into the field of electric vehicles, with the scope of application extending from inside to outside of the vehicle. In the face of ESG requirements in Europe and the United States and the growing demand for renewable energy, AcBel rapidly promotes green power trading platforms to meet the market demand for green power and provide green power transfer services for corporate customers. In the future, AcBel's energy storage technology will be used to achieve the goals of intelligent energy aggregation and dispatching and diversified energy development.\n\nAcBel's global R&D headquarters is located in Taiwan, and now we have added professional R&D teams in the U.S. and other places to keep abreast of the latest market trends and conduct forward-looking technology research and product development oriented to customer needs, and we are committed to providing high-value products that meet the market demands.

In addition, the CPA will issue a Statement of Detached Independence that complies with the provisions of the CPA Code of Professional Ethics No. 10, Integrity, Impartiality, Objectivity, and Independence (the statement is briefly described as follows). The Company regularly evaluates the suitability of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) by referring to Audit Quality Indicators (AQIs). Based on the 13 indicators of AQIs, CPAs demonstrate superior performance compared to industry averages in terms of audit experience, professional support, turnover rate, and Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR) audit experience.\n\nThe Company will submit the above evaluation results to the Board of Directors for approval, and will re-implement the above evaluation if the CPA changes due to statutory regulations or internal factors to ensure the independence and competency of the CPA. The Company's independence evaluation of CPAs in 2024 has been adopted on the 23rd Meeting of 20th Session of Board of Directors on May 7, 2024 by resolution.\n\n| Evaluation Item of Independence and Competency of  CPAs   | Evaluation Item of Independence and Competency of  CPAs                                                                                          | Contents of the Statement of Detached  Independence                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                           | 1.

We also encourage suppliers to conduct greenhouse gas inventories, aiming to enhance the overall effectiveness of carbon reduction throughout the industry value chain.    Moreover, the Company also  procured  the  green  power  certificate  from  T-REC  of  Taiwan,  GEC  of  China  (green certificate), and I-REC (green power) certificate as one of the tools to reduce greenhouse gas. In 2023, we achieved our annual goals of reaching a renewable energy usage rate of 10% and meeting the annual targets set by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for carbon reduction. \u00b7 Water Resource Management\n\nIn addition, according to the Treasure Water Sustainable Goals of the United Nations SDGs, the Company introduced ISO 14046 water footprint inventory, reduce the environmental damage caused by water use through the impact analysis of water footprint, reduce water consumption, and  reduce  the  Company's  operating  costs.  In  2023,  our  company  implemented  various improvement measures across eight main operational bases, including Taiwan, China, and the Philippines. These measures included rainwater harvesting and optimization of water-saving facilities. We achieved the \"2030 Energy Sustainability\" goals, with a 46.63% reduction in water intake intensity compared to the baseline year of 2021 for AcBel Water Resources and a 41.60% reduction for Shanghai Sino Hardware.

In 2023, AcBel's hazardous waste intensity decreased by 9.11% compared to the previous year (a 48% reduction from the baseline year). However, we failed to meet our 2023 target due to the disposal of hazardous waste that had been stored for two years, leading to an increase in weight. On the other hand, Shanghai Sino Hardware Electronics Co., Ltd. reduced its hazardous waste intensity by 7.40% compared to 2022 (a 15% increase from the baseline year) due to effective management. As of 2023, our Dongguan, Wuhan, and Philippine plants have all achieved platinum-level certification from third-party organizations.\n\nThe Company provides environmental protection and energy-saving education training and organizes activities for employees, and employees lead their family members to work together to protect the earth and reduce the consumption of natural resources and environmental impact.

Where the employees' remuneration is paid in the form of shares, it shall be calculated on the basis of the closing price of ordinary shares on the day preceding the board resolution.

The Company's Major lines of Business\n\nAs one of the top ten leading manufacturers of switching power supply in the world, AcBel Polytech Inc. is mainly engaged in the research and development, production and sales of power supply, which accounts for about 90% of the total sales. With professional design and rich manufacturing experience, we provide customers with high-efficiency energy-saving products and complete power management solutions to serve our global customers.\n\nMain products consist of (1) consumer use power suppliers: applied to desktop computers, notebook computers, smart home appliances, and others; (2) business use power suppliers: applied to traditional servers, AI cloud servers, data centers storage devices, networking and telecommunication, and others. In addition, the Company is also actively expanding its developments in green energy, electric vehicle power supply solutions, and other emerging terrains.    The Company has also long been dedicated in the fundamentals of designing and manufacturing power suppliers.

New Products (Services) Planned for Development\n\nIn recent years, AcBel has been actively developing the green energy and electric vehicle related industries. The green energy development has progressed from hardware construction to platform services, and AcBel has been combining group resources to implement electric charging solutions. The explosive  growth  of  artificial  intelligence  applications  has  also  driven  strong  demand  for  highperformance power supplies. In the future, AcBel will combine OmniOn's solid R&D capabilities to strengthen and accelerate the R&D and production of AI power supplies, and provide optimal power solutions for AI data centers and peripheral computing needs. We also look forward to developing better performance  and  more  environmentally  friendly  solutions  through  continuous  innovation  and technological breakthroughs to further achieve the three main objectives of power generation, power saving and power storage.\n\n## (II) Industrial Overview:\n\n- 1. The Current Status and Development of the Industry\n- (1) Power Supply Industry\n\nPower Supply is a device that supplies stable and appropriate voltage or current to electronic products. Depending on the function and basic structure of the product, it is widely used in two major markets: consumer market and enterprise market.\n\n- A.  The consumer market, which mainly covers PCs and consumer electronic devices, is currently facing a tough environment with low price competition from manufacturers of the related industry.    In view of the development of AI applications and the gaming market, it was originally estimated in 2024 that the potential replacement of PCs and the demand for high-specification power supplies would drive demand in the consumer market. However, the  rising  operating  costs  of  AI  applications  have  revised  the  original  optimism  to conservatism, and the growth explosion may be delayed until next year or the year after.\n- B. Enterprise  cloud  power  supplies  are  mainly  applied  to  servers,  storage  devices,  and networking products. Although in 2023, due to interest rate hikes and economic recession concerns, cloud customers have become more conservative in their capital expenditures, canceling or suspending data center expansion plans one after another and extending the service life of their equipment. However, according to Digitimes' forecast, the AI cloud trend will lead the four major cloud providers in North America to return to a high-speed growth trajectory in capital expenditure in 2024, and it is estimated that the penetration rate of the four major providers will account for more than half of the overall server market in 2026. With the changing needs of data center design, there will be a move toward higher power, high density, high conversion efficiency, liquid cooling and other technologies.\n- C. At this stage, the smart grid market is still dominated by the deployment of infrastructure (smart meters). Due to the increase in the proportion of decentralized power generation from renewable energy and energy storage systems, it is expected that this will put pressure on the existing power system. The digitization and intelligence of the power grid will help to dynamically balance the power system between traditional units and renewable energy sources, which is an important key to the future energy transformation.\n\n## (2) Solar farm industry\n\nThe  net-zero  carbon-emission  transition  policies  of  various  countries  have  prompted  the transformation of industries and at the same time driven the development of the green energy",

        "page_content": "industry. Taiwan's government is promoting the '2050 Net Zero Carbon Emission Pathway', with a budget of nearly NT$900 billion by 2030, which will drive more than 4 trillion dollars of private investment. According to the report released by PwC Taiwan, 9.5% of Taiwan's total electricity generation of 282.1 billion kWh in 2023 will come from renewable energy sources, with solar energy accounting for 48% of the total renewable energy generation, amounting to 12.9 billion kWh, an increase of 20% over the previous year.\n\n## (3) Electric Vehicle Industry\n\nWith the rapid development of battery and automotive technology, the automotive industry is moving from fuel vehicles to electrification. Depending on the type of power supply and its proportion, they can be categorized into battery electric vehicles (BEVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles), and range extender electric vehicles (REEVs). According to IEK Consulting of Industrial Technology Research Institute, the global automobile market has resumed growth after the epidemic, and with the trend of net-zero emissions, the global sales volume of EVs will exceed 20 million units in 2023, with an annual growth rate of nearly 30%, and is expected to exceed 30 million units in 2025, with the penetration rate of EVs reaching 32%, and the compounded growth rate of EVs reaching 22% per annum. In addition, the rapid growth of EVs is also driving the demand for charging piles. According to TrendForce, the total number of public charging piles in the world is expected to reach 16 million in 2026, which is about triple the number in 2023. In conjunction with the Net Zero Act in Europe and the Biden Administration's construction goals in the U.S., the development of the charging pile market will have the opportunity to advance even further.\n\n- 2. The Links between the Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream Segments of the Industry Supply Chain\n\n## Links between upstream raw materials and the industry\n\nThe  main  raw  materials  for  switching  power  supplies  can  be  broadly  categorized  into  active components, passive components, magnetic components, other electronic components, chassis and printed circuit boards. Active components are mainly imported, while passive components and magnetic materials have a high domestic production rate. As the importance of power management functions increases, micro controllers or DSP chips will become the key components of high-end power  supplies.  Through  cooperation  and  information  exchange  with  upstream  suppliers,  the Company adjusts its supply chain and product development strategy to meet customer needs.\n\n## Links between downstream application products and switching power supplies\n\nDomestically  produced  switching  power  supplies  are  mainly  used  in  communication  products, computers and their peripherals, and in recent years, with the rapid development and popularization of AI technology, power supplies have become an important key component for AI applications. For high-performance AI servers, power supplies have to provide sufficient and stable power to drive CPUs, GPUs, or AI accelerators, and the efficiency of the power supply product is extremely critical, mainly because it directly affects the overall energy consumption and heat dissipation requirements. Highly efficient power supplies can also extend the lifespan of power supply and reduce server downtime due to power issues.",

In the enterprise cloud and communications sector, the construction of large-scale data centers is driving the trend of modular cabinet design, and the introduction of new energy sources is driving the demand for more efficient high-voltage DC systems, while communications power supplies are adopting a decentralized architecture and focusing on product reliability. The rise of different architectures and applications is expected to create new growth momentum in the highly standardized communications power supply market.\n\nIn the field of electric vehicles, from the initial individual components (such as on-board chargers, motor controllers, and DC converters), we are gradually moving towards integrated design (all-in-one electronic control products). The integrated design enables the mechanism and appearance to be shared to achieve universal miniaturized design and increase power density, and to develop to higher voltage systems (e.g. 800V), all-in-one integrated products, and new generation of compound semiconductor applications.\n\n## 4. Competition\n\nThe power supply industry is an industry with a high rate of self-manufacturing and driven by the demand for downstream information products. With the rise of concepts such as energy saving, carbon reduction, smart power usage and cloud services, the conversion efficiency, power management",

The debt-to-assets ratio:\n- Primarily due to an increase in total assets compared to the same period.\n- 2.   Long-term funding as a percentage of property, plant, and equipment:\n- Mainly due to an increase in shareholders' equity compared to the same period.\n- 3.   Interest coverage ratio:\n- Mainly due to a decrease in net income before taxes and interest expense compared to the same period.\n- 4.   Asset turnover ratio, equity return ratio, pre-tax income to paid-in capital ratio, net profit margin, earnings per share: Primarily due to a decrease in net profit after tax compared to the same period.\n- 5.   Cash flow ratio, cash flow reinvestment ratio:\n- Mainly due to an increase in net cash inflows from operating activities and other non-current assets compared to the same period.\n- Note 1:  All financial data from 2019 to 2023 have been audited and attested by the CPAs. The first-quarter 2024 financial statements have been audited and attested by the CPAs.\n\nNote 2:  The calculation formulas for the above items of financial analysis data are listed as follows:\n\n- 1. Financial structure\n- (1) Debt-to-assets ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets.\n- (2) Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities) / Net property, plant and equipment.\n- 2. Solvency\n- (1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities.\n- (3) Interest coverage ratio = Income before tax and interest expenses / Interest expenses.\n- 3. Operating Ability\n- (1) Receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Net sales / Balance of average receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations).\n- (2) Average collection days = 365 / Receivables turnover ratio.\n- (3) Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory.\n- (4) Payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Balance of average payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations).\n- (5) Average days for sale = 365 / Inventory turnover ratio.",

        "page_content": "- (6) Property, plant and equipment turnover ratio = Net sales / Average net property, plant and equipment.\n- (7) Total asset turnover ratio = Net sales / Average total assets.\n- 4. Profitability\n- (1) Return on assets = [Net income after tax + Interest expenses x (1 - Tax rate)] / Average total assets.\n- (2) Return on equity = Net income after tax / Average total equity.\n- (3) Net profit margin = Net income after tax / Net sales.\n- (4) Earnings per share = (Net income attributable to owners of parent company - Dividends on preferred shares) / Weighted average number of shares issued (Note 4).\n\n## 5. Cash Flow\n\n- (1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Net cash flow adequacy ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities for the most recent five years / (Capital expenditures + Inventory increase + Cash dividends) for the most recent five years.\n- (3) Cash reinvestment ratio = (Net cash flow from operating activities - Cash dividends) / (Gross property, plant and equipment + Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Working capital). (Note 5)\n\n## 6. Leverage\n\n- (1) Operating leverage = (Net operating income - Changes in operating costs and expenses)/Operating income (Note 6).\n- (2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income - Interest expenses).\n- Note 4: Special attention shall be paid to the following matters when the above calculation formula for earnings per share is used:\n- 1. Use the weighted average number of ordinary shares, not the number of shares issued at the end of the year.\n- 2. Capital increase for cash or treasury shares transactions shall be considered when the weighted average number of shares is calculated.\n- 3. Capital increase from surplus earnings or capital reserve shall be retrospectively adjusted by the proportion of capital increase when earnings per share for previous annual and semi-annual periods are calculated. The issue period for capital increase does not have to be considered.\n- 4. For preferred shares that are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, dividends (regardless of whether they are distributed) shall be deducted from net income after tax or included as net loss after tax. If preferred shares are non-cumulative, where net income after tax is available, dividends on preferred shares shall be deducted from net income after tax. No adjustment is required if the Company has loss after tax.\n\n## Note 5: Special attention shall be paid to the following in the process of cash flow analysis:\n\n- 1. Net cash flow from operating activities refers to net cash flow generated from operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\n- 2. Capital expenditures refer to the annual cash flow used in capital investment.\n- 3. The increase in inventory is included only if the balance at the end of the year is greater than the balance at the beginning of the year. If it is the other way around, the number used should be zero.\n- 4. Cash dividends include cash dividends on ordinary shares and preferred shares.\n- 5. Gross  property,  plant  and  equipment  refers  to  the  total  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  minus accumulated depreciation.\n- Note 6: The issuer shall classify the operating costs and operating expenses as fixed or variable based on their nature. If it involves estimation or subjective judgment, attention shall be paid to its rationality and consistency.\n- Note 7: Where company shares have no par value or where the par value per share is not NT$10, any calculation involving paid-in capital and its ratio shall be replaced with the calculation of the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the balance sheet.",

recent two years:\n\n- 1. Debt to Asset Ratio:\n- Primarily due to an increase in total assets compared to the same period.\n- 2. Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment:\n- It is mainly due to the increase in the shareholders' equity over the same period.\n- 3. Interest coverage ratio:\n- Primarily due to a decrease in net profits (earnings) before interest and taxes compared to the same period.\n- 4. Total asset turnover ratio (times):\n- Primarily due to an increase in the average total assets compared to the same period.\n- 5. Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Pre-tax income to paid-in capital ratio, Net Profit Margin, Earnings Per Share (EPS):\n- Primarily due to a decrease in net income after taxes compared to the same period.\n- 6. Cash Flow Ratio (%), Cash Flow Reinvestment Ratio (%), Cash Flow Adequacy Ratio (%):\n- Primarily due to net cash outflows from operating activities and long-term investments, as well as capital expenditures. 7. Operating leverage:\n- It is mainly due to the increase in net operating profit over the same period.\n\nNote 1:\n\n- All financial data from 2019 to 2023 have been audited and attested by the CPAs.\n\nNote 2:\n\n- The ratio of cash flow and leverage is zero or negative.\n\nNote 3:\n\n- The calculation formulas for the above items of financial analysis data are listed as follows:\n- 1. Financial structure\n- (1) Debt-to-assets ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets.\n- (2) Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities) / Net property, plant and equipment.\n- 2. Solvency\n- (1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities.\n- (3) Interest coverage ratio = Income before tax and interest expenses / Interest expenses.\n- 3. Operating Ability\n- (1) Receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Net sales / Balance of average receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations).\n- (2) Average collection days = 365 / Receivables turnover ratio.\n- (3) Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory.\n- (4) Payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Balance of average payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations).\n- (5) Average days for sale = 365 / Inventory turnover ratio.",

Profitability\n\n- (1) Return on assets = [Net income after tax + Interest expenses x (1 - Tax rate)] / Average total assets.\n- (2) Return on equity = Net income after tax / Average total equity.\n- (3) Net profit margin = Net income after tax / Net sales.\n- (4) Earnings per share = (Net income attributable to owners of parent company - Dividends on preferred shares) / Weighted average number of shares issued (Note 4).\n\n## 5. Cash Flow\n\n- (1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Net cash flow adequacy ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities for the most recent five years / (Capital expenditures + Inventory increase + Cash dividends) for the most recent five years.\n- (3) Cash reinvestment ratio = (Net cash flow from operating activities - Cash dividends) / (Gross property, plant and equipment + Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Working capital).

Leverage\n\n- (1) Operating leverage = (Net operating income - Changes in operating costs and expenses)/Operating income (Note 6).\n- (2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income - Interest expenses).\n- Note 4:  Special attention shall be paid to the following matters when the above calculation formula for earnings per share is\n- used:\n- 1. Use the weighted average number of ordinary shares, not the number of shares issued at the end of the year.\n- 2. Capital increase for cash or treasury shares transactions shall be considered when the weighted average number of shares is calculated.\n- 3. Capital increase from surplus earnings or capital reserve shall be retrospectively adjusted by the proportion of capital increase when earnings per share for previous annual and semi-annual periods are calculated. The issue period for capital increase does not have to be considered.\n- 4. For preferred shares that are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, dividends (regardless of whether they are distributed) shall be deducted from net income after tax or included as net loss after tax. If preferred shares are non-cumulative, where net income after tax is available, dividends on preferred shares shall be deducted from net income after tax. No adjustment is required if the Company has loss after tax.\n\n## Note 5:  Special attention shall be paid to the following in the process of cash flow analysis:\n\n- 1. Net cash flow from operating activities refers to net cash flow generated from operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\n- 2. Capital expenditures refer to the annual cash flow used in capital investment.\n- 3. The increase in inventory is included only if the balance at the end of the year is greater than the balance at the beginning of the year. If it is the other way around, the number used should be zero.\n- 4. Cash dividends include cash dividends on ordinary shares and preferred shares.\n- 5. Gross  property,  plant  and  equipment  refers  to  the  total  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  minus accumulated depreciation.\n- Note 6:  The issuer shall classify the operating costs and operating expenses as fixed or variable based on their nature. If it involves estimation or subjective judgment, attention shall be paid to its rationality and consistency.\n- Note 7:  Where company shares have no par value or where the par value per share is not NT$10, any calculation involving paid-in capital and its ratio shall be replaced with the calculation of the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the balance sheet.",

Changes in Interest Rates\n\nIn 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down, the war between Russia and Ukraine affected the global political and economic situation, accompanied with the increasingly serous inflation problem, U.S. and Europe successively took on tightening interest policies. Central Bank of Taiwan also raised interest rates to tackle inflation. However, there was not much room for interest rates to continue to be adjusted upward, and as the Company and its subsidiaries currently still have a large amount of available bank credits, the impact on the Company's capital utilization should be limited.\n\n## 3. Changes in Exchange Rate\n\nThe exchange rate of Taiwan dollar against the US dollar at the end of 2023 was 30.735 dollars, a depreciation of 0.027 dollars (-0.09%) compared with that at the end of 2022, which was favorable to most of the products quoted in US dollars by the Company and its subsidiaries. In order to effectively manage the exchange rate risk, the Company and its subsidiaries try their best to quote in US dollars for purchase and payment, so as to achieve the effect of natural hedging. The Company also has formulated the Operational procedures for Acquisition and Disposal of Assets, with the financial department referring to the analysis of well-known banks and research institutions at home and abroad, to engage in forwarding exchange, exchange rate swaps and other hedging derivative financial commodity trading, so as to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## 4. Inflation\n\nIn 2023, the consumer price index (CPI) in Taiwan increased by 2.49% and the producer price index (PPI) in Taiwan decreased by 0.57%, compared with those of 2022. The Company and its subsidiaries adjusted selling prices accordingly and hence the profits and losses were not materially affected.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with The Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these  requirements.  We believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report were as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue- Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(o) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales  revenue  and  revenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is  shown  in  note  (6)(y)  of  the  consolidated financial statements.",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nThe Group has established vender managed inventories in overseas warehouses which do not belong to the Group. The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Group, should be based on the circumstance  of  VMI client  delivery.  Both  parties  reconcile  periodically  to  ensure  the  consistency  in  the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur  principal  audit  procedures  included:  understanding  and  testing  the  related  controls  surrounding  the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between AcBel Polytech Inc. and VMI  client  delivery,  selectively  conducting  external  confirmations  on  VMI,  as  well  as  assessing  the operating  revenue  recognition  (including  VMI)  of  the  Group  to  determine  whether  related  accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(h) inventories and note (5) of the consolidated financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses is shown in note (6)(g) of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Group is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluation in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow moving inventories to determine whether  policies  of  the  Group  and  accounting  policies  are  applied.  In  addition,  in  order  to  verify  the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## 3. Business combination\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(q), business combination, of the consolidated financial statements for the accounting policy  on  business  combination.  Information  regarding  business  combination  is  shown  in  note  (6)(i) acquisition of the subsidiary of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matters:\n\nTo promote and accelerate the technological upgrading and transformation of the power supply industry and to deepen the development of the North American market, the Company acquired 100% of Lineage Power Holding Inc. (renamed as Omnion Power Inc.),  the power conversion department of ABB Group on July 3, 2023, through its U.S. subsidiary, AcLeap Power (USA) Inc. Due to the subjective nature of evaluation and complexity of the calculation of the consideration to be transferred and the fair value of the underlying assets to be obtained, the business combination transaction is one of the key audit matters in our audit.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  on  Auditing  of  the  Republic  of  China,  we  exercise professional judgment and professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.",

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cause significant  doubt  on  the  Group' s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  we  conclude  that  a  material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partners on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report are Wang, I-Wen and Kuo, Kuan-Ying.\n\n## KPMG\n\nTaipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) March 12, 2024\n\n## Notes to Readers\n\nThe  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  are  intended  only  to  present  the  consolidated  financial  position,  financial performance and cash flows in accordance with the accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the Republic of China and not  those  of  any  other  jurisdictions.  The  standards,  procedures  and  practices  to  audit such  consolidated  financial  statements are  those generally accepted and applied in the Republic of China.\n\nThe independent auditors'audit report and the accompanying consolidated financial statements are the English translation of the Chinese version prepared and used in the Republic of China. If there is any conflict between, or any difference in the interpretation of the English and Chinese language independent auditors'audit report and consolidated financial statements, the Chinese version shall prevail.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (ii) Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of each Group entities is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the entities operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in New Taiwan Dollar, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information presented in New Taiwan Dollar has been rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n## (c) Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Principle of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights  to,  variable  returns  from  its  involvement  with  the  entity  and  has  the  ability  to  affect those returns through its control over the entity.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Intragroup  balances  and  transactions,  and  any  unrealized  income  and  expenses  arising  from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Group attributes the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income to the owners  of  the  parent  and  to  the  non-controlling  interests,  even  if  this  results  in  the  noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nThe Group prepares consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n\nChanges in the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are  accounted  for  as  equity  transactions.  Any  differences  between  the  amount  by  which  the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received will be recognized directly in equity, and the Group will attribute it to the owners of the parent.\n\nWhen  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognizes  the  assets  (including  any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control  is  lost,  with  the  resulting  gain  or  loss  being  recognized  in  profit  or  loss.  The Group recognizes as gain or loss in profit or loss the difference between (i) the fair value of the consideration received as well as any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost; and (ii) the assets (including any goodwill), liabilities of the subsidiary as well as any related non-controlling interests at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost, as gain or loss in profit or loss. When the Group loses control of its subsidiary, it accounts for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if it had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.",

At  the  end  of  each subsequent reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into  the  functional  currencies  using  the  exchange  rate  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  items denominated  in  foreign  currencies  that  are  measured  at  fair  value  are  translated  into  the functional currencies using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nExchange differences are generally recognized in profit or loss, except for those differences relating to the following, which are recognized in other comprehensive income:\n\n- 1) an  investment  in  equity  securities  designated  as  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income;\n- 2) a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that hedge is effect; or\n- 3) qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that hedges are effective.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into the Group's functional currency at the exchange rates at the reporting date.  The income and expenses of foreign operations, are translated into the Group's functional currency at the average exchange rate. Exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is  lost,  the  cumulative  amount  in  the  translation  reserve  related  to  that  foreign  operation  is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of investment in an associate of joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining  significant  or  joint  control,  the  relevant  proportion  of  the  cumulative  amount  is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planed nor likely in the foreseeable future. Exchange differences arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (e) Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nAn asset is classified as current under one of the following criteria, and all other assets are classified as non-current.\n\n- (i) It is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle;\n\n(Continued)",

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by  the  issue  of  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its classification.\n\n## (f) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known  amounts  of  cash  and  which  are  subject  to  an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes are reclassified as cash equivalents.\n\n## (g) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially  recognized  when  the  Group becomes  a party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument.  A  financial  asset  (unless  it  is  an  account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll  regular  way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial  assets  are  reclassified  on  the  first  day  of  the  first  reporting  period  following  the change in the business model.",

Interest income,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses,  as  well  as  impairment,  are  recognized  in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- 2) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI )\n- A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n- \u00b7 it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both  collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSome accounts receivables are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by  both  collecting  contractual  cash  flows  and  selling  by  the  Group,  therefore,  those receivables  are  measured  at  FVOCI.  However,  they  are  included  in  the  account receivables line items.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt  investments  at  FVOCI  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Interest  income calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other  comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nEquity  investments  at  FVOCI  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Dividends  are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part  of  the  cost  of  the  investment.  Other  net  gains  and  losses  are  recognized  in  other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the exdividend date.",

On  initial  recognition,  the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be measured  at  amortized  cost  or  at  FVOCI,  as  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe  Group recognizes  loss  allowances  for  expected  credit  losses  (ECL)  on  financial assets measured at amortized cost (including cash and cash equivalents, amortized costs, notes  and  accounts  receivable,  other  receivables(current  and  non-current),  guarantee deposit paid and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL), except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:\n\n- \u00b7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nLoss  allowance  for  accounts  receivable  and  contract  assets  are  always  measured  at  an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Group's historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  as  well  as  forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of 'investment grade which is considered to be BBB- or higher per  Standard & Poor's, Baa3 or higher per Moody's or twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings'.\n\nThe Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the financial asset is more than  90  days  past  due or  the  borrower  is  unlikely  to  pay  its  credit  obligations  to  the Group in full.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe  maximum  period  considered  when  estimating  ECLs  is  the  maximum  contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost  and  debt  securities  at  FVOCI  are  credit-impaired.  A  financial  asset  is  'creditimpaired'  when  one  or  more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the  estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial assets is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7the lender of the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n\n\u00b7the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged  to  profit  or  loss  and  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  instead  of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nThe  gross  carrying  amount  of  a  financial  asset  is  written  off  when  the  Group  has  no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing  and  amount  of  write-off  based  on  whether  there  is  a  reasonable  expectation  of recovery.  The  Group  expects  no  significant  recovery  from  the  amount  written  off. However,  financial  assets  that  are  written  off  could  still  be  subject  to  enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 5) Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the  financial  asset  are  transferred  or  in  which  the  Group  neither  transfers  nor  retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of balance sheet, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized.\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n## 1) Classification of debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as financial liabilities or equity  in  accordance  with  the  substance  of  the  contractual  arrangements  and  the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## 2) Equity instrument\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it  is  designated  as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are measured  at  fair  value  and  net  gains  and  losses,  including  any  interest  expense,  are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Group  derecognizes  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual  obligations  are discharged  or  cancelled,  or  expire.  The  Group also  derecognizes  a  financial  liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different,  in  which  case  a  new  financial  liability  based  on  the  modified  terms  is recognized at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 5) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement  of  balance  sheet  when,  and  only  when,  the  Group currently  has  a  legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe  Group  designates  certain  hedging  instruments,  which  include  derivatives,  as  either  fair value hedges.\n\nAt inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective  and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedge.  The  Group  also  documents  the  economic relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  including  whether  the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.\n\nIf  the  hedge  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting  or  the  hedging  instrument  is sold,  expires  is  terminated  or  is  exercised,  then  hedge  accounting  is  discontinued prospectively. The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is based  on  weighted-average  costing  principle  and  includes  expenditure  incurred  in  acquiring  the inventories,  production  or  conversion  costs,  and  other  costs  incurred  in  bringing  them  to  their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.",

Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and  are  recognized  initially  at  cost.  The  cost  of  the  investment  includes  transaction  costs.  The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  Group' s  share  of  the  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive income of those associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group from the date on which significant influence commences until the date on which significant  influence  ceases.  The  Group  recognizes  any  changes  of  its  proportionate  share  in  the investee within capital surplus, when an associate's equity changes due to reasons other than profit and loss or comprehensive income, which did not result in changes in actual proportionate share.\n\nGain and loss resulting  from  the transactions between the Group and an associate are recognized only to the extent of unrealized Group's interest in the associate.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interests in an associate, it discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the recognized interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## (j) Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nItems  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost,  which  includes  capitalized borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group.\n\n## (iii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated on the cost of an asset less its residual value and is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nLand is not depreciated.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## (i) As a lessee\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any  initial  direct  costs  incurred  and  an  estimate  of  costs  to  dismantle  and  remove  the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe  right-of-use  asset  is  subsequently  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- 1) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- 2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- 3) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n- 4) payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  It is remeasured when:",

The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor sale-and-leaseback transactions, the Group applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted  for  as  a  sale  of  the  asset.  If  the  transfer  of  an  asset  satisfies  the  requirement  of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Group recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (ii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance  lease  or  an  operating  lease.  To  classify  each  lease,  the  Group  makes  an  overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers  certain  indicators  such  as  whether  the  lease  is  for  the  major  part  of  the economic life of the asset.",

Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\nFor other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does  not  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been  determined,  net  of  depreciation  or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## (n) Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present obligation that can be  estimated  reliably,  and  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  the  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.\n\nA  provision  for  the  site  restoration  is  measured  at  a  restoration  cost  which  was  estimated  using different assumptions on the related changes in cost-elements from current market price.\n\nThe  Group follows  the  policy  of  Bureau  of  Energy,  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs,  accruing  the module recycle fee based on the size of the power station, and recognize as provision by the present value of decommissioning costs.\n\n## (o) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue  is  measured  based  on  the  consideration  to  which  the  Group expects  to  be  entitled  in exchange  for  transferring  goods.

The  Group recognizes revenue when control of the products has been transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the  risks  of  obsolescence  and  loss  have  been  transferred  to  the  customer,  and  either  the customer  has  accepted  the  products  in  accordance  with  the  sales  contract,  the  acceptance provisions  have  lapsed,  or  the  Group has  objective  evidence  that  all  criteria  for  acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Group  often  offers  volume  discounts  to  its  customers  based  on  aggregate  sales  of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  No  element  of  financing  is  deemed  present  as  the  sales  of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term,  which  is  consistent  with  the  market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed  through  the  grid,  and  the  revenue  is  calculated  according  to  the  fee  agreed  with Taiwan Power Company.\n\n## (iii) Engineering contract and vendering of service\n\nThe  Group  provides  engineering  service,  project  management  advisory  and  maintenance services. Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services  are  rendered.  For  fixed-price  contracts,  revenue  is  recognized  based  on  the  actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services provided is determined based on the services incurred to date as a proportion of the total services of the transaction. In case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by the Group exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognized.\n\n## (iv) Financing components\n\nThe Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

Other government grants related to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant; they are then recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses or losses  incurred  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  on  a  systematic  basis  in  the  periods  in  which  the expenses or losses are recognized.\n\n## (q) Business combination\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  business  combinations  using  the  acquisition  method.  The  goodwill arising from an acquisition is measured as the excess of (i) the consideration transferred (which is generally measured at fair value) and (ii) the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, both over the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. If the amount calculated above is a deficit balance, the Company recognized that amount as a gain on a bargain purchase in profit or loss immediately after reassessing whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed.\n\nAll acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except for the issuance of debt or equity instruments.\n\nFor  each  business  combination,  the  Group  measures  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest' s  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree' s identifiable net assets, if the non-controlling interests are present ownership interests and entitle their holders  to  a  proportionate  share  of  the  Group' s  net  assets  in  the  event  of  liquidation.  Other components  of  non-controlling  interests  are  measured  at  their  acquisition-date  fair  values,  unless another measurement basis is required by the IFRSs endorsed by the FSC.\n\nIn  a  business  combination  achieved  in  stages,  the  Group  remeasures  its  previously  held  equity interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, and recognizes the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss. In prior reporting periods, the Group may have recognized changes in the value of the acquiree's  equity  in  other  comprehensive  income.  If  so,  the  amount  that  was  recognized  in  other comprehensive income will be recognized on the same basis as if the Group had directly disposed of the previously held equity interest. If the disposal of the equity interest requires a reclassification to profit or loss, such an amount will be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf  the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete prior to the reporting date of the combination transaction, the Group reports in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items  for  which  the  accounting  is  incomplete.  During  the  measurement  period,  the  Group retrospectively  adjusts  or  recognizes  additional  assets  or  liabilities  to  reflect  new  information obtained  about  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  The  measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\n## (r) Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  comprise  current  taxes  and  deferred  taxes.  Except  for  expenses  related  to  business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes shall be recognized in profit or loss.",

The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.  It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred  taxes  arise  due  to  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) assets  or  liabilities  that  are  not  part  of  a  business  combination  and  that,  at  the  time  of  the transaction, (i) affect neither the accounting nor taxable profit (loss) and (ii) do not give rise to equivalent taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n- (ii) temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to  the  extent  that  the  Group  is  able  to  control  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- (iii) taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred taxes are measured at tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reserve, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the following criteria are met:\n\n- (i) the  Group  has  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  set  off  current  tax  assets  against  current  tax liabilities; and\n- (ii) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:\n- 1) the same taxable entity; or\n- 2) different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis,  or  to  realize  the  assets  and  liabilities  simultaneously,  in  each  future  period  in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the carry forward of unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and  are  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no  longer  probable  that  the  related  tax  benefits  will  be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.",

When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the total of the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present  value  of  the  economic  benefits,  consideration  is  given  to  any  minimum  funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity.

The  amount  recognized  as  an  expense  is  adjusted  to  reflect  the  number  of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\nFor share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased  payment  is  measured  to  reflect  such  conditions,  and  there  is  no  true-up  for  differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\n## (u) Earnings per share\n\nThe Group discloses the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company. The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding.

Thereafter, generally, the assets or disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount  and  fair  value,  less  costs  to  sell.  Any  impairment  loss  on  a  disposal  group  is  first allocated to goodwill, and then to the remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to assets not within the scope of IAS 36 - Impairment of Assets. Such assets  will  continue  to  be  measured  in  accordance  with  the  Group' s  accounting  policies. Impairment  losses  on  assets  initially  classified  as  held-for-sale  and  any  subsequent  gains  or losses on remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.

The  management recognizes  any  changes  in  accounting  estimates  during  the  period  and  the  impact  of  those  changes  in accounting estimates in the next period.\n\nThere are no critical  judgments  in applying the accounting policies that have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is as follows.  Those  assumptions  and  estimation  have  been  updated  to  reflect  the  impact  of  COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n## Inventory valuation\n\nInventories are supposed to be measured based on the lower of cost or net realizable value. Due to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, which tends to devalue the inventories, the Group evaluates the costs of inventories using the net realizable value. Inventory valuation is based on the demand of the products during the specific period, therefore, the value of inventories may be variable due to the nature of fast-paced industry. Please refer to note (6)(g) of the consolidated financial statement for inventory valuation.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe goodwill is mainly derived from the operating value in the market, and it is expected to  generate  synergies  through  integration  with  the  consolidated  company's  operations, and no income tax is expected.\n\nThe Consolidated Company will review the above matters on an ongoing basis during the Measurement Period. The accounting treatment of the Acquisition will be revised if new information  relating  to  the  facts  and  circumstances  existing  at  the  acquisition  date  is available  within  one  year  and  an  adjustment  to  the  above  tentative  amount  or  any additional liability provision existing at the acquisition date can be identified.\n\n## 4) Evaluation of impairment\n\nGoodwill  of  $4,804,423  arising  from  the  acquisition  of  OmniOn  Power  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries on July 3, 2023, was mainly attributable to the expected benefit derived from the  operating  revenue  growth.  According  to  IAS  36,  goodwill  acquired  in  a  business combination  should  be  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually.  For  the  purposes  of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the acquirer's cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. AcLeap Power and its subsidiaries  are  cash-generating  units  that  generate  independent  cash  flows;  therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment by calculating the value-in-use of AcLeap Power and its subsidiaries against the carrying value of net assets to assess whether the impairment should be recognized.\n\nAccording to the Usage Value Analysis Report issued by an expert engaged by AcLeap Power had been prepared based on the AcLeap Power's financial forecast covering 2024 to 2028, the recoverable amount of AcLeap Power was greater than its carrying amount and no impairment loss was recognized.\n\n## (j) Loss control of subsidiaries\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company decided at the board meeting to handle the cash capital increase of its subsidiary AcSun Energy, after which AcBel's shareholding ratio was reduced to 20%, and at the same time, the Company approved the sale of 60% of the equity in AcSacca, a subsidiary in which AcBel had previously held 75% of the shareholding, and 100% of the equity in KangYang to AcSun Energy.  The  transaction  was  completed  on  September  11,  2023,  and  control  of  it  was  lost.  The disposal  prices  were  $653,159  thousand  and  $125,123  thousand  respectively  (net  of  securities transaction tax), and the gain on disposal was $269,308 thousand and $1,246 thousand respectively, which  has  been  included  under  other  income  and  loss  in  the  consolidated  statement  of comprehensive income, please refer to note 6 (aa) for details. The gain on disposal includes a profit of $67,818 thousand from the Group's 15% remaining equity interest in AcSacca at a fair value of $163,781 thousand.",

If the employee gives up the subscription or if  the  amount  of  shares  subscribed  is  insufficient,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  is authorized to negotiate with a specific person to subscribe for the full amount of shares at the issue price.\n\nAfter investigating the employees' intention to subscribe the shares, the Company granted 15,645 thousand shares and July 1, 2023, as the date of grant, the fair value on the date of payment was $46.45, the subscription price was $38.8, and the expenses incurred due to the payment of the share basis were $119,684 thousand.\n\nOn August 11, 2021, the shareholders decided to issue 10,000 thousand shares as employee stock options  to  full-time  employees  who  meet  certain  requirements.  The  above  decision  had  been approved  by  the  Securities  and  Futures  Bureau  of  FSC.

Thereafter, the restricted shares were kept by  a trust, appointed by  the Company, before they are vested.  These  restricted  shares  shall  not  be  sold,  pledged,  transferred,  gifted,  or  disposed  by  any other  means,  to  third  parties  during  the  custody  period.

However, if the Company has accumulated deficits, the profit should be reserved to offset the deficit.\n\nThe aforementioned profit for the year is the earnings before tax, excluding directors' remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration to employees may be distributed in stocks or in cash and may be distributed to such  targets  including  the  employees  of  the  Company' s  subordinate  companies  who  meet  certain requirements.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration amounting at $5,317 and $55,123, respectively, and directors' remuneration amounting at $760 and $7,875, respectively. The estimated amounts mentioned above are calculated based on the  net  profit  before  tax,  excluding  the  remuneration  to  employees  and  directors  of  each  period, multiplied  by  the  percentage  of  remuneration  of  employees  and  directors  as  specified  in  the Company's  Articles.  These  remunerations  were  expensed  under  operating  costs  or  operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one day before the date of the Board of Directors meeting.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  remunerations  to  employees  amounted  to $55,123  and  $37,682,  and  to  directors  amounted  to  $7,875  and  $7,246,  respectively.  The aforementioned  estimated  amounts  are  identical  to  those  of  the  actual  distributions.  The  related information is available on the Market Observation Post System website.",

Therefore, the credit risk of accounts receivable is not significantly concentrated. The Group regularly evaluates the financial  condition  of  these  clients  to  reduce  the  credit  risk  of  accounts  receivable. However, the clients generally are not required to provide collaterals.\n\n## 3) Receivables and debt securities\n\nFor credit risk exposure of notes and accounts receivable, please refer to note (6)(f).\n\nOther  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost,  including  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  time deposit, and current and non-current other receivables, are considered to have low credit risk, and thus, the impairment provision recognized during the period was limited to 12 months expected credit losses.\n\nThe  movements  in  the  allowance  for  other  receivables  (including  current  and  noncurrent) were as follows:\n\n|                                                     | 2023      | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Balance on January 1                                | $ 179,231 | 178,866 |\n| Impairment loss recognized (reversal of impairment) | 124       | 368     |\n| Amounts written off                                 | (135)     | (61)    |\n| Foreign exchange gains (losses)                     | (90)      | 58      |\n| Balance on December 31                              | $ 179,130 | 179,231 |\n\n(Continued)",

Regarding the liabilities with variable interest rates, the analysis is on the basis of the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding throughout the year. The rate of change is expressed as the interest rate increases or decreases by 0.25% when reporting to management internally, which also represents the Group management's assessment of the reasonably possible interest rate change.\n\nIf the interest rate had increased or decreased by 0.25%, the net profit before tax for the years  ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were illustrated below, which would  be  mainly  resulted  from  the  bank  savings  with  variable  interest  rates  and  bank loans.  Since the interest of time deposits, financial assets at amortized cost, and part of long-term  borrowings  were  fixed,  changes  in  market  interest  of  the  aforementioned financial assets will have no effect on the net profit before tax.\n\n|                | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| 0.25% increase | $ 1,463 | 3,710   |\n| 0.25% decrease | (1,463) | (3,710) |\n\n## (iv) Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## 1) Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss, financial  instruments  used  for  hedging,  and  financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured on a recurring basis. The carrying amount and fair value  of  the  Group' s  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  including  the  information  on  fair value  hierarchy  were  as  follows;  however,  except  as  described  in  the  following paragraphs, for financial instruments not measured at fair value whose carrying amount is  reasonably  close  to  the  fair  value,  and  lease  liabilities,    disclosure  of  fair  value information is not required:",

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- 2) Valuation technique for financial instruments not measured at fair value\n\nThe Group's valuation techniques and assumptions used for financial assets at amortized cost not measured at fair value are as follows:\n\nIf there is quoted price generated by transactions, the recent transaction price and quoted price data is used as the basis for fair value measurement. However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n\n- 3) Valuation technique for financial instruments measured at fair value\n- a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices.\n\nMeasurements of fair value of financial instruments without an active market are based on valuation technique.\n\n- b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nMeasurement  of  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  is  based  on  the  valuation techniques  that  are  generally  accepted  by  the  market  participants.  For  instance, discount method, option pricing models, or Binominal pricing model. Fair value of forward  currency  exchange  is  usually  determined  by  using  the  forward  currency rate.\n\n## 4) Transfers between Level 1 and Level 3\n\nThere was no transfer among fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Group holds an investment in equity shares of Gogoro, which is classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. In April 2022, Gogoro listed its equity shares on  an  exchange  and  they  were  traded  in  active  market,  therefore,  the  fair  value measurement was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.",

For more disclosures about the quantitative effects of these  risks  exposures,  please  refer  to  the  respective  notes  in  the  accompanying  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe Group's finance department provide business services for the overall internal department. It sets  the  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for  managing  the  risk  and  the methods used to measure the risk arising from both the domestic and international financial market operations. The Group minimizes the risk exposure through derivative financial instruments. The Board of Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative  financial  instruments  in accordance  with  the  Group' s  policy  about  risks  arising  from  financial  instruments  such  as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the investments of excess liquidity. The audit committee and internal auditors of the Group continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the  Group' s  policy  and  the  risk  management  policies  and  procedures.   The  Group  has  no transactions  in  financial  instruments  (including  derivative  financial  instruments)  for  the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the Board of Directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument  fails  to  meet  its  contractual  obligations,  and  arises  principally  from  the  Group' s receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Group's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer  is  analyzed  individually  for  creditworthiness  before  the  Group's  credit  limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed periodically. Customers that fail to meet the Group's benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.  The Group's customers are mainly from the high-tech industry. In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the  Group  constantly  assesses  the  financial  status  of  the  customers,  and  requests  the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Group regularly accesses the collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  recognizes  allowance for accounts receivable. The impairment losses are always within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records  and  the  degree  of  cooperation.  Customers  that  are  graded  as  'high  risk'  are placed  on  a  restricted  customer  list  and  monitored  by  the  finance  department  more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.\n\nThe Group set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and  other  receivables.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  consists  of  specific  losses relating  to  individually  significant  exposure  and  the  unrecognized  losses  arising  from similar  assets  groups.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  is  based  on  historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investments\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial  instruments  are  measured  and  monitored  by  the  Group' s  finance  department. Since  the  Group's  transaction  counterparties  and  contractually  obligated  counterparties are banks, financial institutes and corporate organizations with good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nPlease refer to note (13)(a) for the financial guarantees as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate  the  effects  of  fluctuations  in  cash  flows.  The  Group' s  management  supervises  the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank and issued corporate bonds form an important source of liquidity for the Group. Please refer to note (6)(n) and note (6)(q) for unused short-term and long-term credit lines as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## (v) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Group buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market  risks.  Generally  the  Group  seeks  to  apply  hedge  accounting  in  order  to  manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  currency  risk  on  sales,  purchases  and  borrowings  that  are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in NTD, USD, and CNY.\n\nAt  any  point  in  time,  the  Group  hedges  specific  percentage  of  its  estimated  foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Group also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts  are  excluded  from  designation  as  the  hedging  instrument  and  are  separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash  flows.  The  Group  assesses  whether  the  derivative  designated  in  each  hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group borrows funds on fixed and variable interest rates, which has a risk exposure to changes in fair value and cash flow. Therefore, the Group manages the interest rates risk by maintaining an adequate combination of fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## 3) Other price risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  arising  from  investments  in  foreign  listed equity securities.\n\n## (ad) Capital management\n\nThe Group maintains the capital based on the current operating characteristics of the industry, future development,  and  changes  in  external  environment,  to  assure  there  is  financial  resource  and operating  plan  to  support  working  capital,  capital  expenditures,  research  &  development  expense, debt redemption and dividend payment and so on. The management decides the optimized capital by using  appropriate  debt-to-equity  ratio,  interest-bearing  liabilities-to-equity  ratio  or  other  financial ratios.  To  maintain  a  strong  capital  base,  the  Group  enhances  the  return  on  equity  by  optimizing debt-to-equity ratio. The Group's debt-to-equity ratio at the end of the reporting date was as follows:",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Account of Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirement. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report were as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue and investment of the subsidiary accounted for using the equity method - Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(o) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales revenue and revenue from contracts with customers is shown in note (6)(v) of the financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nThe Company, AcBel (Dong Guan) Co., Ltd., AcBel (WUHAN) Co., Ltd. and OmniOn Power Electronics Inc. have established vender managed inventories in overseas warehouses which do not belong to the Company. The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Company, should be based on the circumstance of VMI client delivery. Both parties reconcile periodically to ensure the consistency in the  amount  and  timing  of  sales  recognition.

Inventory valuation and investments of the subsidiary accounted for using the equity method - Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(g) inventories and note (5) of the financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate  of  inventory  valuation,  respectively.  Information  regarding  the  inventory  and  related  expenses  is shown in note (6)(f) of the financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for  the  inventory  of  the  Company  is  expected.  Therefore,  the  test  of  inventory  valuation  is  one  of  the significant evaluations in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow-moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Company and OmniOn Power Electronics Inc., and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## 3. Investments of the subsidiary accounted for using the equity method - Business combination\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(s), business combination, of the consolidated financial statements for the accounting policy  on  business  combination.  Information  regarding  business  combination  is  shown  in  note  (6)(h) acquisition of the subsidiary of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matters:\n\nTo promote and accelerate the technological upgrading and transformation of the power supply industry and to deepen the development of the North American market, the Company acquired 100% of Lineage Power Holding Inc. (renamed as Omnion Power Inc.), the power conversion department of ABB Group on July 3, 2023, through its U.S. subsidiary, AcLeap Power (USA) Inc. Due to the subjective nature of evaluation and complexity of the calculation of the consideration to be transferred and the fair value of the underlying assets to be obtained, the business combination transaction is one of the key audit matters in our audit.\n\n## Audit procedures:\n\n- (1) Evaluating the external professional's capability,  objectivity and relevant experiences of evaluation.\n- (2) Examining  the  valuation  information  provided  by  the  external  professional,  and  reviewing  the reasonableness of the valuation method and assumptions adopted by the external professional.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  on  Auditing  of  the  Republic  of  China,  we  exercise professional judgment and professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,  design  and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  that  is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.",

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about  the  matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that  a  matter  should  not  be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partners on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report are Wang, I-Wen and Kuo, Kuan-Ying.\n\n## KPMG\n\nTaipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) March 12, 2024\n\n## Notes to Readers\n\nThe accompanying  financial statements are intended only to present the  financial position, financial performance and cash flows in accordance  with  the  accounting  principles  and  practices  generally  accepted  in  the  Republic  of  China  and  not  those  of  any  other jurisdictions.

The  income  and  expenses  of  foreign  operations  are  translated  into  the presentation  currency  at  the  average  exchange  rate.  Exchange  differences  are  recognized  in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is  lost,  the  cumulative  amount  in  the  translation  reserve  related  to  that  foreign  operation  is reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  as  part  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  disposal.  When  the  Company disposes  of  only  part  of  investment  in  an  associate  of  joint  venture  that  includes  a  foreign operation while retaining significant or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planed nor likely in the foreseeable future, exchange differences arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income.",

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the  counterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by  the  issuing  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its classification.\n\n## (e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of  meeting  short-term  cash  commitments  rather  than  for  investment  or  other  purposes  should  be recognized as cash equivalents.\n\n## (f) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  the  instrument.  A  financial  asset  (unless  it  is  an  account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll  regular  way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\n(Continued)",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the  Company  changes  its  business  model  for  managing  financial  assets,  in  which  case  all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## 1) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\n- A  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n- \u00b7 it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  to  hold  assets  to  collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is the amount at which the  financial  asset  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  plus/minus,  the  cumulative amortization using the effective interest method, adjusted for any loss allowance. Interest income,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses,  as  well  as  impairment,  are  recognized  in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n- 2) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI )\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both  collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nSome accounts receivables are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling by the Company, therefore, those receivables are measured at FVOCI. However, they are included in the trade receivables' line item.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may  irrevocably  elect  to  present  subsequent  changes  in  the  investment' s  fair  value  in other  comprehensive  income.  This  election  is  made  on  an  instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt  investments  at  FVOCI  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair  value.  Interest  income calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  and impairment are recognized in profit or loss.

On  initial  recognition,  the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be  measured  at  amortized  cost  or  at  FVOCI,  as  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortized cost (including cash and cash equivalents, amortized costs, notes  and  accounts  receivable,  other  receivables  (current  and  non-current),  guarantee deposit paid and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL), except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:\n\n- \u00b7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nLoss  allowance  for  accounts  receivable  and  contract  assets  are  always  measured  at  an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since  initial  recognition  and  when  estimating  ECL,  the  Company considers  reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This  includes  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  information  and  analysis  based  on  the Company's historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  as  well  as  forwardlooking information.\n\nThe Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is  equivalent  to  the  globally  understood  definition  of  ' investment  grade  which  is considered to be BBB- or higher per  Standard & Poor's, Baa3 or higher per Moody's, twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings'.",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\nThe Company assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\n\nThe Company considers a financial asset to be in default when the financial asset is more than  90  days  past  due or  the  debtor  is  unlikely  to  pay  its  credit  obligations  to  the Company in full.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n12 month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe  maximum  period  considered  when  estimating  ECLs  is  the  maximum  contractual period over which the Company is exposed to credit risk.\n\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the  Company in  accordance  with  the  contract  and  the  cash  flows  that  the  Company expects  to  receive).  ECLs  are  discounted  at  the  effective  interest  rate  of  the  financial asset.\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  financial  assets  carried  at amortized  cost  and  debt  securities  at  FVOCI  are  credit-impaired.  A  financial  asset  is ' credit-impaired' when  one  or  more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7 the  lender  of  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  contractual  reasons  relating  to  the borrower's  financial  difficulty,  having  granted  to  the  borrower  a  concession  that  the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged  to  profit  or  loss  and  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  instead  of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.",

Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative, or  it  is  designated  as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are measured  at  fair  value  and  net  gains  and  losses,  including  any  interest  expense,  are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as fair value hedges.\n\nAt  inception  of  designated  hedging  relationships,  the  Company  documents  the  risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Company also documents the  economic  relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument,  including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.",

The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (g) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is calculated  using  the  weight-average  method,  and  includes  expenditure  incurred  in  acquiring  the inventories,  production  or  conversion  costs,  and  other  costs  incurred  in  bringing  them  to  their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet  realizable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  less  the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n## (h) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the  financial  and  operating  policies.

After the recognized interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## (i) Investment in subsidiaries\n\nWhen preparing the parent-company-only financial statements, investment in subsidiaries which are controlled by the Company is accounted for using the equity method.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus  any  initial  direct  costs  incurred  and  an  estimate  of  costs  to  dismantle  and  remove  the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe  right-of-use  asset  is  subsequently  depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- 1) fixed payments; including in-substance fixed payments;\n- 2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- 3) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n- 4) payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  It is remeasured when:\n\n- 1) there is a change in future lease payments arising from the change in an index or rate; or\n- 2) there is a change in the Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n- 3) there is a change in the lease term resulting from a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, or\n- 4) there is a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option; or\n- 5) there are any lease modifications\n\nWhen  the  lease  liability  is  remeasured,  other  than  lease  modifications,  a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or in profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.",

The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor  sale-and-leaseback  transactions,  the  Company applies  the  requirements  for  determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of the asset. If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Company recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company will  continue  to  recognize  the  transferred  asset  and  shall  recognize  the  financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (ii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance  lease;  if  not,  then  the  lease  is  an  operating  lease.  As  part  of  this  assessment,  the Company considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\n## (l) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nGoodwill  arising  on  the  acquisition  of  subsidiaries  is  measured  at  cost,  less  accumulated impairment losses.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product  or  process  is  technically  and  commercially  feasible,  future  economic  benefits  are probable and the Company intends to, and has sufficient resources to, complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to  initial  recognition,  development  expenditure  is  measured  at  cost,  less  accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.",

All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Amortization\n\nAmortization is calculated over the cost of the asset, less its residual value, and is recognized in  profit  or  loss  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives  of  intangible  assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives of computer software for current and comparative periods are 3~5 years.\n\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\n## (m) Impairment - non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.",

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  the  current  market  assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.\n\n## (o) Recognition of revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Company's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe Company manufactures and sells electronic components to electronic manufacturers. The Company recognizes  revenue  when  control  of  the  products  has  transferred,  being  when  the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance  of  the  products.  Delivery  occurs  when  the  products  have  been  shipped  to  the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either  the  customer  has  accepted  the  products  in  accordance  with  the  sales  contract,  the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Company often  offers  volume  discounts  to  its  customers  based  on  aggregate  sales  of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the  end  of  the  reporting  period.  No  element  of  financing  is  deemed  present  as  the  sales  of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term,  which  is  consistent  with  the  market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed  through  the  grid,  and  the  revenue  is  calculated  according  to  the  fee  agreed  with Taiwan Power Company.",

Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services provided is determined based on the services incurred to date as a proportion of the total services of the transaction. In case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount  based  on  a  payment  schedule.  If  the  services  rendered  by  the  Company exceed  the payment,  a  contract  asset  is  recognized.  If  the  payments  exceed  the  services  rendered,  a contract liability is recognized.\n\n## (iv) Financing components\n\nThe Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. Consequently, the Company does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\n## (p) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each  the  plan  by  estimating  the  amount  of  future  benefit  that  employees  have  earned  in  the current  and  prior  periods,  discounting  that  amount  and  deducting  the  fair  value  of  any  plan assets.\n\nThe  calculation  of  defined  benefit  obligations  is  performed  annually  by  a  qualified  actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated  in  retained  earnings  within  equity.  The  Company determines  the  net  interest expense  (income)  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  for  the  period  by  applying  the discount  rate  used  to  measure  the  defined  benefit  obligation  at  the  beginning  of  the  annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.",

The  Company recognizes  gains  and  losses  on  the  settlement  of  a  defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n## (iii) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefits  are  expensed  as  the  related  service  is  provided.  A  liability  is recognized  for  the  amount  expected  to  be  paid  if  the  Company  has  a  present  legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (q) Share-based payment\n\nThe  grant-date  fair  value  of  share-based  payment  awards  granted  to  employees  is  recognized  as employee expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The  amount  recognized  as  an  expense  is  adjusted  to  reflect  the  number  of  awards  which  related service  and  non-market  performance  conditions  are  expected  to  be  met,  such  that  the  amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\nFor share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased  payment  is  measured  to  reflect  such  conditions,  and  there  is  no  true-up  for  differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\n## (r) Income taxes\n\nIncome  taxes  comprise  current  taxes  and  deferred  taxes.  Except  for  expenses  related  to  business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatment, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS37.\n\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payables or receivables on the taxable profits (losses) for the  year  and  any  adjustment  to  the  tax  payable  or  receivable  in  respect  of  previous  years.  The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.  It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred  taxes  arise  due  to  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction (i) affects neither accounting nor taxable  profits  (losses)  and  (ii)  does  not  give  rise  to  equivalent  taxable  and  deductible temporary differences;",

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and  are  reduced  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no  longer  probable  that  the  related  tax  benefits  will  be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\n## (s) Business combination\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  business  combinations  using  the  acquisition  method.  The  goodwill arising from an acquisition is measured as the excess of (i) the consideration transferred (which is generally measured at fair value) and (ii) the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, both over the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. If the amount calculated above is a deficit balance, the Company recognized that amount as a gain on a bargain purchase in profit or loss immediately after reassessing whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed.\n\nAll acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except for the issuance of debt or equity instruments.\n\nFor  each  business  combination,  the  Group  measures  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest' s  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree' s identifiable net assets, if the non-controlling interests are present ownership interests and entitle their holders  to  a  proportionate  share  of  the  acquire' s  net  assets  in  the  event  of  liquidation.  Other components  of  non  controlling  interests  are  measured  at  their  acquisition-date  fair  values,  unless another measurement basis is required by the IFRSs endorsed by the FSC.\n\n(Continued)",

In prior reporting periods, the Company may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  will  be  recognized  on  the  same  basis  as  would  be required if the Company had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest. If the disposal of the equity interest required a reclassification to profit or loss, such an amount will be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in  which  the  combination  occurs,  provisional  amounts  for  the  items  for  which  the  accounting  is incomplete are reported in the Company's financial statements. During the measurement period, the provisional  amounts  recognized  at  the  acquisition  date  are  retrospectively  adjusted,  or  additional assets or liabilities are recognized to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.

Dilutive potential ordinary shares comprise employee stock options, remuneration to employees not yet approved by the directors, restricted employee shares and convertible bonds.\n\n## (u) Operating segments\n\nThe Company discloses the operating segments information in the consolidated financial statements.

The accounting treatment of the Acquisition will be revised if new information relating to the facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date is available within one year and an adjustment to the above tentative amount or any additional liability provision existing at the acquisition date can be identified.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the legal advice fees and advisory fees incurred in the acquisition is $391,150 and $101,942,  respectively,  which  are  recognized  under  \"Other  income  and  loss\"  in  the  consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Please refer to note 6(x).\n\nGoodwill of $4,804,423 arising from the acquisition of OmniOn Power Inc. and its subsidiaries on July  3,  2023,  was  mainly  attributable  to  the  expected  benefit  derived  from  the  operating  revenue growth.  According  to  IAS  36,  goodwill  acquired  in  a  business  combination  should  be  tested  for impairment at least annually. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the  acquirer' s  cash-generating  units,  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the  synergies  of  the combination. AcLeap Power and its subsidiaries are cash-generating units that generate independent cash flows; therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment by calculating the value-in-use of AcLeap Power and its subsidiaries against the carrying value of net assets to assess whether the impairment should be recognized.\n\nAccording to the Usage Value Analysis Report issued by an expert engaged by AcLeap Power had been  prepared  based  on  the  AcLeap  Power' s  financial  forecast  covering  2024  to  2028,  the recoverable amount of AcLeap Power was greater than its carrying amount and no impairment loss was recognized.",

Of the remaining balance, 10% is to be appropriated as legal reserve. Only if the legal reserve attaining to the paid-in capital could be the exception, besides, special reserves are supposed to set aside or reversed in accordance with the relevant regulations or as required by the government. And then any remaining profit together with any undistributed retained earnings shall be distributed according  to  the  distribution  plan  proposed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  submitted  to  the stockholders' meeting for approval.\n\nThe Company explicitly stipulate in its Articles of Incorporation to authorize the distributable dividends and bonuses, in whole or in part, which may be paid in cash after a resolution has been adopted by a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two thirds of the total number of directors; and in addition thereto, a report of such distribution shall be submitted to the shareholders' meeting.\n\nThe Company's industry is currently in a gentle growth phase. To take the capital requirements of  the  Company  and  the  shareholders  into  account,  the  Company' s  remaining  balance  is partially  distributed  as  cash  dividends  to  stockholders,  and  the  amount  of  cash  dividends should not be lower than 50% of the total dividends.\n\n## 1) Legal reserve\n\nIf the Company experienced profit for the year, the distribution of the statutory earnings reserve, either by new shares or by cash, shall be decided at the shareholders meeting, and the distribution amount is limited to the portion of legal reserve which exceeds 25 percent of the paid-in capital.\n\n## 2) Special reserve\n\nIn  accordance with the Ruling issued by the FSC, a portion of current-period earnings and undistributed prior-period earnings shall be reclassified as special earnings reserve during  earnings  distribution.  The  amount  to  be  reclassified  should  equal  the  currentperiod total net reduction of other shareholders'equity. A portion of undistributed priorperiod earnings shall be reclassified as special earnings reserve (and does not qualified for earnings distribution) to account for cumulative changes to other shareholders' equity pertaining  to  prior  periods.  Amounts  of  subsequent  reversals  pertaining  to  the  net reduction of other shareholders' equity shall qualify for additional distributions.\n\n## 3) Earnings distribution\n\nBased on the resolutions of the Board of Directors' meeting held on March 8, 2023 and March  11,  2022,  respectively,  the  appropriations  of  dividends  from  the  distributable retained earnings of 2021 and 2020 were as follows:",

However,  if  the  Company  has  accumulated  deficits,  the  profit  should  be  reserved  to offset the deficit.\n\nThe aforementioned profit for the year is the earnings before tax, excluding directors' remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration to employees may be distributed in stocks or in cash and may be distributed to such  targets  including  the  employees  of  the  Company' s  subordinate  companies  who  meet  certain requirements.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration amounting to $5,317 and $55,123, respectively, and directors' remuneration amounting to $760 and $7,875, respectively. The estimated amounts mentioned above were calculated based on the  net  profit  before  tax,  excluding  the  remuneration  to  employees,  directors  of  each  period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration to employees, directors as specified in the Company's articles.  These  remunerations  were  expensed  under  operating  costs  or  operating  expenses.  If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based  on  the  closing  price  of  the  Company' s  shares,  one  day  before  the  date  of  the  Board  of Directors' meeting. There is no difference between the amount approved in the meeting of the Board of Directors and those recognized in the financial statements in 2023 and 2022.\n\nFor the years ended December 2021 and 2020, the remunerations to employees amounted to $55,123 and  $37,682,  and  to  directors  amounted  to  $7,875 and  $7,246,  respectively.  The  aforemationed estimated  amounts  are  identical  to  those  of  the  actual  distributions.  The  related  information  is available on the Market Observation Post System Website.",

Moreover,  the  sales  territories are  dispersed.  Therefore,  the  credit  risk  of  accounts  receivables  is  not  significantly concentrated. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of these clients to reduce  the  credit  risk  of  accounts  receivables.  However,  the  clients  generally  are  not required to provide collaterals.\n\n## 3) Receivables and debt securities\n\nFor credit risk exposure of notes and accounts receivable, please refer to note (6)(e).\n\nOther financial assets at amortized cost includes cash and cash equivalents, time deposit, and current and non-current other receivables, are considered to have low risk, and thus, the impairment provision recognized during the period is limited to 12 months expected losses.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023 and  2022,  the  allowance  for  other  receivables  (including current and non-current) were $135,252.",

A weakening (strengthening) 5% of each major foreign currency  against  Company entities'  functional  currency  as  of  December  31,  2023  and 2022 would have affected the net profit before tax as followings:\n\n|                       | 2023     | 2022     |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|\n| USD (against the TWD) |          |          |\n| Strengthening 5%      | $ 44,668 | (55,189) |\n| Weakening 5%          | (44,668) | 55,189   |\n\nSince the Company has many kinds of functional currency, the information on foreign exchange gain (loss) on monetary items is disclosed by total amount.  For the years  2023 and  2022,  foreign  exchange  gain  (loss)  (including  realized  and  unrealized  portions) amounted to $(15,474) and $(21,441), respectively.",

Regarding the liabilities with variable  interest  rates,  the  analysis  is  on  the  basis  of  the  assumption  that  the  amount  of liabilities  outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding throughout the year. The rate of change  is  expressed  as  the  interest  rate  increases  or  decreases  by  0.25%  when  reporting  to management internally, which also represents management of the Company's assessment on the reasonably possible interval of interest rate change.\n\nIf  the  interest  rate  had  increased  or  decreased  by  0.25%,  the  net  profit  before  tax  was illustrated below for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which would be  mainly  resulted  from  the  bank  savings  and  short-term  borrowings  with  variable  interest rates.  Since the interest of short-term borrowings were fixed, changes in market interest of the aforementioned financial assets will have no effect on the net profit before tax.\n\n|                | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| 0.25% increase | (3,101) | (2,900) |\n| 0.25% decrease | 3,101   | 2,900   |\n\n## (v) Fair value\n\n## 1) Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss, financial  instruments  used  for  hedging,  and  financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured on a recurring basis. The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, including the information on fair value  hierarchy  were  as  follows;  however,  except  as  described  in  the  following paragraphs, for financial instruments not measured at fair value whose carrying amount is  reasonably  close  to  the  fair  value,  and  lease  liabilities,  disclosure  of  fair  value information is not required:",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## 2) Valuation technique for financial instruments not measured at fair value\n\nThe Company's valuation techniques and assumptions used for financial instrument not measured at fair value are as follows:\n\nIf there is quoted price generated by transactions, the recent transaction price and quoted price data is used as the basis for fair value measurement. However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n\n## 3) Valuation technique for financial instruments measured at fair value\n\n- a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices.\n\nMeasurements of fair value of financial instruments without an active market are based on valuation technique.\n\n- b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nMeasurement  of  fair  value  of  derivative  instruments  is  based  on  the  valuation techniques  that  are  generally  accepted  by  the  market  participants.  For  instance, discount method or option pricing models. Fair value of forward currency exchange is usually determined by using the forward currency rate.\n\n## 4) Transfers between Level 1 and Level 3\n\nThere was no transfer among fair value hierarchy in 2023.\n\nThe Company holds an investment in equity shares of Gogoro, which is classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. In April 2022, Gogoro listed its equity shares on  an  exchange  and  they  were  traded  in  active  market,  therefore,  the  fair  value measurement was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## (z) Financial risk management\n\n- (i) Overview\n\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its financial instruments \uff1a\n\n- 1) Credit risk\n- 2) Liquidity risk\n- 3) Market risk\n\nThe  following  likewise  discusses  the  Company' s  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for measuring  and  managing  the  above  mentioned  risks.  For  more  disclosures  about  the quantitative  effects  of  these  risks'  exposures,  please  refer  to  the  respective  notes  in  the accompanying financial statements.\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe  Company' s  finance  department  provide  business  services  for  the  overall  internal department. It sets the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used  to  measure  the  risk  arising  from  both  the  domestic  and  international  financial  market operations.  The  Company  minimizes  the  risk  exposure  through  derivative  financial instruments.  The  Board  of  Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative financial  instruments  in  accordance  with  the  Company' s  policy  about  risks  arising  from financial instruments such as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and  non-derivative  financial  instruments  and  the  investments  of  excess  liquidity.  The  audit committee and internal auditors of the Company continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the Company's policy and the risk management policies and procedures.  The Company has no transactions in financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) for the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the Board of Directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit  risk  is  the  risk  of  financial  loss  to  the  Company if  a  customer  or  counterparty  to  a financial  instrument  fails  to  meet  its  contractual  obligations,  and  arises  principally  from  the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Company's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Company's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed  periodically.  Customers  that  fail  to  meet  the  Company's  benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Company only on a prepayment basis.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC.\n\n## Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\nThe  Company' s  exposure  to  credit  risk  is  influenced  mainly  by  the  individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Company's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which  customers  operate,  as  these  factors  may  have  an  influence  on  credit  risk.  The Company's customers  are  mainly  from  the  high-tech  industry.   In  order  to  mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Company constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Company  regularly  accesses  the  collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  recognizes allowance  for  accounts  receivable.  The  impairment  losses  are  always  within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records  and  the  degree  of  cooperation.  Customers  that  are  graded  as  'high  risk'  are placed  on  a  restricted  customer  list  and  monitored  by  the  finance  department  more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.\n\nThe Company set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade  and  other  receivables.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  consists  of  specific losses  relating  to  individually  significant  exposure  and  the  unrecognized  losses  arising from  similar  assets  groups.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  is  based  on  historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investment\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Company's finance department. Since the Company's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties  are  banks,  financial  institutes  and  corporate  organizations  with  good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nThe Company could only provide financial guarantees to subsidiaries under its policy. Please refer to note (13)(a) for the financial guarantees provided to subsidiaries by the Company as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Company manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Company's management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank and issued corporate bonds form an important source of liquidity for the Company.  Please refer to notes (6)(l) and (6)(n) for unused credit lines as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC.\n\n## Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## (v) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates  and  equity  prices  will  affect  the  Company's income  or  the  value  of  its  holdings  of financial  instruments.  The  objective  of  market  risk  management  is  to  manage  and  control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe  Company buys  and  sells  derivatives,  and  also  incurs  financial  liabilities,  in  order  to manage  market  risks.  Generally,  the  Company seeks  to  apply  hedge  accounting  in  order  to manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  respective  functional  currencies  of  the Company's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese  Yuan  (CNY).   The  currencies  used  in  these  transactions  are  denominated  in NTD, USD, and CNY.\n\nAt any point in time, the Company hedges specific percentage of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Company also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe  Company designates  the  spot  element  of  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange  contracts  are  excluded  from  designation  as  the  hedging  instrument  and  are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Company's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash  flows.  The  Company assesses  whether  the  derivative  designated  in  each  hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe  Company  borrows  funds  on  fixed  and  variable  interest  rates,  which  has  a  risk exposure to changes in fair value and cash flow. Therefore, the Company manages the interest rates risk by maintaining an adequate combination of fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## 3) Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from investments in foreign listed equity securities.\n\n(Continued)",
