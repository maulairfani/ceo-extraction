The better we understand what customers need, the better we can help them make things click.\n\nLife is complicated, the economy uncertain and the world is changing fast. Our customers look to us to help make sense of the financial puzzles in their lives; we take that responsibility to heart and always want to do better.\n\nThis year, some of those customers across Canada, Ireland and the UK again faced wildfires and hail, storms and flood. With homes damaged, and lives turned upside down, our teams were on hand to help. Our people worked extra shifts and teams were on the ground in the worst hit communities arranging temporary accommodation, emergency payments and repairs. This is Aviva at its best.\n\nWe're all working hard to make sure we keep our word to all our customers and live up to their expectations, today and long into the future. That's the reason we exist after all, to be 'with you today, for a better tomorrow'.\n\nBy getting that right and delivering on our purpose as well as we can, we will deliver on our full potential for shareholders too.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Across the UK, Ireland and Canada, we've been living up to our purpose to be with people in their moments of need and thinking about what's needed for tomorrow.\n\n## Delivering strongly\n\nIn contrast to the volatile external environment, our own performance has been dependably consistent and strong.\n\nYou will read in the following pages that we've delivered another 12 months of excellent momentum in our financial results and another 12 months of good strategic progress.\n\nThis means we have been able to deliver on our other commitments, including investing in and contributing to our communities more widely.\n\nWe've also continued to deliver good returns for our shareholders, including a dividend of 33.4 pence.\n\n## Leading to growth\n\nNone of this happens by accident. Our progress this year is the tangible consequence of our strategy and the deliberate choices and actions of Amanda Blanc, our Group CEO, and her team.\n\nThanks to that clear direction and strong execution, we are now well positioned and taking advantage of the growth opportunities we have identified in our chosen markets. And thanks to our scale and diversity, we've shown yet again that we are also resilient to the ups and downs of external conditions.\n\nSuch a strong performance is also the direct result of the excellent work from Aviva's people over the past 12 months. I'd like to thank everyone for their efforts throughout the year. It is, after all, the culture of any organisation, what we value and the way we choose to behave together, that underpins long-term sustainable success.\n\n## High-performance culture\n\nOne challenge for any board is to get under the skin of presentations and beyond first impressions, to really get a sense of how people in the business are feeling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can see in this report some of the ways we've gone about that this year. What we've seen and heard all points to Aviva taking great strides towards a high performing, highly engaged, truly customer-focused culture.\n\n## Confidence\n\nWe are confident that with our clear strategy, our trading momentum and the commitment of our people, that Aviva's prospects are excellent. That does not mean we always get everything right, of course, but a key element of any performing organisation is to rectify any mistakes quickly and learn from them as we always look to improve.\n\n## Delivering our promise\n\nThe way our customers are living their lives is changing as fast as the society around us. Our commitments to them, whether that is protecting their home or business, their health and their family, or offering the means to a secure, fulfilling retirement, matter today more than ever.\n\nBy living up to our promises, we will continue on our path to delivering the full promise of this business for our customers, colleagues, and shareholders.\n\nGeorge Culmer\n\nChair\n\n6 March 2024",

We once again extended our track-record of growth and have now achieved our Solvency II OFG and cost targets a year early and are firmly on track to exceed our cash remittance target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have made significant progress in 2023. Sales are up, costs are down, and operating profit is 9% higher. Our position as the UK's leading diversified insurer, with major businesses in Canada and Ireland, is clearly delivering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmanda Blanc DBE\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Overview\n\nOur consistent strategy has allowed us to deliver precisely what we said we would: strong momentum in both growth and performance. This has been further bolstered by significant investment across the business and bolt-on M&A, enabling us to continue to capitalise on market growth opportunities. As a result, we have upgraded our targets and dividend guidance and announced a new \u00a3300 million share buyback.\n\nCredit for this year's strong performance goes to my Aviva colleagues for everything they do to support our customers every day - be that sorting a claim, or consolidating someone's pension pot, resolving a query or developing a new, better service. Our people work tirelessly to help solve our customers' financial puzzles, so a very big thank you to the whole Aviva team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong consistent performance\n\nIn 2023 we have shown continued momentum, growing Group adjusted operating profit by 9%. This reflects strong trading performances right across our businesses, the advantages of our scale and market positions, the benefits of our investment programme, and our continued focus on costs and efficiency.\n\nGeneral insurance gross written premiums (GWP) have grown by 12% overall and the group undiscounted combined ratio (COR) was 96.2%. This is a good performance considering adverse weather in Canada, storms in the UK and the impacts of inflation, reinsurance costs and higher claims frequency.\n\nOur UK & Ireland general insurance business had another strong year with GWP up 16% and healthy profitability. In Canada, where we are the number two player, we grew GWP by 10% on a constant currency basis with a strong COR of 95.3%. Across our general insurance businesses, we remain focused on extending our best-in-class technical capabilities and the outlook is positive as rate continues to earn through the portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's report\n\nIn our Insurance, Wealth & Retirement (IWR) business we increased operating value added by 13%. Health insurance annual premium equivalent (APE) remained very strong and grew by 41%, driven by increased demand across retail and business customers, while Individual Protection APE grew 13% as a result of strong growth in IFA and direct channels.\n\nIn Wealth, our workplace business continues to thrive with a record \u00a36.9 billion of net flows, boosted by winning 477 new schemes during the year. Our platform business continues to see positive net flows, at \u00a32.1 billion, and is positioned to benefit when market conditions improve. Overall, Wealth net flows were 6% of opening Assets Under Management (AUM), while total AUM grew 15% to \u00a3170 billion.\n\nIn our Retirement business, we transacted on 56 BPA deals in 2023, for total present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) of \u00a35.5 billion. Improved margins have been supported by the launch of our new streamlined service for smaller schemes. The higher rate environment supported individual annuity PVNBP, which grew by 17%, and conversely impacted equity release sales, which were 48% lower.\n\nSolvency II Own Funds Generation (Solvency II OFG) - an important measure of our dividend paying capacity - grew 12% to \u00a31,729 million driven by improved underlying performance across all businesses, whilst also benefiting from the extension of two key partnerships in IWR, which will deliver better customer service, efficiency and systems rationalisation.\n\nCash remittances were also up 3% to \u00a31,892 million. The Group remains in a very strong financial position with a robust balance sheet and a Solvency II shareholder cover ratio of 207% at the end of the year.\n\nThese results are testament to the work we have been doing to improve the underlying performance of our businesses over the last three years and give us high expectations as we look forward into 2024 and beyond.\n\n## The UK's leading diversified insurer\n\nThese results were also made possible by our unique model, which is a major competitive strength. Our portfolio is diversified across the UK, Ireland and Canada, where we have market leading positions and tangible opportunities for growth. We are also the only major player in the UK which can look after a wide range of customer needs across insurance, wealth and retirement. These multiple lines of business give Aviva's earnings clear resilience and provides advantages to our customers. We now have 4.8 million customers with two or more products with us and we want to grow this number each year.\n\nAll elements of Aviva work together to our mutual advantage. Our general insurance, protection, health and wealth businesses are key customer acquisition and growth engines. Our retirement business underpins our cash generation, and Aviva Investors is a critical enabler of growth in Wealth and Retirement.\n\nTaken together they give us scale, in particular an unrivalled franchise of more than 19 million customers that is and always will be at the heart of our success.\n\nWe're determined to further enhance our customers' experience with Aviva and service more of their needs, to seize those growth opportunities and deliver more value to shareholders.\n\n## Strong organic growth\n\nA big part of our growth story comes from that customer base. Our number one brand position is matched by strong sales to existing customers, with 39% of all new UK sales in the year to existing product holders.\n\nNor are we positioned where we are by accident. For example, with more people looking after their own retirements, and more inter-generational wealth transfer, we've deliberately designed our wealth business to help. An ageing population can look to us to be there for their retirement. As customer expectations and needs evolve, we can be there for them at the key moments in life, helping them protect what matters, build wealth and look after their health and wellbeing.\n\n## Accelerating through M&A\n\nOn top of the organic growth we see flowing from societal trends, we're also investing to accelerate our advantage.\n\nWe made important and deliberate investments in capital-light areas, investing c.\u00a3100 million to acquire Optiom in Canada, which will improve our offering and distribution in a highly attractive segment of the market, and \u00a3460 million to acquire AIG's UK protection business which has over 2.5 million customers, adding further scale to our award-winning protection business.\n\nMost recently, on 4 March 2024, we announced the \u00a3242 million acquisition of Probitas, a high quality, fully-integrated platform in the Lloyd's market, which will expand the market opportunity for Aviva's Global Corporate & Specialty (GCS) business.\n\n## Investment for the future\n\nWe are making significant investment across our business, to make customer service quicker, simpler and slicker; to develop new products and services which make customers' lives easier; and to accelerate the growth of our capital-light businesses. And this investment is paying off. For example, in our protection business, SME customer journeys are now digital, supporting a 5% growth in sales. In Health, we have enhanced our direct quote and buy customer journey leading to increased conversion rates.\n\nWe continue to innovate to improve our offering to customers. Aviva Zero, our next generation personal lines proposition is going from strength to strength, while our AI driven pensions tracing service Fabric has seen an over 50% increase in transfer-in flows. Digital-led improvements are enhancing the way our customers can interact with us too. This year saw us add 600,000 more MyAviva app users, bringing the total up to 6.3 million. We have also continued to support customers who have struggled with the high cost of living, for example by offering payment deferrals and lower cost, no-frills general insurance products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are making the business simpler too, and have reduced our IT applications by approximately 30% since 2020.\n\nBeing efficient also means setting ourselves up for the future, making things easier for our people and smoother for our customers - that is why we have extended our strategic partnerships with FNZ and Diligenta to simplify and strengthen our operations and technology in our heritage and wealth businesses.\n\nAnd finally, on sustainability, as well as our continued commitment to climate action, we're focusing on social action too. That includes investing in our communities and the UK economy, such as Aviva Investors' recent investment of \u00a350 million in Hightown Housing Association, supporting them in providing affordable, energy-efficient homes or Aviva Capital Partners' work to develop the London Cancer Hub, creating a life-science district dedicated to cancer treatment and research.\n\n## Superior returns for shareholders\n\nOur strong performance, profitable growth and financial strength gives us increasing confidence for the future. We are committed to delivering superior returns to our shareholders, year in, year out.\n\nThat means we can deliver on our regular, sustainable returns of surplus capital, by announcing a new share buyback programme of \u00a3300 million.\n\nWe have also declared a final dividend of 22.3 pence, bringing our total dividend for the year to 33.4 pence. In total, over the last three years, we have now returned \u00a39 billion of capital and dividends to shareholders.\n\nWe know the importance of a sustainable dividend for shareholders, and in recognition of the group's strong prospects, we have also upgraded our dividend guidance to mid-single digit growth in the cash cost (from low-to-mid single digit previously).\n\n## Confidence in Aviva's future\n\nOur confidence also underpins the new Group targets, representing consistent progression from our existing targets.\n\nOn Group adjusted operating profit, we have set a target to reach \u00a32 billion by 2026. We are upgrading our Solvency II operating own funds generation target to \u00a31.8 billion by 2026. And we are targeting over \u00a35.8 billion in cumulative cash remittances over 2024-26.\n\nWe have transformed the performance of Aviva over the last three years. We've grown quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, and by operating more efficiently, we are turning that into improvements in profitability. Through our dividend growth and regular share buybacks, we are sustainably delivering superior returns to our investors. With our strong momentum and continued investment in the business, I have real confidence in our ability to extend this track record.\n\nAmanda Blanc DBE Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n6 March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have built a strong track record of delivery and effective deployment of resources across the Group, maximising the value of our diversified business model. All of this gives me confidence in the positive outlook for Aviva.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Charlotte Jones\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n## Overview\n\nOur capital framework gives us a firm grip over how we deploy resources and manage performance across the Group. This has been instrumental to the delivery of our excellent results in 2023 and supports the growth in capital-light areas.\n\nThis strong performance culture is delivering sustainable growth in earnings and cash while maintaining a robust balance sheet, enabling us to grow the regular dividend.\n\nSurplus capital is available for reinvestment in the business, bolt-on M&A and returns to shareholders.\n\nWe have now exceeded our existing Solvency II operating own funds generation target of \u00a31.5 billion by 2024, and we have delivered our \u00a3750 million cost reduction target. Both of these have been achieved a year early. We remain on track to exceed our cash remittance target of >\u00a35.4 billion cumulative (2022-2024).\n\nTherefore, we are establishing new, upgraded targets for the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 Group adjusted operating profit 1 : \u00a32 billion by 2026. A new target following the implementation of IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Solvency II own funds generation: \u00a31.8 billion by 2026. A key driver of value and cash remittances. Upgraded from \u00a31.5 billion by 2024.\n- \u00b7 Cash remittances: >\u00a35.8 billion cumulative 2024-2026. Underpinning our sustainable dividend policy. Upgraded from >\u00a35.4 billion 2022-2024.\n\nWe are committed to delivering for our shareholders. The upgraded targets set out here support our sustainable dividend policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn light of the significant progress made and confidence in Aviva's future, we are upgrading our dividend guidance. We now expect to grow the cash cost of the dividend by mid-single digits 2 .\n\nCombined with our intention for regular and sustainable capital returns which reduce the share count further, this dividend policy drives even greater dividend per share growth.\n\nOur capital position remains extremely strong at 207%, with a balance sheet that is well placed to withstand market movements.\n\nGiven this strong capital position and our confident outlook for the Group, we are announcing the launch of a \u00a3300 million share buyback programme, commencing immediately. This is the second regular and sustainable capital return, building on the \u00a3300 million buyback programme completed in 2023 and takes the total amount of capital returns and dividends to more than \u00a39 billion over the last three years.\n\nOur preference remains to return surplus capital regularly and sustainably.",

Our business is carefully positioned, and our results demonstrate that we continue to successfully navigate these dynamics.\n\nWe have shown continued momentum, with disciplined profitable growth and tight cost control.\n\n## Operating results\n\n## Cash remittances\n\nCash remittances were up 3% to \u00a31,892 million (2022: \u00a31,845 million).\n\n## Performance\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit 1 increased by 9% to \u00a31,467 million (2022 3 : \u00a31,350 million). Our General Insurance results in the UK, Ireland and Canada were a strong contributor to this.\n\nGeneral Insurance adjusted operating profit 1 increased by 35% to \u00a3851 million (2022 3 : \u00a3630 million), reflecting improved investment income and a strong underwriting result.\n\nIWR adjusted operating profit 1 was lower at \u00a3994 million (2022 3 : \u00a31,199 million). IWR operating value added, an important measure of value creation under IFRS 17, increased 13% to \u00a31,849 million (2022: \u00a31,635 million).\n\nAviva Investors adjusted profit 1 of \u00a321 million (2022: \u00a325 million) was lower in the year as a result of challenging market conditions.\n\nGroup debt and other interest expense was flat while Group centre and other operations benefitted from improved investment returns and lower centre costs.\n\nIFRS profit for the year 4 was \u00a31,106 million (2022 3 : loss of \u00a3(1,030) million) as a result of higher operating profit and the positive impact of investment variances and economic assumption changes, partly offset by increased tax.\n\n## Cost reduction\n\nBaseline controllable costs 5 were 1% lower in the year at \u00a32,734 million (2022: \u00a32,771 million) which more than offset inflation. We have delivered \u00a3757 million of cost savings since 2018, beating our target of \u00a3750 million gross cost reduction, one year early.\n\nWe remain laser focused on costs and continued to seek further operational efficiencies going forwards.\n\n## Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG)\n\nSolvency II OFG increased 12% to \u00a31,729 million (2022 6 : \u00a31,540 million)\n\nExcluding management actions and other, Solvency II OFG was up 28% to \u00a31,278 million (2022 6 : \u00a3998 million).\n\n## Solvency II operating capital generation (Solvency II OCG)\n\nSolvency II OCG increased 8% to \u00a31,455 million (2022 6 : \u00a31,352 million). Excluding management actions and other, Solvency II OCG was up 44% to \u00a31,063 million (2022 6 : \u00a3740 million).\n\n## Solvency II return on equity (Solvency II RoE)\n\nSolvency II RoE increased by 4.8pp to 14.7% (2022 6 : 9.9%), primarily reflecting lower opening capital following the B share capital return and an increase in Solvency II OFG. Solvency II RoE (adjusted for excess capital) has increased by 2.7pp to 18.3% (2022 6 : 15.6%).\n\n## Business performance\n\n## Insurance, Wealth and Retirement (IWR)\n\nProtection & Health (Insurance) annual premium equivalent (APE) increased by 16% to \u00a3415 million (2022: \u00a3359 million), driven by strong growth in Health (up 41%) and Individual Protection (up 13%).\n\nWealth net flows remained a resilient 6% of opening assets under management (AUM) at \u00a38.3 billion (2022: \u00a39.1 billion) driven by strong performance in Workplace, partly offset by Platform which remained robust in the face of market volatility. In Retirement, BPA volumes were up 24% to \u00a35.5 billion (2022: \u00a34.4 billion) across 56 transactions.\n\nBaseline controllable costs 5 fell 1% to \u00a31,085 million (2022: \u00a31,093 million) as a result of our cost reduction initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This more than offset higher releases to profit from a growing stock of future profit as the portfolio grows and improved investment returns in a higher interest rate environment.\n\nSolvency II OFG of \u00a31,297 million (2022 6 : \u00a31,368 million) was 5% lower as management actions and other, which includes the initial benefit of extending two key partnerships (further details below), were less beneficial than the prior year.\n\nCash remittances were \u00a31,369 million (2022: \u00a3780 million) as remittances have now caught up from the deferral in 2022, a precautionary measure amid market volatility following the UK mini-budget.\n\nWe have extended two key partnerships with Diligenta and FNZ in order to drive further efficiencies within our IWR business. Diligenta service many of our existing customers and a new 15 year agreement will reduce the number of legacy IT platforms and increase the number of policies serviced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith FNZ, our existing strategic partner for Wealth, the new 15 year agreement will introduce more products onto the FNZ platform and benefit customers with a contemporary IT platform.\n\n- \u00b7 The key benefits of these partnership extensions are improved customer service with an expected uplift in policies on MyAviva, consolidation of providers and platforms, a reduction in IWR IT applications and operational efficiencies leading to a more streamlined cost-base.\n- \u00b7 IWR IFRS profit for the year includes \u00a361 million of non-operating impact from the associated restructuring costs and a \u00a395 million non-operating CSM cost. We expect a further c.\u00a3300 million of non-operating restructuring costs to be incurred over the next five years which will drive an operating profit benefit rising to >\u00a3100 million per annum by 2033.\n- \u00b7 Solvency II OFG includes an initial operating benefit in 2023 of \u00a3208 million reflecting lower expenses. Non-operating includes \u00a3356 million of one-off integration and restructuring costs. We expect an uplift of >\u00a31 billion of Solvency II OFG and >\u00a30.7 billion in cash remittance capacity, cumulative over the next ten years.",

Cash remittances in the year were \u00a325 million (2022: \u00a328 million).\n\n## International investments (India, China and Singapore)\n\nPresent value of new business premiums were 80% higher in constant currency at \u00a32,048 million (2022: \u00a31,172 million) and up 75% at reported FX, reflecting strong growth in India and China.\n\nAdjusted operating profit 1 was up 62% to \u00a363 million (2022 3 : \u00a363 million) and Solvency II OFG was up to \u00a3156 million (2022: \u00a3106 million). Cash remittances in the year were \u00a314 million (2022: \u00a319 million).\n\n## Capital and cash\n\n## Solvency II capital\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Group Solvency II shareholder surplus was \u00a38.8 billion and estimated Solvency II shareholder cover ratio was 207% (2022: \u00a38.7 billion and 212% respectively).\n\nThe increase in surplus since 31 December 2022 is mainly due to Solvency II operating capital generation and net issuance of debt which is largely offset by dividend payments, \u00a3300 million share buyback and nonoperating capital generation.\n\nThe solvency capital requirement of \u00a38.2 billion includes a \u00a32.2 billion benefit from Group diversification.\n\n## Centre liquidity\n\nAt end February 2024, centre liquidity was \u00a31.9 billion (end February 2023: \u00a32.2 billion) reflecting the payment of dividends, the share buyback programme, debt interest and centre costs, offset by cash remittances received from the business units.\n\n## Solvency II debt leverage\n\nSolvency II debt leverage remained flat at 30.7% (2022: 31.4%) as regulatory own funds and total debt remained broadly stable year on year. Excluding the November 2023 Tier 2 issuance of \u00a3500 million, Solvency II debt leverage was 28.9%. We have plenty of further opportunities to manage leverage in line with our preference to be under 30% over time.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together with an interim dividend of 11.1 pence (2022: 10.3 pence) this brings total dividends for the year to 33.4 pence (2022: 31.0 pence), up 8%, with a cash cost of c.\u00a3915 million.\n\n## Shareholder asset portfolio\n\nAviva's high quality shareholder asset portfolio of \u00a384.6 billion at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a378.4 billion) continues to perform well and is defensively positioned.\n\nCorporate bonds represent \u00a323.9 billion or 28% of the portfolio. Of this, 83% is externally rated investment grade and 17% internally rated. Aviva has a long history in private debt, with a robust internal rating model, and these internally rated assets have an average rating of 'single A' quality.\n\nThe corporate bond portfolio continues to perform well with c.\u00a3400 million of upgrades and <\u00a3100 million of downgrades to a lower letter in 2023. No corporate bonds were downgraded below investment grade.\n\nOur commercial mortgage portfolio of \u00a35.6 billion comprises largely longduration fixed rate contracts with low average loan-to-value (LTV) ratios of 53% using the nominal value of the loan.\n\nOur securitised mortgage loans and equity release portfolio of \u00a39.8 billion is mostly internally securitised with a low average LTV of 27%.\n\n## Confident outlook\n\nOur positive momentum continued in 2023 with a strong set of results, and our diversified business model positions us well to navigate the volatile macroeconomic environment. This reinforces our confidence in the prospects, financial targets and outlook for the Group.\n\nIn General Insurance we remain focused on pricing appropriately for the ongoing inflationary environment. Overall, we expect the rating environment to remain favourable in personal lines with some moderation of rate increases in commercial lines. We expect the underlying COR 7 to benefit from the earn through of rating actions taken in 2023.\n\nIn IWR we expect to see continued growth. We expect further strong demand in Protection & Health products given supportive market dynamics. Wealth is central to our strategy, and as we set out at our 'In Focus' briefing in October 2023, the market presents a significant opportunity for Aviva to continue to generate sustainable, capitallight growth. We expect to continue our disciplined approach to BPAs, where the market is expected to continue to benefit from more pension schemes looking to de-risk.\n\nCharlotte Jones Chief Financial Officer\n\n6 March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

During 2023 our support has enabled Citizens Advice to help more than 14,000 people across 31 UK locations.\n\nIn October Aviva and developer Socius were selected as the preferred bidder to advance the development of a worldleading cancer research and treatment facility at the London Cancer Hub, delivering social and economic benefits including c.13,000 highly skilled jobs.\n\n## Climate action\n\nWe remain committed to making progress on our Net Zero by 2040 ambition, whilst also recognising that we do not have full control over the delivery of this ambition. Government action on policy and development of new technologies are of fundamental importance to create the conditions for success.\n\nIn 2023 we have made progress on making Aviva's operations Net Zero by 2030. A key step in this journey was completing our move to our new London Headquarters '80Fen', meeting the latest efficiency standards with an EPC A rating.\n\nWe continue to help enable the transition to a lower carbon future. Between 2020 and 2023 we allocated \u00a31.7 billion of financing for renewable energy infrastructure projects and invested in the development of electric vehicle (EV) charging networks in both Ireland and the UK.\n\n## Sustainable business\n\nWe have made tangible progress on diversity, equity and inclusion, further increasing the percentage of women in senior leadership roles by 3.3% to 40.6% this year.\n\n## Focus for 2024\n\nWe will build stronger communities through our place based strategy, invest in the UK economy and will reinvest at least 2% of our annual Group adjusted operating profit into communities and social innovation.\n\nWe plan to focus our climate action activity on powering the green transition and helping people and businesses to become climate ready.\n\nWe will continue to ensure sustainability is embedded across our business and make progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n## 50%\n\nOperational carbon emissions reduction 1 (2022: 43%)\n\n## \u00a39.5bn\n\nAmount invested in UK infrastructure and real estate from 2020-2023 (2020-2022: \u00a36.9bn)\n\n## 40.6%\n\nWomen in senior leadership roles (2022: 37.3%)\n\n- 1.

It will allow us to rationalise our systems and improve efficiency, bringing significant benefits for our customers and the business.\n\n## Products and customers Insurance\n\nWe are the UK's only provider of scale, offering protection and health for both individual and corporate clients. Structural trends have continued to drive a buoyant market across private healthcare and group protection, and we have strengthened our positions in all our business lines.\n\nWe are the leading individual protection provider in the UK and were the number one writer of new business in 2023 1 , with a market share of 18.7% 2 . In September, we won the 'Best Protection Provider' at the 2023 Money Marketing Awards, which is a testament to the strength of our proposition and to our commitment to customers.\n\nIn group protection, our portfolio has grown by 8% 3 versus 2022, driven by strong retention and existing scheme growth. We now insure 2.8 million lives, an increase of 100k lives versus 2022.\n\nIn September, we announced the acquisition of AIG UK Life for \u00a3460 million (subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals) which will further develop our Protection business.\n\nIn Health, we provide access to private medical services and treatment to 1.2 million people in the UK. This is an increase of more than 100k customers compared to 2022, with growth in each of our consumer, SME and large corporate segments.\n\nIn June, we won Corporate Adviser's 'Best Healthcare Provider' award for product development in areas like cancer assistance and diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nWe also demonstrated our customer commitment by completing our final COVID-19 Customer Value Pledge Rebate payment of \u00a347 million.

We won over 470 new corporate pension schemes in 2023, surpassing the previous year's total. Workplace propositions received numerous Corporate Adviser Awards including 'Best Group Pensions Provider', 'Best Provider: Decumulation Proposition' and 'Ultimate Default Fund'.\n\nOur Adviser platform attracted the second highest net flows in the market 5 , maintaining our position in a subdued adviser market in which net flows were down 64% compared to 2022, driven by the impact of challenging macroeconomic conditions.\n\nOur Adviser platform won awards for 'Leading Platform for Model Portfolio Services' (Schroders), Best ESG Provider' (Money Marketing) and 'Best Stocks & Share ISA provider' (Moneyfacts).\n\nIn Succession Wealth, we have added new advisers and additional assets from further acquisitions, seen new flows onto Aviva's platform to help customers secure their financial future and grown restricted advice proposition.

Direct Wealth won 'Best Buy - Pension' at the Boring Money awards along with 'Best Pension Platform - Large Portfolio' and 'Best Investment Platform for Beginners' at the Your Money awards.\n\n## Retirement\n\nOur Retirement business consists of bulk purchase annuities (BPA), individual annuities and equity release.\n\nBPA is a key focus area; we retain a top four 1 share in a rapidly growing BPA market and have developed a marketleading small scheme capability alongside our wider product offering to medium and large schemes. Our BPA proposition enables pension trustees to secure future obligations to defined benefit (DB) scheme members by de-risking their pension schemes. We expect the 2024 BPA market to be the largest on record and, with DB liabilities of c.\u00a31.5 trillion yet to transact, leading market experts predict the BPA market to continue to grow in the short term.\n\nWe saw strong growth in external Individual Annuities during the year (up c.67% compared to prior year). This was driven by strong market demand for annuities, leading to a 35% increase in the market at September 2023.\n\nWe displayed a strong performance in the equity release market in 2023. The market contracted c.50% in 2023, though Aviva's share grew to 17% by the end of the year.\n\nWe have delivered a new well-received Equity Release platform, providing a market leading experience for customers and advisers and winning 'Best Equity Release Lender' and 'Best Equity Release Lender Customer Service' at the 2023 What Mortgage Awards.\n\n## Ireland\n\nIn Ireland, we are number four 2 in the market. We offer a wide range of products across protection, savings, pensions and annuities and are committed to making it easier for intermediaries to do business with Aviva.\n\nIn 2023, we released new features as part of our Digital Transformation & Automation programme which enhances how we interact with our customers and advisers.\n\nWe released a number of key initiatives, including a new Personal Retirement Savings Account product which has been well received in the market, as well as a fixed deposit fund, of which the first three tranches were oversubscribed.\n\nWe were awarded three Sustainability awards in 2023, including the ESG award at the prestigious Business & Finance Irish Business Awards. Aviva Ireland also signed up as a signatory to the Women in Finance Charter which requires us to publicly communicate on progress against diversity, equity and inclusion targets annually.\n\n- 1.

With a complimentary portfolio, we continue to make further progress towards making our business capital-light and our key priorities for 2024 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to deliver customercentric propositions and innovate for our customers, partners and clients across Insurance, Wealth and Retirement.\n- \u00b7 Drive further efficiency through automation and digitisation, and simplify our business to better serve and engage our customers.\n- \u00b7 Integrate AIG's UK protection business into our Individual and Group Protection business lines (following completion of the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals), continuing to demonstrate our commitment to the market and customers.\n- \u00b7 Modernise our IT infrastructure with a focus on Health and Individual Annuities to fully leverage market opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Establish Aviva's leadership in the Wealth market, with a focus on our Direct Wealth proposition and advice capabilities.\n- \u00b7 Continue to optimise capital and pricing within our BPA business and assess value-adding opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our multichannel distribution includes selling directly to customers through MyAviva and price comparison websites, as well as reaching our customers through intermediary relationships with brokers, affinity partners, 'fintechs' and several of the UK's leading banks.\n\nOur strategy is to focus on growing our Retail business and attractive, profitable segments within our market leading business-to-business (B2B) distribution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur UK personal lines business grew 24% in 2023, with Retail growing at 41% and now representing over half of our portfolio GWP. We balanced growth with the maintenance of pricing and underwriting discipline. This helped us mitigate the headwinds of inflation and increased claims frequency. 37% of sales were to existing Aviva customers, demonstrating the value of Aviva's leading UK insurance customer franchise.\n\nWe continue to enjoy a leading position in the UK home insurance market, and are now a leading high net worth (HNW) insurer, following the acquisitions of Azur Underwriting's HNW personal lines business and the transfer of the Axa XL Private Clients team and business.

We also continue to cut complexity from our business and refocus our personal lines product portfolio into target segments. We have reduced our products by 77% since the end of 2020, including 19 products exited in 2023.\n\nThese changes are customer focused, improving experience through augmented digital journeys as well as improving our agility and ability to compete in a highly price-competitive market.",

This includes making licence progressions to enhance technical capability, re-designing our operating model across commercial lines and distribution to allow quicker access to decision-makers and making specific leadership appointments to strengthen capability. 98% of mid-market renewals are now supported by AI and we have decommissioned legacy IT platforms to improve efficiency for our people, freeing up time to underwrite and tailor service to customer needs.

        "page_content": "## Our business review: Canada General Insurance\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Strong growth in personal lines, driven by our Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) partnership.\n- \u00b7 Strong growth in commercial lines, driven by Mid-Market and MediumSized Enterprise opportunities in Aviva Business (ABI) and with large corporate and non-traditional property and casualty opportunities in Global Corporate & Specialty (GCS).\n- \u00b7 Launch of two Aviva-branded AutoCare centres to drive better customer outcomes and significant indemnity savings with an ambition to grow further in 2024.\n- \u00b7 Continued investment in digitisation to deliver ease of experience for brokers and customers while driving operational efficiency.\n\nInflation and supply chain disruption continued to pose significant challenges to insurers through 2023. Aviva Canada maintained resilience through this inflationary environment by placing significant focus on monitoring the macro trends and acting swiftly as a business, implementing rate and underwriting actions to mitigate their impact. Auto theft also took the country by storm, significantly impacting results for all insurers. Aviva Canada implemented measures to soften this impact through the introduction of antitheft devices as part of our insurance offering, along with diligent monitoring, pro-active fraud investigations and consistent lobbying to create awareness.\n\nAs we have returned to normal levels of frequency prior to COVID-19, we have seen a continued shift towards digital customer interactions for their insurance needs. While this trend has existed for some time, this was accelerated by the pandemic, further changing customer behaviour. As such, Aviva Canada is committed to building the digital capabilities required for meaningful interactions with brokers and customers to make the insurance sale and service process as seamless as possible.\n\n## Products and customers: Personal lines\n\nOur Personal insurance portfolio makes up the majority of our total book at 61%, and is predominantly made up of massmarket propositions, particularly concentrated in the highly populated province of Ontario, in the personal auto product.\n\nDespite the high growth experienced in 2023, the focus remains on price adequacy, especially in Personal Motor, given the highly regulated market.\n\nWe will continue to focus on rate actions along with growing our specialty portfolio (Group, High Net Worth and Lifestyle). Improving the speed to market of our pricing is paramount to success, and this will be developed through the adoption of a new industry leading Pricing platform to be implemented in early 2024. In Personal Property, our focus continues to be on exposure management, given the weather-related catastrophic events.\n\nWith auto theft impacting the personal lines results of many insurers in the market, a cross-functional task force was created. To bring solutions more proximate to the customer, we launched an initiative, partnering with Tag to install free anti-theft devices in all high risk vehicles, decreasing the likelihood of theft and bolstering the value proposition of our auto product.\n\nAs cyber risk becomes an increasing part of the corporate world, so too does the risk for individuals. It is seven times more likely for an individual to fall victim to cybercrime than a house fire 1 . Seeing this gap in the market, we completed our launch of a new industry-leading cyber product across all channels and regions.\n\n## Products and customers: Commercial lines\n\nCommercial lines is split between ABI (19% of the book) and GCS (20% of the book). Given the delivery and profitable results seen in these areas, our ambition is to continue the same trajectory while accelerating growth.\n\nFor ABI, we continue to grow in the profitable medium and mid-market segments through premium. For GCS, the ambition is to grow the corporate risk segments into an industry-leading size, matching our industry presence in this segment to that which exists in other GCS segments. In order to achieve these growth aspirations, we are expanding our suite of products to sell more to existing clients, specifically in specialty financial lines. We will continue to deliver through our diverse commercial lines product offerings.\n\nThe acquisition of Optiom O2 Holdings Inc (Optiom) will strengthen Aviva's current market position and accelerate the diversification of our earnings profile. Optiom focuses on supplementing amounts paid by traditional auto insurance policies and the cost to replace vehicles where there are deficit amounts. This move will put us significantly ahead of the curve with new auto replacement coverage. There are also opportunities to leverage Optiom's flexible payment opportunities for existing Aviva Canada customers, increasing the ease of doing business with us.\n\nOur focus going into 2024 continues to be maintaining rate adequacy and strong underwriting discipline across our portfolio. This, coupled with our focus on continues improvement, will lead to better customer outcomes.\n\n## Customers\n\nAs was the case last year, claims TNPS performance was impacted by macroeconomic trends that created delays in parts and limited repair shop capacity. In response, we are becoming more vertically integrated with our supply chain, opening two Aviva-branded AutoCare shops in Ontario. These enhanced shops have already delivered 16% indemnity savings and two-day reduction in claims cycle time on average.\n\n- 1. Cyber crime statistic source: Canadian Underwriter\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our investment performance relative to benchmark in 2023 was negatively impacted by the difficult market environment with 44% (2022: 51%) of AUM exceeding benchmark over one year and 44% (2022: 50%) over three years. The weaker investment performance reflected the challenge of asset allocation in volatile markets across our multi-asset funds, however performance was strong across real assets and credit, with marked improvement in equities over shorter time horizons .\n\nNet flows excluding strategic actions 2 and liquidity were \u00a3(0.8) billion outflow (2022: \u00a342 million inflow). Positive external net flows were resilient in light of difficult market conditions but reduced to \u00a30.7 billion (2022: \u00a31.3 billion), reflecting the diversity of our business with strong demand for our real assets capabilities more than offsetting a weak market for liquid strategies.\n\nInternal outflows increased to \u00a3(1.6) billion (2022: \u00a3(1.3) billion) as Heritage run off was partially offset by strong workplace and annuity flows in 2023 and one-off transfers into ESG Enhanced in 2022.\n\nOur Aviva client distribution channels mainly comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 Wealth, where we develop sustainability-focused propositions to meet the long-term savings needs of Aviva's investment, wealth and retirement customers; and\n- \u00b7 Aviva shareholder, where we develop investment solutions to support Aviva's growth ambitions, primarily in the UK BPA and individual annuity markets.\n\nOur external client distribution channels include:\n\n- \u00b7 Global Institutional clients: Large asset owners, consultants, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds;\n- \u00b7 Global Insurance companies: From large to small who wish to benefit from our expertise in managing insurance company assets; and\n- \u00b7 Global wealth, financial institutions such as large private banks and wholesale intermediaries to retail customers, such as independent financial advisers and wealth managers.\n- 1. Per Peregrine Communications The Global 100 2022 report\n- 2. Strategic actions include outflows from clients previously part of the Group and corporate actions\n\n## Key priorities for 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Continued improvement in investment performance to deliver enhanced investment returns for our clients.\n- \u00b7 Capitalising on growth opportunities within Aviva Group and externally through our strengths in multi-assets solutions, our active specialisms and sustainable investing.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing focus on simplifying our business to deliver efficiency benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At a Group level, we have to comply with the Solvency II requirements regulated by the PRA. The Group Solvency II capital requirements are calculated using a Partial Internal Model (PIM) which assesses the risks on an Internal Model basis approved by the PRA.\n\nGroup capital is represented by Solvency II own funds. Solvency II own funds are comprised of a combination of shareholders' funds, preference share capital, subordinated debt, and deferred tax assets measured on a Solvency II basis.\n\nSolvency II surplus at the Group level represents the excess of eligible Solvency II own funds over the Group's solvency capital requirements calculated in accordance with Solvency II requirements.\n\nAs part of Solvency II reform in the UK, modifications were made to the calculation of the Solvency II risk margin. This regulation replaces the 6% cost of capital rate with a 4% rate and introduces a tapering factor for life insurance business, effective from 31 December 2023. The impact of this risk margin reduction is partly offset by a corresponding reduction in the TMTP. This reform increased the Group Solvency II Shareholder cover ratio by six percentage points as at 31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Cover ratio   | 212%              | 14%                            | (7)%                          | (11)%       | 3%                  | (4)%           | 0%           | 207%              |\n|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| NAV per share | 390p              |                                |                               |             |                     |                |              | 415p              |\n| Surplus       | 8,694             | 1,455                          |                               |             | 241                 |                | 12           | 8,813             |\n|               |                   |                                | (372)                         | (917)       |                     | (300)          |              |                   |\n| \u00a3m            | 31 December  2022 | Operating  capital  generation | Non-operating  generation 1,2 | Dividends 3 | Net debt   issuance | Share  buyback | Acquisitions | 31 December  2023 |\n| Own funds     | 16,468            | 1,729                          | (214)                         | (917)       | 241                 | (300)          | 12           | 17,019            |\n| SCR           | (7,774)           | (274)                          | (158)                         | -           | -                   | -              | -            | (8,206)           |\n\n- 3.

These future changes remain subject to further policy development and while the impacts are therefore uncertain, they are not currently expected to have a material overall impact on the Group's capital position.\n\nThe Group Solvency II position disclosed is based on a 'shareholder view'. The shareholder view is considered by management to be more representative of the shareholders' risk exposure and the Group's ability to cover the SCR with eligible own funds. It also aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position. In arriving at the shareholder position, adjustments are made to the regulatory Solvency II position, including removal of own funds and SCR in respect of with-profit funds and staff pension schemes in surplus.\n\nFinancial strength is key to the Group's strategy and the Group's estimated Solvency II shareholder cover ratio is 207% at 31 December 2023 (2022: 212%) and surplus is \u00a38.8 billion (2022: \u00a38.7 billion). The increase in surplus is mainly due to operating capital generation and net issuance of subordinated debt which is largely offset by dividend payments, \u00a3300 million share buyback and non-operating capital generation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Capital management\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAs part of the Group's internal capital management process, we regularly monitor the Group's sensitivity to economic and non-economic scenarios.\n\nThe table shows the absolute change in Solvency II shareholder surplus and cover ratio under each sensitivity, e.g. a 2pp positive impact would result in the Solvency II shareholder cover ratio increasing from 207% to 209%.\n\n## Limitations of sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table demonstrates the effect of an instantaneous change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged. In reality, changes may occur over a period of time and there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration that the Group's assets and liabilities are actively managed. Additionally, the Solvency II position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group's financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.\n\nAs investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocations and taking other protective action.\n\nOther limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risks that only represent the Group's view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty and the assumption that all parameters move in an identical fashion.\n\nSpecific examples:\n\n- \u00b7 The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rates at all terms. These results should not be used to calculate the impact of non-parallel yield movements.\n- \u00b7 The sensitivity analysis assumes equivalent assumption changes across all markets i.e. UK and non-UK yield curves move by the same amounts, equity markets across the world rise or fall identically.\n\nAdditionally, the movements observed by assets held by Aviva will not be identical to market indices so caution is required when applying the sensitivities to observed index movements.\n\n## Stress and scenario testing\n\nIn addition to our sensitivity analysis, stress and scenario testing (including reverse stress testing) is used to test the resilience of business plans and to inform decision-making.\n\nThe results of this testing demonstrates that through the use of key management actions (e.g. expense and volume management, hedging, de-risking and debt raising) the Group can maintain sufficient liquidity and surplus of Solvency II own funds over SCR to withstand a variety of severe scenarios and stresses.\n\n| Sensitivities 31 December 2023                            | Impact on  surplus   | Impact on  shareholder  cover ratio   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Group Solvency II cover ratio                             | 8.8                  | 207%                                  |\n|                                                           | \u00a3bn                  | pp                                    |\n| Changes in economic assumptions                           |                      |                                       |\n| 50 bps increase in interest rate                          | 0.1                  | 4 pp                                  |\n| 50 bps decrease in interest rate                          | (0.1)                | (6) pp                                |\n| 100 bps increase in interest rate                         | 0.1                  | 8 pp                                  |\n| 100 bps decrease in interest rate                         | (0.3)                | (13) pp                               |\n| 50 bps increase in corporate bond spread 1                | 0.1                  | 4 pp                                  |\n| 50 bps decrease in corporate bond spread 1                | (0.2)                | (6) pp                                |\n| 100 bps increase in corporate bond spread 1               | 0.1                  | 7 pp                                  |\n| Credit downgrade on annuity portfolio 2                   | (0.4)                | (7) pp                                |\n| 10% increase in market value of equity                    | 0.0                  | (1) pp                                |\n| 10% decrease in market value of equity                    | (0.1)                | - pp                                  |\n| 25% increase in market value of equity                    | 0.1                  | (2) pp                                |\n| 25% decrease in market value of equity                    | (0.3)                | (1) pp                                |\n| 20% increase in value of commercial property              | 0.3                  | 6 pp                                  |\n| 20% decrease in value of commercial property              | (0.4)                | (8) pp                                |\n| 20% increase in value of residential property             | 0.3                  | 6 pp                                  |\n| 20% decrease in value of residential property             | (0.6)                | (9) pp                                |\n| Changes in non-economic assumptions                       |                      |                                       |\n| 10% increase in maintenance and investment expenses       | (0.7)                | (9) pp                                |\n| 10% increase in lapse rates                               | (0.3)                | (4) pp                                |\n| 2% increase in mortality/morbidity rates - life assurance | (0.1)                | (1) pp                                |\n| 2% decrease in mortality rates - annuity business         | (0.3)                | (5) pp                                |\n| 5% increase in gross loss ratios                          | (0.3)                | (3) pp                                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Analysis of the SCR by risk type is a key measure used in managing risk exposures. The split of SCR by risks is summarised in the chart.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Solvency II regulatory own funds by Tier and Solvency II debt leverage ratio\n\nOne of the objectives of capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure using a combination of equity shareholders' funds, preference share capital, subordinated debt and borrowings, in a manner consistent with our risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business.\n\nSolvency II debt leverage ratio is 30.7% (2022: 31.4%). During 2023 debt has reduced due to maturing senior debt and lower commercial paper borrowings, partly offset by net issuance of subordinated debt. Excluding the \u00a3500 million November debt issuance, which gives the Group flexibility to redeem debt over time, Solvency II debt leverage ratio would be 28.9%.\n\nThe table provides a summary of the Group's regulatory Solvency II own funds by Tier and Solvency II debt leverage ratio.\n\n| Regulatory view                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | % of own  funds 2023   | 2022 \u00a3m   | % of own  funds 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| Solvency II regulatory debt 1          | 5,472     |                        | 5,210     |                        |\n| Senior notes                           | 401       |                        | 687       |                        |\n| Commercial paper                       | 51        |                        | 252       |                        |\n| Total debt                             | 5,924     |                        | 6,149     |                        |\n| Unrestricted Tier 1 2                  | 13,179    | 70%                    | 13,162    | 70%                    |\n| Restricted Tier 1 3                    | 946       | 5%                     | 946       | 5%                     |\n| Tier 2 4                               | 4,526     | 24%                    | 4,264     | 23%                    |\n| Tier 3 5                               | 173       | 1%                     | 296       | 2%                     |\n| Estimated total regulatory own funds 6 | 18,824    |                        | 18,668    |                        |\n| Solvency II debt leverage ratio 7      | 30.7%     |                        | 31.4%     |                        |\n\n- 1.

Tier 2 capital, 23% of own funds, consists of dated subordinated debt. The features of Tier 2 capital include subordination, a minimum duration of 10 years with no contractual opportunity to redeem within 5 years, and absence of redemption incentives, mandatory costs and encumbrances.\n\n- 6.

Over 100 of our top leaders have already participated in this new course. The 'Courage' programmes are designed to help leaders take accountability, make bold decisions and boost team performance.

In 2023, we achieved an exceptional set of results in our annual Voice of Aviva survey, with 88% of colleagues saying they would recommend Aviva as a great place to work. Our high levels of engagement are down to our wonderful people and the environment they create where everyone is supported to perform at their best.\n\nOur colleagues clearly understand our strategy and understand how what they do contributes to the organisation's goals around growth, customer, efficiency and sustainability. We keep our people engaged and informed via regular Aviva wide leadership and employee communications and broadcasts and this year launched our new employee communication platform Workvivo.\n\nWe can also see from our survey data how participation in our 'Courage' leadership programmes is improving leadership effectiveness.\n\nOur annual culture diagnostic focuses on six dimensions of culture and tracks colleague perception data from the Voice of Aviva survey, as well as customer and people metrics. In 2023, we saw strong improvements across all dimensions of culture. Leadership effectiveness has increased and a greater number of colleagues report feeling motivated by our strategy.\n\nOur Customer Focus Index increased over the last year, with 95% of colleagues understanding how their work impacts customer outcomes. In response to the diagnostic, we will focus on our ability to adapt to new ways of working and improving visible representation in leadership.\n\nThe diagnostic is also used as the basis for the Board to monitor our organisational culture.\n\n## More diverse, inclusive & sustainable\n\nWe want Aviva colleagues to feel they belong, and for our people to reflect the customers and communities we serve. It's the right thing to do for our business and for society.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion is central to what we do and we have six thriving communities led by our colleagues. Inclusion across all these communities is vital, and within that we have had a particular focus on gender and ethnicity.\n\nWe achieved 40.6% (397 female) gender diversity in senior leadership, up 6.9 percentage points since the start of 2022. We continue to offer market-leading equal parental leave and this year launched 'Confident Comebacks', coaching support for all colleagues going on, and returning from, parental leave. We've made our hiring processes more accessible for all candidates by reducing the number of criteria, using more inclusive language and publishing salary bands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Culture Diagnostic\n\nThe six dimensions used to assess Aviva's culture reflect regulatory expectations and frame discussion with the Group Executive Committee and Board on how we measure and monitor our culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data sources\n\nThe data used to inform the analysis against the six dimensions is based on three key sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Colleague perspectives on, and experiences of, our culture captured in Voice of Aviva.\n- \u00b7 Colleague behaviours across the employee lifecycle captured via HR data (such as senior leadership diversity, absence rates etc.).\n- \u00b7 Colleague and customer metrics and feedback on their experiences of Aviva's service.\n\n.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeadership & direction Leadership and tone from the top has the greatest influence on the culture of an organisation.\n\n## Accountability\n\nAccountability is a critical driver of colleague performance metrics - higher accountability tends to drive better productivity and lower absence.\n\n## Safe to speak up\n\nA culture where it is safe to speak up enables colleagues to feel they can ask questions and raise issues without worrying about the consequences.\n\n## Values\n\nValues are drivers of habitual behaviours and mindsets that characterise an organisation, and impact customer and colleague experience.\n\n## Diversity of thinking\n\nWhere a culture of diverse thinking exists, customers feel we are better able to meet their needs and there are higher levels of innovation and organisational agility.\n\n## Customer focus\n\nA culture where the customer is front of mind and colleagues feel able to challenge decisions and quickly resolve customer issues.",

        "page_content": "## Our sustainability ambition\n\n## Progress across our ambition\n\nHighlights in 2023 include developing a new focused approach to help to deliver social action in the communities where we live and work across the UK. We became the Founding Place Partner with Business In The Community (BITC) and will support BITC's ambition to help transform 50 places in the UK over the next ten years, working collaboratively with other businesses towards a shared aim.\n\nWe've continued to support the regeneration of communities, Aviva Investors have invested \u00a39.5 billion in UK infrastructure and real estate between 2020 and 2023; and during 2023 Aviva Capital Partners also invested in projects that provide benefits to society. From social housing to charging networks for electric vehicles, ultra-low carbon homes to development of a world-leading cancer research and treatment hub, Net Zero carbon schools to windfarms, we are helping the UK and other economies we operate in to get ready for the future.\n\nWe contribute annually to community investment across a variety of programmes aimed at helping people in the communities where we live and work. In 2023 the amount we contributed to this work was \u00a332.5 million.\n\nWe've pledged \u00a387 million to nature based solutions projects. These projects will run for between 17 and 60 years, working to capture carbon, contributing towards flood resilience and helping to restore natural habitats.\n\nDuring 2023 we achieved 100% renewable electricity for Aviva's operations.\n\n## Social Action\n\nFor over 300 years Aviva has played a part in the lives of our customers, forming long-standing connections with communities.\n\nWhether it's helping people prepare for retirement, protect their belongings or look after their health, we help customers look forward with financial confidence. We want to play a part in making more people financially secure.\n\nInvesting for the future benefits our customers, and the communities we operate in. The scale of our investments gives us ability to invest in community infrastructure - everything from the regeneration of towns and cities and social housing through to investment in green energy.\n\n## Sustainable Business\n\nWe are embedding sustainability into our leadership decisions and day-to-day business activities. We have clear policies and a robust governance structure in place to ensure high standards across fundamental issues of diversity, equity and inclusion, wellbeing, upholding human rights, business ethics, responsible use of data and ensuring our supply chain is responsible and sustainable.\n\n## Climate Action\n\nClimate change represents one of our planet's biggest risks. The ways in which the insurance sector could be affected by the climate crisis are diverse and are interconnected with other sustainability issues. So we're taking an active role in tackling it.\n\nAs a major investor and underwriter we can help to enable the transition to a low-carbon future.\n\nAs we move towards our ambition to become Net Zero by 2040 we continue to reduce the impact of Aviva's operations. We're also helping communities start to become more climate-ready by offering our customers some choices in terms of climate-friendly products, influencing our suppliers and the companies we invest in, helping the broader transition to a more climate resilient economy, and being part of shaping a response to the twin crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity.\n\nWe set out our ambition in March 2021. At the time, and indeed today, the pathways to Net Zero were not well understood. Furthermore, government action on policy and development of new technologies were and still remain of fundamental importance to create the conditions for success.\n\nWithout good progress on these issues, achieving our climate ambitions will become increasingly challenging. We recognise that while we have control over Aviva's operations and influence on its supply chain, when it comes to decarbonising the economy in which we operate and invest, Aviva is one part of a far larger global ecosystem.\n\nWe have learnt a lot, and the complexities and challenges are coming into sharper focus. There remain difficulties over measurement and data reliability, in particular the emissions from Aviva's investments and underwriting captured as part of Scope 3 reporting which is not an area where we can achieve our goals in isolation.\n\nThere are also limits to our ability to influence other organisations and governments. Nevertheless we remain focused on the task and are committed to playing our part in the collective effort to enable the global transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We continue to offer customers the flexibility to reduce their cover and monthly payments through our payment-deferral. We also offer a range of affordable motor and home propositions through QuoteMeHappy Essentials - helping people save money while maintaining peace of mind.\n\n## Community Investment\n\nAs part of our focus upon building stronger communities we contribute an average of 2% of our Group adjusted operating profit to community investment. In 2023 the amount we contributed to communities was \u00a332.5 million which represented 2.2% of our Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nIn 2023 over 800,000 people have benefitted from our community investment programmes across the UK, Ireland and Canada.\n\nOur Aviva Community Fund has formed a key part of our approach since it was launched in 2015. In 2023 the Fund helped 531 inspirational community projects across the UK raise \u00a37 million. This was made up of match-funding donations of \u00a32.7 million from Aviva in addition to partner donations and crowdfunding.\n\n## Citizens Advice\n\nIn 2022, during the UK cost of living crisis, Aviva partnered with Citizens Advice. We've contributed \u00a37 million to help deliver vital front line services that are seeing unprecedented levels of demand.\n\nDuring 2023 our partnership has:\n\n- \u00b7 Delivered support to 31 offices, funded 50 telephone based advisors and digital services\n- \u00b7 Identified \u00a31.2 million of additional income for individuals - including over \u00a3800,000 in new benefit claims\n- \u00b7 Supported 14,000 people with 26,000 complex issues\n\n## Aviva Foundation\n\nAviva's independent charity provided \u00a31.1 million of funding focused on building financial resilience for underserved groups.\n\nIn 2023 the Foundation:\n\n- \u00b7 Supported neurodiverse people and their families via a hub giving resources and tools to help develop financial skills\n- \u00b7 Helped Moneyline deliver financial services to some of the lowest income households in the UK\n- \u00b7 Worked with the Living Wage Foundation to tackle in-work poverty\n\nWe learn from this work to help us consider how we can serve our customers better, particularly our vulnerable customers.\n\n## Social action through volunteering\n\nAll Aviva colleagues can take three days volunteering leave every year helping to engage our people with our purpose to be 'with you today for a better tomorrow'.\n\nIn 2023 our people volunteered for 87,599 hours, more than double the hours in 2022.

We seek to minimise our exposure to the downside risks arising from the transition to a low carbon future (e.g. new climate policies) and physical effects (e.g. flood, windstorms and heavy precipitation).\n\nWe also consider the impact of global geopolitical environment on both current and emerging risks for the potential second and third order impacts, for example the impact of climate policies on the global supply chain.\n\nWe assess climate risks and opportunities over short, medium and long term time horizons. Climate change and the risks associated with it are core to a business like Aviva.\n\nWe believe Aviva becoming Net Zero is in the best interests of our customers and clients, as well as the long-term continuity of our business model and the wider environment in which we operate.\n\nWe aim to protect and restore biodiversity and understand the impact of climate change on our investments and underwriting.\n\nIn 2022, Aviva became the first international composite insurer to have carbon-reduction goals validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nTowards this journey, we have near term ambitions to reduce emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 We have a validated SBTi target to reduce Aviva's Scope 1 and Scope 2 operational emissions by 90% from a 2019 baseline by end of 2030.\n- \u00b7 We are also aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of Aviva's Scope 3, category 15 investments (currently investee Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from credit and equities, direct real estate and sovereigns for shareholder and policyholder assets) by 60% from a 2019 baseline.\n\nWe recognise that while we have control over Aviva's operations and influence on its supply chain, when it comes to decarbonising the economy in which we operate and invest and the risks we underwrite, Aviva is one part of a far larger global ecosystem.\n\nAs the wider society make choices towards their own Net Zero journey, this could impact business models and decarbonisation cost.\n\nAs such we depend on governments and regulators working together to create the right conditions for success. That's why we aim to use our influence to advocate for systemic changes to the international financial architecture, collaborating across industry through partnership and alliances.\n\nWe are also grappling with the challenge of understanding and measuring Scope 3 emissions, in other words the emissions arising from the value chain of our customers, investees and suppliers.\n\nThere are continued challenges towards measurement of Scope 3 emissions and associated complexity, due to limited and unsophisticated data and methodologies. This includes the risk of significant double counting or worse if multiple organisations are reporting on the same emissions. We want to target emissions which we can reliably measure.\n\nRead more on our Climate-related\n\nFinancial Disclosure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are engaging with our suppliers and working to align them to our Net Zero ambitions.\n\nOur near-term goal is for 70% of Aviva's suppliers (by spend) to set science-based targets by 2025.\n\nTo deliver this we implemented a number of initiatives in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 We are supporting new and existing suppliers with clear sustainability guidance as part of the contracting process.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability and carbon questions are included in all our Request For Proposal (RFP) and Request For Information (RFI) processes and form part of our consideration for purchasing decisions.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability and carbon questions are a part of our supplier onboarding process.\n- \u00b7 We introduced incentives for suppliers that meet our sustainability requirements.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable sourcing training will be conducted annually to upskill all our buyers to equip them with the knowledge required to engage suppliers on sustainability.\n\nBy the end of 2023, 35% of suppliers by spend had already signed up to Sciencebased targets.\n\n## Reduction in the carbon intensity of our investments\n\nMeasuring and reducing the carbon intensity of our investments will contribute to a significant reduction in our indirect emissions.\n\nWe are aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of Aviva's Scope 3 category 15 investments (currently includes investee Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from credit, equities, direct real estate and sovereigns for shareholder and policyholder assets) by 60% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline. Investment emissions are the portion of investees' emissions attributed to Aviva based on its share of investment or level of funding.\n\nOur metrics include investee Scope 1 and 2 emissions. There are concerns with Scope 3 of investee emissions including double counting, data quality and level of estimation.\n\nOur investment exclusion policy (launched in November 2022) came into operation and a number of divestments that were completed in 2022 removed carbon intensive investments. We can also expect to see carbon intensity reduce as the companies that we invest in and those that we engage with continue on their own carbon reduction journeys.\n\nBy the end of 2023, we had reduced the Scope 1 and Scope 2 weighted average carbon intensity of our credit and equities (shareholder and with-profits) by 57% against a 2019 baseline.\n\nWe also provide a temperature alignment score to show our level of alignment to a 1.5\u00b0C global warming pathway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more within our Climate-related Financial Disclosure",

Governance\n\n## Restoring rare native British rainforests\n\nWe're partnering with The Wildlife Trusts to help restore the UK's temperate rainforests. This partnership is part of our nature based solutions programme.\n\nIn February 2023 Aviva announced a \u00a338 million partnership with The Wildlife Trusts to restore Britain's lost temperate rainforests in the UK over the next 60 years. Native to the British Isles, temperate rainforest is an incredibly rare and biodiverse habitat that now covers less than 1% 1 of the UK. It is thought to be more rare than tropical rainforests.\n\nThe pledged donation aims to support work to re-establish temperate rainforest by planting a combination of native species including oak, birch, holly and rowan across c.5,200 acres.\n\nWork is already well underway connecting existing temperate rainforest sites in the Isle of Man, North Wales and Devon.\n\nThe restored rainforests aim to remove c.800,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over the next 100 years, equivalent to the emissions created by one person taking over 740,000 transatlantic flights 2 . Restoring these rainforests isn't just about meeting environmental targets. It's also about providing a better tomorrow by protecting and restoring biodiversity, providing increasing flood protection, and addressing the ongoing nature crisis by adding to the natural beauty and cultural heritage of each site 3 .\n\n- 1.

A priority set out in our Climate-related Financial Disclosure 2022 was to launch further Aviva nature based carbon removal partnerships in the British Isles, as well as similar projects in Canada.\n\nDuring 2023 we announced a number of partnerships as part of our plan to remove carbon from the atmosphere in this way. We have donated money to a number of partners with the aim of developing the market for investment in nature-based carbon sequestration projects. The projects our partners are undertaking with our funding will demonstrate the co-benefits of carbon sequestration, nature restoration, flood resilience and social and community benefit. Creation of verified carbon removals credits from projects to support Aviva's Net Zero ambition is a key part of demonstrating the long-term investment potential of nature based solutions.\n\nTo monitor our projects a carbon measuring framework is in place for each partnership. This is monitored regularly for the duration of the partnership. We also regularly visit the project sites for all partnerships to validate progress.\n\n## The Woodland Trust\n\nIn February 2023 we announced a \u00a310 million partnership with the Woodland Trust to support its Woodland Carbon Scheme over the next 18 years. The funding aims to deliver carbon removal as well as improving air quality and biodiversity through a combination of woodland creation and peat restoration. Through the partnership Aviva will fund projects that aim to remove approximately 330,000 tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere over the next 100 years.\n\nThe projects are spread across the UK at a number of Woodland Trust sites including three 'Hero' sites:\n\n- \u00b7 Green Farm, Norfolk - close to Aviva's Norwich offices, the plan is for the site to be a mosaic of broadleaf woodland, wood pasture, grassland and hedgerows.\n- \u00b7 Snaizeholme, the Yorkshire Dales aiming to create one of England's biggest new native woodlands.\n- \u00b7 Smithills, Lancashire - The project aims to rewet peat bogs at the Trust's largest site in England.\n\nIt is planned that these sites will create new reserves that people can enjoy for free.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Aviva has pledged to donate \u00a321 million to the WWT aiming to help restore up to 250 hectares of saltmarsh over the next 17 years.\n\nIt is thought that saltmarsh has a significant role to play in fighting climate change and reversing nature loss by providing a long-term, natural store of carbon and creating a rich and unique habitat for plants and animals specially adapted to the conditions. Saltmarsh has also been estimated to protect more than c.90,000 properties and more than c.\u00a32 billion of assets 1 through reducing flooding in the UK.

The partnership will run for 12 years and aims to restore landscapes and improve biodiversity in the region.\n\nThe partnership will work on a project called StoneWoods Forest Carbon which covers c.520 hectares of land in Alberta. It is estimated by Wild + Pine that the project aims to sequester nearly c.275,000 tonnes of carbon over c.60 years while supporting regional biodiversity, including enhancing valuable habitat for many local species including moose, elk, whitetail and mule deer, black bears, and great grey owls.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This innovative proposition meant that Aviva covered the cost of offsetting at least 1,000 miles of customers' carbon emissions from driving or charging their car for the policy year. In addition customers could also choose to pay to offset 50% of their remaining miles, which Aviva would match. This meant that customers could offset up to 100% of their carbon emissions, from driving or charging their car based on the mileage they will drive. Over 500,000 Aviva Zero policies have been sold since launch.\n\nIn August 2023 we expanded our underwriting appetite to include engineered timber 1 in commercial developments. As one of the first UK insurers to commit dedicated underwriting resource to the development of more sustainable buildings, we aim to help enable the UK as it moves to become climate-ready.\n\nSupport is also available for SME businesses through Aviva's Risk Management Solutions service which provides guidance for SMEs on reducing their risk across a range of sustainability related issues including electric vehicles, flood mitigation, solar panels and supply chain risk.\n\n## Providing customers with sustainability focused investment options\n\nOur adviser platform provides an ESG profiler tool supporting financial advisers reviewing customers' investments from an ESG perspective. It improves the transparency of funds, enabling customers to understand if a fund meets their investment appetite and ESG objectives. This supports advisers in their conversations with clients on ESG, allowing them to show the scale and quantifiable impact of investments in terms they understand.\n\n## Supporting brokers in building a more resilient business\n\nTo help brokers understand the impact their business has on the environment and wider society Aviva launched a 'Sustainable Business Coach', a new, free-to-use digital tool to support brokers in building a more resilient business. Created with brokers, for brokers, the tool was developed in partnership with the non-profit organisation, Future-Fit, and digital coaching business, Life Moments, to help brokers develop their sustainability capabilities.\n\nThe programme provides brokers with a personalised report on how they can improve their sustainability goals and approach, helping them become more efficient while measuring improvement over time and providing the opportunity to increase their knowledge and understanding with free learning modules.\n\n- 1.

Our Executive Long Term Incentive plan includes two diversity, equity and inclusion measures:\n\n- \u00b7 40% of senior management being women by 2024\u00b9. In 2023 we achieved 40.6%, up 6.9 percentage points since the start of 2022.\n- \u00b7 12.5% of senior management to be ethnically diverse by 2024\u00b2. In 2023 we had achieved 10.8%.\n\n## Gender equality: % of women in senior management\n\nTo improve gender equality we set the example from the top down. Our female leaders act as role models for future talent, sharing their insights and experiences. We are active members of Moving Ahead and the Women in Finance Charter. Our CEO, Amanda Blanc, is HM Treasury's Women in Finance Champion and our Women's Sponsorship Programme works to accelerate the pipeline of women into senior roles.\n\nThe Aviva Investors 'Return to Work' programme has extended into the wider business, supporting people looking to return to work after a break in their career of 18 months or more. Since launch an average of 71% of participants have taken permanent roles helping build a pipeline of experienced talent through the programme.\n\n## Ethnic equality: % of ethnic diversity in senior management\n\nThe ambition of 12.5% is yet to be reached due to challenges on recruitment given our existing location footprint and market competition for the same talent.\n\nOur reverse mentoring programme continues, partnering senior leaders with ethnically diverse colleagues. Our Board, Group Executive and top 1,200 leaders have completed 'anti racism' training to embed the practice of challenging racial bias whenever they see it. We continued our Group-wide Ethnically Diverse Leadership Programme (EDLP) focusing on ethnically diverse colleagues. Since launch, 58% of those on the programme have had a promotion or a lateral move to build their career.\n\nOur Origins Community - focused on race and ethnicity, culture, faith and social mobility - continues to provide safe spaces for people, raising awareness and educating colleagues and promoting cultural diversity at Aviva. Origins also has 11 sub-networks supporting specific communities within Aviva. Additionally we encourage ethnically diverse talent through networks such as iCAN, the Insurance Cultural Awareness Network, and are Founder Members of CBI's Change the Race Ratio and a signatory to the Race Equality Charter.\n\n## Pipeline talent\n\nOur graduate and apprentice programmes which attract new talent and develop existing colleagues continued to demonstrate good gender and ethnicity balance. In 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 55% of our graduate intake was female and 11% were ethnically diverse.\n- \u00b7 40% of our apprenticeship programme were female and 12% ethnically diverse.\n- 1.

Part of this involves looking to identify potential market-wide and systemic risks and seeking to mitigate them through engagement with policymakers.\n\nBusiness alone, as participants in the market, cannot correct system-wide issues such as market failures. We can, however, help identify such risks through our research and in our engagement with corporates as an asset owner. This informs our approach to market reform so our actions for change have practical application.\n\nWhere market failures exist we engage with policymakers to advocate for reforms.\n\nWe use our voice to raise awareness and encourage interventions so that our financial system is better able to serve the needs of the present without prejudicing those of generations to come.\n\n## Using our vote\n\nAs part of our approach Aviva undertakes stewardship at a micro level too, by identifying risks, opportunities and impacts through investment research and acting on these insights through corporate engagement. In 2023 as part of our stewardship approach Aviva:\n\n- \u00b7 Exercised our voting rights on 68,177 resolutions at AGMs and EGMs\n- \u00b7 Voted against 25% of company management recommendations that did not align with our sustainable investment strategy\n- \u00b7 Achieved 281 sustainability engagement objectives through Aviva Investors, resulting in changes in investee companies' strategies, actions or behaviours\n- \u00b7 Conducted 1,694 substantive sustainability engagement meetings through Aviva Investors\n\n## Transition Plan Taskforce\n\nAn increasing number of corporates are setting Net Zero ambitions and publishing transition plans. We believe these plans should be consistent, comparable and credible.\n\nOur Group CEO co-chairs the UK Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) with HM Treasury aimed at creating a common approach in this area.\n\nThe TPT was set up by the UK Government in April 2022 to develop the gold standard for private sector climate transition plans in the UK. The TPT built on the work done by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\n\nThe TPT published a consultation in 2023 on the TPT disclosure framework, as well as implementation guidance. The final framework was published later in the year, with final sector guidance due in 2024.\n\nWe will review the final guidance and incorporate it in our next climate transition plan, as well as continuing to advocate for clearer transition plan standards around the world.\n\n## Aviva Investor Responsible Investment Report\n\nAviva Climate-Ready Index Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable business\n\n## Our Tax Strategy 1\n\nOur tax strategy is to pay the right amount of tax at the right time in each of the countries in which we operate.\n\nWe act with honesty and integrity, engaging with HMRC and other relevant tax authorities on a transparent and cooperative basis. We conduct our business dealings in accordance with both the letter and spirit of all tax law, with our core values underpinning our approach to taxation.\n\nThis approach is consistent with the Group's appetite to manage its operational risk to as low a level as is commercially sensible, taking account of the financial impact and the value placed by the Group on maintaining a reputation for upholding the highest standard of corporate ethics.\n\nWith a low appetite for litigation, we prefer to seek clarity through timely discussion and prompt disclosure of all relevant information, to enable tax authorities to form an accurate assessment of the tax implications of our activities, and assess the current, future, and past tax risks.\n\nWe engage proactively in external developments on tax policy and engage with national governments, the European Union, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and others where appropriate.\n\n## Ensuring that we pay the right amount of tax in each country\n\nWe pay tax on the profits earned in each country and require all our businesses to comply with the tax laws in their markets and not enter into schemes or structures which result in an abusive tax result. When we undertake tax planning, we only do so in the context of wider business activity with a real and commercial basis.\n\nAnnual reviews are carried out to ensure that appropriate prices have been used for services provided cross border. These prices are subject to regular benchmarking to external markets to ensure the prices charged are consistent with arm's length transfer pricing principles and that profits arising in each company reflect the activity undertaken by that business.\n\n## Cross border reinsurance\n\nOur UK resident reinsurance company has quota share reinsurance arrangements with Aviva subsidiaries from the UK, Ireland and Canada. The terms of our reinsurance treaties are consistent with arm's length principles.\n\nAviva also has a captive reinsurance company in Barbados, which supports the Canadian business. This was put in place to provide capital efficient pooling of risk in a traditional reinsurance location with a supportive regulatory regime and significant local experience. The company is now in run-off.\n\n## Offshore Investment Funds\n\nAs is common practice in the investment management industry, investment funds are structured to facilitate pooling of capital from different investors.\n\nAviva Investors manages various investment fund vehicles which are resident in low tax jurisdictions, including Luxembourg, Guernsey and Jersey.\n\nThese market standard offshore investment fund vehicles are cost efficient and mitigate tax arising within the fund, ensuring that income and gains are predominantly taxed in the hands of the investor. This allows investors with different tax profiles (e.g. tax exempt UK pension funds) to pool capital without increasing the amount of tax they would otherwise pay.\n\n## Managing our tax risks\n\nAll tax returns and correspondence are prepared and reviewed by qualified and trained colleagues, acting under appropriate delegated authorities. Where the Group outsources activities, the outsourcing partner must be able to meet all relevant tax compliance responsibilities.\n\nExternal advice will be sought where the risk, complexity and size of the decision requires an opinion from a third party.\n\nThe tax strategy is supported by the Tax Business Standard and our Operational Risk & Control Management (ORCM) framework. All our businesses are required to manage the tax risks in their jurisdiction, considering both proximate and long-term risks. Regular updates detailing the Group's tax position are provided to the Group Audit Committee.\n\nThe management of tax risks is overseen by the risk and audit functions.\n\nThe tax strategy is aligned with the Aviva Business Ethics code. It is owned by the Group Chief Financial Officer and is approved and overseen by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Canada and Ireland we continue to build strong businesses.\n\n## Climate and environment\n\n## Employees\n\n## Social matters\n\n## Human rights\n\n## Anti-corruption\n\nWe've been a carbon neutral company since 2006 and our ambition is to be Net Zero by 2040. In March 2022 we published our climate transition plan setting out our approach. We can impact the carbon emissions of Aviva's operations and have some influence through our assets under management that we have stewardship over, alongside the innovations and customers we support via our insurance. To deliver on our climate ambition, and reduce our exposure to climate-related risk, we focus on the following key areas: influencing, decarbonising our investments, insuring the transition and decarbonising our operations and supply chain.\n\nRead more in our sustainability ambition and our Climaterelated Financial Disclosure\n\nOur focus is on unleashing the power of our people to deliver our strategy. We believe in a high-performance culture and expect the highest standards of behaviour and integrity of our people consistent with our values. Our Conduct and Performance Policy sets out the standards for all colleagues at work. Our mandatory learning covers all the important things employees need to know about working at Aviva so we can protect our business, customers and colleagues. We also want our people to feel comfortable sharing their insights and experiences so we can work together to understand the needs of all customers and find solutions to problems together. Our Fairness and Equality at Work policy and its supporting procedures help colleagues understand what it means to work in a way that's fair, equal and within the law - and also how to raise concerns. We do not tolerate discrimination of any description on any grounds.\n\nRead more in our people\n\nWe are aiming to build stronger communities by allocating an average of 2% of our Group adjusted operating profit a year to community investment; helping people with financial, climate and health challenges.\n\nThrough our fund management operations, we seek to invest in assets that can be put to positive social use, where we can. We finance many social infrastructure developments, including healthcare, education, transport, housing, water and renewable energy.\n\nThrough our life insurance companies we have a goal to help at least 13% of adults in the UK to save or retire with Aviva.\n\nAcross Aviva we work with our customers, communities and partners to help more people get the insurance protection and income in retirement they need for a better tomorrow.\n\nRead more in our sustainability ambition\n\nOur approach is to be committed to respecting the human rights of others. This includes preventing, addressing and remediating any potential adverse human rights impacts in our operations, our business activities and relationships, and our investments. We continue to pursue our anti-modern slavery agenda within our operations and supply chain, and through our partnerships. In 2023 we refreshed our wider human rights approach following our last biennial, Group-wide human rights due diligence assessment. In addition we widened the scope of our supplier assessments and selected a new Sustainability partner Business for Social Responsibility (BSR). BSR will specifically support the ongoing development of our Human Rights and Anti-modern slavery agendas, aiming to identify the most salient issues across our operations and value chain.\n\nRead more in this report under our support for human rights. Also see our modern slavery statement on aviva.com\n\nWe will always seek to protect our customers, shareholders, employees and communities from financial crime.\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance approach to acts of bribery and corruption.\n\nAll Group offices must comply with our Financial Crime Business Standard and associated Minimum Compliance Standards, which include robust antibribery and corruption requirements based on the UK Bribery Act.\n\nOur Business Ethics Code strictly prohibits any person associated with the Group from doing anything that supports, encourages or facilitates bribery and corruption.\n\nRead more about our Business Ethics Code on aviva.com\n\nFor further information, see Our business model and Our strategy.\n\nThe table below outlines Aviva's policies across certain key, non-financial areas with links to where further information on these topics can be found in this Strategic report.\n\nOur policies can be read in full at https://www.aviva.com/sustainability/ reporting/#policies-and-response.\n\nOn the next page is a summary of how we go about managing these aspects of our business and measuring our performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It allows the Board to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into our strategy, decision making and business processes. The Board's Customer and Sustainability Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of Aviva's Sustainability Ambition. The impact of climate change is considered by the Risk Committee and climate disclosures by the Group Audit Committee.\n\nSee the Governance section for further information including the consideration of climate-related matters by our Board and Committees during 2023.\n\n## Read more in governance\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe have an ambition to be Net Zero by 2040. Our current approach is focused on reducing carbon emissions, protecting and restoring biodiversity and understanding the impact of investments. This is set out in Our sustainability ambition section.\n\nWe have committed to do everything within our power to create the right conditions to become a Net Zero carbon\n\nemissions company by 2040, whilst also recognising that we do not have full control over the delivery of this ambition. Government action on policy and development of new technologies are of fundamental importance to create the conditions for success. Without good progress on these issues, achieving our climate ambition becomes increasingly challenging.\n\n## Read more in sustainability ambition\n\n## Risk management\n\nAviva's risk management framework sets out how we identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on the risks to which our business, customers' and wider society are, or could be, exposed to (including climate and sustainability related risks).\n\nWe use our risk identification process to identify potential exposure to climaterelated risks via the associated physical risk (for example flood, wind storm and tropical cyclones and heavy precipitation), transition risk (for example new climate policies) and litigation risk (including greenwashing).\n\nWe have identified climate-related risks covering investment returns, disruption to the life and general insurance markets.\n\nThere are also climate-related opportunities related to our investments and insurance product offerings.\n\nWe use the following time horizons to classify climate-related opportunities and risks, aligned to our strategy and business plans:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term 0 to 3 years: risks and opportunities deemed material to our three year business and financial planning cycle are viewed as short term.\n- \u00b7 Medium term 3 to 10 years: Risks and opportunities deemed material to our 2030 ambitions are viewed as medium term.\n- \u00b7 Long term > 10 years - aligned with the SBT guidance for financial institutions.\n\nWe then conduct exposure analysis to understand how these risks will impact our most material exposures. The principal risks impacted by climate change are credit risk, market risk, general insurance risk and life insurance risk.\n\nIn 2023, through effective collaboration across Aviva as well as clear roles and responsibilities, we continued to build our climate and other sustainability related risk capability and methodology.\n\nThis has supported further integration of these risks into our governance, strategy, risk management, and disclosure as well as to develop our associated metrics and targets, to support better understanding, monitoring and reporting, ensuring these risks and opportunities are embedded in our day-to-day decision making in line with our climate risk appetite and risk profile.\n\n## Read more in our risks and risk management\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nWe have expanded our financed emissions metric to include additional asset classes this year: infrastructure debt, commercial real estate mortgages, equity release mortgages and direct real estate.\n\nWe use scenario analysis as a tool to assist to identify the potential impact of climate change on our organisation. Our analysis shows that Aviva's strategy remains resilient to climate-related risks and opportunities in all scenarios when taking into account the availability of\n\nfuture management actions. There remains a clear benefit to Aviva in terms of keeping temperature rises below 2\u00b0C. We continue to work towards limiting global warming to under 1.5\u00b0C in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nAs to be expected, the proportion of transition risk generally reduces as we move to higher temperature pathways. Aviva is most exposed to the 4\u00b0C scenario where physical risk dominates, negatively impacting long-term investment returns and exacerbating insurance-related costs.\n\nThe following table sets out the assets included in our climate metrics compared to the AUM on the IFRS consolidated statement of the financial position of assets managed on behalf of the Group:\n\n|                                                                               | 2023   | Re- presented   2022 1   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Total AUM for climate  metrics (\u00a3bn)                                          | 213    | 189                      |\n| AUM included in the IFRS  consolidated statement  of financial position (\u00a3bn) | 307    | 289                      |\n| Coverage (%)                                                                  | 69%    | 65%                      |\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nFinanced emissions represent the carbon emissions of our investment portfolio (i.e. Aviva's emissions for Scope 3 category 15 from the GHG Protocol). We monitor the emissions of our investment portfolio for shareholder and policyholder funds and our progress towards our climate ambitions.\n\n## Operational emissions\n\nWe have set out below our GHG emissions on an absolute CO 2 e basis in accordance with the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR).\n\n- 1.

Following the adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (see note 1 of the Financial Statements for further details), the Group's revenue-based operational intensity measure has been updated to use Insurance revenue and Fee and commission income instead of GWP\n- 2. Market-based: A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity that companies have purposefully chosen\n- 3. Scope 1: Natural gas, fugitive emissions (leakage of gases from air conditioning and refrigeration systems), oil, and company-owned car\n\n- 5. Scope 3: Includes certain Scope 3 categories for business travel (category 6) and grey fleet (private cars used for business) (category 6), waste (category 5) and water. Scope 3 emissions have increased compared to 2022 principally as a result of business travel increasing.\n- 6. All residual emissions have been offset. In 2023 and 2022 we offset our residual carbon emissions from our Scope 2 market-based total as this takes account of the reduced emissions from our use of electricity from renewable sources. As at 16 February 2024, the 17,386 credits purchased in relation to the 2023 market-based emissions footprint were retired.\n- 7. Location-based: A location-based method reflects the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs\n- 8. Includes Scopes 1 and 2 energy MWh used within our occupied buildings\n- Indicates that the data was subject to external independent reasonable assurance by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC'). For the results of that assurance, see Aviva plc Climaterelated Financial Disclosure 2023 Independent Assurance section and Aviva plc 2023 Reporting Criteria Independent Assurance section.\n\nOperational and financed emissions Scope 1 emissions relate to Aviva's operations excluding electricity usage. Scope 2 emissions relate to electricity usage of Aviva's operations.\n\nScope 3 emissions in the table on the left includes emissions related to category 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7, as outlined below. For these categories the emissions do not include the counterparties' Scope 3 emissions. For category 15 financed emissions, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are included and do not include investee Scope 3 emissions (Scope 3 of Scope 3).\n\n|                                                  | Status Scope 3  category name:                                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Not yet   reported                               | Category 1 - Purchased goods  and services                                                  |\n|                                                  | Category 2 - Capital goods                                                                  |\n| Included in  operational  carbon  emissions      | Category 3 - Fuel and energy- related activities                                            |\n| Included in  operational  carbon  emissions      | Category 5 - Waste generated in  operations                                                 |\n| Included in  operational  carbon  emissions      | Category 6 - Business travel                                                                |\n| Included in  operational  carbon  emissions      | Category 7 - Employee commuting                                                             |\n| Aviva does  not engage in  activities  linked to | Category 4 - Upstream transportation  and distribution                                      |\n| Aviva does  not engage in  activities  linked to | Category 8 - Upstream leased assets                                                         |\n| these  categories                                | Category 9 - Downstream  transportation and distribution                                    |\n| these  categories                                | Category 10 - Processing of sold  goods                                                     |\n| these  categories                                | Category 11 - Use of sold products                                                          |\n| these  categories                                | Category 12 - End-of-life treatment  of sold products                                       |\n| these  categories                                | Category 13 - Downstream leased  assets                                                     |\n| these  categories                                | Category 14 - Franchises                                                                    |\n| Included in  Financed  emissions                 | Category 15 - Investments  Financed emission metrics include  investee Scope 1 and Scope 2. |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consistent with the requirements of section 414CB of the Companies Act, climate-related financial disclosures are embedded within the Strategic report. The Group's general purpose financial reports include a Climate-related Financial Disclosure report, which provides more detailed information. The table below outlines how the 11 recommendations have been addressed both within the Strategic report, and with greater granularity within the Climate-related Financial Disclosure.\n\n| TCFD pillars                                                                                                                                                            | TCFD recommended disclosures                                                                                                                                             | Section of the Strategic report, that disclosures  are included in, in compliance with the  Companies Act                                     | Section of the Climate-related Financial  Disclosure with further details, in compliance  with the Listing Rules                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance Disclose the organisation's  governance around climate-related                                                                                               | a.

We diversify the risks inherent in our business lines through our scale, the variety of the products and services we offer, and the channels through which we sell our products and services.\n\n## Year in review\n\nAviva has effectively mitigated the impact of significant risk events throughout 2023, with proactive and successful management response. Notably, this includes resilience to entrenched high UK inflation and interest rates, alongside other market-wide risks and issues that have had the potential to harm Aviva's customers or cause material financial strain on the business and operations.\n\n2023 also saw a positive outcome in conclusion to the Risk Improvement Delivery Programme (RIDP).\n\nAviva's Groupwide Risk Function and Risk Management were independently assessed as moving from Industry Standard to Good Practice, and in several areas ahead of our competitors, such as in 'risk measurement and the quality of risk opinions'.\n\n## Our strategy for risk\n\nEffective risk management leadership, capability and culture are fundamental to the sustainable success of Aviva.\n\nWe receive premiums which we invest to maximise risk-adjusted returns, so that we can fulfil our promises to customers while providing a return to our shareholders. In doing so, we prefer retaining risks we believe we are capable of managing to generate a return.\n\nThe risks inherent to our business model, along with broader risk trends impacting the business are set out below, in the Principal Risks section, and longer term emerging risks in the Emerging Risks section of this report.\n\n## Types of inherent risks\n\nThe types of risks to which the Group is exposed have not changed significantly over the year. The inherent risks to our business are described below and, in particular with operational risks, may have an adverse impact on our brand and reputation.\n\nOur exposure to these risks and mitigating actions are set out in detail in note 54 of the financial statements.\n\n## Risks customers transfer to us:\n\n- \u00b7 Life insurance risk includes longevity risk (annuity customers living longer than we expect), mortality risk (customer lifespans are shorter than expected), expense risk (the amount it costs us to administer policies) and persistency risk (customers lapsing or surrendering their policies).\n- \u00b7 General insurance risk arises from loss events (for example, fire, flooding, windstorms, accidents) and inflation (on expenses and claims). Health insurance exposes the Group to morbidity risk (the proportion of our customers falling sick) and medical expense inflation.\n- \u00b7 Asset management risk is the risk of customers redeeming funds, not investing with us, or switching funds, resulting in reduced fee income.\n\n## Risks arising from investments:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risks (actual defaults and expected defaults) create uncertainty in our ability to offer a minimum investment return on our investments.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments when they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form.\n- \u00b7 Market risks result from fluctuations in asset values, including equity prices, property prices, foreign exchange, inflation and interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As illustrated on the figure to the left, our RMF is made up of several key components, including sub-frameworks for risk appetite and key risk categories, as well as our risk policy, governance, processes, procedures, systems and desired behaviours and attitudes for risk management.\n\nIt is codified through risk policies, business standards and frameworks which set out the approach to risk management, risk appetite and the minimum requirements and key controls for the Group's operations.\n\nAviva's culture underpins all aspects of our RMF and ensures different and balanced risk perspectives inform decision-making at Aviva. We monitor the effectiveness of our control consciousness and risk behaviours through feedback from our people throughout our businesses, regular assessment and industry benchmarking.\n\n## Our risk appetite framework\n\nOur risk appetite framework (RAF) outlines the risks we select and manage in the pursuit of return, the risks we accept and retain at a moderate level as part of doing business and the risks we actively avoid or take action to mitigate as far as practical.\n\nOur risk appetites express the level of risk our business is willing to accept, are set at an aggregate level (sometimes covering multiple risk types) and act as hard constraints. The Group has risk appetites for solvency, liquidity, climate, operational, conduct and reputational risk. The risk appetites are supported by risk tolerances, preferences, triggers, and limits (see Risk Strategy infographic).\n\n## Our people, processes and systems\n\nOur people and culture underpin all aspects of Aviva's risk management. We encourage diversity of thought and a culture of curiosity to ensure a broad range of risks are identified and considered. We continuously develop the skills and capabilities of our people to drive better business decisions that appropriately balance risk and reward.\n\nThe processes and systems we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks are designed to enable dynamic risk-based decision-making and effective day-to-day risk management. These include the use of our risk models, Operational Risk and Control Management System (ORCM) and stress and scenario testing (SST).\n\n<!-- image -->",

We refreshed the Conduct Risk appetite and sharpened guidance around good customer outcomes and foreseeable harm.\n\nWe have appointed Non-Executive Director Consumer Duty Champions across all of our UK businesses. The champions support the chairs and Chief Executives in raising the Duty in all relevant discussions, and challenge how we are embedding the Duty and focusing on consumer outcomes.\n\nWe have also updated our Policies and Business Standards (including those relating to people and reward).\n\nActivity is underway in relation to closed products and the second implementation deadline on 31 July 2024.\n\nThe roles and responsibilities of the Risk and Audit Committees in relation to the oversight of risk management and internal control are set out in the Governance section of this Report.\n\nThe Risk Committee engages with the Customer and Sustainability Committee on the Climate and wider Sustainability agenda. There are three Group-level management committees designed to assist members of the Aviva Executive Committee in the discharge of their delegated authorities and their accountabilities within the Aviva Governance Framework and in relation to their defined regulatory responsibilities: the Group Asset and Liability Committee; the Group Executive Risk Committee and the Group Disclosure Committee.\n\n## Oversight and challenge\n\nThe risk function is committed to enabling Aviva to grow profitably, responsibly and sustainably through oversight and challenging how the first line optimises our risk exposure safely with a key focus on protecting our customers and society for a better tomorrow. This is delivered through our risk leadership team specialising in financial risk, non-financial risk (including IT, cyber, climate and conduct), and consists of our Market Chief Risk Officers and risk directors. The risk function has been proactive on key business initiatives, for example implementation of Consumer Duty in the year.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.

The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and capital and liquidity positions are set out in the Strategic report, along with the Group's approach to risk and risk management. In addition, the Financial statements sections include notes on the Group's borrowings (note 47); its contingent liabilities and other risk factors (note 50); its capital management (note 52); management of its risks including market, climate, credit and liquidity risk (note 54); and derivative financial instruments (note 55).\n\nThe going concern and longer-term viability review includes consideration of the Group's current and forecast solvency and liquidity positions over a three-year period which aligns to management's 2024-2026 business plan and evaluates the results of stress and scenario testing. Stress and scenario testing (including reverse stress testing) is used to test the resilience of business plans and to inform decision-making.\n\nThese tests are driven by the Group's risk profile at a range of severities, as well as a range of other scenarios as part of the Group solvency and liquidity management processes.\n\nThe Group continues to maintain strong solvency and liquidity positions through a range of scenarios and stress testing. Particular areas of uncertainty include credit downgrades where a specific focus has been our commercial mortgage portfolio which we continue to monitor closely and have taken several actions including debt restructuring. The Group's balance sheet exposure has been reviewed and actions taken to reduce the sensitivity to economic shocks.\n\nEven in severe downside scenarios, no material uncertainty in relation to going concern and longer-term viability has been identified, due to the Group's strong solvency and liquidity positions providing considerable resilience to external shocks, underpinned by the Group's approach to risk management (see note 54).\n\nIt is fundamental to the Group's longerterm strategy that the directors manage and monitor risk, considering all key risks the Group faces, including longer-term insurance risks, so that it can continue to meet its obligations to policyholders. The Group is also subject to extensive regulation and supervision under the UK Solvency II regulatory framework.\n\n## Going concern\n\nAfter making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt, and to consider appropriate, the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\n## Longer-term viability statement\n\nThe directors have assessed the prospects of the Group in accordance with Provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, with reference to the Group's current position and prospects, its strategy, risk appetite, and the potential impact of the principal risks and how these are managed. Based on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year assessment period to 31 December 2026.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\nBy order of the Board on 6 March 2024.\n\nAmanda Blanc DBE Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

I firmly believe that strong corporate governance practices sit behind and enable both those outcomes.\n\nAs a Board, we are responsible for promoting the success of the Company and generating value for shareholders while also fulfilling responsibilities to all our stakeholders.\n\nTo execute that function, we provide leadership, set the Group's strategic aims and risk appetite and uphold the purpose, culture, values and ethics of the company.\n\nWe believe that our clear governance framework enables the Board to operate effectively.\n\n## Our Board\n\nThe way we operate also depends on having the right balance of skill, knowledge and experience. As part of that, we're committed to ensuring we have diversity of perspective and we are proud to meet the gender and ethnicity targets set by the Financial Conduct Authority and The Parker Review.\n\nIn January 2024, the Board appointed a new Group Company Secretary, Susan Adams. Susan takes on the role from Kirstine Cooper who stepped down as Group General Counsel and Company Secretary in December and I'd like to thank Kirstine for her enormous contribution to the Board over her 13 years in the role.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nThe Board is determined to maintain the highest standards in the way we work, just as in the way the wider business operates. As part of our process for self-reflection and improvement, we undertook our annual assessment of effectiveness and conducted an internal Board and Committee evaluation. The evaluation was positive across all areas and the individual results had improved on the prior year.\n\nFollowing the evaluation, the Board agreed key areas of focus which included delivering our growth agenda, focusing on the customer and sustainability.\n\nRead more about our governance activities:\n\nOur approach to governance\n\nOur Board's activities\n\nBoard and Committee evaluation\n\nStakeholder engagement\n\nAnnual General Meeting\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our governance framework and a clear division of responsibilities enables the Board to operate effectively, fulfil its responsibilities and provide valuable oversight.\n\nWhilst the Board reserves certain responsibilities, day-to-day management of the Group has been delegated to the Group Chief Executive Officer, who is supported by the Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board has established five Board Committees which operate under Terms of Reference, available online at www.aviva.com/committees.\n\nThe Board Committees work closely together in particular areas. For example, the Audit and Risk Committees work together on risk and control matters and both Committee Chairs are members of the other Committee to ensure a co-ordinated approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance framework\n\n## Board\n\nCollectively responsible for promoting the long-term, sustainable success of the Company through seeking to generate value for shareholders while fulfilling responsibilities to all our stakeholders. This includes setting the Group's strategic priorities and monitoring management's performance against those priorities, setting the Group's risk appetite and ensuring effective controls are in place, monitoring compliance with corporate governance principles and upholding the purpose, culture, values, and ethics of the Company.\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Chair is tasked with the leadership of the Board, setting its agenda, ensuring its effectiveness and enabling the constructive challenge of the performance and strategic plans of the Executive Directors by the Non-Executive Directors. The Chair also plays a key role in the effective communication with shareholders and working with the Board to establish our culture, purpose, and values.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThe Senior Independent Director's principal duties are to provide a sounding board for the Chair and serve as an intermediary to other directors and shareholders where necessary. The Senior Independent Director also leads on reviewing the performance of the Chair.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nNon-Executive Directors are expected to exercise independent judgement through constructive challenge and scrutiny of management's performance. They assist in the development of strategy and must satisfy themselves that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust. Non-Executive Directors are central in determining appropriate levels of remuneration for Executive Directors, as well as succession planning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to governance\n\n## Board independence\n\nThe independence of the Board is fundamental in ensuring that Non-Executive Directors can properly fulfil their responsibility to provide constructive challenge and scrutiny of management's performance.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee assess the independence of each Non-Executive Director upon appointment and on an annual basis, against the criteria set out in the Code, and make recommendations to the Board.\n\nIn January 2024, the Board determined that all Non-Executive Directors were independent, except for Michael Mire. However, the Nomination and Governance Committee considered that Michael contributed strongly to the discussions at the Board and brought significant experience of strategy, transformation and asset management and recommended that Michael remain on the Board.\n\nIn the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts, we disclosed that Mike Craston was not considered to be independent at that time in relation to the assessment criteria set out in Provision 10 of the Code. This was due to Mike having held an executive role with Aviva Investors within the previous five years, between 14 January 2016 and 30 September 2017.\n\nIn January 2024, following the expiry of the five-year period, the Nomination and Governance Committee carefully re-considered Mike's status and assessed that Mike's previous employment does not affect his independence at this time and that he should therefore be considered as an Independent Non-Executive Director.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nAnother factor that is vital to the effective operation of the Board is our directors having sufficient time to meet their responsibilities.\n\nWhen appointing new directors to the Board, the Nomination and Governance Committee consider prospective directors' external appointments to ensure that they have sufficient time to dedicate to Aviva.\n\nThe Committee also considers existing directors' time commitments if they wish to take on additional external appointments and, recognising the importance of keeping directors' time commitments under review, the Committee assesses each director's external appointments and demand on their time annually and make recommendations to the Board.\n\nIn January 2024, the Board determined that all directors continued to demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to their role with Aviva.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company's Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose such limits or conditions as are deemed necessary. The Board continues to monitor and note any actual or potential conflicts of interest that each director may have and decides whether these should be authorised.\n\nDirectors are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest as and when they arise and to confirm the information held by the Company is correct on a bi-annual basis.\n\nRead more in the Nomination and Governance Committee report\n\n## Independent advice\n\nAll directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary in relation to the discharge of their duties on the Board and any committees they serve on.\n\nFurthermore, any directors may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense. During the year, no directors sought to do so.\n\n## Induction, training and development\n\nA commitment to support the continuing development of all employees is a central part of Aviva's culture. Our directors are highly supportive of this and are committed to their own ongoing professional development. During 2023, the directors participated in internal training sessions on subjects including Consumer Duty, sustainability and inclusive behaviours.\n\nFurther training sessions have been incorporated into the Board and Committee plans for 2024.\n\nThe Board also receives regular briefings on a range of strategically important matters to ensure they are informed of developments in these areas.\n\nAll newly appointed directors are provided with a structured and tailored induction programme. This covers, amongst other matters, the current financial and operational plan, meeting packs and minutes from recent Board and Committee meetings, stakeholder engagement, organisation structure charts, a history of the Group, role profiles and all relevant policies, procedures and other governance material. The induction also includes meeting key members of senior management and the external and internal auditors.\n\nAny knowledge or skill enhancements identified during the directors' regulatory application process are also addressed through the induction programme.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Executive Directors have an ongoing dialogue and a programme of meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and analysts which are managed by the Company's investor relations function.\n\nThe Chair also meets with the Group's major shareholders. At those meetings a range of issues is discussed to understand shareholders' perspectives, within the constraints of rules around confidential information. Shareholders' views are regularly communicated to the Board through reports from the Group CEO and Group CFO and weekly briefings from our corporate brokers and the investor relations function.\n\nThe Chair of the Remuneration Committee also met with major shareholders during the year.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director is also available to meet with major shareholders to discuss any concerns that cannot be resolved through normal channels.\n\n## Read more in our stakeholders\n\nShareholders are also given the opportunity to communicate with the Board at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Read more in shareholder services\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group's risk appetite and ensuring that there is an appropriate system of risk governance in place.\n\nTo discharge this responsibility, the Board has established frameworks for risk management and internal control using a 'three lines of defence' risk governance model, which help the Group comply with the FRC guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting.\n\nIn-depth monitoring of the establishment and operation of prudent and effective key controls for assessing and managing the key risks associated with the Group's operations is delegated to the Audit and Risk Committees.\n\nAt the mid-year 2023, the Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, carried out a robust assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks. This exercise was repeated in January 2024. The outcome of these assessments was discussed at the Board.\n\nAviva's approach to risk management and internal controls, together with the principal and emerging risks that face the Group are explained within the Our risks and risk management section of the Strategic report.\n\n## Assessment of effectiveness of risk management\n\nEach business unit Chief Executive Officer is required to make a declaration that the Group's governance and system of internal controls are effective and are fit for purpose for their business and that they are kept under review throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe effectiveness assessment draws on the regular cycle of assurance activity carried out during the year and is supported by the application of the Group's operational risk and control management framework whereby the details of any key failings or weaknesses are reported to the Audit and Risk Committees and to the Board on a regular basis.\n\nAny material risks not previously identified, key control weaknesses or non-compliance with the Group's risk policies or local delegations of authority must be highlighted as part of this process. This assessment is subject to Chief Risk Officer review and challenge both at local business unit and Group-level.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committees monitor the operation of the Group's risk management and internal controls through regular reports. In January 2024, working closely together on behalf of the Board, the Audit and Risk Committees carried out a full review of the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. This review covered all key controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and the risk management framework.\n\nRead more in our risks and risk management",

The Board undertakes a rigorous evaluation process each year to assess how it, its Committees and individual directors are performing. In line with the Code, the Board instructed Lintstock Limited to conduct an externally facilitated evaluation in November and December 2022. Lintstock Limited provides external board evaluation services and has no other connection with Aviva or its directors.\n\nIn 2023, the Board conducted an internal evaluation process, building on the process facilitated by Lintstock in 2022. The evaluation was conducted through a questionnaire completed by all directors and the results of the evaluation were presented and discussed at the Board in January 2024.\n\nFollowing this discussion, the Board agreed the key areas of focus, and an action plan to address these specific areas as shown in the table. All actions from the 2022 Board evaluation were addressed during 2023 and the progress made on the recommendations from the 2022 Board evaluation was highly rated overall.\n\nThe evaluation also assessed the Board composition and effectiveness of each of the Board Committees. The current Board composition was rated highly and the Board was seen to be well balanced with a diverse mix of skills and experience. The Committee structure was considered effective and all Committees were considered to be working effectively.\n\n## Our Board and Committee evaluation cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress against 2022 evaluation outcomes\n\n| Focus area           | Theme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Progress                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer  strategy   | Becoming the go to brand for  Insurance, Wealth and Retirement.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | The Board's effectiveness in this area was rated positively.

The Committee reviewed in detail Shonaid's portfolio, overall capacity and noted that Shonaid had retired from Greencoat UK Wind from the conclusion of their 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn March 2023, Mohit Joshi was appointed as Managing Director and CEO designate to Tech Mahindra Limited, leaving his position at Infosys. He assumed the position as Managing Director and CEO in December 2023.\n\nOn 1 February 2024, Andrea Blance retired from her role as Senior Independent Director of Vanquis Banking Group.\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that each director continued to have sufficient time to allocate to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Code places an emphasis on succession planning and the Committee continues to build on its existing processes to strengthen its focus in this area.\n\nAn external market mapping exercise was completed for the role of the Group Company Secretary to strengthen the leadership and succession in the function following Kirstine Cooper's retirement and splitting the Group Company Secretary and General Counsel roles. As a result Susan Adams was appointed as Group Company Secretary on 8 January 2024.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the succession plan for the Group CEO and Group CFO to ensure that internal and external talent pipeline was robust and diverse.\n\nThe development of the Group Executive Committee (ExCo) is also monitored to ensure that there is an appropriate pipeline of senior executives and potential future Executive Directors with the required skills and experience.\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee received updates from the Group CEO on composition and changes to the Group ExCo and considered the development plans and talent profiles of these individuals in line with the Group's succession plans.\n\nThe development plans designed to prepare successors for ExCo roles were also considered. Internal talent development and developing a pipeline of potential future leaders remained an area of focus for the Committee during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee also considered initiatives to enhance, strengthen and diversify the talent pipeline across the wider Group and members of the Committee remain involved in various initiatives, including the Ethnically Diverse Leadership programme and cross-company mentoring programmes with senior leaders.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion continued to be an area of focus for the Committee. The Board is committed to having a diverse and inclusive leadership team which provides a range of perspectives and insights and the challenge needed to support good decision making. Diversity at Aviva includes, but is not limited to, gender, ethnicity, skills and experience, geographic and socio-economic and educational backgrounds, disability and sexual orientation.\n\nThe ways in which we seek to put into practice these values are set out in our Board Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement (the Statement), which supports the Committee's approach to succession planning. This includes our commitment to increasing the number of women in leadership roles to 40% by 2024 and to enhancing the ethnic diversity of our leadership and succession pipeline.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee updated the Statement to reflect that Aviva has achieved its commitment to 40% female representation amongst our leadership cadre.",

The Board is pleased to have met the Parker Review Committee's target for all FTSE 100 boards to have at least one director from an ethic minority background. Since 31 December 2023, no Board changes have occurred that have affected our ability to meet the targets above.\n\nNumerical data on the ethnic background and gender of the Board and Group Executive Committee required by Listing Rule 9.8.6(10) can be found in the Directors' report.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, I can report that the gender balance of the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports as at 31 December 2023 was 35.7% women and 64.3% men.\n\nFurther details on diversity in the workforce and wider senior leadership population can be found in the Strategic report.\n\nWe actively support women advancing into senior roles, with the Group CEO being a member of the 30% Club and HM Treasury's Women in Finance Champion, which commits financial services companies to a range of measures to improve gender diversity amongst senior management.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Committee monitors the Group's compliance with the Code and other areas of regulation and guidance. The Group Company Secretary provides updates to the Committee on governance matters which have the potential to impact the reputation of the Group.\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee focused on the implementation and embedding of the Group Governance Framework for the oversight of the Group's subsidiaries, as reported in the Subsidiary Governance dashboard. Updates were provided relating to enhancements to the Subsidiary Governance Principles, the effectiveness of the Company's subsidiary boards and the Group conflicts of interest policy and related safeguards.\n\nSuccession planning for material subsidiaries around the Group is considered and, where appropriate, changes to the composition of the material subsidiary boards are approved by the Committee. The Committee also reviews the outcomes of the evaluations completed by subsidiary boards and monitors and actions plans developed by those boards in response to those outcomes.\n\nThe Committee considers proposals for operating model simplification within the Group. The reduced geographic size of the Group provided an opportunity to optimise and simplify our operating model to drive efficiency and deliver greater value to our shareholders. The Committee reviewed the organisational design plans and the programme workstreams and considered the governance and controls around the proposed changes.\n\n## George Culmer\n\nChair of the Nomination and Governance Committee\n\n6 March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n## Committee member requirements\n\nThe Board annually review how members meet the experience and expertise criteria set out in the Code and the FCA Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTRs). I, as Committee Chair, Andrea Blance, Shonaid Jemmett-Page and Jim McConville fulfilled both this Code and the DTR requirements for financial expertise, experience and independence. The Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the Insurance and broader Financial Services Industry.\n\n## Financial and non-financial reporting\n\nThe Committee reviewed the integrity and accuracy of the Company's financial, and principal non-financial reporting and related announcements. This included quarterly results announcements, the Annual Report and Accounts and the Solvency and Financial Condition Report.\n\nThe Committee monitored the implementation of IFRS 17 during 2023, including oversight over new financial reporting processes, systems and control environment.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the integrity and accuracy of the financial impact of IFRS 17 on the transition date 1 January 2022 and the publication of restated 2022 financial information and the related disclosures in the Half Year Report 2023.\n\n## Climate-related reporting\n\nThe Committee reviewed the principal climate-related disclosures made by Aviva plc in 2023 Annual Report and Accounts and Climate-related Financial Disclosure report and to ensure appropriate controls are in place to support the preparation of disclosures.\n\nThe Committee noted the developing nature of climate metrics measurement standards, particularly in relation to the estimation of Scope 3 financed emissions in context of continued challenges towards measurement of Scope 3 emissions and associated complexity, due to limited and unsophisticated data and methodologies.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nTo support the directors' statement that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, the Committee reviewed the process of preparing the report. There is a robust process to ensure each section of the report is signed off by an appropriate member of management and the overall production of the report is overseen by the Chief Financial Controller to ensure consistency across the document. The report is reviewed by members of the Group Executive Committee, the Disclosure Committee, the Aviva plc Board and each of its Committees. Furthermore an extensive verification process is undertaken to ensure factual accuracy.\n\n## External and internal audit effectiveness\n\nThe Committee and management have a regular and open dialogue with PwC and our audit partner regularly attends Committee meetings. The Committee also receives reports from the external auditor on the progress of its audit activities.\n\nThe Committee reviews the contents of these reports and the level of professional scepticism and challenge of management assumptions demonstrated by the external auditor, and where appropriate, requests that management respond to that challenge and tracks management response to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the challenges raised.\n\nThe 2023 external audit effectiveness review was undertaken to assist the Committee in assessing the quality of external auditor services provided to the Group through completion of a questionnaire by the Committee, subsidiary company audit committees, senior management, and members of the Group's finance teams. The review focused on the effectiveness of the external auditor team, expertise and resources and interaction with Audit Committee meetings. Overall feedback was positive and where opportunities for improvement were identified, PwC was asked to take account of that feedback in audit activity.\n\nThe Committee was provided with the FRC Audit Quality Review (AQR) report on the PwC audit of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts and discussed the findings with PwC.\n\nNo specific actions were required as a result of the AQR. The AQR provided further external evidence to the Committee of the robustness and quality of the external audit. The Committee concluded that the external auditor continued to perform effectively.\n\nThe Committee also conducts an annual review of the internal audit function to assess its independence, effectiveness and to satisfy itself that the quality, experience and expertise of the internal audit function is appropriate for the business. This is carried out by reviewing reports issued by internal audit and the output of an annual stakeholder effectiveness survey. This formal process is supplemented by regular private discussions with executive management, the internal auditor and the external auditor. The Committee concluded that for 2023 the function performed well and remained effective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following Board approval, we announced on 18 November 2021 our intention to appoint EY as our auditor for the financial year ending 31 December 2024.\n\nShareholder approval for EY's appointment will be sought at the 2024 AGM and PwC will resign as auditor, after 12 years in position. PwC has confirmed that there are no matters that need to be brought to the attention of holders of securities of the Company.\n\nThe Company is compliant with the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\nThe Committee is monitoring the transition of auditor from PwC to EY. The Committee will monitor EY's effectiveness as external auditor and report on its findings for the financial year ending 31 December 2024 in next year's Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nNo Audit Committee member had a connection with EY.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe Committee, together with the Risk Committee, monitored the effectiveness of the systems of internal control over financial and non-financial reporting that support the integrity of Aviva's financial and non-financial disclosures.\n\nIn January 2024, the FRC announced the publication of the 2024 Code. The Committee, together with the Risk Committee, will oversee and make recommendations to the Board in relation to the changes to Provision 29. The changes will require the Board to make a disclosure relating to the effectiveness of internal controls including a declaration in relation to material internal controls as at year-end.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nIn my role as Committee Chair, I am the whistleblowers' champion for the Group and I am responsible for overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the Group's policies in relation to whistleblowing.\n\nThe Committee receives reports on the number of cases reported to the Speak Up service, the proportion of reports that are designated as instances of whistleblowing, the number of substantiated cases and summaries of the action taken.\n\nThe Committee continues to support the Speak Up team and review opportunities to further enhance the Speak Up service. The outcome of the Voice of Aviva survey is used to assess staff comfort and confidence in the whistleblowing processes.\n\n## FRC Minimum Standard\n\nIn May 2023, the FRC published the Audit Committees and External Audit: Minimum Standard (the Minimum Standard). The Committee can confirm that the Company is compliant with the Minimum Standard. Activities undertaken to meet the requirements of the Minimum Standard are described throughout this report.\n\nPatrick Flynn Chair of the Audit Committee 6 March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee reviews the  underlying assumptions as  these involve complex  judgements and changes can  have a significant impact on  reported results. | Technical provisions . The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions used in the calculation of the Best Estimate Liability component  of the technical provisions required under IFRS and SII across our life and general insurance businesses, including restatement of technical  provisions on introduction of IFRS 17. The Committee reviewed and challenged the longevity, persistency, expense and residential and commercial property growth assumptions used  for the quarterly operating updates, and 2023 Half Year and Full Year financial statements. The process around the setting of longevity  assumptions was a particularly significant area for review as those judgements could have a material impact on Aviva's IFRS and SII results.  During 2023, the Committee worked closely with the Audit Committee of the Group's IWR subsidiary, Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited, to review the  detailed analysis and to validate changes observed in recent mortality experience and the resulting impact on the existing longevity assumptions.  The Committee reviewed the impact in the period of higher inflation and the rising interest rate environment during 2023. This included residential  property assumptions, the impact on the general insurance business of current and future claims inflation and impacts on the Aviva Staff Pension  Scheme. Reserving process.  Reviewed the controls associated with the IFRS and SII reserving process. The Committee reviewed the sign off procedures  and control framework for movements in IFRS reporting and SII results. |\n| IFRS and SII key accounting  judgements and disclosures | The Committee reviews and  recommends to the Board  Quarterly, Half Year and Full  Year disclosures and the impact  of accounting judgements on  those disclosures.

The Committee reviewed, challenged and recommended approval of IFRS and SII  judgements, including the impact of acquisitions on the Group balance sheet and the outcome of goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews.  The Committee reviewed the Group's exposure to contingent liabilities and other risk factors, including amounts allowed for and disclosures. The  Committee also considered the financial impact and disclosures stemming from the war in the Middle East and the Ukraine. Where appropriate, the  Committee monitored and tracked management's response to the challenges it raised to ensure a satisfactory outcome. Alternative Performance Measures (APMs).  The Committee reviewed and approved the clarification and treatment of certain items within the  Group's APMs to further improve the transparency and consistency of reporting of APMs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Implementation of IFRS 17                               | IFRS 17 is a new insurance  accounting standard issued by  the International Accounting  Standards Board (IASB)  effective from 1 January 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The Committee monitored the implementation of new IFRS standards, but most significantly in respect of IFRS 17. IFRS 17 has a significant impact  on the measurement and presentation of insurance contracts and the Committee has spent significant time monitoring the implementation of the  new accounting policies and judgements. The Committee continued to regularly assess the impact on the financial reporting process, the  operation of new internal financial tools used for financial forecasting and planning purposes, and the calculation of insurance liabilities under the  new standard. The Committee also assessed the effectiveness of the system of controls over the new IFRS 17 reporting systems. The Committee reviewed the integrity and accuracy of the financial impact of IFRS 17 on the transition date 1 January 2022 and the publication of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee focused on the continued development of the climate reporting control environment which supports  non-financial disclosures.  The Committee discussed and provided feedback on Net Zero ambition and climate disclosures in Aviva plc 2023 Annual Report and  Accounts and Climate-related Financial Disclosure report. A significant area of discussion on Net Zero ambition related to Aviva's  dependency on the external factors and whether they continued to support achievement of Aviva's Net Zero ambition. The Committee  noted the developing nature of climate measurement standards, particularly in relation to the estimation of Scope 3 financed emissions,  which has an inherent potential for double counting across entities in the same value chain. The Committee noted that emissions estimates and other climate metrics should be read acknowledging these are in initial stages of  development and subject to change as standards emerge and underlying data sources become more complete and developed.  The  Committee recognised that climate measurement standards are not at the same level of maturity as financial accounting standards. In  addition, enhancements to availability of data and control frameworks will be required to align with IFRS financial statements. Currently,  industry wide, the attestation provided by an auditor is to a weaker level than applies to IFRS financial statements. |\n| Internal Controls         | The Committee provides  oversight of the system of  internal control over financial  and non-financial reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Review of the effectiveness of the Operational Risk and Control Management (ORCM) system.  The Committee regularly reviewed a number of  reports to allow the evaluation of the effectiveness of controls and any failings or weaknesses. The Committee continued to challenge and support  developments to the risk aware culture of our people and strong internal control framework. Review of internal controls.  The Committee reviewed reports on the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial and non-financial  reporting to gain assurance that these remained in tolerance with no control weaknesses which could have a material impact on the financial  results and non-financial metrics. As referenced in 'Our approach to governance' section, the Committee received reports on the assessment of  financial reporting controls deficiencies and the detailed findings of the testing undertaken for their remediation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Internal Audit            | The Committee has  responsibility for overseeing  the work, effectiveness and  independence of the internal  audit function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Annual plan, budget and reports.

The main purpose of the Committee in assisting the Board in its oversight of risk within the Group is to review the Group's risk appetite and risk profile in relation to solvency, liquidity, climate, operational, conduct and reputational risks and to review the effectiveness of the Group's risk management framework (RMF), making recommendations to the Board as required.\n\nThe Committee reviews the methodology and oversees the governance of the internal model used in determining the Group's capital requirements and associated stress testing, including the key assumptions, methodologies and areas of expert judgement, activities undertaken to validate the outputs of the model and the development required to ensure that it continues to reflect the risk profile of the group.\n\nThe Group Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) is an ongoing assessment of the risks the Group is exposed to, and of the capital resources available to ensure that the Group is able to sustain its business over the plan horizon.\n\nThe Committee's review of the Group's ORSA process included proposed stress tests and scenarios to be used in the evaluation of capital adequacy, the profile of risks within the Group's strategic plan and how they may change over the planning period and the Group's overall capacity for the risks identified.\n\n## Group CRO Report\n\nThe Committee receives and reviews a report from the Group CRO at each meeting which highlights key information impacting the Group-wide risk profile, as well as an assessment of the current and forward-looking Group risk exposures. The report includes analysis of risks arising from the macroeconomic outlook and conditions in financial markets, together with geopolitical, legislative and regulatory change risks that may impact the Group's business and the Groupwide top risk themes. It includes updates on key activities undertaken by the Risk function to deliver on its vision and purpose in supporting the Group's strategic objectives, outputs of regular risk monitoring activities and, details of any current and specific financial, nonfinancial or regulatory and compliance risk matters.\n\nAlongside the Group CRO report, the Committee is provided with information on risk appetites and tolerances, assessing actual positions relative to the Group's risk appetite statements, and quantitative analysis of the Group's exposures to financial and operational risks, including risk-based capital requirements in relation to the core risks within the Group's businesses.\n\nIn November 2023, we welcomed James Hillman as Group Chief Risk Officer, and the Committee looks forward to working closely with him over the coming years.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nA number of risk events crystallised during 2023, including the Israel- Palestine conflict, the continuing impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, strong inflationary pressures and sustained higher interest rates, and a significant hardening of property reinsurance market. During the year the Committee monitored the potential impacts of macroeconomic risks in a number of areas including widening credit spreads and downgrades, interest rate movements and the risk of property price volatility on the commercial mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe Committee conducted a deep dive into conduct and financial crime risks, including the impacts of the continuing cost of living crisis. The Committee reviewed the Group's cyber risk and control environment, including the threat posed by the risk of ransomware attacks on both the Group and our material third party suppliers\n\nEmployee wellbeing remained an area of focus and the Committee people risk, including resource stretch and cost of living pressures.\n\n## Conduct Risk\n\nIn addition to those matters set out above, the Committee approved updates to the conduct risk policy to reflect the requirements of the FCA New Consumer Duty regulations and monitored the progress of measures taken within the UK subsidiaries to achieve compliance.\n\n## Data and AI\n\nThe Committee carried out a deep dive review of the Group's data risk environment, including our data ethics framework, to facilitate the responsible deployment of Artificial Intelligence (including Generative AI) capabilities.\n\n## Operational Resilience\n\nThe Committee received regular updates and challenged the progress made by management on operational resilience and change management related risk management appetites and tolerances. The Committee reviewed the Group transformation risk profile and the associated change execution and delivery risks, including the material Groupwide thematic drivers to our delivery risk.\n\n## Co-ordinated Assurance Plan\n\nThe Committee reviewed the 2024 Co-ordinated Assurance Plan which will provide a more connected approach to assurance, aligned to the Group's strategic priorities.\n\n## Andrea Blance\n\nChair of the Risk Committee\n\n6 March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

This included regular reviews of the customer dashboard which provides insight into key customer metrics, material customer trends, customer growth, experience and engagement.\n\nThe Committee monitored progress in building an enhanced customer experience, including through improvements to our digital capability such as better transactional functionality and digital support.\n\nThe impact of the FCA's Consumer Duty Regulation was closely monitored by the Committee during the year and reports from management relating to the customer considered Consumer Duty. We received regular updates on the implementation of the regulation and Aviva's approach to actively engage and support customers.\n\nThe Committee undertook deep-dives in relation to customer communications, digital customer journeys and customer complaints, all with a focus on the application of the Consumer Duty regulation.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the progress of our brand campaign, 'Making it Click' which recognises that taking financial action can be difficult for customers and was aimed at helping customers make positive decisions in relation to their finances.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Committee tracked progress against Aviva's Sustainability Ambition, including Key Performance Indicators and the Sustainability Ambition scorecard. The Committee reviewed and agreed the non-financial metrics, which demonstrate Aviva's sustainability performance and monitored progress against the sustainability ambitions. The Committee also provided input into the governance model for external reporting.\n\nThe Committee discussed pathways to Aviva's Net Zero ambitions, whilst recognising that Aviva do not have full control over the delivery of this ambition. The Committee noted that government action on policy and development of new technologies were and still remain of fundamental importance to create the conditions for success. Without good progress on these issues, achieving Aviva's climate ambition becomes increasingly challenging.\n\nThe Committee discussed and provided feedback on our Net Zero ambition in our 2023 Annual Report and Accounts and Climate-related Financial Disclosure report. A significant area of discussion related to Aviva's dependency on the external factors and whether they continued to support achievement of Aviva's Net Zero ambition.\n\nThe Committee noted the developing nature of climate metrics measurement standards, particularly in relation to the estimation of Scope 3 financed emissions in context of continued challenges towards measurement of Scope 3 emissions and associated complexity, due to limited and unsophisticated data and methodologies.\n\nThe Committee reviewed Group sustainability and climate reporting, including the Climate-related Financial Disclosure report in preparation for the climate disclosures summary being voted on (on an advisory basis) at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. In addition the Committee reviewed the Sustainability section of the Annual Report.\n\nThe Committee reviewed Aviva's social action strategy, which focuses on the difference we make to society.\n\nThe Committee also received updates on the progress of Aviva's sustainability governance activity, including reviewing the refreshed Aviva Human Rights Policy, our Business Ethics code, Sustainability Business Standard and our performance in external sustainability benchmarks and indices.\n\nFurther information on our integrated responsibility and sustainable business approach can be found on the Company's website at: www.aviva.com/ sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aviva Canada and Aviva Ireland\n\nDuring the year, Aviva Canada and Aviva Ireland presented to the Committee updates on their customer strategies including customer journeys and experience, and on the sustainability scorecards for their markets.

The new Policy will be presented to shareholders for approval at our Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 2024.\n\n## Read more in Remuneration Policy\n\n## \u00b7 Annual report on remuneration -\n\nfurther detail on how the Policy has been applied and remuneration outcomes in respect of 2023, and how the new Policy will be implemented in 2024.\n\n## Read more in Annual report on remuneration\n\n## 2023 Company performance\n\n2023 was another year of strong performance, reflecting our market leading positions, customer focus and the benefits of our diversified business. We have continued capital-light growth momentum and delivery across our diversified Group, and are in a strong and resilient capital position.\n\nPerformance against the annual bonus financial measures was strong, exceeding the targets set for the majority of measures.\n\n- \u00b7 Growth in the value created by our businesses was seen in the increase in Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG) and gross cash remittances, both exceeding target levels.\n- \u00b7 Growth and expense discipline saw increased Group adjusted operating profit and we have exceeded our \u00a3750 million gross cost reduction target, one year early.\n- \u00b7 Solvency II shareholder cover ratio remains strong at 207%, underpinned by robust capital generation.\n\nIn terms of non-financial performance, the Committee welcomed the continued improvement evident in our risk and control environment, as reflected in an above target assessment against the qualitative and quantitative measures within the Risk scorecard. Our employee engagement levels saw a two point increase to 88%, a figure well ahead of market norms. This reflects the focus on leadership development and visibility, and actions to support our people through a difficult economic environment.\n\nPerformance against our customer measures was more challenging, given the continued impact of inflation on product pricing and supply chain issues. Our investment in improving digital customer journeys resulted in online experience targets being achieved.\n\n## Supporting our people\n\nOversight of remuneration across the wider colleague population remains a focus area for the Committee.\n\n- \u00b7 We are proud to pay all of our UK colleagues at least the Real Living Wage, plus an additional 8% to enable colleagues to benefit from our 14% matching pension contribution and save for their retirement.\n- \u00b7 In addition, in March 2023, we were one of the first UK employers to be awarded the Living Pension accreditation. This signifies that we provide a Living Pension savings level which equates to 12% of a full-time real Living Wage salary, of which at least 7% comes from Aviva as an employer.\n- \u00b7 Further actions taken to support our colleagues in 2023 included an extension to our financial education programmes, improved communication of our overall reward package and improvements to our UK health and wellbeing proposition.\n\nFor 2024, the UK salary budget was 6%. Recognising the cost of living challenges, a higher budget was targeted at more junior colleagues offset by a significantly lower budget for senior management.\n\n## Policy Review and Shareholder Consultation\n\nIn line with the usual three-year cycle, we are required to submit our Policy to shareholders for approval at our AGM in May 2024. The Committee has therefore completed a review of the Policy to ensure it remains aligned to our purpose and strategy and continues to drive and reward strong performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur review concluded that, overall, our framework continues to achieve these aims and remains fit for purpose. As such, we are proposing only modest changes to the Policy, ensuring that it remains market aligned and that our incentive measures reflect business priorities.\n\nI would like to thank our major shareholders and their representative bodies for their level of engagement and overall positive feedback received as part of our consultation process.\n\nProposed changes to our Policy are outlined below and in the 'Directors' Remuneration Policy' section of this report.\n\n## Policy Changes\n\nTo better align with market practice and ensure our approach remains competitive and fair, the level of bonus deferral will reduce from two-thirds to half. This change will increase alignment with FTSE 100 practice and that of close peers, while continuing to ensure that a meaningful proportion of any bonus award is deferred into Aviva shares.\n\nAs part of a broader improvement to our wider workforce health proposition, Company-provided wellbeing services such as health assessments will be provided for NEDs.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration Committee report\n\n## Non-Policy Changes - Annual Bonus Plan Measures\n\nFollowing the achievement of the previously communicated cost reduction target and reflecting our growing businesses, the Cost Reduction measure will be replaced by efficiency measures. Recognising the diversified nature of Aviva, each of our core businesses will have targeted efficiency measures, which we will use to measure progress against our overall efficiency ambition. The weighting will remain at 10%.\n\n## Non-Policy Changes - LTIP\n\nThe current LTIP measures and weightings remain appropriate as key drivers of our long-term success. Therefore, changes are limited to refining the methodology and operation of 3 of the 7 measures:\n\n## Solvency II Return on Equity (Solvency II RoE)\n\nThe Solvency II RoE calculation basis will move to a total capital basis, rather than a target 180% basis. This will simplify the calculation methodology whilst continuing to provide a clear incentive for management to actively deploy excess capital. We continue to report and monitor target capital basis for in-flight LTIPs.\n\n## Relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)\n\nConsistent with prior years, we continue to review the comparator group for rTSR purposes. To ensure the group represents our geographic footprint and those companies we compete with directly, we will remove AXA, Allianz and Zurich.\n\nOur current approach provides for 20% of award value vesting when threshold performance is achieved. Market practice is mixed, with threshold vesting being set at 25% in many cases, and numerous recent examples of companies increasing their threshold vesting level. However, the Committee concluded that, aligned with our view that incentive arrangements should drive and reward strong performance, it was not appropriate to propose a change to our approach in this regard. We are though, proposing a small change to the operation of the rTSR element of the LTIP such that maximum vesting will be triggered by upper quartile performance, rather than upper quintile performance. This approach will ensure we incentivise and reward strong performance, bringing us more into line with market practice and improving the overall competitiveness of the LTIP's operation.\n\n## Customer - Relationship Net Promoter Score (RNPS)\n\nReflecting our strategy being centred around our customers, a customer measure with a 7.5% weighting, will be retained. In place of a standalone RNPS measure, we will introduce a Customer Scorecard that better reflects our strategic ambitions to grow our customer franchise and serve more customer needs. The measures within the scorecard will be simple in design and operation, more aligned to growth, and easier for stakeholders to understand and scrutinise. The measures will not overlap with the customer measures within the ABP, which are shorter term measures focused on the active management of customer experience and continue to work well.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for 2023\n\nOur remuneration outcomes reflect the continued strong performance of Aviva in 2023, as set out below.\n\n## 2023 annual bonus\n\nThe formulaic outcome from the annual bonus scorecard was 70.6% of maximum (at 141.1%). The Committee carefully considered this outcome in the context of broader performance and a quality of earnings assessment, noting input from the Audit and Risk Committees, to ensure the scorecard outcome was reflective of overall performance and aligned with the experience of shareholders. The Committee determined that no adjustments were required to the formulaic bonus scorecard outcome.\n\nIn line with the Policy the Committee also considered the individual performance of the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to determine whether individual adjustments to the scorecard outcome were required.\n\nAmanda Blanc's performance as Group CEO continues to be exceptional. Successful progression of the strategy, which Amanda set out, has resulted in Aviva pivoting to capital-light and outperforming the competition in the growth of General Insurance, Workplace, Protection and Health, alongside strategic bolt-on acquisitions. Our strategy continues to engage colleagues at record levels.\n\nThroughout the year Amanda has also continued to strengthen the senior leadership team including three ExCo appointments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom an external perspective, Amanda has continued to enhance Aviva's profile across multiple industry and public forums such as the Prime Minister's Business Council and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) Board.\n\nThis performance is reflected in Amanda's annual bonus for 2023 of 88.1% of maximum (at 176.1% of salary).\n\nCharlotte Jones has demonstrated strong performance in 2023, driving the effective performance management processes across the Group that support the delivery of our financial results. Maintaining our balance sheet strength and effective capital management has enabled investment for growth and efficiency as well as delivery of regular and sustainable capital returns. Charlotte has successfully executed M&A activity and led the delivery of the transition to IFRS 17. The \u00a3300 million share buyback has been effectively executed and Charlotte has led extensive market, investor and analyst engagement. Internally, Charlotte has strengthened her leadership team and re-shaped our approach to transformation activity.\n\nCharlotte's annual bonus for 2023 was 85.4% of maximum (at 128.1% of salary).\n\n## 2021-23 LTIP\n\nThe formulaic vesting outcome was 91.8%, reflecting very strong performance against the Solvency II RoE target and maximum vesting of the rTSR element (performance exceeding upper quintile of the peer group).",

Charlotte will receive a salary increase of 3.9%.\n\nThe percentage increases for our EDs are below the overall increase in the UK salary budget of 6%.\n\n## 2024 Annual Bonus and 2024-26 LTIP\n\nFor Amanda and Charlotte, the opportunities are unchanged from the awards made for the prior year.\n\n|           | Annual bonus        | Annual bonus         | Annual bonus      |\n|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n|           | Target  opportunity | Maximum  opportunity | LTIP  opportunity |\n| Group CEO | 100%                | 200%                 | 350%              |\n| Group CFO | 100%                | 150%                 | 225%              |\n\nOpportunities are in line with the Policy.\n\n## 2024 focus areas\n\nThe Committee will continue to focus on ensuring that remuneration fairly rewards, and is aligned with, business performance, particularly in the context of the changes being made to incentive measures following the review of the Policy.\n\nIn addition we will ensure that the broader colleague reward proposition remains competitive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe have again delivered very strong results in a challenging and volatile economic environment, demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business. As a Committee, we have sought to make decisions which effectively drive and reward results, while continuing to align with UK best practice remuneration and governance expectations. I hope that this report is clear and informative and I look forward to seeing shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Pippa Lambert\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n6 March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

If approved, it will apply immediately, for up to three years.\n\nThe key changes between this Policy and the current Policy as approved at the 2021 AGM are detailed below and noted in the tables that follow:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual bonus - The current Policy requires two-thirds of any bonus award to be deferred. To better align with market practice and ensure our approach remains competitive and fair, we are proposing to reduce the level of deferral to 50%.\n- \u00b7 NED benefits - The proposed policy allows flexibility to introduce health assessments for our NEDs. This change follows broader wellbeing improvements that we have made for our wider workforce in the UK.\n\n## Alignment of Group strategy with executive remuneration\n\nThe Committee considers that alignment between Group strategy and ED remuneration is critical. The Policy provides market competitive remuneration, and incentivises EDs to achieve the annual business plan and the longer-term strategic objectives of the Group. Significant levels of deferral, and within and post-employment shareholding requirements, align EDs' interests with those of shareholders and aid retention of key personnel. As well as rewarding the achievement of objectives, variable remuneration can be zero if performance thresholds are not met. Remuneration payments to Directors can only be made if they are consistent with the approved Policy.\n\nTable 1 provides an overview of the Policy for EDs. The Policy for NEDs is in table 3.\n\nTable 1 Key aspects of the Policy for Executive Directors Element\n\n<!-- image -->",

Achievement against individual strategic objectives is also taken into account.\n\nLTIP performance measures are chosen to provide an indication of both absolute and relative return generated for shareholders. In terms of target setting, a number of reference points are taken into account each year including, but not limited to, the Group's business plan and external market expectations of the Company. Maximum payouts require performance that significantly exceeds expected performance under both the annual bonus and the LTIP.\n\n## Quality of earnings assessments\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee engages in a regular quality of earnings assessment. A quality of earnings assessment sign-off is the final step in determining annual bonus scorecard outcomes, and is performed before vesting is determined against financial measures under the LTIP.\n\nAs a minimum, at any Committee meeting where LTIP vesting or annual bonus scorecard decisions are considered, the Financial Controller or equivalent prepares a report to the Committee on the quality of earnings reflected in the results being assessed, against performance targets. Extensive information from the audited accounts is used to explain the vesting and scorecard outcomes - ranging from movements in reserves, capital management decisions, consistency of accounting treatment and period to period comparability. The Financial Controller or equivalent attends the Committee meeting to answer any questions that any member of the Committee may choose to ask. Any vesting decision or confirmation of awards is made after this process has been undertaken.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nThe circumstances when malus (the forfeiture or reduction of unvested shares awarded under the ABP and LTIP) and clawback (the recovery of cash and share awards after release) may apply include (but are not limited to) where the Committee considers that the employee concerned has been involved in or partially/wholly responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 A materially adverse misstatement (as defined by the Board) of the Company's financial statements, or a misleading representation of performance;\n- \u00b7 A significant failure of risk management and/or controls;\n- \u00b7 A scenario or event which causes material reputational damage to the Company;\n- \u00b7 A scenario or event which causes material corporate failure;\n- \u00b7 Any regulatory investigation or breach of laws, rules or codes of conduct;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Misconduct which, in the opinion of the Committee, ought to result in the complete or partial lapse of an award;\n- \u00b7 Conduct which resulted in significant loss(es) or summary termination of employment;\n- \u00b7 Failure to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety;\n- \u00b7 A material error (as defined by the Board) in the calculation of a financial or strategic measure used to determine the outcome of variable pay, or any other error or material misstatement that results in overpayment to employees;\n- \u00b7 Any circumstances determined by the Board that mean the underlying financial health of the Group or member of the Group has significantly deteriorated, resulting in severe financial constraints which preclude or limit the ability to fund variable pay; and\n- \u00b7 Any other circumstance required by local regulatory obligations or that, in the Board's opinion, justifies the reduction or repayment of variable pay.\n\nThe clawback period runs for two years from the date of payment in the case of the cash element of any annual bonus award.\n\nFor deferred bonus elements and LTIP awards, the overall malus and clawback period is five years from the date of grant.\n\n## Discretions\n\nThe discretions the Committee has in relation to the operation of the ABP and LTIP are set out in the plan rules. In relation to the outcomes under these plans, the Committee has unfettered discretion to adjust upward or downward (including to nil) the mechanical outcome where it considers that:\n\n- \u00b7 The outcome does not reflect the underlying financial or strategic performance of the participant or the Group over the relevant period;\n- \u00b7 The outcome is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at the award date;\n- \u00b7 There exists any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate; and/or\n- \u00b7 It is appropriate to do so, taking into account a range of factors, including the management of risk and good governance and, in all cases, the experience of shareholders.",

Such discretions would only be applied in exceptional circumstances, to ensure that awards properly reflect underlying business performance. Any use of the discretions and how they were exercised will be disclosed, where relevant, in the DRR and, where appropriate, be subject to consultation with Aviva's shareholders.\n\n## Change in control\n\nIn the event of a change in control, unless a new award is granted in exchange for an existing award, or if there is a significant corporate event like a demerger, awards under the LTIP would normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied as at the date of the change in control, and unless the Committee decides otherwise, would be pro-rated to reflect the time between the date of grant and the change in control event. Awards under the ABP would normally vest on the date of the change in control and may vest if there is a significant corporate event.\n\n## Consistency of executive Policy across the Group\n\nThe Policy for our EDs is designed as part of the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group. Remuneration arrangements for colleagues below the EDs take account of the seniority and nature of the role, individual performance and local market practice. The components and levels of remuneration for different colleagues may therefore differ from the Policy for EDs.\n\nAny such elements are reviewed against market practice and approved in line with internal guidelines and frameworks.\n\nDifferentiation in reward outcomes based on performance and behaviour that is consistent with the Aviva values is a feature of how Aviva operates its annual bonus plan for its senior leaders and managers globally.\n\nA disciplined approach is taken to moderation across the Company in order to recognise and reward the key contributors. The allocation of LTIP awards also involves strong differentiation, with expected contribution and ability to collaborate effectively in implementation of the strategy driving award levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Legacy payments\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before May 2014 (the date the Company's first Policy came into effect), (ii) before the Policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the Policy in force at the time they were agreed, or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes, 'payments' includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Approach to recruitment remuneration\n\nOn hiring a new ED, the Committee would align the proposed remuneration package with the Policy in place for EDs at the time of the appointment.\n\nIn determining the actual remuneration for a new ED, the Committee would consider the package in totality, taking into account elements such as the skills and experience of the individual, local market benchmarks, remuneration practice, and the existing remuneration of other senior executives. The Committee would ensure any arrangements agreed would be in the best interests of Aviva and its shareholders. It would seek not to pay more than necessary to secure the right candidate.\n\nWhere considered appropriate the Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to 'buyout' remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee would take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which it was paid (e.g. cash or shares) and the timeframe of awards.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nBuyout awards would be awarded on a 'like for like' basis compared to remuneration being forfeited, and would be capped to reflect the value being forfeited. The Committee considers that a buyout award is a significant investment in human capital by Aviva, and any buyout decision will involve careful consideration of the contribution that is expected from the individual.\n\nThe maximum level of variable pay which could be awarded to a new ED, excluding any buyouts, would be in line with the Policy set out above and would therefore be no more than 550% of basic salary for the Group CEO (200% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant) and 500% of basic salary for other EDs (150% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant).\n\nAll other elements of remuneration will also be in line with the Policy set out above.\n\nShould the Company have any prior commitments outside of this Policy in respect of an employee promoted internally to an ED position, the Committee may continue to honour these for a period of time. Where an ED is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an ED is appointed following Aviva's acquisition of, or merger with, another company, legacy terms and conditions may be honoured.\n\nOn appointing a new NED, the Committee would align the remuneration package with the Policy for NEDs, outlined in table 3, including fees and travel benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee has the ability to exercise its discretion on the final amount actually paid. Any compensation would be based on basic salary, pension entitlement and other contractual benefits during the notice period, or a payment made in lieu of notice, depending on whether the notice is worked.\n\nWhere notice of termination of a contract is given, payments to the ED would continue for the period worked during the notice period. Alternatively, the contract may be terminated, and phased monthly payments made in lieu of notice for, or for the balance of, the 12 months' notice period. During this period, EDs would be expected to mitigate their loss by seeking alternative employment. Payments in lieu of notice would be reduced by the salary received from any alternative employment, potentially to zero. The Company would typically make a reasonable contribution towards an ED's legal fees in connection with advice on the terms of their departure.\n\nThere is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus for the year in which loss of office occurs. The Committee may determine that an ED may receive a pro rata bonus in respect of the period of employment during the year loss of office occurs based on an assessment of performance. Where an ED leaves the Company by reason of death, disability or ill health, or any other reason determined by the Committee, there may be a payment of a pro rata bonus for the relevant year at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nThe treatment of leavers under the ABP and LTIP is determined by the rules of the relevant plans. Good leaver status under these plans would be granted in the event of, for example, the death of an ED. Good leaver status for other leaving reasons is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individual's departure, but would typically include planned retirement, or their departure on ill health grounds.\n\nIn circumstances where good leaver status has been granted, awards may still be subject to malus and clawback in the event that inappropriate conduct of the ED is subsequently discovered post departure, and retirees are subject to post-activity restrictions which allow the Committee to reduce or recover awards if certain employment is taken elsewhere. If good leaver status is not granted, all outstanding awards will lapse.\n\nIn the case of LTIP awards, where the Committee determines an ED to be a good leaver, vesting is normally based on the extent to which performance conditions have been met at the end of the relevant performance period, and the proportion of the award that vests is pro-rated for the time from the date of grant to final date of service (unless the Committee decides otherwise). Any decision not to apply this would only be made in exceptional circumstances and would be fully disclosed. It is not the practice to allow such treatment.",

We consulted with major shareholders and their representatives during 2023 in preparation for presenting our Policy to shareholders at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Our colleagues\n\nThe Committee has sight of colleague views through the colleague engagement survey (Voice of Aviva), input from the People function during Committee meetings, colleague forums and the Evolution Council, chaired by the Board Chair. Specifically for the last two channels:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee Chair met with Your Forum (a fully elected employee forum representing UK colleagues) and members of Unite the Union in April 2023. Discussion included matters of interest to colleagues and members covering areas such as Smart Working, Recruitment and Retention, the Company's ongoing response to the cost of living challenges as well as our sustainability goals and strategy for the future.\n- \u00b7 The Evolution Council consists of a diverse group of high calibre leaders from across the business who discuss a range of topics related to the Group strategy, values, culture and performance.\n\nWhen determining the Policy and arrangements for EDs, the Committee also reviews:\n\n- \u00b7 Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure reward structures are suitably aligned and that levels of remuneration remain appropriate, as set out below table 16. Other considerations include:\n- -Changes in remuneration (salary, benefits and bonus) of UK colleagues compared with that of directors (see table 12).\n- -The ratio of CEO pay to that of colleagues (see tables 15 and 16).\n- -Gender and ethnicity pay gaps. We released our UK Pay Gap Report 2023 in February 2024. This was the seventh year that we published our gender pay gap and the second time we published our ethnicity pay gap. The report also included details of actions we are taking to drive change and close the gap. The report can be found at www.aviva.com/about-us/uk-pay-gap-report.\n- -Any material changes to benefit and pension provision for colleagues more widely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Single total figures of remuneration for 2023\n\nThe table below sets out the total remuneration for 2023 and 2022 for each of our EDs.\n\nTable 5 Total 2023 remuneration - Executive Directors (audited information)\n\n|                    | Executive Directors   | Executive Directors   | Executive Directors   | Executive Directors   | Executive Directors                     | Executive Directors                     |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                    | Amanda Blanc          | Amanda Blanc          | Charlotte Jones 6     | Charlotte Jones 6     | Total emoluments of Executive Directors | Total emoluments of Executive Directors |\n|                    | 2023                  | 2022                  | 2023                  | 2022                  | 2023                                    | 2022                                    |\n|                    | \u00a3000                  | \u00a3000                  | \u00a3000                  | \u00a3000                  | \u00a3000                                    | \u00a3000                                    |\n| Basic salary 1     | 1,068                 | 1,023                 | 699                   | 220                   | 1,767                                   | 1,242                                   |\n| Benefits 2         | 48                    | 59                    | 18                    | 2                     | 66                                      | 61                                      |\n| Pension 3          | 131                   | 125                   | 86                    | 27                    | 217                                     | 152                                     |\n| Total fixed pay    | 1,247                 | 1,206                 | 804                   | 249                   | 2,051                                   | 1,455                                   |\n| Annual bonus 4     | 1,902                 | 2,001                 | 906                   | 283                   | 2,808                                   | 2,284                                   |\n| LTIP 5             | 3,479                 | 2,242                 | -                     | -                     | 3,479                                   | 2,242                                   |\n| Total variable pay | 5,381                 | 4,243                 | 906                   | 283                   | 6,287                                   | 4,526                                   |\n| Total 7            | 6,628                 | 5,449                 | 1,710                 | 532                   | 8,338                                   | 5,981                                   |",

The Group CEO and CFO are based in the UK (albeit with global responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.\n\nTable 12 Percentage change in remuneration of the directors\n\n|                          | 2022-23     | 2022-23   | 2022-23   | 2021-22     | 2021-22   | 2021-22      | 2020-21     | 2020-21   | 2020-21      | 2020-21     | 2019-20   | 2019-20   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                          | Salary/Fees | Bonus     | Benefits  | Salary/Fees | Bonus     | Benefits 7,8 | Salary/Fees | Bonus     | Benefits 7,8 | Salary/Fees | Bonus     | Benefits  |\n| Group CEO\u00b9               |             |           |           |             |           |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| Amanda Blanc             | 4.4%        | (5.0) %   | (18.3) %  | 2.3%        | 13.3%     | (51.4) %     | 0.0 %       | 47.2 %    | (23.9) %     | -           | -         | -         |\n| Group CFO\u00b9               |             |           |           |             |           |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| Charlotte Jones          | 3.6%        | 3.5%      | 141.1%    | -           | -         |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| Chair\u00b9                   |             |           |           |             |           |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| George Culmer            | 0.0%        | -         | 6.0%      | 0.0%        | -         | 74.8%        | 0.0%        | -         | 57.7%        | 263.6%      | -         | (26.3) %  |\n| NEDs                     |             |           |           |             |           |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| Andrea Blance 3          | 0.0%        | -         | 86.3%     | -           |           |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| Mike Craston 3           | 4.5%        | -         | (26.4) %  | -           |           |              |             |           |              |             |           |           |\n| Patrick Flynn 1,2        | 0.0%        | -         | (9.6) %   | 0.0%        | -         | 1433.4%      | 5.0%        | -         | (75.0) %     | 44.8%       | -         | (39.4) %  |\n| Shonaid Jemmett-Page 1,4 | 9.2%        | -         | 141.8%    | 83.0%       | -         | -            | -           | -         | -            | -           | -         | -         |\n| Mohit Joshi              | 0.0%        | -         | 130.4%    | 0.0%        | -         | 69.8%        | -           | -         | -            | -           | -         | -         |\n| Pippa Lambert 1          | 0.0%        | -         | 90.8%     | 17.0%       | -         | 350.7%       | -           | -         | -            | -           | -         | -         |\n| Jim McConville 5         | 15.0%       | -         | (16.5) %  | 55.3%       | -         | 4997.8%      | -           | -         | -            | -           | -         | -         |\n| Michael Mire 6           | (19.7) %    | -         | 57.8%     | (7.8) %     | -         | 484.0%       | 4.9%        | -         | 10.5%        | 9.6%        | - %       | (82.8) %  |\n| Martin Strobel 1         | 31.6%       | -         | (51.6) %  | 67.2%       | -         | -            | -           | -         | -            | -           | -         | -         |\n| All UK-based employees   | 9.5%        | 9.5%      | 2.4%      | 6.5%        | 2.1%      | (14.2) %     | 3.8%        | 47.4%     | 34.8%        | 3.3%        | 0.5%      | 10.7%     |\n\n- 1.

Jim McConville stood down as Chair of the Customer and Sustainability Committee, remaining a member, on 17 May 2022. He joined the Remuneration Committee on 1 February 2023.\n- 6. Michael Mire stood down from the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee on 14 September 2022\n- 7. The increase in taxable benefits for UK based employees in 2021, and subsequent decrease in 2022 has been mainly driven by the one-off recognition in 2021 of colleagues for their hard work during the pandemic. The taxable benefits also increased in 2021 due to the increase in the cost of private medical insurance. Without these items, benefits would have increased by 8.4 % in 2021 reflecting greater use of our online recognition platform.\n- 8. The increase in benefits for NEDs in 2022 compared to 2021 is largely reflective of the return of taxable travel and subsistence costs after the pandemic. The reduction in benefits in 2021 compared to 2020 is largely reflective of reduced taxable travel and subsistence costs due to the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under this approach we calculate total remuneration on a full-time equivalent basis for all of our UK employees and rank them accordingly.\n\nThe increase in the 2023 ratio reflects the first full year LTIP vesting since Amanda became Group CEO. 2022 reflects a pro-rata LTIP vesting, as well as 10% reduction for windfall gains, and 2021 reflected no LTIP vesting. Executive Directors receive a greater proportion of their remuneration in elements tied to performance, including participation in the LTIP. This means that the pay ratio will vary in large part due to incentive outcomes each year.\n\nAlthough the CEO pay ratio has increased, the total remuneration for each quartile employee has also increased. This reflects the measures taken by Aviva to support our colleagues through the rising cost of living.\n\nTable 16 provides further information on the total remuneration figure for each quartile employee, and the salary component within this.\n\n|   Year | Pay element        | P25  (lower quartile)   | P50  (median)   | P75  (upper quartile)   |\n|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n|   2023 | Salary             | \u00a326,648                 | \u00a337,276         | \u00a360,042                 |\n|   2023 | Total remuneration | \u00a332,590                 | \u00a345,822         | \u00a375,262                 |\n\nIn reviewing the employee pay data, the Committee is comfortable that the P25, P50 and P75 individuals identified appropriately reflect the employee pay profile at those quartiles, and that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees.\n\nAt Aviva, we are equally focused on our colleagues as we are on our customers. We recognise the individual needs of colleagues and we are proud of the reward, benefits and overall career packages that we offer our colleagues:\n\n- \u00b7 In the UK, we have been an accredited Real Living Wage employer since April 2014 and a Real Living Hours employer since October 2020. Our salaries are at least 8% above Real Living Wage to allow colleagues to save for their retirement and benefit from an employer pension contribution up to 14% whilst still earning the Real Living Wage.\n- \u00b7 In addition, in March 2023, Aviva was one of the first UK employers to be awarded the Living Pension accreditation. This signifies that we provide a Living Pension savings level which equates to 12% of a full-time real Living Wage salary, of which at least 7% comes from Aviva as an employer. We have been at the forefront of campaigning to drive proposals to abolish auto-enrolment contribution thresholds to enable more people to save into a pension for their retirement.\n- \u00b7 We have a structured salary progression scheme for our frontline colleagues, providing salary increases to recognise colleagues as they develop and gain experience.\n- \u00b7 We conduct regular market reviews of our salary ranges in order to maintain competitiveness to market rates, and we move everyone who is below a band to at least the minimum of that range each year.\n- \u00b7 Our comprehensive, flexible benefits offering provides colleagues with the opportunity to select the benefits that matter most to them, and our range of inclusive colleague policies support life's big moments, including equal parental leave.\n- \u00b7 UK colleagues are eligible to participate in our SAYE and All Employee Share Ownership Plan (AESOP) offerings with similar plans operating for many of our overseas colleagues. We are proud of the participation rates in these plans, with over 60% participating in the SAYE and over 70% in the AESOP, meaning colleagues both share in Aviva's success and benefit from tax-efficient savings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this manner, the Committee is able to retain oversight of the shares and is comfortable that this provides the ability to enforce the post-cessation guidelines in practice and helps with the enforcement of malus and clawback.\n\n## Table 18 Executive Directors - share ownership requirement (audited information)\n\n|                      |                   |                                                    | Shares held                                      | Options held                                   | Options held               |                                          |                                      |                  |\n|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Executive  Directors | Owned  outright 1 | Unvested and  subject to  performance conditions 2 | Unvested and  subject to  continued employment 3 | Unvested and  subject to  continued employment | Vested  but not  exercised | Shareholding  requirement  (% of salary) | Current shareholding 4 (% of salary) | Requirement  met |\n| Amanda  Blanc        | 785,722           | 2,466,382                                          | 702,944                                          | -                                              | -                          | 300%                                     | 316%                                 | Yes              |\n| Charlotte  Jones     | 12,957            | 729,588                                            | 46,115                                           | -                                              | -                          | 225%                                     | 8%                                   | No               |\n\nThere were no changes to the EDs interests in Aviva shares during the period 1 January 2024 to 6 March 2024.\n\n|                      | 1 January 2023   | 31 December 2023   |\n|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| George Culmer        | 99,500           | 210,175            |\n| Andrea Blance        | 15,000           | 15,000             |\n| Mike Craston         | 30,771           | 30,771             |\n| Patrick Flynn        | 7,600            | 7,600              |\n| Shonaid Jemmett-Page | 4,565            | 10,490             |\n| Mohit Joshi          | 5,789            | 65,089             |\n| Pippa Lambert        | 6,985            | 12,739             |\n| Jim McConville       | 14,186           | 14,186             |\n| Michael Mire         | 38,000           | 38,000             |\n| Martin Strobel       | 30,400           | 30,400             |\n\nThere were no changes to the NEDs interests in Aviva shares during the period 1 January 2024 to 6 March 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

EDs are eligible to participate in the Company's broad-based employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees. Details of awards granted to EDs under these plans are also included in tables 5, 9 and 18.\n\nMore information around HMRC tax-advantaged plans can also be found in note 33. EDs are restricted from entering into any form of hedging arrangement or remuneration and liability-related insurance policies which might undermine the risk alignment features of share awards (such as delivery in shares, performance conditions, malus and clawback provisions).\n\nTable 20 LTIP, ABP and options over Aviva shares (audited information)\n\n|                          | At 1 January 2023  (number)   | Options/awards granted during year 1 (number)   | Options/awards  exercised/vesting  during year 2 (number)   | Options/awards  lapsing during  year 3  (number)   | At 31 December  2023 (number)   | Market price at  date awards granted 4 (pence)   | SAYE exercise  price (options)  (pence)   | Market price at  date awards  vested/option  exercised (pence)   | Vesting date(s)/  exercise period(s) 5   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Amanda Blanc LTIP 6,7    |                               |                                                 |                                                             |                                                    |                                 |                                                  |                                           |                                                                  |                                          |\n| 2020                     | 641,921                       | -

SAYE options have historically been satisfied primarily through new issue shares. In future, all awards granted under Aviva employee share plans, including SAYE options will be satisfied primarily through shares purchased in the market. Shares are held in employee trusts, details of which are set out in note 34.\n\nThe Company monitors the number of shares issued under the Aviva employee share plans and their impact on dilution limits. The Company's usage of shares compared to the relevant dilution limits set by the Investment Association in respect of all share plans (10% in any rolling ten-year period) and executive share plans (5% in any rolling ten-year period) was 4.91% and 2.28% respectively on 31 December 2023.\n\n## Governance Regulatory Remuneration Code\n\nAviva Investors Global Services Limited (AIGSL) and a number of small 'firms' (as defined by the FCA) within the IWR Insurance business are subject to the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II).\n\nAviva Investors UK Funds Services Ltd and Aviva Investors Luxembourg are subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Management Directive (AIFMD) and the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS V) directive.\n\nRemuneration Code requirements include an annual disclosure. For AIFMD and UCITS V the disclosure is part of the Financial Statements and/or Annual accounts of the Alternative Investment Funds or UCITS. For IFPR the 2023 AIGSL disclosure will be found, when published, at https://www.aviva.com/investors/regulatory-returns/ along with the disclosure for the UK Insurance firms.\n\n## Solvency II remuneration\n\nRemuneration Requirements (PRA PS22/16 & SS10/16) apply to the Aviva Group. Our remuneration structures have been designed in a way that is compliant with these requirements for all senior managers across the Group, not just those identified as being specifically covered by the requirements of the regulation. Such employees at Aviva are termed 'Covered Employees'. We are required to complete a Remuneration Policy Statement, which outlines how we have complied with each of the requirements. This document is approved annually by the Group Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Solvency II reporting requirements for the year ended 31 December 2023 necessitate firms to produce the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) which contains remuneration information and is publicly available. Aviva's reward principles and arrangements are designed to incentivise and reward employees for achieving stated business goals in a manner that is consistent with the Company's approach to sound and effective risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Statement of voting at AGM\n\nThe results of the shareholder votes at the Company's 2021 AGM in respect of the Policy and at the 2023 AGM in respect of the 2022 DRR are set out in the below table.

Before this, NED fees had not been increased since 1 July 2020. The committee chair and committee membership fees of the Customer and Sustainability and Remuneration Committees were increased to bring them into parity with the current fees of the Audit and Risk Committees, in recognition that the time commitment, breadth of remit and regulatory accountabilities for these roles are broadly comparable. Following the increase, the total base fees paid to NEDs remains within the current aggregate limit of \u00a32,000,000 per annum.\n\nA resolution will be put to the 2024 AGM which will seek approval to increase the aggregate NED fee limit to \u00a33,000,000 per annum. The limit has not been increased since 2012 and the increase will bring the limit in line with other large financial services groups.\n\nTable 22 Non-Executive Directors' fees\n\n| Role                                                     | Fee from  1 April  2024   | Fee from  1 January  2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Board Chair 1                                            | \u00a3550,000                  | \u00a3550,000                    |\n| Board membership                                         | \u00a375,000                   | \u00a375,000                     |\n| Additional fees are paid as follows:                     |                           |                             |\n| Senior Independent Director                              | \u00a335,000                   | \u00a335,000                     |\n| Committee Chair (inclusive of committee membership fee): |                           |                             |\n| Audit                                                    | \u00a355,000                   | \u00a355,000                     |\n| Risk                                                     | \u00a355,000                   | \u00a355,000                     |\n| Customer and Sustainability                              | \u00a355,000                   | \u00a345,000                     |\n| Remuneration                                             | \u00a355,000                   | \u00a345,000                     |\n| Committee membership:                                    |                           |                             |\n| Nomination and Governance                                | \u00a310,000                   | \u00a310,000                     |\n| Audit                                                    | \u00a320,000                   | \u00a320,000                     |\n| Risk                                                     | \u00a320,000                   | \u00a320,000                     |\n| Customer and Sustainability                              | \u00a320,000                   | \u00a315,000                     |\n| Remuneration                                             | \u00a320,000                   | \u00a315,000                     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company.\n\n## Restrictions on transfer of securities or voting rights\n\nWith the exception of restrictions under the Company's employee share incentive plans, where the shares are subject to the plan rules, there are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the Company's ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares under employee share schemes\n\nWhere, under an employee share incentive plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised at the discretion of the participants.\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, shareholders renewed the Company's authorities to make market purchases of up to 280 million ordinary shares, up to 100 million preference shares of 8\u00be% each and up to 100 million preference shares of 8 \u215c % each. No shares have been purchased under this authority.\n\nAt the 2024 AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew the authorities to buy the Company's shares for another year and the resolution in relation to the ordinary shares will once again propose a maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which the Company can purchase of less than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital. Details will be contained in the Notice due to be published at the end of March 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are no agreements with employees or directors for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. However, all of the Company's employee share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control.

Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and parent financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nUnder UK company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss for that period.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make reasonable and prudent judgements and accounting estimates;\n- \u00b7 state where applicable the directors have prepared the Group and Company's financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards; and\n\n- \u00b7 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Company, enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe directors are responsible for making, and continuing to make, the Company's Annual Report and Accounts available on the Company's website. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Directors' confirmations\n\nThe directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nEach of the current directors whose names and functions are detailed in the Our Board of Directors section confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group and Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 the Strategic report, Governance section and the Directors' report in this Annual Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\nIn the case of each director in office at the date the Directors' report is approved:\n\n- \u00b7 so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's external auditor, PwC, is unaware; and\n- \u00b7 each director has taken all steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that PwC is aware of that information.\n\nBy order of the Board on 6 March 2024.\n\nAmanda Blanc DBE Group Chief Executive Officer",

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided.\n\nOther than those disclosed in Note 13, we have provided no non-audit services to the Company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Context\n\nAs part of this opinion we have also provided information on how we approached the audit, including the impact of the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standard 17 - Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17) by the Group.\n\n## Overview\n\nAudit scope\n\n- \u00b7 Our audit scope has been determined to provide coverage of all material financial statement line items; and\n- \u00b7 In designing our audit, we have considered the impacts that climate change could have on the Group, including the physical or transitional risks which could arise. In particular, we have assessed the impacts on reporting of the commitments related to climate change which the Group has made.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 Adoption of IFRS 17 and restatement of comparatives (Group)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of life risk and life participating insurance contract liabilities (Group)\n- \u00b7 Annuitant mortality assumptions (Group)\n- \u00b7 Credit default assumptions for illiquid assets (commercial mortgages, equity release mortgages) and corporate bonds (Group)\n- \u00b7 Expense assumptions (Group)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of the life risk and life participating risk adjustment (Group)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of the life risk and life participating insurance contractual service margin ('CSM') (Group)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of general insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets (Group)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of hard to value investments (Group)\n- \u00b7 Valuation of investments in subsidiaries (Company)\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 Overall Group materiality: \u00a3142,000,000 based on 1% of equity attributable to shareholders of Aviva plc, plus CSM net of tax.\n- \u00b7 Overall Company materiality: \u00a375,271,000 based on 0.5% of total equity.\n- \u00b7 Performance materiality: \u00a3106,500,000 (Group) and \u00a356,453,250 (Company).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nThis year there are three new key audit matters:\n\n- \u00b7 Adoption of IFRS 17 and restatement of comparatives (Group);\n- \u00b7 Valuation of the life risk and life participating risk adjustment (Group); and\n- \u00b7 Valuation of the life risk and life participating CSM (Group).\n\nThe key audit matters 'Valuation of life risk and life participating insurance contract liabilities (Group)' (previously 'Valuation of life insurance liabilities (Group)') and the \"Valuation of general insurance and reinsurance contract liabilities (Group)' (previously 'Valuation of general insurance liabilities (Group)') have been updated this year to reflect the impacts from the adoption of IFRS 17. This new standard changes the way in which life risk, life participating and general insurance contract liabilities are measured, introduces new concepts and language, and changes a range of judgements that insurers must make.\n\nDisclosure of the impact of adopting IFRS 17, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because this was a risk relevant to a specific disclosure made in the prior year financial statements. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Small changes to these assumptions can result in material impacts to the valuation of the fulfilment cash flows, CSM and risk adjustment.\n\nOur assessment of the related audit risks is focused in the following three areas:\n\n- 1. The significant assumptions that involve high levels of judgement in determining the best estimate liabilities, in particular the following assumptions:\n- a) the mortality assumptions used in the valuation of annuity business life risk insurance contracts ('annuitant mortality');\n- b) credit default assumptions for illiquid assets (commercial mortgages, equity release mortgages) and corporate bonds for life risk insurance contracts; and\n- c) expense assumptions for life risk and participating investment contracts.\n- 2. The methodology and judgement involved in determining the valuation of the risk adjustment; and\n- 3. The methodology and assumptions used in determining the valuation of the life CSM.\n\nWe provide more detailed consideration of each of these assumptions, the valuation of the risk adjustment, and the valuation of the life CSM below.\n\nThe work to address the valuation of the life insurance liabilities included the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Understood and evaluated the process and the design and implementation of controls in place to determine the life risk and life participating insurance contract liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls in place over life risk and life participating insurance contract liabilities, including those covering the approval of assumptions, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used;\n- \u00b7 Using our actuarial specialist team members, applied industry knowledge and experience and compared the methodology, models and assumptions used against recognised actuarial practice. This included consideration of the reasonableness of assumptions against actual historical experience, and the appropriateness of any judgements applied, including if there was any indication of management bias;\n- \u00b7 Tested the key judgements over the preparation of the life risk and life participating insurance contract liabilities, including manual calculation of components focussing on the consistency in treatment and methodology year-on-year and with reference to recognised actuarial practice; and\n- \u00b7 Used the results of an independent PwC annual benchmarking survey of assumptions to further challenge the assumption setting process by comparing certain assumptions used relative to the Group's industry peers.\n\nFurther details on the specific procedures performed over each of the identified key assumptions are included in the below sections of our Key Audit Matters. Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the assumptions used for valuation of life risk and life participating insurance contract liabilities to be appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The differing factors which affect the assumptions are underlying mortality experience (in the portfolio), industry and management's views on the future rate of mortality improvements, and external factors arising from developments in the annuity market. COVID-19 has caused additional challenges in estimating long term mortality assumptions due to the uncertainty in more recent data which is reflected, for example, in management's exclusion of 2022 experience from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (\"CMI\") model 2022.\n\nThere are two main components to the annuitant mortality assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Mortality base assumption: this component is typically less subjective as it is derived using the external ('CMI') tables for individual annuities and Club Vita 3 ('CV3') tables for Bulk Purchase Annuities (\"BPA'), adjusted for internal experience. However, judgement is required in choosing the appropriate table and fitting Aviva's own experience to this table. In setting this assumption management adopted the latest CMI model (CMI 2022), opting to exclude the 2022 experience from the analysis and allow for a flat increase to the base table as well as including an anti-selection adjustment for certain pension annuities; and\n- \u00b7 Rate of mortality improvements: this component is more subjective given the uncertainty over how life expectancy will change in the future and the lack of available data to support judgements made in respect of this. In setting this assumption, management has adopted the latest CMI model (CMI 2022) and dataset, and updated the calibration of key parameters within the model.\n\nIn respect of the annuitant mortality assumptions, our work included the following on the judgements applied:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the methodology used by management to derive the assumptions with reference to relevant rules and actuarial guidance and by applying our industry knowledge and experience. This included evaluating management's approach to the adoption of the latest CMI model (CMI 2022) particularly around the appropriateness of excluding the 2022 experience from the analysis and including a flat increase to the base table;\n- \u00b7 Assessed the reasonableness of the base mortality assumptions. This included assessing any adjustments made by management in respect of experience impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the choice of antiselection assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Considered the reasonableness of mortality improvement assumptions, including those unchanged, such as the socio-economic group adjustments, following the move to the latest CMI model. We performed this by assessing the continued appropriateness of these elements of the mortality improvement basis against the impact arising from the change in the CMI model; and\n- \u00b7 Compared annuitant mortality assumptions selected by management against those that have been used by others in the market, based on our expert actuarial experience.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the assumptions used for annuitant mortality to be appropriate.",

UK Life has substantial holdings in asset classes with significant credit risk.\n\nFor illiquid assets, the underlying asset valuation requires a number of different assumptions. Internally developed models are then used to project the associated cash flows for the assets, using these assumptions, to calculate the asset value and associated credit risk.\n\nThere is a heightened risk that corporate bond credit default assumptions may not be appropriate given the ongoing heightened economic uncertainty and high inflation environment observed in the current year. We have consequently included this asset class within this key audit matter.\n\nThe calculated credit risk for illiquid assets and corporate bonds is converted into credit default assumptions for each asset type. These assumptions are then uplifted by a risk allowance to allow for unexpected credit losses and used, alongside credit default assumptions for other assets, in the calculation of the valuation interest rate used to value life insurance liabilities.\n\nIn respect of the credit default assumptions for illiquid assets, our work included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the methodology and the credit risk pricing models used by management to derive the assumptions for commercial and equity release mortgages. This included consideration of the relevant rules and actuarial guidance, such as the adoption of an appropriate risk allowance, and by applying our industry knowledge and experience; and\n- \u00b7 Validated the significant assumptions used by management by ensuring consistency with the assumptions used for the valuation of the illiquid assets and by considering any additional judgements applied, market observable data (to the extent available and relevant) and our experience of market practice.\n\nIn respect of the credit default assumptions for corporate bonds, our work included performing the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the appropriateness of the methodology used by management. This included consideration of the relevant rules and actuarial guidance, such as the adoption of an appropriate risk allowance, and by applying our industry knowledge and experience; and\n- \u00b7 Assessed the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the calculation of the credit default assumption, with a focus on recent market volatility.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the assumptions used for credit default risk on commercial mortgages, equity release mortgages and corporate bonds to be appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our role as Group auditors, we exercised oversight of the work performed by auditors of the components including performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Issued Group instructions outlining areas requiring additional audit focus, including the key audit matters above;\n- \u00b7 Maintained an active dialogue with reporting component audit teams throughout the year;\n- \u00b7 Attended meetings with local management;\n- \u00b7 Reviewed reporting requested from component teams, including those areas determined to be of heightened audit risk; and\n- \u00b7 Met with all full scope components and reviewed the detailed working papers, where relevant .\n\n## The impact of climate risk on our audit\n\nWe have made enquiries of management (both within and outside of the Group's finance functions) in order to understand the extent of the impact of climate change risks and the commitments made by the Group on the Group's financial statements. As part of this, we reviewed the Group's climate reporting framework, and have also made enquiries to understand, and performed a risk assessment in respect of, the commitments made by the Group and how these may affect the financial statements and the audit procedures that we perform. We have assessed the risks of material misstatement to the financial statements as a result of climate change and concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2023, the main audit risks are related to consistency of disclosures included within the Annual Report and 'other information' including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (\"TCFD\") report. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that there was no impact on our key audit matters.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                  | Financial statements - Group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Financial statements - Company                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall materiality              | \u00a3142,000,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00a375,271,000.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| How we determined it             | 1% of equity attributable to shareholders of Aviva plc, plus  CSM net of tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 0.5% of total equity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Rationale for  benchmark applied | In determining our materiality, we considered financial  metrics which we believed to be relevant and concluded that  equity attributable to shareholders of Aviva plc, plus CSM net  of tax was the most appropriate benchmark.

The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u00a330,000,000 and \u00a3129,000,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to \u00a3106,500,000 for the Group financial statements and \u00a356,453,250 for the Company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a37,100,000 (Group audit) and \u00a33,763,550 (Company audit) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining the directors' going concern assessment and challenging the rationale for the downside scenarios adopted and material assumptions made using our knowledge of Aviva's business performance, review of regulatory correspondence and obtaining further corroborating evidence;\n- \u00b7 Considering the directors' assessment of the regulatory solvency coverage and liquidity position in the forward looking scenarios considered, which have been derived from Aviva's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (\"ORSA\");\n- \u00b7 Considering information obtained during the course of the audit and publicly available market information to identify any evidence that would contradict the directors' assessment of going concern; and\n- \u00b7 Enquiring and understanding the actions taken by the directors to mitigate the risks arising from the impacts of economic uncertainty, including review of Board Risk Committee minutes and attendance of all Audit Committees.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the directors' reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic Report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic Report and Directors' report\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors' report.",

Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- \u00b7 The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and Company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the Company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.\n\n## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of UK and European regulatory principles, such as those governed by the Prudential Regulation Authority (\"PRA\"), the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") and the UK tax authorities, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to management bias in accounting estimates and judgmental areas of the financial statements as shown in our 'Key Audit Matters'. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- \u00b7 Discussions with the Board of Directors, management, internal audit, senior management involved in the risk and compliance functions and the Group's and the Company's legal function, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;\n- \u00b7 Assessment of matters reported on the Group's and the Company's whistleblowing helpline and fraud register and the results of management's investigation of such matters;\n- \u00b7 Meeting with the PRA periodically and reading key correspondence with the PRA and the FCA, including those in relation to compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing relevant meeting minutes including those of the Board of Directors, Remuneration and Disclosure Committees;\n- \u00b7 Identifying and testing journal entries based on risk criteria;\n- \u00b7 Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of our testing;\n- \u00b7 Testing transactions entered into outside of the normal course of the Group's and the Company's business;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the Group's register of litigation and claims, internal audit reports, and compliance reports in so far as they related to non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud; and\n- \u00b7 Attendance at Audit and Risk Committee meetings.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\n## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 the Company financial statements and the part of the Annual report on remuneration to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nAviva plc (the 'Company'), a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group' or 'Aviva') transacts life assurance and long-term savings business, fund management and most classes of general insurance and health business through its subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches in the UK, Ireland, Canada, India, China and Singapore.\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (A) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and those of the Company have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, investment property, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are stated in pounds sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentational currency. Unless otherwise noted, the amounts shown in these financial statements are in millions of pounds sterling (\u00a3m).\n\nComparative figures have been restated following the implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as detailed in note 1.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been issued and endorsed by the UK and adopted by the Group or the Company\n\nThe Group has applied IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments retrospectively from 1 January 2023. As a result, the Group has restated certain comparative amounts. IFRS 17 significantly impacts the measurement and presentation of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (participating investment contracts). Adoption of IFRS 9 has had no impact on the measurement of the Group's financial instruments, but introduces new disclosure requirements. The nature and effects of the transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 are summarised in note 1, including the financial impacts on the statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022. The Group's revised accounting policies are set out in (B), (C), (H), (I), (M), (N), (O), (P), (T), (U), (W), (X), (Y), (AA) and (AF) below.\n\nIn addition, the Group and the Company has adopted the following amendments to standards which became effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 January 2023. The amendments do not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements or the Company's financial statements.\n\n- (i) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n- (ii) Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates\n- (iii) Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\n(iv) Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group or the Company\n\nThe following amendments to existing standards have been issued, are not yet effective for the Group and the Company, and have not been adopted early by the Group and the Company. None of the amendments are expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements or the Company's financial statements.\n\n## (i) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nPublished by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in January 2020. The amendments are effective for annual reporting beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and have been endorsed by the UK.\n\n- (ii) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Non-current Liabilities with Covenants Published by the IASB in October 2022. The amendments are effective for annual reporting beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and have been endorsed by the UK.\n\n## (iii) Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\n\nPublished by the IASB in September 2022. The amendments are effective for annual reporting beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and have been endorsed by the UK.\n\n## (iv) Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements\n\nPublished by the IASB in May 2023. The amendments are effective for annual reporting beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and have been endorsed by the UK.\n\n## (v) Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability Published by the IASB in August 2023. The amendments are effective for annual reporting beginning on or after 1 January 2025 and have yet to be endorsed by the UK.\n\n## (B) Group adjusted operating profit\n\nThe long-term nature of much of the Group's operations means that, for management's decision-making and internal performance management of our operating segments, the Group focuses on Group adjusted operating profit, a non-GAAP alternative performance measure (APM) which is not bound by IFRS. The APM incorporates the expected return on investments which supports its long-term and non-long-term businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for life and non-life business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities. This includes movements in the liabilities to with-profit policyholders that offset the operating result of non-profit contracts written in the with-profit funds. Group adjusted operating profit also includes the effect of the mismatch between movements in expected future insurance contract cash flows measured at current discount rates and the corresponding adjustment to the contractual service margin (CSM) measured at lockedin rates (see policy M).\n\nVariances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe exclusion of economic variances from the Group adjusted operating profit APM reflects the long-term nature of much of our business and presents separately the operating profit APM which is used in managing the performance of our operating segments from the impact of economic factors. Further details of this analysis and the assumptions used are given in note 10.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit excludes impairment of goodwill, associates and joint ventures; amortisation and impairment of intangibles acquired in business combinations; amortisation and impairment of acquired value of in-force business; and the profit or loss on disposal and remeasurement of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. These items principally relate to mergers and acquisition activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from the operating profit APM as this is principally used to manage the performance of our operating segments when reporting to the Group's chief operating decision maker.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, Group adjusted operating profit excludes integration and restructuring (I&R) costs that relate to a well-defined programme that materially changes the scope of our business or the manner in which it is conducted, with the exception of I&R costs directly attributable to insurance contracts. Directly attributable I&R costs are reflected in the CSM and the impact recognised in Group adjusted operating profit as CSM is amortised. This change in accounting policy had no impact on the 2022 comparative amounts.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit also excludes other items, which are those items that, in the Directors' view, are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. Details of these items, including an explanation of the rationale for their exclusion, are provided in the Alternative Performance Measures section within 'Other information'.\n\nThe Group adjusted operating profit APM should be viewed as complementary to IFRS GAAP measures. It is important to consider Group adjusted operating profit and profit before tax together to understand the performance of the business in the period.\n\n## (C) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements and assumptions applied and the appropriateness of material accounting policies. The material judgements considered by the Committee in the year are included within the Audit Committee Report.\n\nThe accounting policies in the table below are those that have the most material impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements, with those judgements involving estimation summarised thereafter.\n\nCritical accounting judgement\n\n## Consolidation (accounting policy - D)\n\nAssessment of whether the Group controls the underlying entities including consideration of its decision-making authority and rights to the variable returns from the entity. As part of this assessment Aviva applies a corridor approach to consolidation thresholds, where the Group's percentage ownership in certain investment vehicles fluctuates daily.\n\n## Classification of insurance and investment contract (accounting policy - G)\n\nAssessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the Group and discretionary participation features in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract. Insurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk. Contracts that transfer financial risks, but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts. Judgement is required to assess whether insurance risk is significant at inception of the contract. Some insurance and investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature which is a supplement to guaranteed benefits. Judgement is required to determine whether discretionary additional benefits are likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual payments.\n\n## Level of aggregation and measurement model for insurance, participating investment and reinsurance contracts (accounting policies - M(b) and M(c))\n\nFor measurement purposes, insurance contracts are aggregated into groups based on an assessment of risks and dividing each portfolio into annual cohorts by year of issue. Judgement is required in assessing if the contracts have similar risks that are managed together. Each annual cohort is further subdivided into three groups, and judgement is applied to determine the profitability of contracts at initial recognition. Judgement is then applied to determine if the group of contracts is eligible for either the variable fee approach (VFA) or premium allocation approach (PAA) to measurement.\n\nAll estimates are based on management's knowledge of current facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge and their predictions of future events and actions. Actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has all of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Power over the investee,\n- \u00b7 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n- \u00b7 The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.\n\nThe Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential voting rights.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\n## (b) Investment vehicles\n\nIn several countries, the Group has invested in a number of specialised investment vehicles such as Open-ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and unit trusts. These invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties, and distribute most of their income. In determining whether the Group controls such vehicles, primary considerations include whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent (including an assessment of the substantive removal rights of third parties) and the variability in the returns associated with the Group's aggregate economic interest in the fund (direct interest and expected management fees) relative to the total variability of returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nAdditionally, the Group's percentage ownership in these vehicles can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the level of participation of the Group and third-parties. To avoid transitory or minor changes in fund holdings (which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement) resulting in binary changes in the consolidation conclusions, the Group takes into account the trend of ownership over a period of time.\n\nThis is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 40%, the Group is judged to have control over the entity;\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 40%, the facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement in the entity are considered in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity. Considerations include the rights held by other parties, the Group's rights to fees from the entity, the variability in the returns associated with the Group's aggregate economic interest in the fund and the nature of the Group's exposure to variability compared with that of other investors; and\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity.\n\nWhere the Group is deemed to control such vehicles, they are consolidated, with the interests of parties other than Aviva being classified as liabilities. These appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unitholders' in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe interest of parties other than Aviva in the investment return on these funds appear as 'Investment expense/ (income) attributable to unitholders' in the income statement.\n\nWhere the Group does not control such vehicles, and these investments are held by its insurance or investment funds, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position, in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.\n\nAs part of their investment strategy, long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships (PLPs), either directly or via property unit trusts (PUTs), through a mix of capital and loans. The PLPs are managed by general partners (GPs), in which the long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs. The PUTs are managed by a Group subsidiary.\n\nAccounting for the PUTs and PLPs as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on whether the Group is deemed to have control or joint control over the PUTs and PLPs' shareholdings in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement are considered along with other factors that determine control, as outlined above. Where the Group exerts control over a PUT or a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.\n\nWhere the partnership is managed by an agreement such that there is joint control between the parties, notwithstanding that the Group's partnership share in the PLP (including its indirect stake via the relevant PUT and GP) may be lower or higher than 50%, such PUTs and PLPs have been classified as joint ventures (see below).\n\nWhere the Group has significant influence over the PUT or PLP, as defined in the following section, the PUT or PLP is classified as an associate. Where the Group holds noncontrolling interests in PLPs, with no significant influence or control over their associated GPs, the relevant investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments.\n\n## (c) Consolidation procedure\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Group obtains control and are excluded from consolidation from the date the Group loses control. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with Group policies.\n\nThe Group is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under this method, the Group recognises identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group has the option to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill (see accounting policy O below). Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that lead to changes in the ownership interests in a subsidiary but do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions.\n\n## (d) Merger accounting and the merger reserve\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, the date of first time adoption of IFRS, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the 'pooling of interests method' (or merger accounting), which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods. Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiary's own share capital and share premium account. These transactions have not been restated, as permitted by the IFRS 1 transitional arrangements.\n\nThe merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\n## (e) Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control. Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it has between 20% and 50% of voting rights. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Group and other parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a number of these, the Group's share of the underlying assets and liabilities may be greater or less than 50% but the terms of the relevant agreements make it clear that control is not exercised. Such jointly controlled entities are referred to as joint ventures in these financial statements.\n\nGains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. Losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred between entities.\n\nOther than investments in investment vehicles which are carried at fair value through profit or loss, investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the cost of the investment in a given associate or joint venture, together with the Group's share of that entity's postacquisition changes to shareholders' funds, is included as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position. As explained in accounting policy O, the cost includes goodwill recognised on acquisition. The Group's share of their post-acquisition profit or losses is recognised in the income statement and its share of postacquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group no longer has significant influence or joint control over the investment.\n\nIf the Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the undertaking, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity.\n\n## (f) The Company's investments\n\nIn the Company's statement of financial position, subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment. Investments are reviewed annually to test whether any indicators of impairment exist.\n\nWhere there is objective evidence of such an asset being impaired the investment is impaired to its recoverable value and any unrealised loss is recorded in the income statement.\n\n## (E) Foreign currency translation\n\nIncome statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Group's presentation currency at average exchange rates for the year, while their statements of financial position are translated at the year-end exchange rates.\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the currency translation reserve within equity.\n\nOn disposal of a foreign entity, such exchange differences are transferred out of this reserve and are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. The cumulative translation differences were deemed to be zero at the transition date to IFRS.\n\nForeign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nTranslation differences on fixed maturity securities and other monetary financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) (see accounting policy W) are included in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement. Translation differences on nonmonetary items, such as equities which are designated as FVTPL, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.\n\n## (F) Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. This presumes that the transaction takes place in the principal (or most advantageous) market under current market conditions. Fair value is a market-based measure and in the absence of observable market prices in an active market, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe fair value of a non-financial asset is determined based on its highest and best use from a market participant's perspective. When using this approach, the Group takes into account the asset's use that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. In certain circumstances, the fair value at initial recognition may differ from the transaction price.\n\nIf the fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging), or is based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, then the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is recognised as a gain or loss in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nWhen unobservable market data has a significant impact on the valuation of financial instruments, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is not recognised immediately in the income statement, but deferred and recognised in the income statement on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out or otherwise matured.\n\nIf an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, the price within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances is used to measure fair value.\n\n## (G) Product classification\n\nInsurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance, at the inception of the contract. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Contracts that transfer financial risks, but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nSome insurance and investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature, which is a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits (i) that are likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual payments; (ii) whose amount or timing is at the discretion of the issuer; and (iii) that are based on the performance of a specified pool of assets, company, or other entity that issues the contracts. Investment contracts with discretionary participation features, referred to as participating investment contracts, are accounted for under IFRS 17 as set out in policy (M). This includes hybrid participating investment contracts, which are a combination of unit-linked and with-profits investments for which the discretionary participation feature is a significant portion of the combined contract. Investment contracts without discretionary participation features, referred to as nonparticipating investment contracts, and the related reinsurance assets are accounted for as financial instruments under IFRS 9.\n\n## The classification of the Group's main contracts is summarised below:\n\n| Type of contract                                                                                               | Classification                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annuities                                                                                                      | Insurance contract                                     |\n| Unit-linked with significant  insurance risk or with a  significant discretionary  participation feature       | Insurance contract/ Participating investment  contract |\n| Unit-linked without significant  insurance risk and without  significant discretionary  participation features | Non-participating investment  contract                 |\n| Protection                                                                                                     | Insurance contract                                     |\n| General insurance  (motor, property, liability)                                                                | Insurance contract                                     |\n| With-profits                                                                                                   | Insurance contract/ Participating investment  contract |\n\n## (H) Insurance service result\n\nThe insurance service result represents the Group's profit or loss recognised on insurance contracts, participating investment contracts and reinsurance contracts (measured in accordance with policy M) in the period, excluding the impact of the time value of money and financial risks related to such contracts. The insurance service result contains three components:\n\n## (a) Insurance revenue\n\nFor insurance contracts and participating investment contracts applying General Measurement Model (GMM) and Variable Fee Approach (VFA), insurance revenue is comprised of:\n\n- \u00b7 The amortisation of contractual service margin (CSM);\n- \u00b7 The release of the risk adjustment included within the liability for remaining coverage;\n- \u00b7 Claims and expenses expected to be incurred in the period, as released from the liability for remaining coverage and adjusted for the allocation of loss Other, including revenue recognised for policyholder tax and other incurred expenses that have been charged to policyholder funds; and\n- \u00b7 The recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows, which offsets the amortisation included in insurance service expenses.\n\nFor insurance contracts applying the premium allocation approach (PAA), insurance revenue is based upon the amount of expected premium receipts allocated to insurance contracts in the period. Premium receipts are allocated to insurance contracts based upon the passage of time or, where there is evidence that the release of risk differs from the passage of time, on the basis of the expected timing of insurance service expenses.\n\n## (b) Insurance service expenses\n\nFor insurance contracts and participating investment contracts, insurance service expenses are comprised of:\n\n- \u00b7 Actual claims (excluding investment components) and non-acquisition fulfilment expenses incurred, adjusted for the allocation of loss components;\n- \u00b7 The recognition and reversal of losses on onerous contracts;\n- \u00b7 Non-financial assumption changes which do not adjust the CSM;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fees related to investment management services are recognised as revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied. In most cases this revenue is recognised in the same period in which the fees are charged to the policyholder. Fees that are related to services to be provided in future periods are deferred and recognised when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Variable consideration, such as performance fees and commission subject to clawback arrangements, is not recognised as revenue until it is reasonably certain that no significant reversal of amounts recognised would occur.\n\nInitiation and other 'front-end' fees (fees that are assessed against the policyholder balance as consideration for origination of the contract) are charged on some nonparticipating investment and investment fund management contracts.\n\nWhere the investment contract is measured at fair value, the front-end fees that relate to the provision of investment management services are deferred and recognised as the services are provided. Origination fees are recognised immediately where the sale of fund interests represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## (K) Other fee and commission income\n\nOther fee and commission income consists primarily of fund management fees, distribution fees from mutual funds, commissions on reinsurance ceded, commission revenue from the sale of mutual fund shares and transfer agent fees for shareholder record keeping. Reinsurance commissions receivable are deferred in the same way as acquisition costs, as described in accounting policy AA. All other fee and commission income is recognised over time as the services are provided.\n\n## (L) Other investment income\n\nInvestment income consists of dividends, interest and rents receivable for the year, movements in amortised cost on fixed maturity securities, realised gains and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on investments held at FVTPL (as defined in accounting policy W). Dividends on equity securities are recorded as revenue on the exdividend date. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the investment. It includes the interest rate differential on forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nRental income is recognised on an accruals basis using a straight line method, unless there is compelling evidence that benefits do not accrue evenly over the period of the lease.\n\nA gain or loss on a financial investment is only realised on disposal or transfer, and is the difference between the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, and its original cost or amortised cost, as appropriate.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses, arising on investments which have not been derecognised as a result of disposal or transfer, represent the difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The LRC represents the obligation under the insurance contract for insured events that have not yet occurred i.e., the obligation that relates to the unexpired portion of the coverage period, including the contractual service margin (CSM). The LIC reflects the obligation to investigate and pay valid claims for insured events that have already occurred, including events that have already occurred but for which claims have not been reported.\n\nThe key features of each measurement model are set out below.\n\n## (i) General measurement model (GMM)\n\nThe GMM is the default IFRS 17 measurement model. The fulfilment cash flows comprise the present value of future cash flows within the boundary of the contract, discounted at current rates, and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nAt inception, a CSM liability is recognised for each new group of contracts which represents the unearned profit to be recognised over the coverage period.\n\nInitial measurement is based on the cash flows within the boundary of the contract discounted at the rate when the contract is written. Except for reinsurance contracts held, losses on groups of contracts that are onerous at inception are recognised immediately.\n\nFor subsequent measurement, fulfilment cash flows are discounted at current rates at each balance sheet date, while the CSM is remeasured applying the discount rate when the contract is written (the locked-in rate). Other financial assumptions including inflation and foreign exchange rates are also locked in at inception for the purposes of remeasuring the CSM. The CSM is remeasured for changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to non-financial risk only, applying these locked in financial assumptions. Interest is accreted on the CSM using the locked-in discount rate and the CSM is amortised over the coverage period of the contract.\n\nThe coverage period is determined based on the service provided to customers including both insurance and investment services. Losses on groups of contracts that are profitable at inception but subsequently become onerous are recognised immediately.\n\nIn contrast to insurance contracts, the CSM for groups of reinsurance contracts held can be an asset or liability. If reinsurance is in place when underlying groups of insurance contracts become onerous, the reinsurance CSM recognised is adjusted to offset the gross losses arising.\n\nWhere the net cost of purchasing reinsurance contracts held relates to events that occurred prior to purchase (for example adverse development cover) no CSM is recognised, and the net cost is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## (ii) Variable fee approach (VFA)\n\nThe VFA is a modified approach to the GMM that is applied to groups of insurance and investment contracts with direct participating features which meet eligibility requirements that demonstrate they provide substantial investment related services to policyholders.\n\nFulfilment cash flows for VFA contracts comprise the obligation to pay policyholders an amount equal to the fair value of underlying items, less the variable fee for future service.\n\nChanges in the obligation to pay policyholders the fair value of underlying items are recognised within net finance expenses from insurance contracts in the income statement.\n\nThe variable fee includes the present value of the Group's share of the fair value of underlying items, adjusted for cash flows that do not vary with those underlying items. The risk adjustment reflects the compensation for nonfinancial risk in relation to the variable fee only.\n\nThe CSM is subsequently remeasured for changes in the variable fee due to both financial and non-financial risks using current market discount rates.\n\nConsistent with the GMM, the CSM is recognised in profit or loss over the coverage period in line with the insurance and investment services provided to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is applied to all of the Group's non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts except for contracts that reinsure adverse development of incurred claims.\n\nThe LRC is measured as the amount of premium received net of acquisition cash flows, less the amount of premiums and acquisition cash flows that have been recognised in profit or loss over the expired portion of the coverage period.\n\nPremium receipts and acquisition cash flows are recognised in profit or loss over the life of the contract, based on the expected timing of incurred claims.\n\nWhere policyholder premiums are yet to be remitted by intermediaries, these premiums are treated as received within the LRC with a separate financial asset recognised for the amounts due from intermediaries. Commissions due to intermediaries are treated as paid within the LRC with a separate financial liability recognised. Variable commissions which are not yet due and which are dependent upon underwriting performance are measured within the liability for remaining coverage, until the coverage period expires and the liability amount is known, at which point they are reclassified as financial liabilities.\n\nIf facts and circumstances indicate that a group of contracts may be onerous, the LRC is measured using GMM principles and losses for onerous contracts are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor most contracts applying PAA, the measurement of the LIC aligns to the GMM, with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk, and discounting applied to expected cash flows. For Health contracts a PAA exemption is applied to measure the LIC on an undiscounted basis, allowable because claims are settled within 12 months of their incurred date.\n\n## (b) Choice of measurement model (i) VFA eligibility\n\nLife business is considered to have direct participating features, and is required to be measured under the VFA model where:\n\n- \u00b7 Contractual terms evidence that policyholders participate in a pool of clearly identified underlying items, for example unit-linked or with-profits funds;\n- \u00b7 The policyholders expect to receive a substantial share of the returns on underlying items (defined by the Group as greater than 50%); and\n- \u00b7 A substantial proportion of changes in amounts payable to policyholders varies with returns on the underlying items (defined by the Group as a correlation coefficient of greater than 50%).\n\nReinsurance contracts held are not eligible to apply the VFA.\n\n## (ii) PAA eligibility\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's direct non-life business has a duration of one year or less and is automatically eligible for the PAA model. For the remainder, financial modelling is performed to compare the value of the LRC measured under GMM and PAA.\n\nWhere the LRC does not materially differ between the two measurement models (over the duration of the contract and in a range of reasonably foreseeable scenarios) the contract group is PAA eligible.\n\nThe Group has multiple non-life reinsurance contracts which are greater than one year in duration. These are assessed for PAA eligibility by applying the same financial modelling approach and are all PAA eligible except for treaties reinsuring the adverse development of incurred claims.\n\n## (c) Level of aggregation\n\nThe unit of account is a group of contracts, so insurance contracts are aggregated into groups for measurement purposes. Discrete CSMs are determined for each group of insurance contracts applying GMM or VFA.\n\nGroups of insurance contracts have been determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts, comprising contracts subject to similar risks that are managed together, and dividing each portfolio into annual cohorts by year of issue.\n\nEach annual cohort is then further subdivided into three groups based on the profitability of contracts determined at initial recognition and comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 Contracts that are onerous;\n- \u00b7 Contracts that have no significant possibility of becoming onerous; (based on the probability that changes in assumptions would result in contracts becoming onerous); and\n- \u00b7 All remaining contracts.\n\nReinsurance contracts held are also subdivided into three profitability groups, determined by reference to net gains/losses on initial recognition, and comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 Contracts that have a net gain at initial recognition;\n- \u00b7 Contracts that have no significant possibility of a net gain arising subsequently; and\n- \u00b7 All remaining contracts.\n\nThe approach to profitability grouping makes use of sets. Where it can be demonstrated that all contracts within a set are sufficiently homogeneous, they are allocated to the same profitability group without performing an individual contract assessment. For Life product lines, sets of contracts usually correspond to policyholder pricing groups. The likelihood of changes in insurance, financial and other exposures resulting in contracts becoming onerous is monitored at the level of these pricing groups.\n\nFor contracts measured under the PAA, IFRS 17 permits a simplification whereby contract groups are assumed not to be onerous unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. The Group has used internal management information to identify facts and circumstances that may indicate that a group is onerous.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\n## (d) Recognition and derecognition\n\nAn insurance contract issued by the Group is recognised from the earliest of:\n\n- \u00b7 The beginning of its coverage period (i.e. the period during which the Group provides insurance contract services in respect of any premiums within the boundary of the contract);\n- \u00b7 The date the first payment from the policyholder becomes due or, if there is no contractual due date, when it is received from the policyholder; and\n- \u00b7 The date when facts and circumstances indicate that the contract is onerous.\n\nReinsurance contracts are recognised on the following dates:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance contracts that provide proportionate coverage: the later of the date on which any underlying insurance contract is initially recognised and the date the reinsurance is entered into. This applies to the Group's quota share reinsurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Other reinsurance contracts: The beginning of the coverage period of the group of reinsurance contracts. However, if the Group recognises an onerous group of underlying insurance contracts on an earlier date and the related reinsurance contract was entered into before that earlier date, then the group of reinsurance contracts is recognised on that earlier date. This applies to the Group's excess of loss and catastrophe cover reinsurance contracts.\n\nAn insurance or reinsurance contract acquired in a transfer of contracts or a business combination is recognised on the date of acquisition.\n\nWhen the contract is recognised, it is added to an existing group of contracts or, if the contract does not qualify for inclusion in an existing group, it forms a new group to which future contracts are added. Groups of contracts are established on initial recognition and their composition is not revised once all contracts have been added to the group.\n\nInsurance contracts are derecognised when the contract is extinguished, i.e. when the specified obligations expire, are discharged, or are cancelled.\n\nThe Group also derecognises a contract if its terms are modified in a way that would have changed the accounting for the contract significantly had the new terms always existed, in which case a new contract based on the modified terms is recognised.\n\n## (e) Estimate of future cash flows\n\nThe estimate of future cash flows is assessed at the level of groups of contracts and represents the best estimate of the Group's cost to fulfil a contract incorporating current estimates of non-financial assumptions. The estimate allows for all the cash inflows and outflows expected to occur within the contract boundary. Cash flows are modelled separately for gross and reinsurance contracts.\n\n## (i) Contract boundaries\n\nCash flows are within the contract boundary if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group can compel the policyholder to pay premiums or has a substantive obligation to provide insurance contract services.\n\nA substantive obligation to provide services ends when the Group has the practical ability to reassess the risks (insurance and financial risks transferred from the policyholder, so excluding lapse and expense risks) and set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those reassessed risks for either the particular policyholder or the portfolio that contains the contract.\n\nRiders, representing add-on provisions to a basic insurance policy that provide additional benefits to the policyholder at additional cost, issued together with the main insurance contracts form part of a single insurance contract with all of the cash flows within its boundary.\n\nSome insurance contracts issued by the Group provide policyholders with the option to buy additional insurance coverage. The Group assesses the practical ability to reprice such insurance contracts in their entirety to determine if the option cash flows are within or outside the insurance contract boundary. As a result of this assessment, options for which pricing is not guaranteed are not measured by the Group until they are exercised.\n\nCash flows are within the boundaries of participating investment contracts if they result from a substantive obligation of the Group to deliver cash at a present or future date.\n\nCash flows are within the contract boundary of a reinsurance contract held if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the Group is compelled to pay amounts to the reinsurer or has a substantive right to receive services from the reinsurer.\n\nThe contract boundary is reassessed at each reporting date to include the effect of changes in circumstances on the Group's substantive rights and obligations and, therefore, may change over time. Cash flows outside the contract boundary relate to future insurance contracts and are recognised when those contracts meet the recognition criteria.\n\n## (ii) Principal non-financial assumptions\n\nPrincipal non-financial assumptions used in the calculation of life insurance and participating investment contract fulfilment cash flows include those in respect of annuitant and assurance mortality and future expenses. Expenses must be directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts, including an allocation of overheads to the extent that they can be allocated to groups of contracts in a systematic and rational way.\n\nPrincipal non-financial assumptions used in the calculation of the non-life LIC use past claims experience to project future claims (estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques).\n\n## (iii) Financial assumptions\n\nDiscount rates\n\nDiscounting is applied to the estimate of future cash flows. The Group uses a bottom-up discount rate for all life and non-life insurance contracts except for annuities. A top-down discount rate is applied to annuities to reflect more appropriately the characteristics of the annuity liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nFor other contracts where liabilities are subject to lapse risk or where cash flows depend on underlying asset performance (such as unit-linked and with-profits), the characteristics of the liability can be reflected using the bottom-up method which requires the application of less judgement.\n\n## Top-down discount rates\n\nThe discount rate is determined from the yield implicit in the fair value of an appropriate reference portfolio of assets that reflects the characteristics of the liability. Adjustments are made for differences between the reference portfolio and liability cash flows, including an allowance for defaults which reflects the compensation a market participant would require for credit risk.\n\nThe CSM for annuity contracts is measured using a locked-in discount rate based on assets expected to be originated for new business at initial recognition of the contracts. On subsequent measurement of the fulfilment cash flows the reference portfolio is based on the assets held to match the portfolio of liabilities. For recently written contracts, an adjustment is made to liabilities where appropriate assets are yet to be sourced.\n\n## Bottom-up discount rates\n\nThe discount rate is determined as the risk-free yield, adjusted for differences in liquidity characteristics between the financial assets used to derive the risk-free yield and the relevant liability cash flows (known as an 'illiquidity premium').\n\nThe illiquidity premium is determined as a percentage of the current spread over the risk-free yield on an index of covered bonds. The percentage applied reflects the liquidity characteristics of the liabilities including the propensity and ability of policyholders to lapse or surrender their contracts; for example, 100% for structured settlements where surrenders are not possible, and 0% for unit-linked contracts where policyholders can normally immediately surrender their contract for the unit value. An intermediate percentage is applied for other types of business.\n\n## Inflation assumptions\n\nFuture inflation assumptions are treated as a financial assumption when applied to policyholder benefits or outsourced maintenance expenses that are contractually linked to an inflation index.\n\n## Presentation of financial assumption changes\n\nThe Group recognises the impact of financial assumption changes in the income statement, except for those that relate to changes in the variable fee for VFA contracts which adjust the CSM.\n\n## (f) Risk Adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation required by the Group to accept the uncertainty about the amount and timing of future cash flows that arises from nonfinancial risk.\n\nThe calculation of the risk adjustment is calibrated to the Group's pricing and capital allocation framework, leveraging the Solvency II view of non-financial risk, considering a lifetime view, and including diversification between risks.\n\nThe change in risk adjustment relating to current or past service is recognised within insurance revenue in the income statement. The impact of discounting the risk adjustment for GMM and PAA contracts is disaggregated and recognised within net finance expenses from insurance contracts.\n\n## (g) CSM\n\nThe CSM represents a liability for unearned profit measured at inception and recognised in the income statement over the life of the contract as insurance and investment related services are provided to the customer.\n\nFor profitable groups of insurance contracts, the CSM is established to ensure no profit is recognised at inception, hence it is equal and opposite to the net present value of the expected cash flows (including initial premiums and insurance acquisition cash flows) and the risk adjustment. For groups of gross insurance contracts issued that are onerous at initial recognition, the CSM is set to nil and losses are recognised in the income statement. For reinsurance contracts the CSM is initially recognised at a value that ensures no gain or loss is recognised but may be adjusted for loss offsetting as set out in (h).\n\nSubsequently, the CSM is adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 Accretion of interest at locked-in discount rates (groups of GMM contracts only), which is charged to net finance expenses in the income statement;\n- \u00b7 New contracts added to the same group;\n- \u00b7 Changes in fulfilment cash flows (including risk adjustment) that relate to future service;\n- \u00b7 For reinsurance contracts held, income recognised in profit or loss on initial recognition of onerous underlying contracts and adjustments to the loss recovery component set out in (h); and\n- \u00b7 Currency exchange differences.\n\nChanges in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service include:\n\n- \u00b7 Experience variances in premiums received during the period that relate to services provided from the start of the current period;\n- \u00b7 Changes in expected future cash flows and risk adjustment on GMM contracts arising from nonfinancial assumption changes and experience variances, measured using locked in financial assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Changes in the variable fee and risk adjustment on VFA contracts arising from financial and non-financial assumption changes and experience variances, except where the risk mitigation option is applied; and\n- \u00b7 Experience variances in non-distinct investment components, premium refunds and rights to withdraw payable in the period.\n\nChanges in fulfilment cash flows that relate to past or current service do not adjust the CSM and are recognised immediately in the income statement, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Experience variances in claims and expenses incurred, which are recognised as the difference between insurance revenue (expected claims and expenses incurred) and insurance service expenses (actual claims and expenses incurred); and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investment related services are only included if the Group is deemed to be providing a significant investment service when providing an investment component, or policyholder's right to withdraw, that is expected to include an investment return generated by investment activity performed by the Group. This includes contracts where the value of the investment return that the policyholder benefits from is not directly related to the value of the underlying investments.\n\nCoverage units are discounted and are updated at each reporting date to reflect the current best estimate of service expected to be provided in future periods.\n\nCoverage units for reinsurance contracts held are typically consistent with the underlying gross contracts, adjusted for differences in the services provided.\n\n## (h) Loss components and loss offsetting\n\nLosses on onerous contracts are recognised immediately within insurance service expenses in the income statement, and a loss component is established. Subsequent losses, and reversals of losses, arising from changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service adjust the loss component and are recognised immediately in insurance service expenses to the extent that a balance remains on the loss component, after which a CSM will be established.\n\nA variable proportion approach is used to systematically allocate changes in fulfilment cash flows that relate to past or current service to the loss component, resulting in a deduction from the amount of these changes that is recognised within insurance revenue in the income statement with an offsetting adjustment to insurance service expenses. The variable proportion is determined each reporting date as the proportion of the balance on the loss component relative to the fulfilment cash flows for that group of contracts.\n\nA reinsurance loss recovery component is established for a group of reinsurance contracts that covers a group of onerous underlying contracts. At initial recognition this is the amount that the reinsurance CSM has been adjusted as a result of recognising income to offset losses recognised at inception on underlying insurance contracts, based on the percentage of the claims that are recoverable through the reinsurance.\n\nSubsequently the loss recovery component is adjusted for changes in the reinsurance fulfilment cash flows that correspond to change in fulfilment cash flows that relate to future service for the underlying onerous contracts.\n\nThe balance on the loss recovery component is systematically allocated to the income statement using a similar approach to loss components.\n\n## (i) Investment components and rights to withdraw\n\nInvestment components are amounts that are payable to the policyholder in all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs. This typically includes the account balance on unit-linked and withprofit contracts, surrender and maturity values on protection contracts and guaranteed payments on immediate annuities. Rights to withdraw, which may include items that are investment components, are amounts payable to policyholders that do not represent an additional benefit payable when an insured event occurs.\n\nThis includes, but is not restricted to, maturity values that are not determined by the occurrence of an insured event, a policyholder's rights to receive a surrender value or refund of premiums on cancellation of a policy, rights to transfer an amount to another insurance provider and guaranteed annuity payments on a deferred annuity in excess of the death benefit payable prior to retirement. Investment components and rights to withdraw are excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses in the income statement.\n\n## (j) Insurance acquisition cash flows\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows are initially deferred on the balance sheet as an insurance acquisition cash flow asset and then allocated against groups of insurance contracts to which they are directly attributable.\n\nThis includes instances where insurance acquisition cash flows are directly attributable to the future renewal of existing contract groups for some products in the Group's non-life business. For contract groups applying PAA, the Group has chosen not to apply an exemption to recognise insurance acquisition cash flows as an expense at the point they are incurred.\n\nWhere insurance acquisition cash flows are allocated to contract groups applying GMM or VFA, they are included within the measurement of the CSM and recognised in the income statement over the period which services are provided to the customer. Insurance acquisition cash flows allocated to contract groups applying PAA are recognised in the income statement over the life of the contract based on the expected timing of incurred claims.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flow assets are assessed for impairment where facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Group uses data on customer retention rates and the profitability of products to identify such facts and circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under IFRS 9, the Group elects to recognise the movement in own credit risk through the income statement in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch. Deposits collected under non-participating investment contracts are not accounted for through the income statement, except for the investment income attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the investment contract liability.\n\nThe majority of the Group's contracts classified as nonparticipating investment contracts are unit-linked contracts and are measured at fair value.\n\nThe liability's fair value is determined using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate of the amount for which the liability could be transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, subject to a minimum equal to the surrender value. For unit-linked contracts, the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units.\n\nIn addition, if required, non-unit reserves are held based on a discounted cash flow analysis. For non-linked contracts, the fair value liability is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with allowance for risk calibrated to match the market price for risk.\n\n## (O) Reinsurance for non-participating investment contracts\n\nReinsurance assets for non-participating investment contracts includes balances in respect of investment contracts that are legally reinsurance contracts but do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS 17 as they principally transfer financial risk. Premiums payable on these contracts are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position.\n\nA deposit asset is initially recognised, based on the consideration paid less any explicitly identified premiums or fees to be retained by the reinsured. The assets are subsequently measured at FVTPL.\n\n## (P) Goodwill, AVIF and intangible assets (a) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on the Group's investments in subsidiaries is shown as a separate asset, while that on associates and joint ventures is included within the carrying value of those investments.\n\nGoodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 (the date of transition to IFRS) is carried at its book value (original cost less cumulative amortisation) on that date, less any impairment subsequently incurred. Goodwill arising before 1 January 1998 was eliminated against reserves and has not been reinstated.\n\nWhere negative goodwill arises on an acquisition, this is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## (b) Acquired value of in-force business (AVIF)\n\nThe present value of future profits on a portfolio of longterm non-participating investment contracts, acquired either directly or through the purchase of a subsidiary, is recognised as an asset.\n\nIf the AVIF results from the acquisition of an investment in a joint venture or an associate, it is held within the carrying amount of that investment. In all cases, the AVIF is amortised over the useful lifetime of the related contracts in the portfolio on a systematic basis. The rate of amortisation is chosen by considering the profile of the additional value of in-force business acquired and the expected depletion in its value.\n\nAVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment, consistent with reviews conducted for other finite life intangible assets and impairment tested at product portfolio level by reference to a projection of future profits arising from the portfolio.\n\n## (c) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets consist primarily of contractual relationships such as access to distribution networks, customer lists and software.\n\nThe economic lives of these are determined by considering relevant factors such as usage of the asset, typical product life cycles, potential obsolescence, maintenance costs, the stability of the industry, competitive position and the period of control over the assets. Finite life intangibles are amortised over their useful lives, which range from three to 30 years, using the straight-line method.\n\nThe amortisation charge for the year is included in the income statement under 'Other expenses'. For intangibles with finite lives, impairment charges will be recognised in the income statement where evidence of such impairment is observed.\n\nIntangibles with indefinite lives are subject to regular impairment testing, as described below.\n\n## (d) Impairment testing\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated to cashgenerating units. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value. Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are written down for impairment where the recoverable amount is insufficient to support its carrying value. Further details on goodwill allocation and impairment testing are given in note 17. Any impairments are charged as expenses in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

When such properties are sold, the accumulated revaluation surpluses are transferred from this reserve to retained earnings.\n\nThese properties are depreciated down to their estimated residual values over their useful lives.\n\nThis excludes owner-occupied properties held under lease arrangements, which are measured at amortised cost. See accounting policy AB for further information.\n\nAll other items classed as property and equipment within the statement of financial position are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nInvestment properties under construction are included within property and equipment until completion, and are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their values until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the cost of other assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u2022 Properties under construction\n\nNo depreciation\n\n- \u2022 Owner-occupied properties, and related mechanical and electrical equipment\n\n25 years\n\n- \u2022 Motor vehicles\n\nThree years, or lease term (up to useful life) if longer\n\n- \u2022 Computer equipment\n\nThree to five years\n\n- \u2022 Other assets\n\nThree to five years\n\nThe assets' residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed regularly, and at least at each financial year end, and adjusted if appropriate. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.\n\nGains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of property and equipment are capitalised. All repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the most recently assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group and the renovation replaces an identifiable part of the asset. Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n\n## (R) Investment property\n\nInvestment property is held for long-term rental yields and is not occupied by the Group.\n\nCompleted investment property is stated at its fair value, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by qualified staff of the Group. Changes in fair values are recorded in the income statement in net investment income.\n\nAs described in accounting policy Q above, investment properties under construction are included within property and equipment, and are stated at cost less any impairment in their values until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\n## (S) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nProperty and equipment and other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Non-financial assets, except goodwill which have suffered an impairment, are reviewed annually for possible reversal of the impairment.\n\n## (T) Recognition and classification of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are measured initially at fair value plus eligible transaction costs for financial assets held at amortised cost. Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVTPL based on a business model assessment and the extent to which the contractual cash flows associated with the financial assets are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI).\n\nThe Group measures financial assets at FVTPL if they do not meet the SPPI criteria or if they are held within a business model where they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis resulting from the Group's management of capital on a regulatory basis.\n\nA financial asset is classified at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and its contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nOn initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise. The Group has designated certain cash balances at FVTPL to reduce an accounting mismatch when these balances form part of the risk mitigation for insurance contracts measured under the VFA and to which the risk mitigation option is applied under IFRS 17. These cash balances would otherwise be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group measures equity instruments at FVTPL, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, as it did not make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf the terms of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost are substantially modified, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset or financial liability are deemed to have expired or extinguished. The original financial asset or financial liability is derecognised, and a new financial asset or financial liability is recognised at fair value.\n\nA financial asset measured at amortised cost is not derecognised if the contractual terms are not substantially modified and a modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is the ability and intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (W) Financial investments\n\nThe Group classifies financial investments at FVTPL using the business model assessment as described in accounting policy T.\n\nThe FVTPL category has two subcategories - those that meet the definition as being held for trading and those that are held at FVTPL based on the business model assessment. Fixed maturity securities and equity securities, which the Group acquires with the intention to resell in the short term and derivatives are classified as trading. All other investments are classified as other than trading.\n\nThe fair value of investments is based on the quoted price within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value or based on the cash flow models using market observable inputs or unobservable inputs. Changes in the fair value of investments are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.\n\nPurchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets, at their fair values.\n\n## (X) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate futures, currency and interest rate swaps, currency and interest rate options (both written and purchased) and other financial instruments that derive their value mainly from underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit or equity indices, commodity values or equity instruments.\n\nAll derivatives are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at their fair value, which usually represents their cost. They are classified as mandatorily held at FVTPL, with the method of recognising movements in this value depending on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not available, by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.\n\nAll derivatives are carried as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. Premiums paid for derivatives are recorded as an asset on the statement of financial position at the date of purchase, representing their fair value at that date.\n\nDerivative contracts may be traded on an exchange or over-the-counter (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives are standardised and include certain futures and option contracts. OTC derivative contracts are individually negotiated between contracting parties and include forwards, swaps, caps and floors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nDerivatives are subject to various risks including market, liquidity and credit risk, similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments. Many OTC transactions are contracted and documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements or their equivalent, which are designed to provide legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, reducing the Group's exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe notional or contractual amounts associated with derivative financial instruments are not recorded as assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position as they do not represent the fair value of these transactions. These amounts are disclosed in note 55(b).\n\nThe Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties. Accounting policy Z covers collateral, both received and pledged, in respect of these derivatives.\n\n## (a) Interest rate and currency swaps\n\nInterest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments, calculated on a specified notional amount and defined interest rates. Most interest rate swap payments are netted against each other, with the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest payments paid by one party. Currency swaps, in their simplest form, are contractual agreements that involve the exchange of both periodic and final amounts in two different currencies.\n\nBoth types of swap contracts may include the net exchange of principal. Exposure to gain or loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as a function of maturity dates, interest and foreign exchange rates, and the timing of payments.\n\n## (b) Interest rate futures, forwards and options contracts\n\nInterest rate futures are exchange-traded instruments and represent commitments to purchase or sell a designated security or money market instrument at a specified future date and price.\n\nInterest rate forward agreements are OTC contracts in which two parties agree on an interest rate and other terms that will become a reference point in determining, in concert with an agreed notional principal amount, a net payment to be made by one party to the other, depending upon what rate prevails at a future point in time.\n\nInterest rate options, which consist primarily of caps and floors, are interest rate protection instruments that involve the potential obligation of the seller to pay the buyer an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid by the buyer.\n\nThis differential represents the difference between current rate and an agreed rate applied to a notional amount. Exposure to gain or loss on all interest rate contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as interest rates fluctuate. Certain contracts, known as swaptions, contain features which can act as swaps or options.\n\n## (c) Foreign exchange contracts\n\nForeign exchange contracts, which include spot, forward and futures contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date.\n\nForeign exchange option contracts are similar to interest rate option contracts, except that they are based on currencies, rather than interest rates.\n\n## (d) Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is applied to certain transactions of the Group so that the financial statements represent the impact of the Group's hedging strategies for currency risk. The Group has applied the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements from 1 January 2023.\n\nHedge accounting can be applied only if all the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 The hedge relationship consists only of eligible hedging instruments and hedged items;\n- \u00b7 There is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the risk management objective and the risk management strategy; and\n- \u00b7 The hedge relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting by using net investment hedges to hedge the currency risk arising from our foreign operations (hedged item) against foreign currency borrowings (hedging instrument). Cash flow hedging is also used to hedge currency risk arising from the expected sale of Aviva Singapore. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income in a separate reserve within equity to the extent that it is effective. Gains and losses accumulated in this reserve are transferred to the income statement on disposal or part-disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nFor derivative transactions where hedge accounting is not applied, the fair value gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised immediately in net investment income.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2023, hedge accounting was applied to certain transactions which met the criteria set out in IAS 39.\n\nAt the inception of the transaction, the Group documented the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documented its assessment of whether the hedge was expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk in the hedged item and whether it was actually effective, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that were designated as a net investment hedge were recognised in other comprehensive income in a separate reserve within equity. The Group did not apply the hedge accounting rules to its derivative translations during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\n## (Y) Loans\n\nLoans with fixed maturities, mortgage loans on investment property, securitised mortgages and collateral loans, are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers. Certain loans are carried at their unpaid principal balances and adjusted for amortisation of premium or discount, non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs. These amounts are deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as an adjustment to loan yield using the effective interest rate method.\n\nAs described in accounting policy T, loans are classified and measured at either amortised cost or FVTPL based on the outcome of an assessment of the business model for managing financial assets and the extent to which the financial assets' contractual cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nThe majority of mortgage loans are measured at fair value since they're managed and evaluated on a fair value basis. The fair values of these mortgages are estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate which reflects the risks associated with these products. They are revalued at each period end, with movements in their fair values being taken to the income statement.\n\nThe impairment policy is described in accounting policy U for loans measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (Z) Collateral\n\nThe Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of stock lending transactions, certain derivative contracts and loans, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. Collateral is also pledged as security for bank letters of credit. The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.\n\nCollateral received in the form of cash, which is not legally segregated from the Group, is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position with a corresponding liability for the repayment in financial liabilities (see note 56). However, where the Group has a currently enforceable legal right of set-off and the ability and intent to settle net, the collateral liability and associated derivative balances are shown net. Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the statement of financial position unless the transfer of the collateral meets the derecognition criteria from the perspective of the transferor.\n\nSuch collateral is typically recognised when the Group either (a) sells or repledges these assets in the absence of default, at which point the obligation to return this collateral is recognised as a liability; or (b) the counterparty to the arrangement defaults, at which point the collateral is seized and recognised as an asset.\n\nCollateral pledged in the form of cash, which is legally segregated from the Group, is derecognised from the statement of financial position with a corresponding receivable recognised for its return. Non-cash collateral pledged is not derecognised from the statement of financial position unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement, and therefore continues to be recognised in the statement of financial position within the appropriate asset classification.\n\n## (AA) Deferred acquisition costs for non-\n\nparticipating investment contracts and other assets For non-participating investment and investment fund management contracts, incremental acquisition costs and sales enhancements that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service are deferred.\n\nThese deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the period in which the service is provided.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs are reviewed by category of business at the end of each reporting period and are written-off where they are no longer considered to be recoverable.\n\nOther receivables and payables are initially recognised at cost, being fair value. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (AB) Leases\n\nWhere the Group is the lessee, a lease liability equal to the present value of outstanding lease payments and a corresponding right-of-use asset equal to cost are initially recognised.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease term. Depreciation on lease assets and interest on lease liabilities is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe Group has made use of the election available under IFRS 16 to not recognise any amounts on the balance sheet associated with leases that are either deemed to be short term, or where the underlying asset is of low value. A short-term lease in this context is defined as any arrangement which has a lease term of 12 months or less. Lease payments associated with such arrangements are recognised in the income statement as an expense on a straight-line basis. The Group's total short term and low value lease portfolio is not material.\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor, leases are classified as finance leases if the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee and operating leases if they are not substantially transferred. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable. The Group has not entered into any material finance lease arrangements as lessor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\n## (AC) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more probable than not that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions under a variety of circumstances including for product governance rectification, which may include customer redress, and for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\nThe amount recorded as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Discounting is applied to the provision where the effect of the time value of money is material. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan and has raised a valid expectation that the restructure will be carried out, for example by announcing its main features to those affected. Costs included in restructuring provisions comprise only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring. Costs associated with the ongoing activities of the entity are excluded.\n\nWhere the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.\n\nContingent liabilities are disclosed if there is a possible future obligation as a result of a past event, or if there is a present obligation as a result of a past event but either a payment is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\n## (AD) Employee benefits\n\n## (a) Pension obligations\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes, whose members receive benefits on either a defined benefit or defined contribution basis. Under a defined contribution plan, the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to the amount it agrees to contribute to a fund and there is no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay benefits.\n\nA defined benefit pension plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan and typically defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The pension obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, using a discount rate based on market yields for high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have durations approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.\n\nThe resultant net surplus or deficit recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nPlan assets exclude unpaid contributions due from Group entities to the schemes, and any non-transferrable financial instruments issued by a Group entity and held by the schemes. If the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the resultant asset is limited to the asset ceiling defined as present value of economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group.\n\nRemeasurements of defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, the return on plan assets (excluding net interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any). The Group recognises remeasurements immediately in other comprehensive income and does not reclassify them to the income statement in subsequent periods.\n\nService costs comprising current service costs, past service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and net interest expense/income are charged or credited to the income statement.\n\nPast service costs are recognised at the earlier of the date the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when related restructuring costs are recognised.\n\nThe Group determines the net interest expense/income on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability/asset. Net interest expense is charged to finance costs, whereas net interest income is credited to investment income.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension plans. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group, as employer, has no further payment obligations. The Group's contributions are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate and are included in staff costs.\n\n## (b) Equity compensation plans\n\nThe Group offers share award and option plans over the Company's ordinary shares for certain employees, including a Save As You Earn plan (SAYE plan), details of which are given in the Directors' Remuneration Report and in note 33.\n\nThe Group accounts for options and awards under equity compensation plans, which were granted after 7 November 2002, until such time as they are fully vested, using the fair value based method of accounting (the 'fair value method').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nUnder this method, the cost of providing equity compensation plans is based on the fair value of the share awards or option plans at date of grant, which is recognised in the income statement over the expected vesting period of the related employees and credited to the equity compensation reserve, part of shareholders' funds. In certain jurisdictions, awards must be settled in cash instead of shares, and the credit is taken to liabilities rather than reserves. The fair value of these cash-settled awards is recalculated each year, with the income statement charge and liability being adjusted accordingly.\n\nShares purchased by employee share trusts to fund these awards are shown as deduction from shareholders' equity at their weighted average cost.\n\nWhen the options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital (par value) and the balance to share premium.\n\nWhere the shares are already held by employee trusts, the net proceeds are credited against the cost of these shares, with the difference between cost and proceeds being taken to retained earnings. In both cases, the relevant amount in the equity compensation reserve is then credited to retained earnings.\n\n## (AE) Income taxes\n\nThe current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, after any adjustments in respect of prior years. Tax, including tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over profits before taxation and amounts charged or credited to components of other comprehensive income and equity, as appropriate.\n\nProvision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, using the liability method, on all material temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date are used to value the deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on any temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred taxes are not provided in respect of temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity are similarly recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity respectively.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions, where management expects it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur as a result of examination by a relevant tax authority. Provisions reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. The final amounts of tax due may ultimately differ from management's best estimate at the balance sheet date. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are re-measured as required to reflect current information.\n\nIn addition to paying tax on shareholders' profits ('shareholder tax'), the Group's life businesses in the UK, Ireland and Singapore pay tax on policyholders' investment returns ('policyholder tax') on certain products at policyholder tax rates. The incremental tax borne by the Group represents income tax on policyholder's investment return.\n\nIn jurisdictions where policyholder tax is applicable, the total tax charge in the income statement is allocated between shareholder tax and policyholder tax. The shareholder tax is calculated by applying the corporate tax rate to the shareholder profit. The difference between the total tax charge and shareholder tax is allocated to policyholder tax. This calculation methodology is consistent with the legislation relating to the calculation of tax on shareholder profits.\n\nThe Group has decided to show separately the amounts of policyholder tax to provide a meaningful measure of the tax the Group pays on its profit. In the pro forma reconciliations, the Group adjusted operating profit has been calculated after charging policyholder tax.\n\n## (AF) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are classified as being for either core structural or operational purposes. They are recognised initially at their issue proceeds less transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, most borrowings are stated at amortised cost and any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of property and equipment as described in accounting policy Q.\n\nWhere loan notes have been issued in connection with certain securitised mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage of the fair value option under IFRS 9 to present them at fair value to eliminate any accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise from using different measurement bases for these items and the associated mortgages and derivative financial instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, a financial instrument is treated as equity if:\n\n- \u00b7 There is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on terms that may be unfavourable; and\n- \u00b7 The instrument is a non-derivative that contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of shares or is a derivative that will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other assets for a fixed number of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## (b) Share issue costs\n\nIncremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds of the issue and disclosed where material.\n\n## (c) Dividends\n\nInterim dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends on these shares are recognised when they have been approved by shareholders. Dividends on preference shares are recognised in the period in which they are declared and appropriately approved.\n\n## (d) Treasury shares\n\nWhere the Company or its subsidiaries purchase the Company's share capital or obtain rights to purchase its share capital, the consideration paid (including any attributable transaction costs net of income taxes) is shown as a deduction from total shareholders' equity. Gains and losses on own shares are charged or credited to the treasury share account in equity.\n\n## (AH) Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets and income arising from fiduciary activities, together with related undertakings to return such assets to customers, are excluded from these financial statements where the Group has no contractual rights in the assets and acts in a fiduciary capacity such as nominee, trustee or agent.\n\n## (AI) Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding the weighted average number of treasury shares.\n\nEarnings per share has also been calculated on Group adjusted operating profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, net of tax, non-controlling interests, preference dividends and coupon payments on the direct capital instrument (DCI) as the directors believe this figure provides a better indication of operating performance. Details are given in note 15.\n\nFor the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as convertible debt and share options granted to employees.\n\nPotential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.components;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A restated opening statement of financial position is shown above.\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts provides a comprehensive and consistent approach to accounting for insurance contracts. It replaces IFRS 4, which was issued in 2005 and was largely based on grandfathering of previous local accounting policies.\n\nThe Group has also adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2023 and comparatives have been retrospectively restated. IFRS 9 incorporates new classification and measurement requirements for financial assets, introduces a new expected credit loss impairment model to replace the IAS 39 incurred loss model and new hedge accounting requirements. The Group had previously deferred the application of IFRS 9 to align with the implementation of IFRS 17. IFRS 9 has not resulted in any measurement differences on adoption by the Group but does impact the disclosure of financial instruments as described in note 1(e).\n\nAccounting policies that have been revised as a result of adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 are presented in Accounting Policies. Significant methods, judgements and assumptions applied in measurement of insurance contracts are set out in note 40(g). This note focuses on the changes made on transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. Further information in respect of the adoption of IFRS 17 is provided in note 1(d).\n\n## Financial impacts\n\nGroup consolidated equity attributable to shareholders of Aviva plc, has reduced by \u00a32,523 million relative to the \u00a319,202 million reported on an IFRS 4 basis at 31 December 2021. The value of the CSM liability recognised is \u00a36,146 million (gross of tax). The additional impact of the prior period correction for with-profits business on this CSM is explained in note 1(a)(ii).\n\nThe material components of the total impact are explained below.\n\n## Reclassification and derecognition in the restated opening statement of financial position\n\nUnder IFRS 17, the concepts of acquired value in force (AVIF), deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and unallocated divisible surplus (UDS) are no longer applied to produce separately recognised assets and liabilities in relation to insurance and participating investment contracts, instead they are implicitly included in the measurement of insurance contract assets and liabilities. \u00a3956 million AVIF, \u00a3751 million DAC and \u00a3(1,960) million UDS on long-term insurance and participating investment contracts has been derecognised on transition. \u00a31,078 million DAC on non-life insurance contracts has been presented as a reclassification to insurance contract liabilities. AVIF and DAC in respect of non-participating investment contracts are unchanged.\n\nThere are also changes in presentation and content of the following financial statement line items:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-participating investment contract liabilities and related reinsurance assets to which IFRS 9 applies, are now presented in separate line items;\n- \u00b7 Participating investment contracts to which IFRS 17 applies, are presented within insurance and participating investment contract assets or liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Receivables, payables and other liabilities in respect of insurance contracts to which IFRS 17 applies, are now included within insurance and participating investment contract assets or liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Policy loans to which IFRS 17 applies have been reallocated from loans to insurance contract and participating investment contract liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The principles of deferred tax mean that  the total tax (current and deferred) remains aligned to the reported profits. The  transition CSM includes profits that were previously reported in accordance with  IFRS 4 and subject to tax. The reduction in net assets on adoption of IFRS 17,  including the CSM recognition, gives rise to deferred tax asset as tax on profits is  only paid once. The deferred tax asset will reverse as the CSM unwinds and  profits are recognised in future. |                    |\n| Total                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 866 (2,776)        |\n\nThe impact on transition to IFRS 17 is most significant for the Group's annuity and protection business where the deferral of profit in the CSM is the most material. A significant proportion of the CSM on transition arises from the Group's existing immediate annuity portfolio, the unwind of which will become a material driver of the contribution to future profits by the UK & Ireland Insurance, Wealth and Retirement (IWR) operating segment. Offsetting this, the majority of profits on new annuity and protection business will now be deferred. In addition, under IFRS 17, the impact of changes in non-financial assumptions on future cash flows will be adjusted through the CSM and spread forward rather than being recognised immediately in profit as under IFRS 4.\n\nThere are more limited impacts from the Group's other lines of insurance business, with no impact for business out of scope of IFRS 17 including non-participating investment contracts, equity release mortgage loans, and investment management business.\n\n## Financial impact of transition to IFRS 9\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has no financial impact on the opening 1 January 2022 statement of financial position or the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2022 as it has not changed the measurement of the Group's financial instruments. Further information in respect of the adoption of IFRS 9 is set out in note 1(e).\n\n## (ii) Accounting for with-profits funds\n\nA review of accounting processes for with-profits funds has identified corrections to previous reported values on the consolidated statement of financial position and comparative amounts have been restated. The costs of providing policyholders with certain annuity benefits were incorrectly allocated between shareholder and with-profits funds. Correction of the cumulative misallocation from the shareholder funds to with-profits funds has resulted in an increase in participating with-profits insurance contract liabilities of \u00a3312 million (including an increase in participating CSM of \u00a317 million) and a decrease in shareholder equity of \u00a3241 million, net of reinsurance recoveries and tax on the statement of financial position as at 1 January 2022.\n\nThe income statement for the period ended 31 December 2022 has not been restated, as the impact on profit for the year was insignificant, as was the impact on the income statement for the period ended 31 December 2023 and previously reported periods.\n\nThe Half Year Report 2023 included an adjustment for \u00a350 million of misallocations identified at that point in time which reduced insurance revenue during the six months to 30 June 2023 and increased insurance contract liabilities at 30 June 2023. This amount has been included within the total estimated prior period correction at 1 January 2022 and 30 June 2023 comparatives will be adjusted accordingly in the interim accounts to 30 June 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## (d) Further information in respect of adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, participating investment contracts and reinsurance contracts. It introduces a model that measures groups of contracts based on the present value of future cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk (the fulfilment cash flows) and a CSM representing the unearned profit to be recognised in profit or loss over the service period (coverage period).\n\nLosses on contracts that are onerous at inception are recognised immediately. The core of IFRS 17 is the GMM, supplemented by the VFA which is a specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features, and the PAA which is a simplified model for short duration contracts.\n\nThe application of IFRS 17 significantly impacts the measurement and presentation of insurance and participating investment contracts, and reinsurance contracts. The financial impact of measurement changes is more significant for life insurance than non-life insurance contracts, however, there are significant changes to presentation and disclosures for all insurance contracts. Investment contracts with no significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features, equity release mortgage loans and investment management business are out of scope and therefore not impacted by the new standard.\n\nUnder IFRS 17 the presentation of insurance revenue and insurance service expenses in the income statement is based on the concept of insurance services provided during the period. Extensive disclosures provide information on the recognised amounts from insurance contracts and the nature and extent of risks arising from these contracts. Our disclosures will be aligned to three major groupings: life risk; life participating; and non-life (general insurance and health) which broadly align with the IFRS 17 measurement models GMM, VFA and PAA respectively. Further details of these groupings are provided in note 40.\n\nChanges in accounting policies resulting from the implementation of IFRS 17 have been applied in accordance with the transitional provisions of the standard, which impact the measurement of the CSM at the transition date. The CSM represents a liability for unearned profit, hence will be recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the contract as insurance and investment related services are provided to the customer.\n\nThe fully retrospective approach (FRA) has been used where practicable, calculating the CSM at the date of transition as if the standard had always applied. Where FRA is not practicable for a particular group of insurance contracts there is a choice to apply the modified retrospective approach (MRA) to the extent that reasonable and supportable information exists, or the fair value approach (FVA). The choice between MRA and FVA can have a significant impact on the valuation of the CSM on transition and has been made separately for each group of insurance contracts for which it is impracticable to apply FRA.\n\nFor non-life business in scope of the PAA the FRA has been used.\n\nFor life business and non-life adverse development reinsurance, the Group has applied judgement when determining whether the FRA is practicable and whether reasonable and supportable information exists to apply the MRA. For this business the following approaches have been applied on transition to IFRS 17:\n\n- \u00b7 The FRA has been used for the majority of business written or acquired since 2016, as prior to this date the risk adjustment is considered indeterminable without the benefit of hindsight due to the multiple views of risk that were reported at that time;\n- \u00b7 The MRA has been used for certain portfolios of UK individual protection business written in the period 2012-2015 and for certain portfolios of acquired UK unit-linked and with-profits business; and\n- \u00b7 The FVA has been used for all other business written prior to 2016, including annuities.\n\nOn transition, 35% of the CSM is calculated under the FRA, 9% under the MRA and 56% under the FVA.\n\n## Application of the MRA\n\nWhere information is not available to undertake the FRA the MRA allows certain modifications to be applied provided reasonable and supportable information is available to apply the modification. The aim is to achieve the closest possible outcome to the FRA.\n\nFor UK individual protection business measured using the MRA, modifications have been applied in respect of: assessment of groups using information at the transition date; determination of future cash flows and risk adjustment at the date of initial recognition; and determination of the coverage provided prior to the transition date.\n\nFor UK VFA business measured using the MRA, modifications have been applied in respect of: calculation of the CSM at the transition date; and using information available at the transition date for the assessments of contracts within the scope of IFRS 17, eligibility for the VFA measurement model and grouping of contracts.\n\nFor contracts transitioned under the FRA or MRA, the opening CSM balance at 1 January 2022 includes the effect of amortisation of the CSM for the period of retrospective restatement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Application of the FVA\n\nUnder the FVA, the CSM recognised at the transition date has been determined as the fair value of the group of contracts less the fulfilment cash flows at the transition date. Unlike the FRA and MRA, no pre-transition information is required to calculate the FVA CSM. The FVA measures the value of the CSM at the date of transition to IFRS 17, 1 January 2022, the start of the comparative period. Subsequent to the transition date, the CSM is remeasured for movements since the date of transition according to the general (non-transition) requirements of IFRS 17, however the initial fair value as at 1 January 2022 is a point in time assessment that will not be reassessed for future reporting.\n\nWhere FVA has been applied to determine the value at transition, the fair value has been derived in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement (except a demand deposit floor was not applied) and represents the price a market participant would require to assume the insurance contract liabilities in an orderly transaction. As quoted market prices are not available for groups of insurance contracts, valuation models have been used to calculate the fair value of each group at the transition date. The choice of model and inputs to the model involves judgement and this gives rise to a range of plausible fair values at the transition date.\n\nWhilst the fair value at transition impacts the size of the CSM that will subsequently be recognised in profit over the remaining life of the contracts applying the accounting policy set out in accounting policy M, the fair value model and inputs to that model will not be applied to, or result in adjustment to, any subsequent measurement of the CSM.\n\nThe valuation models determine the fair value using a cost of capital approach. Expected cash flows and the required capital to run the business are projected forward, applying an appropriate weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Inputs have been calibrated to those Aviva would expect market participants to use had they priced the insurance contracts for transfer to them at the transition date.\n\nThis is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, and involves consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 The most appropriate assumptions for use by a third party in the principal market.\n- \u00b7 The specifics of the group of insurance contracts being valued, such as the insurance cover and policyholder benefits provided and any legal requirements for its administration.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking against market transactions, where these exist.\n\nValuation inputs reference market information where available, with unobservable inputs otherwise used to estimate those that a third party would have applied as at the transition date of 1 January 2022. The most significant judgements for each portfolio were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Identification of the principal market;\n- \u00b7 The return on assets backing the insurance contracts and the consequential impact on the discount rate, particularly for UK annuities where the Solvency II capital regime was assumed to apply to market participants;\n- \u00b7 The level of regulatory capital required to support the group of insurance contracts, which reflected Aviva's total Group working range for the Solvency II cover ratio of 160%-180%, adjusted to reflect differences in market participants for specific types of insurance contracts. It was assumed that a third party would require a higher level of regulatory capital for certain UK with-profits business aligned to the legal commitments made following the reattribution of the inherited estate in 2009; and\n- \u00b7 The required rate of return on capital deployed, which reflected the characteristics of the group of contracts being measured.\n\nAll other material assumptions were aligned to the Aviva Solvency II valuation basis.\n\nThe FVA CSM on UK annuities is included within the life risk product group (total CSM at transition of \u00a34,853 million), whilst the FVA CSM on UK with-profits business measured in accordance with the VFA is included in the life participating product group (total CSM at transition \u00a31,293 million).\n\nFor business transitioning under the FVA, the Group has taken advantage of the simplification permitting contracts in different annual cohorts to be placed into a single group of contracts.\n\n## (e) Further information in respect of adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments\n\nIFRS 9 introduces new classification and measurement requirements for financial assets, resulting in the Group's financial assets being measured at FVTPL or amortised cost. The basis of classification depends on the business model for managing the cash flows from these assets and their contractual cash flow characteristics, as set out in accounting policy T. The IFRS 9 expected credit loss model for impairment is applied to any financial assets held at amortised cost and lease receivables. The outcome for financial liabilities remains unchanged as the Group has elected to recognise fair value changes attributable to own credit risk in the income statement for financial liabilities designated at FVTPL.\n\nChanges in accounting policies as a result of adopting IFRS 9 have been implemented retrospectively with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting, where the election to apply the IFRS 9 requirements for hedge accounting has been applied prospectively. Hedge relationships that were previously designated under IFRS 9 are deemed to be continuing hedges as they met the IFRS 9 criteria for hedge accounting at 1 January 2023.\n- \u00b7 Assessments that have been made on the basis of facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application of 1 January 2023, as follows:\n- -The determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held.\n- -The designation (and revocation of previous designations) of certain financial assets and financial liabilities measured at FVTPL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Integration and restructuring costs of \u00a361 million have been incurred during 2023 in relation to this simplification, with additional costs expected to be incurred over the period 2024-2028. This programme will rationalise our administration platforms to remove complexity and improve customer outcomes. The costs will cover changes to data and systems and expenditure to deliver associated efficiency savings. Benefits of this restructuring programme will include a reduction in the operating cost base of the IWR business, resulting in higher capital generation and cash remittances. These costs are included in other expenses.\n\n## 9 - Other finance costs\n\nThis note analyses the interest costs on our borrowings (which are described in note 47) and similar charges.

To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is not included in the investment variance. The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances.\n\nSimilarly, the effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are included in the investment variance and economic assumption changes.\n\nFor many types of life business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit. The profit impact of economic volatility on other business depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, exposure to financial options and guarantees, and the application of relevant IFRS 17 risk-mitigation options.\n\n## (c) Assumptions\n\nThe expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions at the start of the year between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equity and property are:\n\n|                | 2023   | 2023   | 2022 Property   | 2022 Property   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| United Kingdom | 7.2 %  | 5.7 %  | 4.4 %           | 2.9 %           |\n| Ireland        | 6.7 %  | 5.2 %  | 3.8 %           | 2.3 %           |\n| Canada         | 7.3 %  | 5.8 %  | 5.5 %           | 4.0 %           |\n\nThe expected return on equity and property has been calculated by reference to ten-year SONIA rates for the UK and the ten-year mid-price swap rate for an AA rated bank in the relevant currency for other markets, to which a risk premium is added. The use of risk premium reflects management's long-term expectations of asset return in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes. The asset risk premiums are set out in the table below:\n\n|                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity risk premium   | 3.5 %  | 3.5 %  |\n| Property risk premium | 2.0 %  | 2.0 %  |\n\nThe ten-year mid-price swap rates at the start of the year are set out in the table below:\n\n|                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| United Kingdom | 3.7 %  | 0.9 %  |\n| Ireland        | 3.2 %  | 0.3 %  |\n| Canada         | 3.8 %  | 2.0 %  |\n\nFor fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk (assessed on a best estimate basis).\n\nThe expected return on cash holdings is a 1-year risk-free rate assumption taken as at the start of the year.\n\n## (d) Analysis of investment variances and economic assumption changes\n\n## (i) Life business\n\nThe gain of \u00a3217 million (2022 restated: loss of \u00a32,306 million) in relation to investment variances and economic assumption changes on life business was primarily driven by UK 10-year term interest rates falling c.40 bps and favourable credit default experience, partly offset by a loss from hedging gains on equity markets.\n\nThe positive impact of interest rate falls and adverse impact of equity market gains reflect the fact that we hedge on a Solvency II basis rather than an IFRS basis. For example, when equity markets increase we gain from the increase in the value of future annual management charges on unit-linked products on an economic basis which are not recognised under IFRS, however, the loss from hedges in place is recognised on both Solvency II and IFRS bases.\n\nThe negative variance for 2022 was primarily driven by the significant increase in UK interest rates, with the rate on 10-year swaps increasing by 280bps during 2022. This resulted in a reduction in the value of fixed income securities and loans which was not fully offset by a reduction in the valuation of long-term insurance liabilities from the increase in the valuation interest rate. Other components of investment variances and economic assumption changes were smaller and broadly offset. These included positive impacts from hedging negative global equity returns and a reduction in the allowance for risk of default on assets backing annuities due to reduced asset values; and negative impacts from foreign exchange losses and widening of spreads on corporate bonds.",

The negative variance for 2022 was primarily driven by rising interest rates, losses from equity market falls, foreign exchange losses and credit spreads widening.\n\n## 11 - Employee information\n\nThis note shows where our staff are employed, excluding staff employed by our joint ventures and associates, and analyses the total staff costs.\n\n## (a) Employee numbers\n\nThe number of persons employed by the Group, including directors under a service contract, was:\n\n|                                      | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | Average for the year 1   | Average for the year 1   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                      | 2023 Number      | 2022 Number      | 2023 Number              | 2022 Number              |\n| Insurance, Wealth & Retirement (IWR) | 9,963            | 9,163            | 9,562                    | 8,717                    |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance       | 8,653            | 7,858            | 8,333                    | 7,680                    |\n| Canada General Insurance             | 4,657            | 4,471            | 4,643                    | 4,439                    |\n| Aviva Investors                      | 963              | 997              | 967                      | 1,069                    |\n| International investments            | 1,490            | 1,334            | 1,447                    | 1,294                    |\n| Other operations                     | 656              | 541              | 577                      | 502                      |\n| Total employee numbers               | 26,382           | 24,364           | 25,529                   | 23,701                   |\n\n## (b) Staff costs\n\n|                                    | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wages and salaries                 |        | 1,132     | 1,042     |\n| Social security costs              |        | 132       | 126       |\n| Post-retirement obligations        |        |           |           |\n| Defined benefit schemes            | 46(d)  | 27        | 23        |\n| Defined contribution schemes       | 46(d)  | 190       | 172       |\n| Profit sharing and incentive plans |        | 198       | 220       |\n| Equity compensation plans          | 33(d)  | 61        | 58        |\n| Termination benefits               |        | 14        | 17        |\n| Total staff costs                  |        | 1,754     | 1,658     |\n\n## Staff costs are charged within:\n\n|                          | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Acquisition costs        |        | 465       | 459       |\n| Claims handling expenses |        | 190       | 204       |\n| Central costs            |        | 67        | 59        |\n| Staff costs              | 8      | 1,032     | 936       |\n| Total staff costs        |        | 1,754     | 1,658     |\n\n## 12 - Directors\n\nInformation concerning individual directors' emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors' Remuneration report in the 'Corporate governance' section of this report.

As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profits and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Group's pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge/(credit) attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.\n\nThe UK corporation tax rate increased to 25% from 1 April 2023. This rate has been used in the calculation of the UK's deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIn addition, the UK government announced a reduction in the authorised surplus payments charge, applicable to withdrawing amounts from pension schemes in surplus, from 35% to 25% to take effect from 6 April 2024. This provision was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, however, its implementation is expected to reduce the deferred tax liabilities of the group by approximately \u00a343 million.\n\nDuring 2023, legislation on The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proposals to reform the international tax system and introduce a global minimum effective rate of corporation tax of 15% was enacted or substantively enacted by a number of jurisdictions in which the group operates, to take effect from 31 December 2023. In accordance with the amendments to IAS 12, endorsed in the UK on 19 July 2023, the Group has applied the exemption and not provided for deferred tax in respect of these reforms.\n\nThe Group has assessed its potential exposure, based on the available information, and has identified that the effective tax rates in most jurisdictions are either over 15% or that transitional safe harbour relief is expected to apply. Where these do not apply, the Group expects to be exposed to no greater than \u00a310 million of additional tax under these provisions in those jurisdictions.\n\n## (e) Tax paid reconciliation\n\nThe tax on the Group's profit before tax differs from the tax paid per the consolidated statement of cash flows as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Total tax charged/(credited) to income statement      | 584       | (1,209)              |\n| Deferred tax                                          | (292)     | 1,263                |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                 | 29        | 35                   |\n| Current tax recorded in other comprehensive income    | (1)       | (6)                  |\n| Accounts adjustments                                  | (264)     | 1,292                |\n| Amounts paid in (earlier)/later accounting periods    | (180)     | 131                  |\n| Amounts received relating to prior accounting periods | (72)      | (4)                  |\n| Payment timing differences                            | (252)     | 127                  |\n| Total tax paid                                        | 68        | 210                  |\n\nTotal tax paid has arisen in our main jurisdictions of the UK, Canada and Ireland by \u00a346 million, \u00a320 million and \u00a32 million, respectively (2022: \u00a3134 million, \u00a365 million and \u00a36 million). Other jurisdictions accounted for \u00a3nil million (2022: \u00a35 million).\n\nDeferred tax represents the tax on profits or losses, which are required by legislation to be taxed in a different period to which they impact the Group's financial statements. Adjustments in respect of prior years arise where the final tax liability payable to tax authorities is different from the tax charge for the period reported in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the CGU unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (i) Long-term business\n\nValue in use has been calculated based on a shareholder value of the business calculated in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders' interests. The principal adjustments relate to the exclusion of the benefit of transitional measures on technical provisions and the volatility adjustment under Solvency II, modification of the Solvency II risk margin to an economic view and removal of restrictions on contract boundaries or business scope.\n\nThe present value of expected profits arising from future new business may be included within the shareholder value and is calculated on an adjusted Solvency II basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management. These plans reflect management's best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit. The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.\n\nFuture new business profits beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate. Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.\n\nExpected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate. The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Economic assumptions are based on market data as at the end of each reporting period. The basic risk-free rate curves used to value the technical provisions reflect the curves, credit risk adjustment and fundamental spread for the matching adjustment published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the Bank of England on their websites. For the purposes of calculating value in use, the Solvency II risk margin has been modified to an economic view, with a cost of capital rate of 2%.\n\n## (iii) General insurance, health, fund management and other businesses\n\nValue in use is calculated as the discounted value of expected future profits of each business. The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering at least a three-year period. These plans reflect management's best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit. The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates and consider future risks associated with climate change.\n\nCash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate. Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.\n\nFuture profits are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate which is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The inputs include the risk-free rate of interest appropriate to the geographic location of the cash flows related to each CGU being tested, market risk premium, beta and other adjustments to factor local market risks and risks specific to each CGU.\n\n| Key assumptions                             | Extrapolated  future profits  growth rate %   |   2023 Future pre-  tax profits  discount rate % | Extrapolated  future profits  growth rate %   |   2022 Future pre-  tax profits  discount rate % |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| United Kingdom general insurance and health | 1.0                                           |                                             11.9 | 1.0                                           |                                             12.4 |\n| Ireland general insurance and health        | Nil                                           |                                              9.3 | Nil                                           |                                              9.6 |\n| Canada general insurance                    | 5.0                                           |                                             10.8 | 5.0                                           |                                             10.8 |\n\n## Results of impairment testing\n\nManagement's impairment review of the Group's cash generating units did not identify any necessary impairments to goodwill.

Comparative amounts for acquisitions and additions to other intangible assets with finite useful lives have decreased by \u00a389 million following restatement of the Succession Wealth acquisition balance sheet (see note 1(c)).\n- 2. The 2022 comparative amounts have been restated following the adoption of IFRS 17 (see note 1).\n\n## (a) Acquired value of in-force business\n\nAVIF on non-participating investment contracts is generally recoverable in more than one year. Of the total of \u00a3461 million, \u00a3409 million (2022: \u00a3464 million) is expected to be recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.\n\nAVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment, consistent with reviews conducted for other finite life intangible assets. If evidence of impairment exists, AVIF is tested at product portfolio level by reference to the value of future profits in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders' interests, consistent with the impairment test for goodwill for long term business (see note 17(b)).\n\n## (b) Other intangible assets\n\nAdditions to Internally generated intangible assets in 2023 relate to capitalisation of software costs in relation to the Group's digital initiatives. Impairments totalling \u00a3nil million (2022: \u00a34 million) have been recognised in 2023.\n\nOther intangible assets with finite useful lives primarily includes the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The joint ventures have no other contingent liabilities at 31 December 2023 (2022: none) to which the Group has significant exposure. The Group has no commitments to provide funding to property management joint ventures (2022: none).\n\nIn certain jurisdictions the ability of joint ventures to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances made by the Group is subject to local corporate or insurance laws and regulations and solvency requirements.\n\n## (b) Impairment testing\n\nInterests in joint ventures are tested for impairment of goodwill and intangibles when there is an indicator of impairment. They are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill or intangible relates to the recoverable value of that cash generating unit. Recoverable amount for long-term and general insurance businesses are calculated on a consistent basis with that used for impairment testing of goodwill, as set out in note 17(b). The recoverable amount of property management undertakings is the fair value less costs to sell of the joint venture, measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for investment property (see accounting policy R).\n\n## 20 - Interests in, and loans to, associates\n\nThis note analyses our interests in entities which we do not control but where we have significant influence.\n\n## (a) Carrying amount and details of associates\n\n(i) The movements in the carrying amount comprised:\n\n|                                               | 2023 interests \u00a3m   | 2022 interests \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| At 1 January                                  | 41                  | 118                 |\n| Share of results before tax                   | (39)                | (11)                |\n| Share of tax                                  | -                   | -                   |\n| Share of results after tax                    | (39)                | (11)                |\n| Impairment                                    | -                   | (23)                |\n| Reversal of impairment                        | -                   | 15                  |\n| Share of loss after tax                       | (39)                | (19)                |\n| Reclassification of subsidiary 1              | -                   | (73)                |\n| Reclassification from financial investments 2 | 195                 | -                   |\n| Additions                                     | 1                   | 7                   |\n| Reduction in group interest                   | (8)                 | (1)                 |\n| Dividends received from associates            | (30)                | (1)                 |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements               | -                   | 10                  |\n| At 31 December                                | 160                 | 41                  |\n\nThe Group's share of total comprehensive income related to associates is \u00a339 million loss (2022: \u00a319 million loss).\n\n## (ii) Principal associates\n\nNo associates are considered to be material from a Group perspective in either 2023 or 2022. Investments in principal associates are held by subsidiaries. The Group's principal associates are as follows:\n\n|                                        | Nature of activities   | Principal place  of business   | 2023 Proportion of  ownership  interest %   | 2022 Proportion of  ownership  interest %   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Balanced Commercial Property Trust     | Property Management    | UK                             | 23.18 %                                     | - %                                         |\n| AI UK Commercial Real Estate Debt Fund | Property Management    | UK                             | 20.90 %                                     | 20.86 %                                     |\n\n## (iii) Contingent liabilities\n\nThe associates have no contingent liabilities to which the Group has significant exposure. The Group has no commitments to provide funding to property management associates (2022: \u00a32 million).\n\nIn certain jurisdictions the ability of associates to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances made by the Group is subject to local corporate or insurance laws and regulations and solvency requirements.\n\n## (b) Impairment testing\n\nThe recoverable amount of property management undertakings is the fair value less costs to sell of the associate, measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for investment property (see accounting policy R).\n\nThere is no impairment charge in 2023. In 2022, \u00a323 million was recognised in the income statement and primarily related to the full impairment of an investment held by the UK & Ireland Life business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 23 - Lease assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group's leased assets primarily consist of properties occupied by Group companies carried at amortised cost (see note 21), leasehold investment properties carried at fair value (see note 22) which are sublet to third parties and real estate long income finance leases (see note 29). Leasehold investment properties are measured in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property (see accounting policy R).\n\nAlthough the Group is exposed to changes in the residual value at the end of the current leases to third parties on investment property, the Group typically enters into new operating leases and therefore is not expected to immediately realise any reduction in residual value at the end of these leases. Expectations about the future residual values are reflected in the fair value of the properties.\n\n## (a) The following amounts in respect of leased assets have been recognised in the Group's consolidated income statement.\n\n|                                                         |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                   |         8 |         9 |\n| Total lease expenses recognised in the income statement |         8 |         9 |\n\nTotal cash outflows recognised in the year in relation to leases were \u00a362 million (2022: \u00a363 million).\n\n## (b) Right-of-use assets\n\nThe following table analyses the right-of-use assets relating to leased properties occupied by Group companies.\n\n|                                     | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                        | 230       | 294       |\n| Additions                           | 69        | 6         |\n| Disposals                           | (1)       | (1)       |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements     | (2)       | -         |\n| Depreciation                        | (47)      | (33)      |\n| Modification of right-of-use assets | -         | (36)      |\n| At 31 December                      | 249       | 230       |\n\nThere were no gains arising from sale and leaseback transactions during the year. Included within the income statement is \u00a33 million (2022: \u00a33 million) of income in respect of sublets of right-of-use assets. Impairment of right-of-use assets was \u00a33 million (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\n## (c) Future contractual aggregate minimum lease payments\n\nLease liabilities included within note 48 total \u00a3372 million (2022: \u00a3386 million). Future contractual aggregate minimum lease payments are as follows:\n\n|                                                           |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within one year                                           |        77 |        70 |\n| Later than one year and not later than five years         |       149 |       196 |\n| Later than five years                                     |       128 |       165 |\n| Total future contractual aggregate minimum lease payments |       354 |       431 |\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nThe lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interest in the leased assets that are held by the lessor.\n\n## (d) Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable\n\nFuture contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within one year                                                                        | 192       | 227       |\n| Between one and two years                                                              | 171       | 198       |\n| Between two and three years                                                            | 154       | 175       |\n| Between three and four years                                                           | 130       | 154       |\n| Between four and five years                                                            | 113       | 128       |\n| Later than five years                                                                  | 998       | 1,162     |\n| Total future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable - operating leases | 1,758     | 2,044     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unguaranteed residual value in respect of finance leases was \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\n## 24 - Fair value methodology\n\nThis note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value and for fair value disclosures. It also provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.\n\n## (a) Basis for determining fair value hierarchy\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. Level 1 inputs implicitly reflect market view of climate risks to future cashflows.\n\n## Level 2\n\nInputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument. Level 2 inputs include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets;\n- \u00b7 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly;\n- \u00b7 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads); and\n- \u00b7 Market corroborated inputs.\n\nWhere we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2; and\n- \u00b7 In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.\n\n## Level 3\n\nInputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Examples are investment properties and commercial and equity release mortgage loans. Climate risks are factored into the inputs to Level 3 fair values as described in note 24(g).\n\nThe majority of the Group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on quoted market information or observable market data. Of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value 14.3% (2022 restated: 15.5%) of assets and 0.7% (2022: 0.9%) of liabilities are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3. Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible. Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value. Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2.",

Recurring fair value measurements are those that other IFRSs require or permit in the statement of financial position at the end of each reporting period, whereas non-recurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those that other IFRSs require or permit in the statement of financial position in particular circumstances.\n\nThe value of freehold owner-occupied properties measured on a non-recurring basis at 31 December 2023 was \u00a38 million (2022: \u00a38 million), stated at their revalued amounts in line with the requirements of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\n## (e) Valuation approach for fair value assets and liabilities classified as Level 2\n\nPlease see section (a) for a description of typical Level 2 inputs.\n\nFixed maturity securities, in line with market practice, are generally valued using an independent pricing service. These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis.\n\nPricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes. Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied. When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced from brokers.\n\nOver-the-counter derivatives are valued using broker quotes or models such as option pricing models, simulation models or a combination of models. The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.\n\nUnit Trusts and other investment funds (included under the other investments category) are valued using net asset values which are not subject to a significant adjustment for restrictions on redemption or for limited trading activity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are transferred between Levels depending on the availability of observable inputs and whether the counterparty and broker quotes are corroborated using valuation models with observable inputs.\n\n\u00a316 million (2022: \u00a3297 million) of liabilities transferred into Level 3 relate to derivatives held by our business in the UK. These have been transferred into level 3 following a change to using an internally-derived valuation model from the previous counterparty supplied valuations to ensure consistency of approach with the associated assets and liabilities held at fair value.\n\n\u00a354 million (2022: \u00a3nil) of liabilities transferred out of Level 3 relate to derivatives held by our business in the UK.\n\n## (g) Further information on Level 3 assets and liabilities\n\nThe table below shows movement in the Level 3 assets measured at fair value.\n\n|                                                                 | 2023 2022               | 2023 2022       | 2023 2022                      | 2023 2022             | 2023 2022                                       | 2023 2022               | 2023 2022       | 2023 2022                      | 2023 2022             | 2023 2022                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                 | Investment  Property \u00a3m | Loans \u00a3m        | Fixed  maturity  securities \u00a3m | Equity  securities \u00a3m | Other  investments  (including  derivatives) \u00a3m | Investment  Property \u00a3m | Loans \u00a3m        | Fixed  maturity  securities \u00a3m | Equity  securities \u00a3m | Other  investments  (including  derivatives) \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January                                                    | 5,899                   | 25,919          | 7,188                          | 331                   | 1,307                                           |                         | 7,003    29,979 | 8,477                          | 350                   | 1,530                                           |\n| Total net (losses)/gains  recognised in the income  statement 1 | (258)                   | 124             | 116                            | (50)                  | 13                                              | (1,159)                 | (6,691)         | (2,053)                        | 11                    | (214)                                           |\n| Purchases                                                       | 971                     | 2,777           | 1,531                          | 23                    | 170                                             | 434                     | 4,979           | 2,274                          | 18                    | 190                                             |\n| Issuances                                                       | -

Outside the UK, valuations are produced by external qualified professional appraisers in the countries concerned. External valuers in the UK comply with the 'Sustainability and ESG in commercial property valuation and strategic advice' professional standard issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in December 2021. In a valuation context, sustainability involves the consideration of matters that include environment and climate change, health and wellbeing, and personal and corporate responsibility that can or do impact the valuation of an asset. This includes the consideration of capital expenditure required to maintain the utility of the asset due to the longer-term obsolescence and risk.\n- \u00b7 Investment properties are valued on an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no further growth in the estimated rental value of the property. The uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The yield used to value the portfolio ranges from 20bps to 2620bps (2022: 100bps to 2160bps) with higher yields predominately relating to properties in the retail and leisure sectors. Over 95% of the portfolio is valued using spreads within the range from 20bps to 795bps (2022: 100bps to 810bps).\n\n## (ii) Loans\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial mortgage loans and Primary Healthcare loans held by our IWR business are valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model. This model calculates a Credit Risk Adjusted Value for each loan. The risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using a yield curve plus an allowance for illiquidity. Loans valued using the Portfolio Credit Risk Model have been classified as Level 3 as the liquidity premium is deemed to be non-market observable. At 31 December 2023 the liquidity premium used in the discount rate was 170bps (2022: 110bps). Future capital expenditure costs of 0.9% per annum (2022: 0.9%) are included in the modelling of the Credit Risk Adjusted Value of the loans to address climate change actions, including potential climate-related changes. The impact is a reduction in the fair value of the properties securing the loans.\n- \u00b7 Equity release mortgage loans held by our IWR business are valued using an internal model, with fair value initially being equal to the transaction price. The value of these loans is dependent on the expected term of the mortgage and the forecast property value at the end of the term, and is calculated by adjusting future cash flows for credit risk and discounting using a yield curve plus an allowance for illiquidity. At 31 December 2023 the illiquidity premium used in the discount rate was 205bps (2022: 155bps).\n- \u00b7 The equity release mortgages include a no negative equity guarantee ('NNEG') such that the cost of any potential shortfall between the value of the loan and the realised value of the property at the end of the term is recognised by a deduction to the value of the loan. Property valuations at the reporting date are obtained by taking the most recent valuation for the property and indexing using an internal house price index based on published Land Registry data. NNEG is calculated using base property growth rates reduced for the cost of potential dilapidations, using a stochastic model. In addition, a cost of capital charge is applied to reflect the variability in these cash flows. The base property growth rate assumption is RPI +0.75% (2022: RPI +0.75%) which includes a reduction to the growth rate of 0.75% per annum (2022: 0.5%) for the potential impact of climate change actions. The modelled growth rates include an adjustment for the 5-year period 2024-2028 to reflect the market view of short-term growth being lower than longterm average growth.\n- \u00b7 The combination of the adjusted rate over the first five years and the base property growth rate equates to a long-term average growth rate of 3.0% per annum at 31 December 2023 (2022: 3.1%) over a twenty five year projection. After applying the cost of capital charge, dilapidations and the stochastic distribution, the effective net long-term growth rate equates to 0.8% per annum (2022: 0.4%).\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) loans held by our IWR business are valued using a discounted cash flow model. This adds spreads for credit and illiquidity to a risk-free discount rate. Credit spreads used in the discount rate are calculated using an internally developed methodology which depends on the credit rating of each loan, credit spreads on publicly traded bonds and an estimated recovery rate in event of default and are deemed to be unobservable. At 31 December 2023, the illiquidity premium used in the discount rate was 140bps (2022: 115bps) for the PFI loans and ranged from 25bps to 594bps (2022: 25bps to 210bps) for the infrastructure loans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## (iii) Fixed maturity securities\n\n- \u00b7 Structured bond-type, non-standard debt products and privately placed notes held by our business in the UK do not trade in an active market. These fixed maturity securities are valued using discounted cash flow model, designed to appropriately reflect the credit and illiquidity risk of the instrument. These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because the valuation approach includes significant unobservable inputs and an element of subjectivity in determining appropriate credit and illiquidity spreads.\n- \u00b7 Other fixed maturity securities held by our Life business in the UK which are not traded in an active market have been valued using third-party or counter party valuations. These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transaction.\n- \u00b7 The unobservable credit and illiquidity spreads used in the discount rate range from 33bps to 499bps (2022: 25bps to 604bps) with 99% of the modelled assets valued using spreads within the range from 33bps to 419bps (2022: 25bps to 344bps). Fixed maturity securities held by our UK and Asian businesses which are not traded in an active market have been valued using third-party or counterparty valuations. These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transaction.\n\n## (iv) Equity securities\n\n- \u00b7 Equity securities which primarily comprise private equity holdings held in the UK are valued by a number of third-party specialists. These are valued using a range of techniques, including earnings multiples, forecast cash flows and price/earnings ratios which are deemed to be unobservable.\n\n## (v) Other investments (including derivatives)\n\n- \u00b7 Other investments are held for index-linked, unit-linked and with-profit funds and are valued based on external valuation reports received from fund managers. The investments consist of:\n- -Unit trusts;\n- -Other investment funds including property funds; and\n- -Derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Where valuations are at a date other than the balance sheet date, as is the case for some private equity funds, adjustments are made for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions and the fund manager's carried interest.\n\n## (vi) Liabilities\n\n- \u00b7 The principal liabilities classified as Level 3 are securitised mortgage loan notes, presented within Borrowings, which are valued using a similar technique to the related Level 3 securitised mortgage assets. These liabilities are included within the relevant liability category within the sensitivity table below.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe valuation of Level 3 assets involves a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty due to the reliance of valuation models on unobservable inputs. Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives. Level 3 valuations are sourced from independent third parties when available and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, thirdparty models or broker quotes. Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally-modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.\n- \u00b7 For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input. Sensitivities are determined by flexing inputs of internal models to a reasonable alternative, including the yield, NAV multiple or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation. For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the security's contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further details of the fair value methodology and models utilised are given in note 24(g).\n\nHealthcare, infrastructure and PFI other loans of \u00a38,766 million (2022: \u00a36,837 million) are secured against the income from healthcare and educational premises.\n\nNon-securitised mortgage loans include \u00a38,184 million (2022: \u00a37,784 million) of residential equity release mortgages, \u00a35,646 million (2022: \u00a35,971 million) of commercial mortgages and \u00a31,940 million (2022: \u00a32,000 million) relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses. The healthcare and PFI mortgage loans are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises. For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan. Although the loan principal is not government-guaranteed, the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.\n\n## Loans at amortised cost\n\nThe carrying amount of these loans at both 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 was a reasonable approximation for their fair value.\n\n## (b) Analysis of loans carried at amortised cost\n\n|                                         |                       |               |                         | Restated 1            | Restated 1    | Restated 1              |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------|\n|                                         | At amortised  cost \u00a3m | Impairment \u00a3m | 2023 Carrying  Value \u00a3m | At amortised  cost \u00a3m | Impairment \u00a3m | 2022 Carrying  Value \u00a3m |\n| Loans to banks                          | 3,815                 | -             | 3,815                   | 2,913                 | -             | 2,913                   |\n| Other loans                             | 849                   | -             | 849                     | 801                   | -             | 801                     |\n| Total loans at amortised cost           | 4,664                 | -             | 4,664                   | 3,714                 | -             | 3,714                   |\n| Less: Loans classified as held for sale | (199)                 | -             | (199)                   | -                     | -             | -                       |\n| Total loans at amortised cost           | 4,465                 | -             | 4,465                   | 3,714                 | -             | 3,714                   |\n\nThere are no material impairment provisions on these loans.\n\n## (c) Collateral\n\nLoans to banks include cash collateral received under stock lending arrangements (see note 56 for further discussion regarding these collateral positions). The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities (see note 48). The Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate in order to reduce the risk of non-recovery. This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties for the majority of the loan balances above. In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 26 - Securitised mortgages and related assets\n\nThe Group, in its IWR business, has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings. This note gives details of the relevant transactions.\n\n## (a) Description of current arrangements\n\nIn a UK long-term business subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies), in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration. The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments. The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.\n\nAll the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust. Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it has control of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements. AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.\n\nAER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies. In addition, Group companies have invested \u00a3180 million (2022: \u00a3208 million) in loan notes issued by the ERF companies. These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the statement of financial position.\n\nIn all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support. Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.\n\n## (b) Carrying values\n\nThe following table summarises the securitisation arrangements:\n\n|                                                  | Note   | Securitised  assets \u00a3m   | 2023 Securitised  liabilities \u00a3m   | Securitised  assets \u00a3m   | 2022 Securitised  liabilities \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Securitised mortgage loans and loan notes issued | 25     | 1,633                    | (1,121)                            | 1,759                    | (1,299)                            |\n| Other securitisation assets/(liabilities)        |        | 280                      | (792)                              | 286                      | (746)                              |\n| Total securitisation arrangements                |        | 1,913                    | (1,913)                            | 2,045                    | (2,045)                            |\n\nLoan notes held by third parties are as follows:\n\n|                                          | Note     | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total loan notes issued, as above        |          | 1,121     | 1,299     |\n| Less: Loan notes held by Group companies |          | (180)     | (208)     |\n| Loan notes held by third parties         | 47(c)(i) | 941       | 1,091     |\n\n## 27 - Interests in structured entities\n\nA structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Group has interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities as described below.\n\nThe Group holds redeemable shares or units in investment vehicles, which consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities comprising of securitisation vehicles that Aviva does not originate. These investments are comprised of a variety of debt instruments, including asset-backed securities and other structured securities.\n- \u00b7 Investment funds which include: hedge funds, liquidity funds, private equity funds, unit trusts, mutual funds and Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs).\n- \u00b7 Specialised investment vehicles include Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Property Limited Partnerships (PLPs), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'Investissement a Capital Variable (SICAVs), Tax Transparent Funds (TTFs) and other investment vehicles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance-based incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (a) Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has determined that where it has control over investment vehicles, these investments are consolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2023, the Group has granted loans to consolidated PLPs for a total of \u00a372 million (2022: \u00a382 million). The purpose of these loans is to assist the consolidated PLPs to purchase or construct properties. The Group has also provided support, without having a contractual obligation to do so, to certain consolidated PLPs via letters of support amounting to \u00a328 million (2022: \u00a373 million). The Group has commitments to provide funding to consolidated structured entities of \u00a3159 million (2022: \u00a3311 million), primarily relating to a commitment to provide funding to the Aviva Investors Climate Transition Real Assets Fund.\n\nThe Group has also given support to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies) that are consolidated structured entities. As set out in note 26, at the inception of the securitisation vehicles, the UK subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), has granted subordinated loan facilities to some of the ERF companies. AER receives various fees in return for the services provided to the entities. AER receives cash management fees based on the outstanding loan balance at the start of each quarter for the administration of the loan note liabilities. AER receives portfolio administration fees as compensation for managing the mortgage assets. See note 26 for details of securitised mortgages and related assets as at 31 December 2023.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group has no intentions to provide financial or other support in relation to any other investment vehicles.\n\n## (b) Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAs part of its investment activities, the Group invests in unconsolidated structured entities.

In some cases, the Group may be required to absorb losses from an unconsolidated structured entity before other parties when and if Aviva's interest is more subordinated with respect to other owners of the same security.\n\nFor commitments to property management joint ventures and associates, please see notes 19 and 20, respectively. The Group has not provided any other financial or other support in addition to that described above as at the reporting date, and there are no intentions to provide support in relation to any other unconsolidated structured entities in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn relation to risk management, disclosures on debt securities and investment vehicles are given in note 54(b).

The Group does not sponsor any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees. Management fees received for investments that the Group manages, but does not have a holding in, also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities. As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Group's maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees.\n\nThe table below shows the assets under management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those entities.\n\n|                                 | Assets under  management \u00a3m   |   2023 Investment  management  fees \u00a3m | Assets under  management \u00a3m   |   2022 Investment  management  fees \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| OEICs                           | 387                           |                                      1 | 398                           |                                      1 |\n| PLPs                            | 4,258                         |                                     16 | 4,165                         |                                     17 |\n| SICAVs                          | 831                           |                                      3 | 1,060                         |                                      4 |\n| Specialised investment vehicles | 5,476                         |                                     20 | 5,623                         |                                     22 |\n\n## 28 - Financial investments\n\nThis note analyses our financial investments by type and shows their cost and fair value.

Of this net gain, \u00a36,606 million net gain (2022: \u00a343,663 million net loss) related to investments designated as other than trading and \u00a32,173 million net gain (2022: \u00a35,020 million net loss) related to financial investments designated as trading.\n\nThe movement in the unrealised gain/loss position reported in the statement of financial position during the year, shown in the table above, includes foreign exchange movements on the translation of unrealised gains and losses on financial investments held by foreign subsidiaries, which are recognised in other comprehensive income, as well as transfers due to the realisation of gains and losses on disposal and the recognition of impairment losses.\n\n## (c) Financial investment arrangements\n\n## (i) Stock lending arrangements\n\nThe Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas in accordance with established market conventions. The majority of the Group's stock lending transactions occur in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.\n\nThe Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements, either in the form of securities or cash. See note 56 for further discussion regarding collateral positions held by the Group.\n\n## (ii) Other arrangements\n\nIn carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Group's IWR operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders. Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits. At 31 December 2023, \u00a31,570 million (2022: \u00a31,778 million) of financial investments were restricted in this way.\n\nCertain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries. Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 2022 comparative amounts have been restated following the adoption of IFRS 17 (see note 1).\n\nDeferred acquisition costs (DAC) on non-participating investment contracts are generally recoverable in more than one year. Of the above total, \u00a3767 million (2022: \u00a3684 million) is expected to be recovered in more than one year after the statement of financial position date. Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, the amount expected to be recovered is estimated and actual experience will differ.\n\nDAC for non-participating business decreased overall over 2023 as increases from new business sales were more than offset by amortisation.\n\nWhere amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.\n\nAt both 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 the DAC balance has been restricted by the value of projected future profits.\n\n## 31 - Pension surpluses, other assets, prepayments and accrued income\n\n## (a) Pension surpluses and other assets - carrying amount\n\nThe carrying amount comprises:\n\n|                                          | Note   |   2023 '\u00a3m | 2022 '\u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Surpluses in the staff pension schemes   | 46(a)  |        817 | 1,192      |\n| Other assets                             |        |         45 | 42         |\n| Total pension surpluses and other assets |        |        862 | 1,234      |\n\nSurpluses in the staff pension schemes and \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a314 million) of other assets are recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.\n\n## (b) Prepayments and accrued income\n\nPrepayments and accrued income of \u00a33,392 million (2022: \u00a32,822 million) are all expected to be recovered within one year.\n\n## 32 - Ordinary share capital\n\nThis note gives details of Aviva plc's ordinary share capital and shows the movements during the year.\n\n## (a) Carrying amount\n\nDetails of the Company's ordinary share capital are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                        | 2023 '\u00a3m   | 2022 '\u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| The allotted, called up and fully paid share capital of the Company was: 2,739,487,140 |            |            |\n| (2022: 2,807,964,676) ordinary shares of 32 17/19  pence each                          | 901        | 924        |\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting that took place on 4 May 2023, the Company was authorised to allot up to a further maximum nominal amount of:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00a3614 million of which \u00a3307 million can be in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue\n- \u00b7 \u00a3150 million in relation to any issue of Solvency II compliant capital instruments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

All the ordinary shares in issue carry the same right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid by the Company.\n\n## (i) Share buyback\n\nOn 9 March 2023, Aviva announced a share buyback programme for up to a maximum aggregate consideration of \u00a3300 million to commence on 10 March 2023 (the \"Programme\"). On 2 June 2023, Aviva announced that it had successfully completed the Programme. In total, 72,797,191 shares were purchased with a nominal value of \u00a324 million and were subsequently cancelled, giving rise to an additional capital redemption reserve of an equivalent amount. The 72,797,191 shares were acquired at an average price of 412 pence per share.\n\nOn 31 March 2022, Aviva completed the share buyback programme originally announced on 12 August 2021, and extended to an aggregate purchase of up to \u00a31 billion on 16 December 2021. In total, 245,225,489 shares were purchased with a nominal value of \u00a361 million and were subsequently cancelled, giving rise to an additional capital redemption reserve of an equivalent amount. The 245,225,489 shares were acquired at an average price of 408 pence per share. 79,587,629 shares were purchased during 2022, had a nominal value of \u00a319 million, for total consideration of \u00a3336 million and were acquired at an average price of 423 pence per share.\n\n## (ii) Return of capital to ordinary shareholders via B share scheme\n\nOn 2 March 2022, Aviva announced a proposed return of capital, including a \u00a33,750 million B Share Scheme for the holders of ordinary shares. 3,687,322,000 B shares were issued for nil consideration with a nominal value of 101.69 pence per share on 16 May 2022, resulting in a total of \u00a33,750 million being credited to the B share capital account. At the same time, the merger reserve was reduced by \u00a33,750 million. On 17 May 2022, the B shares were redeemed at 101.69 pence per share, which resulted in a \u00a33,750 million reduction in the B share capital account and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve. Retained earnings reduced by \u00a33,750 million on payment of the return of capital to ordinary shareholders.\n\n## (iii) Share consolidation\n\nOn 16 May 2022, the Company's share capital was consolidated whereby 76 new ordinary shares of 32 17/19 pence were issued for each holding of 100 ordinary shares of 25 pence each. The number of ordinary shares in issue reduced by 884,957,280 from 3,687,322,000 to 2,802,364,720.\n\n## (c) Subsequent events\n\nOn 6 March 2024, Aviva plc approved a share buyback of its ordinary shares for up to a maximum aggregate consideration of \u00a3300 million which is expected to commence on 8 March 2024. The buyback will reduce IFRS net asset value and Solvency II own funds by \u00a3300 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant. The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options. 13,599,458 options were exercised during the year (2022: 6,238,086).\n\n## (ii) Share awards\n\nThe fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant based on the following weighted average assumptions:\n\n| Weighted average assumption                                         | 2023       | 2022       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Share price                                                         | 393p       | 404p       |\n| Expected volatility 1                                               | 33 %       | 33%        |\n| Expected volatility of comparator companies' share price 1          | 30 %       | 35%        |\n| Correlation between Aviva and comparator competitors' share price 1 | 55 %       | 51%        |\n| Expected life 1                                                     | 3.00 years | 3.00 years |\n| Expected dividend yield                                             | 0.00 %     | 0.00%      |\n| Risk-free interest rate 1                                           | 3.32 %     | 1.49%      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

From 2021, we satisfy awards and options granted under the Group's share plans primarily through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts. This note gives details of the shares held in these trusts.\n\nMovements in the carrying value of shares held by employee trusts comprise:\n\n|                         | number       | 2023 \u00a3m   | number      | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| At 1 January            | 19,986,626   | 85        | 12,363,684  | 51        |\n| Acquired in the year    | 18,905,610   | 76        | 23,539,378  | 101       |\n| Distributed in the year | (17,698,769) | (74)      | (9,850,409) | (41)      |\n| Share consolidation     | -            | -         | (6,066,027) | (26)      |\n| At 31 December          | 21,193,467   | 87        | 19,986,626  | 85        |\n\nThe shares are owned by employee share trusts with an undertaking to satisfy awards of shares in the Company under the Company's share plans and schemes. Details of the features of the plans can be found in the directors' remuneration report and/or in note 33.\n\nThese shares were either purchased in the market or, in 2015, new shares were issued to the trust and are carried at weighted average cost. At 31 December 2023, they had an aggregate nominal value of \u00a36,971,535 (2022: \u00a36,575,548) and a market value of \u00a392,128,001 (2022: \u00a388,500,780). The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held in the trusts.\n\n## 35 - Preference share capital\n\nThe issued and paid up preference share capital of the Company at 31 December was:\n\n|                                                                         |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 100,000,000 8.375% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of \u00a31 each |       100 |       100 |\n| 100,000,000 8.75% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of \u00a31 each  |       100 |       100 |\n| Total preference share capital                                          |       200 |       200 |\n\nThe issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.\n\nOn a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares. Holders are entitled to receive dividends out of the profits available for distribution and resolved to be distributed in priority to the payment of dividends to holders of ordinary shares. The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the fair value of Aviva plc's preference share capital was \u00a3261 million (2022: \u00a3247 million) .\n\n## 36 - Tier 1 notes\n\nThe carrying amount of Tier 1 notes at 31 December was:\n\n|              |   2023 '\u00a3m |   2022 '\u00a3m |\n|--------------|------------|------------|\n| Tier 1 notes |        496 |        496 |\n\nOn 15 June 2022, Aviva plc issued \u00a3500 million of 6.875% fixed rate reset perpetual Restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes (the RT1 notes). The RT1 notes are callable at par between 15 December 2031 and 15 June 2032 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and thereafter every five years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 15 June 2032 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 4.649%. The notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of Aviva plc and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The RT1 notes are therefore treated as equity and the coupon payment is recognised directly in equity. During the year coupon payments of \u00a334 million were made (2022: \u00a317 million). On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of Aviva plc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Capital Reductions received Court approval on 23 May 2023 and were effected on 25 May 2023.\n\n## (c) Aviva plc company\n\nRetained earnings of Aviva plc, the Company, were \u00a310,589 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a35,248 million) (see note H on the Company Financial statements). The retained earnings of the Company were not impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 2022 comparative amounts have been restated following the adoption of IFRS 17 and for a correction in respect of historic accounting for with-profits funds (see note 1).\n- 2. The movement in 2022 relates to the acquisition of an additional 25% of the ordinary shares of Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited giving Aviva a controlling interest in the entity.\n\nIncluded within the carrying amounts are: the present value of expected future cashflows, representing a best estimate view; risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and CSM representing the unearned profit for future service.\n\nThe carrying amount for reinsurance contracts are recognised separately from insurance contract balances. Detailed movements on both are included in sections 40(b)(i) to 40(b)(iii).\n\nThe following summarises movements in CSM that have occurred during the year:\n\n|                                         | Life risk \u00a3m   | Participating \u00a3m   | Non-life \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | Life risk \u00a3m   | Participating \u00a3m   | Non-life \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|----------------------------|\n| CSM in respect of insurance contracts   |                |                    |               |                 |                |                    |               |                            |\n| At 1 January                            | 5,714          | 1,218              | -             | 6,932           | 4,951          | 1,312              | -             | 6,263                      |\n| CSM recognised for services provided    | (729)          | (151)              | -             | (880)           | (578)          | (172)              | -             | (750)                      |\n| Other movements in CSM                  | 2,393          | (27)               | -             | 2,366           | 1,341          | 78                 | -             | 1,419                      |\n| At 31 December                          | 7,378          | 1,040              | -             | 8,418           | 5,714          | 1,218              | -             | 6,932                      |\n| CSM in respect of reinsurance contracts |                |                    |               |                 |                |                    |               |                            |\n| At 1 January                            | (452)          | -                  | -             | (452)           | (100)          | -                  | -             | (100)                      |\n| CSM recognised for services received    | 80             | -                  | -             | 80              | 63             | -                  | -             | 63                         |\n| Other movements in CSM                  | (798)          | -                  | -             | (798)           | (415)          | -                  | -             | (415)                      |\n| At 31 December                          | (1,170)        | -                  | -             | (1,170)         | (452)          | -                  | -             | (452)                      |\n| Net CSM at 1 January                    | 5,262          | 1,218              | -             | 6,480           | 4,851          | 1,312              | -             | 6,163                      |\n| Net CSM at 31 December                  | 6,208          | 1,040              | -             | 7,248           | 5,262          | 1,218              | -             | 6,480                      |\n\n- 1. The 2022 comparative amounts have been restated following the adoption of IFRS 17 and for a correction in respect of historic accounting for with-profits funds (see note 1).\n\nOther movements in CSM include:\n\n- \u00b7 Recognition of additional CSM in respect of new insurance and reinsurance contracts recognised in the year;\n- \u00b7 Remeasurement of existing contracts (covering non-financial assumption changes and experience variances for all contracts, plus financial assumption changes and experience variances for contracts in scope of the VFA); and\n- \u00b7 For contracts in scope of the GMM, interest accretion on the CSM balance which is recognised within net finance expense/income from insurance contracts.\n\nEach of these items can be seen in more detail in the respective tables in section 40(b)(i) for life risk and 40(b)(ii) for participating.\n\nFor insurance contracts the largest driver of the movement in CSM for both 2022 and 2023 is longevity assumption changes on annuity contracts. These assumption changes are described in more detail in note 43.\n\nThe CSM recognised for services provided on insurance contracts in the year of \u00a3880 million (2022: \u00a3750 million) is a key component of insurance revenue.\n\nThe CSM asset in respect of reinsurance contracts has also increased primarily reflecting lower expected reinsurance recoveries due to longevity assumption changes in the underlying insurance contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other movements in risk adjustment include the risk adjustment established on new business (details of which can be seen in note 40(d)), the impact of movements in discount rates, a reduction in the risk adjustment due to changes in longevity assumptions, and for 2023 the impact of reforms to the Solvency II risk margin in the UK.\n\nDuring 2022, there was a significant fall in net risk adjustment, driven by the large rise in discount rates.\n\n## Movements in carrying amounts of insurance and reinsurance contracts\n\nThe following reconciliations present the movements in the carrying amounts of insurance and reinsurance contracts in each product group.\n\nFor life risk and participating contracts each table presents a different analysis of the movements in both insurance and reinsurance balances. The first disclosure, split by remaining coverage and incurred claims, presents the income statement items that constitute insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and net expenses from reinsurance contracts. The sum of these items represents the contribution to insurance service result. Movements in the balances relating to finance expenses and cash flows are shown below the insurance service result.\n\nIn the second disclosure, split by measurement component (present value of expected future cash flows, risk adjustment and CSM), the movements are presented by driver of change. The insurance service result and subsequent movements have consistent totals across the two disclosure tables.\n\nFor non-life business all gross contracts are measured under the PAA so have no CSM. The movements in balances are presented split by remaining coverage and incurred claims with the incurred claims further analysed between the cash flow and risk adjustment components. For reinsurance contracts the same presentation is used to show total reinsurance contracts. A further table then follows to display the results exclusively for the sub-group of reinsurance contracts relating to adverse development cover, which are the only non-life contracts measured under the GMM and have no CSM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 2022 comparative amounts have been restated following the adoption of IFRS 17 (see note 1).\n- 2. The movement in 2022 relates to the acquisition of an additional 25% of the ordinary shares of Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited giving Aviva a controlling interest in the entity.\n\nKey changes that impact the income statement include the release of CSM for services provided and the release of risk adjustment for expired risks.\n\nChanges that relate to future service include:\n\n- \u00b7 New contracts initially recognised in the year which give rise to a CSM liability representing unearned future profit on service yet to be provided;\n- \u00b7 Experience variances and assumption changes on profitable contracts that impact the expected fulfilment cash flows and adjust the CSM liability; and\n- \u00b7 Recognition of new onerous contracts and experience variances or assumption changes on onerous contracts impacting the income statement immediately.\n\nThe changes in estimates that increase the CSM include the effect of both experience variances and assumption changes on expected future cash flows. Assumption changes included in the changes in estimates that increases the CSM at 31 December 2023 of \u00a31,768 million relate primarily to spouses of BPA scheme members and changes to longevity assumptions. The changes in estimates that increase the CSM at 31 December 2022 of \u00a3746 million, primarily reflects a change to longevity assumptions.\n\nAssumption changes are explained in more detail in note 43.\n\nThe net finance expenses from insurance contracts of \u00a34,157 million (2022: \u00a319,053 million net finance income) recognised in the income statement includes the impact of the change in financial assumptions, the unwind of discounting on the fulfilment cash flows and interest accretion on the CSM. There were significant increases in discount rates during 2022, with smaller changes in discount rates during 2023.",

Each table shows how the Group's estimates of total claims for each accident year have developed over time and reconciles the cumulative claims to the amount included in the statement of financial position. Balances have been translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date as per note 2.\n\nIn the claims development table, the cumulative claim payments and estimates of cumulative claims for each accident year are translated into sterling at the exchange rates that applied at the end of that accident year. The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table. Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as 'paid' at the date of disposal.\n\nThe claims development table include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written more than 10 years ago. The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at\n\n31 December 2023 were \u00a378 million (2022: \u00a386 million). The movement in asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the year reflects an decrease of \u00a3(8) million due to favourable claims development and claims payments net of reinsurance recoveries.",

Accounting policy C sets out the critical accounting judgements and the material accounting estimates that are considered particularly susceptible to changes in estimates and assumptions. This note provides further detail of how these are applied in the context of IFRS 17.\n\nThe Group underwrites life business primarily in the UK and Ireland. This is mainly written in the 'Non-Profit' funds and in a number of 'With-Profits' sub-funds. In the 'Non-Profit' funds shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits. In the 'With-Profits' sub-funds the with-profits policyholders are entitled to between 40% and 100% of distributed profits, depending on the fund rules. There is also the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account (RIEESA) in the UK, which does not itself underwrite any business, but provides capital support to one of the 'WithProfits' sub-funds and receives any surplus or deficit emerging from it. In the RIEESA, shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these can only be distributed in line with the criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme.\n\nThe Group underwrites non-life business in the UK, Ireland and Canada, providing individual and corporate customers with a wide range of insurance products.\n\nSignificant judgments, estimates and assumptions associated with measuring insurance products and associated reinsurance are outlined below.\n\n## (i) Fulfilment cash flows\n\nFulfilment cash flows comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 estimates of future cash flows;\n- \u00b7 an adjustment (discount rate) to reflect the time value of money and the financial risks related to future cash flows, to the extent that the financial risks are not included in the estimates of future cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 a risk adjustment.\n\nThe Group's objective in estimating future cash flows is to determine the expected value of a range of scenarios that reflects the full range of possible outcomes. A deterministic approach, producing point estimates based on best estimate assumptions, is used for valuing most of the Group's business. The exception is for contracts with embedded options and guarantees, in particular with-profits participation business, where a stochastic approach based on the average of a number of scenarios is used. Stochastic modelling involves projecting future cash flows under a large number of possible economic scenarios for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.\n\n## Estimates of future cash flows\n\nIn estimating future cash flows, the Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date. This information includes both internal and external historical data about claims and other experience, updated to reflect current expectations of future events.\n\nThe estimates of future cash flows reflect the Group's view of current conditions at the reporting date, using market variables consistent with observable market prices, where applicable.\n\nWhen estimating future cash flows, the Group takes into account current expectations of future events that might affect those cash flows. However, expectations of future changes in legislation that would change or discharge a present obligation or create new obligations under existing contracts are not taken into account until the change in legislation is substantively enacted. For cash flows which are contractually linked to an index of prices or wages, the Group derives an assumption for future RPI from RPI swap curves, and adjusts this to derive future inflation assumptions for other price and wage indices.\n\nCash flows within the boundary of a contract relate directly to the fulfilment of the contract, including those for which the Group has discretion over the amount or timing. These include payments to (or on behalf of) policyholders, insurance acquisition cash flows and other costs that are incurred in fulfilling contracts.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows arise from the activities of selling, underwriting and starting a group of contracts that are directly attributable to the portfolio of contracts to which the group belongs. This includes initial and recurring commissions payable on instalment premiums receivable within the contract boundary. Other costs that are incurred in fulfilling the contracts include:\n\n- \u00b7 claims handling, maintenance and administration costs;\n- \u00b7 costs that the Group will incur in providing investment services;\n- \u00b7 costs that the Group will incur in performing investment activities to the extent that the Group performs them to enhance benefits from insurance coverage for policyholders by generating an investment return from which policyholders will benefit if an insured event occurs; and\n- \u00b7 income tax and other costs specifically chargeable to the policyholders under the terms of the contracts.\n\nInsurance acquisition cash flows and other costs that are incurred in fulfilling contracts comprise both direct costs and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nCash flows are attributed to acquisition activities, other fulfilment activities and other activities at local entity level using activity-based costing techniques. Cash flows attributable to acquisition and other fulfilment activities are allocated to groups of contracts using methods that are systematic and rational and are consistently applied to all costs that have similar characteristics.\n\n## Contract boundaries\n\nThe assessment of the contract boundary, which defines which future cash flows are included in the measurement of a contract, requires judgement and consideration of the Group's substantive rights and obligations under the contract as follows.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nGroup protection policies issued by the Group have terms that are guaranteed to be renewable every two or three years. The Group determines that the cash flows related to future renewals (i.e. the guaranteed renewable terms) of these contracts are outside the contract boundary. This is because the premium charged for the period reflects the Group's expectation of its exposure to risk for that period and, on renewal, the Group can reprice the premium to reflect the reassessed risks for the next period based on claims experience and expectations for the respective portfolio. Any renewal of the contract is treated as a new contract and is recognised, separately from the initial contract, when the recognition criteria are met.\n\nPension savings contracts with guaranteed annuity terms allow the policyholder to convert, on maturity of the stated term, the maturity benefit into an immediately starting life-contingent annuity at a predetermined rate. The Group has assessed the contract boundary for the entire contract, including the option, and concluded that the cash flows related to the fulfilment of the annuity option fall within the boundary of the contract. This is because the Group does not have the practical ability to reprice the contract on maturity of the stated term.\n\n## Reinsurance contracts\n\nQuota share - The Group manages risks arising from Life insurance contracts through external quota share reinsurance contracts. These reinsurance contracts cover underlying contracts issued within the term on a risk-attaching basis and provides unilateral rights to both the Group and the reinsurer to terminate the cession of new business subject to giving notice to the other party. Notice can usually be given at any time, with termination to new business effective three months from notice being given, albeit a limited number of the Group's quota share reinsurance contract currently stipulate a different notice period. On initial recognition, the cash flows within the reinsurance contract boundary are determined to be those arising from underlying contracts that the Group expects to issue and cede under the reinsurance contract within the next three months. Subsequently risks expected to attach beyond the end of this initial notice period are considered cash flows of new reinsurance contracts and are recognised, separately from the initial contract, as they fall within the rolling three-month notice period.\n\nExcess of loss - The Group's non-Life excess of loss reinsurance contracts held provide coverage for claims incurred during an accident year. Thus, all cash flows arising from claims incurred and expected to be incurred in the accident year are included in the measurement of the reinsurance contracts held. Some of these contracts include mandatory reinstatement premiums, which are guaranteed per the contractual arrangements and are thus within the contract boundary. Estimated reinstatement premiums due are offset against recoveries within the liability for incurred claims.\n\nRisk attaching reinsurance - The Group's risk-attaching non-life treaties have varying coverage periods, ranging from annual treaties to indefinite treaties. Such treaties provide unilateral rights to the Group and reinsurer to terminate the cession of new business by giving notice to the other party based upon notice periods defined by the treaty. On initial recognition, the cash flows within the reinsurance contract boundary are determined to be those arising from underlying contracts that the Group expects to issue and cede under the reinsurance contract within the termination notice period. Subsequently risks attaching beyond the end of the initial termination notice period are considered cash flows of new reinsurance contracts and are recognised, separately from the initial contract, as they fall within subsequent termination notice periods.\n\nAdverse development cover - The Group's non-Life adverse development cover treaties are deemed to expire when all uncertainty associated with the ceded claims liabilities has expired. The contract boundary is based upon the best estimate of when all obligations associated with the liabilities will be extinguished.\n\n## Life contracts\n\nDeath and other claim benefits\n\nDeath and other claim benefits are projected using decrements appropriate to each class of business, including persistency, mortality and morbidity.\n\nMortality assumptions are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends. Local, generally accepted, published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.",

For females the underlying mortality assumptions, before risk adjustment, are 101.3% of PFA16\\_IND with base year 2016 (2022 restated: 100.3% of PFA16\\_IND with base year 2016). The base rates on some contracts are adjusted for lifestyle, medical, and other factors.\n\nImprovements before risk adjustment are based on 'CMI\\_2022 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments' (2022 restated: 'CMI\\_2021 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments') with zero weight on 2022 data within the model. Instead of placing weight on 2022 data within the CMI improvements model, a separate adjustment is made to reflect the impact that the drivers of excess mortality in 2022 and 2023 are expected to have in future years. We use a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% for both males and females (31 December 2022 restated: 1.5% for both males and females) . An allowance has been made to adjust for greater mortality improvements in the annuitant population relative to the general population on which CMI\\_2022 is based, using a parameter of 0.15% for males and 0.20% for females, tapering to zero between ages 90 and 110 (for 2022 the same approach was taken with respect to CMI\\_2021). Long-term improvement rates are set to taper to zero between ages 85 and 110 (2022 restated: between 85 and 110).\n\n## Expenses\n\nMaintenance expense assumptions for life business are generally expressed as a per policy charge set with regards to an allocation of current year expense levels by category of business, adjusted for known changes in contractual arrangements with external suppliers and using the policy counts for in-force business. Expenses are generally charged to with-profits funds using a fixed per policy charge in line with a memorandum of understanding between the withprofits funds and the non-profit fund within the company. Any differential between that and the total charge for each policy accrues to the non-profit fund and is also included in the fulfilment cash flows. The assumptions also include an allowance for future expense inflation over the lifetime of each contract, which is assumed to be in line with RPI. An additional liability is held if projected per policy expenses in future years are expected to exceed current assumptions. A further allowance is made for non-discretionary project costs that typically relate to mandatory requirements. Investment expense assumptions are generally expressed as a proportion of the assets backing the liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Non-life contracts\n\nThe Group establishes reserves for claim events that occurred before the valuation date, whether reported or not. When calculating claim costs, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation. Where non-Life contracts are onerous, the measurement of the loss component includes an estimate of future claims that are expected to occur within the remaining coverage period.\n\nThe undiscounted ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.\n\nThe assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based. Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome. The ultimate cost of outstanding claims includes provision for expenses associated with handling claims.\n\n## UK mesothelioma claims\n\nThe level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities. UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Group's latent claims. The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees. The best estimate of the liabilities considers the latest available market information and studies and how these might impact Aviva's liabilities.\n\n## Lump sums payable to bodily injury claimants\n\nLump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims are influenced by the Ogden discount rate among other factors. The Ogden discount rate is set by the Lord Chancellor and is applied when calculating the present value of future care costs and loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes. The Lord Chancellor's next review of the Ogden discount rate is expected to begin by summer 2024 and its impact upon the valuation of claims has been estimated on a probability weighted basis which considers a range of possible outcomes from the review.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nAll cash flows are discounted using risk-free yield curves adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity of the insurance contracts. For the risk-free yield curves, the Group generally uses the risk-free interest rate curves published by the PRA and EIOPA for regulatory reporting, which are based on swap rates and in the UK based on SONIA (Sterling Over Night Index Average). In Canada, the Group uses the Bank of Canada zero-coupon bond curve. Where necessary, yield curves are interpolated between the last available market data point and an ultimate forward rate, which reflects long-term real interest rate and inflation expectations.\n\nThe Group uses a bottom-up discount rate for all life and non-life insurance contracts except for annuities. A top-down discount rate is applied to annuities to reflect more appropriately the characteristics of the annuity liabilities. For other contracts where liabilities are subject to lapse risk or where cash flows depend on underlying asset performance (such as unit-linked and with-profits), the characteristics of the liability can be reflected using the bottom-up method which requires the application of less judgement.\n\nUnder the top-down approach, the discount rate is determined from the yield implicit in the fair value of an appropriate reference portfolio of assets that reflects the characteristics of the liabilities. Adjustments are made for differences between the reference portfolio and liability cash flows, including an allowance for defaults which reflects the compensation a market participant would require for credit risk.\n\nFor the measurement of new annuity business at inception only, the discount rates are based on assets expected to be originated for new business at initial recognition of the contracts. On subsequent measurement of the fulfilment cash flows the reference portfolio is based on the assets held to match the portfolio of liabilities. For recently written contracts, an adjustment is made to liabilities where appropriate assets are yet to be sourced.\n\nUnder the bottom-up approach, the discount rate is determined as the risk-free yield, adjusted for differences in liquidity characteristics between the financial assets used to derive the risk-free yield and the relevant liability cash flows (known as an 'illiquidity premium').\n\nFor UK and Ireland business, the illiquidity premium is determined as a percentage of the current spread over the riskfree yield on an index of covered bonds. For Canadian business, the illiquidity premium is determined with reference to a spread of bonds available on the market. The percentage applied reflects the liquidity characteristics of the liabilities including the propensity and ability of policyholders to lapse or surrender their contracts; for example, 100% for structured settlements where surrenders are not possible, and 0% for unit-linked contracts where policyholders can normally immediately surrender their contract for the unit value. An intermediate percentage is applied for other types of business. In Canada, a single illiquidity premium is selected given the limited duration differences and similar liquidity characteristics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions for defaults or, in the case of equity release assets, expected losses arising from the No-Negative-Equity Guarantee. These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating.\n\nThe risk allowances made for corporate bonds (including overseas government bonds and structured finance assets), mortgages (including healthcare mortgages, commercial mortgages and infrastructure assets), and equity release equated to 36bps, 25bps, and 89bps respectively at 31 December 2023 (2022 restated: 35bps, 26bps, and 83bps respectively).\n\nFor with-profits business, the liabilities associated with guarantees and options are measured using a market-consistent stochastic model. The cash flows are discounted at scenario-specific rates calibrated, on average, to be the bottom-up discount rates. Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.\n\n|                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity returns   | 17.8 % | 19.3 % |\n| Property returns | 15.0 % | 15.0 % |\n\nThe equity volatility used depends on term, moneyness and region. The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a ten-year term.\n\n## Risk adjustments for non-financial risk\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk reflects the compensation required by the Group to accept the uncertainty about the amount and timing of future cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. The calculation of the risk adjustment is calibrated with reference to the Group's pricing and capital allocation framework. The calibration leverages the Solvency II view of non-financial risk, considering a lifetime view, but excludes financial risks which are included within the Solvency II risk margin. The risk adjustment includes diversification between different portfolios of insurance and participating investment contracts, financial and non-financial risks, non-participating investment contracts and other non-insurance contracts using correlation matrix techniques. Diversification between entities across the Group is not included.\n\nFor life business, the risk adjustment is allocated to individual contracts, including reinsurance contracts, using provisions for adverse deviation (PADs) applied to the best estimate non-financial assumptions.",

Initially the Group applies these techniques on a net of reinsurance basis before calculating gross up factors for each group of contracts and calculating the reinsurance risk adjustment as the difference between net and gross.\n\nFor with-profits contracts the risk adjustment reflects the shareholder's interest in the with-profits fund. However, for non-profit contracts in the with-profit funds, the fund is treated as the entity and the risk adjustment reflects a 100% share of the risk, as for other non-profit business.\n\nThe Group estimates the Risk Adjustment's corresponding confidence level by comparing the combined value of best estimate cash flows and Risk Adjustment with a distribution of possible outcomes on an ultimate horizon. For life and participating contracts the confidence interval, net of reinsurance corresponds to the 68th percentile (2022: 70th percentile), for non-life contracts it corresponds to the 77th percentile (2022: 74th percentile). The percentiles disclosed benefit from the diverse profile of entities within the Group, but not from diversification between the Group's Life and non-Life segments and are uncertain estimates made as of 31 December, which could reasonably change within 12 months. Factors which could cause them to change include variations in the Company's risk profile or quantification thereof, for example as might arise from economic factors such as changes in risk-free discount rates or changes in the composition of insurance liabilities. the movements in the value of the net risk adjustment required to move the confidence level by 2.5 percentage points can be seen in the table below. The figures assume that there are no changes in estimate of future cashflows when in reality a lot of factors which influence the risk adjustment calibration will also impact the estimate of future cashflows.\n\n|                                                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Life and participating business                                               |           |           |\n| Movement in net risk adjustment required for 2.5pp confidence level increase  | 65        | 75        |\n| Movement in net risk adjustment required for 2.5pp confidence level reduction | (65)      | (75)      |\n| Non-Life business                                                             |           |           |\n| Movement in net risk adjustment required for 2.5pp confidence level increase  | 45        | 48        |\n| Movement in net risk adjustment required for 2.5pp confidence level reduction | (41)      | (46)      |\n\nFor Life risk and Participating contracts, this is the confidence level that the liabilities recognised and associated reinsurance balances, excluding CSM, are sufficient to cover the ultimate cost of in-force insurance liabilities applying period end assumptions. For non-Life contracts, this represents the confidence level that net claims liabilities recognised are sufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims. Net non-Life claims liabilities include the liability for incurred claims, asset for incurred claims and the asset for remaining coverage on reinsurance contracts held that reinsure against adverse development on incurred claims.\n\n## (ii) Contractual service margin\n\n## Determination of coverage units\n\nThe amount of CSM recognised in profit or loss to reflect services provided in each year is determined by considering, for each group of contracts, coverage units that reflect the quantity of the benefits provided in each period and the expected coverage period. The coverage units are reviewed and updated at each reporting date.\n\nThe coverage units used by major product lines are:\n\n| Product line                           | Coverage units                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Immediate annuity                      | Annuity outgo                                                                                                                                               |\n| Deferred annuity                       | Annuity outgo for insurance service post retirement and weighted expected  investment return for the investment return service provided prior to retirement |\n| Individual and Group Protection        | Sum assured                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Individual and Group Income Protection | Benefit amount payable                                                                                                                                      |\n| Unit linked insurance                  | Sum assured including unit value                                                                                                                            |\n| With-profits                           | Cost of guarantees plus asset share                                                                                                                         |\n\nFor deferred annuities, judgement has been applied in determining the appropriate method for measuring coverage units and the weighting of those coverage units across the investment return service provided prior to retirement and the insurance service provided post-retirement. That judgement was supported by evidence of market pricing of these services, resulting in an approach that targets equivalence at retirement with the CSM for immediate annuities (when pricing in an active market) that provide an insurance service equivalent to that provided by the deferred annuities postretirement.\n\nThe coverage units for the investment return service combine the expected investment return with the weighting that produces the target CSM after allowing for expected retirement date, transfers and commutations. There is limited estimation uncertainty arising when applying this approach, not least because the weighting of services does not directly impact on the measurement of the CSM, instead it impacts on the pattern of CSM release over the long life of these contracts. Expected investment return is calculated using the locked in discount rate throughout the life of the contract, to represent the investment return that policyholders benefit from through the pricing of their contract.",

An economic offset exists between the insurance contracts and the risk-mitigating items (derivatives and financial investments held at FVTPL), and credit risk does not dominate the economic offset.\n\nFor the with-profit sub-fund supported by the RIEESA, the Group has chosen to apply the risk mitigation option. Certain changes in variable fee cash flows are recognised in profit or loss, and do not adjust the CSM, as they arise from changes in equity and interest rate risks that are mitigated by the use of derivatives and financial investments held at FVTPL.\n\n## (iii) Investment components\n\nThe Group identifies the investment component of a contract by determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the policyholder in all scenarios with commercial substance. These include circumstances in which an insured event occurs or the contract matures or is terminated without an insured event occurring. Investment components and rights to withdraw are both excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses, and variances between actual and expected cash flows adjust the CSM.\n\nParticipating and some non-participating whole-life contracts have explicit surrender values. The non-distinct investment component excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses is determined as the surrender value specified in the contractual terms.\n\nImmediate annuities with a guarantee period contain a non-distinct investment component equal to the value of those guaranteed payments.\n\nDeferred annuities include a non-distinct investment component if all of the following features are present:\n\n- \u00b7 transfer value in the deferral period;\n- \u00b7 death benefit in the deferral period; and\n- \u00b7 guarantee period once the annuity is in payment.\n\nThe investment component excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses is determined as the lower of the present value of each of those possible payments. Any amounts in excess of the investment component, or any payments made under those features that do not qualify as an investment component, are treated as rights to withdraw. In either case, transfer values paid during the deferral period are presented as premium refunds.\n\n## (iv) Fair value of insurance contracts and measurement of contracts on transition to IFRS 17\n\nThe Group has measured the fair value of insurance contracts when it acquired contracts in a business combination and when it applied the fair value approach on transition to IFRS 17. The Group has also applied the modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 17.\n\nFor further details on the measurement of contracts on transition to IFRS 17, see note 1(d).\n\n## 41 - Non-participating investment contracts\n\nThis note analyses our gross liabilities for non-participating investment contracts by type of product and describes the calculation of these liabilities.\n\n## (a) Carrying amount\n\nNon-participating investment contracts as at 31 December comprised:\n\n|                                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Liabilities for non-participating investment contracts        | 158,588   | 141,188              |\n| Reinsurance assets for non-participating investment contracts | (4,713)   | (5,290)              |\n| Net non-participating investment contracts                    |           | 153,875    135,898   |\n\n## (b) Group practice\n\nInvestment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer and if they do not contain a significant discretionary participation feature they are treated as financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9.\n\nMany investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits. These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology as prescribed by IFRS 17 insurance contracts.",

For non-participating investment contracts designated at FVTPL, the Group elects to present the change in fair value attributable to a change in the credit risk of the contracts in the income statement.\n\nOf the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, \u00a3158,498 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a3141,160 million) are unit -linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units, plus if required, additional non-unit reserves based on a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nThese contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number of units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.\n\nFor unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term. The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 30 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 49.\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts acquired in a business combination, an acquired value of in-force business asset is recognised in respect of the fair value of the investment management services component of the contracts, which is amortised on a systematic basis over the useful lifetime of the related contracts. The amount of the acquired value of in-force business asset is shown in note 18, which relates primarily to the acquisition of Friends Life in 2015 and Friends First in 2018.\n\n## (c) Movements in the year\n\nThe following movements have occurred in the gross provisions for non-participating investment contracts in the year:\n\n| Carrying amount                                           | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| At 1 January                                              | 141,188   | 151,295              |\n| Liabilities in respect of new business                    | 4,243     | 4,120                |\n| Expected change in existing business                      | (3,263)   | (3,185)              |\n| Variance between actual and expected experience           | 16,589    | (11,360)             |\n| Impact of operating assumption changes                    | -         | (17)                 |\n| Impact of economic assumption changes                     | -         | (106)                |\n| Other movements recognised as an expense                  | 40        | 28                   |\n| Change in liability                                       | 17,609    | (10,520)             |\n| Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals | -         | -                    |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements                           | (164)     | 415                  |\n| Other movements 2                                         | (45)      | (2)                  |\n| At 31 December                                            | 158,588   | 141,188              |\n\nFor unit-linked investment contracts, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit. The variance between actual and expected experience in 2023 of \u00a316,589 million is due to increases in global equity markets and higher bond and gilt values as a result of decreasing interest rates.\n\nThe impacts of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, which combines non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.\n\nThe following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset for non-participating investment contracts in the year:\n\n| Carrying amount                                 | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| At 1 January                                    | 5,290     | 5,122                |\n| Assets in respect of new business               | 88        | 409                  |\n| Expected change in existing business assets     | (261)     | (176)                |\n| Variance between actual and expected experience | 456       | (63)                 |\n| Other movements recognised as an expense 2      | (815)     | -                    |\n| Change in asset                                 | (532)     | 170                  |\n| Other movements 3                               | (45)      | (2)                  |\n| At 31 December                                  | 4,713     | 5,290                |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 42 - Financial guarantees and options\n\nThis note details the financial guarantees and options inherent in some of our insurance and investment contracts.\n\nFor insurance and participating investment contracts, the Group's objective in estimating future cash flows is to determine the expected value of a range of scenarios that reflects the full range of possible outcomes. For contracts with embedded options and guarantees, in particular with-profits business, a stochastic approach based on the average of a number of scenarios is typically used. Stochastic modelling involves projecting future cash flows under a large number of possible economic scenarios for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.\n\n## (a) UK non-profit business\n\nThe material guarantees and options relating to non-profit business are:\n\n## (i) Guaranteed annuity options\n\nThe Group's UK non-profit funds have written contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options (GAOs), where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates. Provision for these guarantees do not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to \u00a324 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 restated: \u00a329 million).\n\n## (ii) Guaranteed unit price on certain products\n\nCertain pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death. No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.\n\n## (iii) Return of Premium guarantees\n\nGerman pension products sold in Friends Life between 2006 and 2014 are subject to a return of premium guarantee whereby the product guarantees to return the maximum of the unit fund value or total premiums paid (before deductions). Provisions for this guarantee are calculated using a market-consistent stochastic model and amount to \u00a388 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 restated: \u00a385 million).\n\n## (b) UK with-profits business\n\nThe material guarantees and options relating to with-profit business are:\n\n## (i) Maturity value and death benefit guarantees\n\nSignificant conventional and unitised with-profits business have minimum maturity (and in some cases death benefit) values reflecting the sum assured plus declared annual bonus. For some unitised with-profits life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in retail price index (RPI) or consumer price index (CPI).\n\n## (ii) No market valuation reduction (MVR) guarantees\n\nFor unitised business, there are circumstances where a 'no MVR' guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.\n\n## (iii) Guaranteed annuity options\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates. The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.\n\nLiabilities for the cost of guarantees in respect of GAOs in the UK with-profits funds were \u00a3545 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 restated: \u00a3556 million). With the exception of the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA, movements in the GAO liabilities in the with-profits funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the estate to be distributed between policyholders and shareholders. The (immediate) impact on profit arises from the mismatch between the remeasurement of the variable fee (using current market consistent financial assumptions) and remeasurement of the CSM (using locked-in financial assumptions), together with the incremental amortisation of the change to the CSM. Liabilities for GAOs in the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA were \u00a344 million at 31 December 2023 (2022 restated: \u00a341 million).\n\n## (iv) Guaranteed minimum pension\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pension as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.\n\n## (v) Guaranteed minimum maturity payments on mortgage endowments\n\nThe with-profits funds made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profits mortgage endowments. Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Guarantees and options are measured using stochastic methods, and for some smaller with-profit funds closed form solutions.\n\n## 43 - Effect of changes in non-financial assumptions and estimates during the year\n\nThis note analyses the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions from 2022 to 2023, on liabilities for insurance and investment contracts, and related assets and liabilities, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and acquired value of in-force business and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.\n\n|                                                           | 2023                                         | 2023             | 2023                | 2022                                        | 2022             | 2022                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| Assumptions                                               | Change in  Fulfillment  Cash Flows  (FCF) \u00a3m | Change in CSM \u00a3m | Effect on profit \u00a3m | Change in  Fulfillment Cash  Flows (FCF) \u00a3m | Change in CSM \u00a3m | Effect on profit \u00a3m |\n| Expenses                                                  | 59                                           | (63)             | 4                   | 13                                          | (65)             | 52                  |\n| Persistency rates                                         | (9)                                          | 9                | -                   | 11                                          | (6)              | (5)                 |\n| Mortality and morbidity for assurance contracts           | 18                                           | (18)             | -                   | (65)                                        | 105              | (40)                |\n| Mortality for annuity contracts                           | (456)                                        | 528              | (72)                | (486)                                       | 258              | 228                 |\n| Tax and other assumptions                                 | (98)                                         | 108              | (10)                | (26)                                        | 14               | 12                  |\n| Long-term insurance and participating investment business | (486)                                        | 564              | (78)                | (553)                                       | 306              | 247                 |\n| Expenses                                                  | -                                            | -                | -                   | (18)                                        | -                | 18                  |\n| Long-term non-participating investment business           | -                                            | -                | -                   | (18)                                        | -                | 18                  |\n| Total                                                     | (486)                                        | 564              | (78)                | (571)                                       | 306              | 265                 |\n\nThe impact of change in mortality and morbidity assumptions for assurance contracts for both 2023 and 2022 relates mainly to a review of recent experience. In 2022 business also moved onto the latest CMI series tables.\n\nLongevity assumption changes during this year are valued at \u00a3456 million reduction in FCF (valued at opening market discount rates) and \u00a3528 million increase in CSM (discount rates locked in at the time of business inception), giving a total loss of \u00a372m. The three largest contributors (in order of importance) are\n\n- \u00b7 introduction of an explicit adjustment for post-pandemic mortality,\n- \u00b7 updates to the mortality improvement model moving onto the latest CMI\\_2022 model from CMI\\_2021, to incorporate revised population data, and\n- \u00b7 improved assumptions for the proportion of BPA customers that are married.\n\nLongevity assumptions changes in 2022 were valued at \u00a3486 million reduction in FCF (valued at opening market discount rates) and \u00a3258 million increase in CSM (discount rates locked in at the time of business inception), giving a total profit of \u00a3228 million.\n\nThe three largest contributors (in order of importance) were:\n\n- \u00b7 Updates to the rate of mortality improvements for a change to the long-term-rate rate used to taper improvements at the oldest ages from between ages 90 to 115 to between ages 85 to 110\n- \u00b7 Updates to mortality improvements moving onto the latest CMI\\_2021 model from CMI\\_2019\n- \u00b7 Updates to base mortality to reflect methodology and process refinements on BPA business.\n\nTax and other assumptions in 2023 is mainly comprised of changes in provisions for risk adjustment on annuities, where the movements in FCF and CSM largely offset.\n\n## 44 - Tax assets and liabilities\n\nThis note analyses the tax assets and liabilities that appear in the statement of financial position and explains the movements in these balances in the year.\n\n## (a) Current tax\n\nCurrent tax assets recoverable and liabilities payable in more than one year are \u00a385 million and \u00a31 million (2022: \u00a3116 million and \u00a310 million), respectively.\n\nThe Group is party to the CFC & Dividend Group Litigation Order, which challenged the tax treatment of dividends received from non-UK entities before 2009. The Group is attempting to recover claims from HMRC covered by this judgement.

These positions are expected to reverse as the market recovers. The deferred tax asset relates to UK tax losses which carry forward indefinitely and is recognised based on probable future taxable investment income and gains within five years. Assumed investment returns are consistent with actuarial assumptions used in reserving and alternative assumptions modelled by the Group also show full recovery of the deferred tax asset over this period.\n\nWhere shareholder deferred tax assets are not supported by deferred tax liabilities, they are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the tax losses can be utilised. In assessing future profitability, the directors have relied on board approved business plans and profit forecasts for up to five years and the Group's history of taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.\n\n## (ii) The net deferred tax asset/(liability) arises on the following items:\n\n|                                                                   | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Long-term business technical provisions and other insurance items | 500       | 362                  |\n| Deferred acquisition costs                                        | (6)       | (30)                 |\n| Unrealised gains on investments                                   | (245)     | (187)                |\n| Pensions and other post-retirement obligations                    | (145)     | (250)                |\n| Unused losses and tax credits                                     | 267       | 459                  |\n| Intangibles and additional value of in-force long-term business   | (207)     | (237)                |\n| Provisions and other temporary differences                        | 341       | 562                  |\n| Net deferred tax asset                                            | 505       | 679                  |\n\n## (iii) The movement in the net deferred tax asset/(liability) was as follows:\n\n|                                                | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Net asset/(liability) at 1 January             |        | 679       | (941)                |\n| Acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries       |        | -         | (57)                 |\n| Amounts (charged)/credited to income statement | 14(a)  | (292)     | 1,263                |\n| Amounts credited to other comprehensive income | 14(b)  | 119       | 412                  |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements                |        | (1)       | 2                    |\n| Net asset at 31 December                       |        | 505       | 679                  |\n\nThe Group has unrecognised gross tax losses (excluding capital losses) and other temporary differences of \u00a3347 million (2022 restated: \u00a3487 million) to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned. Of these, trading losses of \u00a344 million (2022: \u00a326 million) will expire within the next eight years.

These have no expiry date.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, a potential deferred tax liability of \u00a322 million (2022 restated: \u00a314 million) is not recognised on temporary differences relating to reserves of overseas subsidiaries which are not expected to be distributed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, Ireland and Canada. The assets and liabilities of these defined benefit schemes as at 31 December are shown below.\n\n|                                                | Note      | UK \u00a3m    | Ireland \u00a3m   | Canada \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | UK \u00a3m    | Ireland \u00a3m   | Canada \u00a3m   | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Total fair value of scheme assets              | 46(b)(ii) | 10,678   | 678          | 190         | 11,546          | 10,877   | 689          | 197         | 11,763          |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation    |           | (10,211) | (679)        | (249)       | (11,139)        | (10,002) | (670)        | (259)       | (10,931)        |\n| Net IAS 19 surpluses/(deficits) in the schemes |           | 467      | (1)          | (59)        | 407             | 875      | 19           | (62)        | 832             |\n| Surpluses included in other assets             | 31        | 809      | 8            | -           | 817             | 1,166    | 26           | -           | 1,192           |\n| Deficits included in provisions                | 45        | (342)    | (9)          | (59)        | (410)           | (291)    | (7)          | (62)        | (360)           |\n| Net IAS 19 surpluses/(deficits) in the schemes |           | 467      | (1)          | (59)        | 407             | 875      | 19           | (62)        | 832             |\n\nThis note relates to the defined benefit pension schemes included in the table above. The charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section (b)(i) below, whilst the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section (d) below.\n\nUnder the IAS 19 valuation basis, the Group applies the principles of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, whereby a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the RAC (2003) Pension Scheme and Friends Provident Pension Scheme (FPPS), in the UK and in the Aviva Ireland Staff Pension Fund (AISPF) in Ireland, the Group has determined that the rules set out in the schemes' governing documentation provide for an unconditional right to a refund from any future surplus funds in the schemes.\n\nThe assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees. In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes' beneficiaries. The longterm investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.\n\nA funding actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members. Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.\n\nThe number of scheme members was as follows:\n\n| Number           | UK     | Ireland   | Canada   | 2023 Total   | UK     | Ireland   | Canada   | 2022 Total   |\n|------------------|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|--------|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| Deferred members | 37,906 | 2,182     | 213      | 40,301       | 39,843 | 2,200     | 344      | 42,387       |\n| Pensioners       | 41,212 | 975       | 1,228    | 43,415       | 40,501 | 982       | 1,261    | 42,744       |\n| Total members    | 79,118 | 3,157     | 1,441    | 83,716       | 80,344 | 3,182     | 1,605    | 85,131       |\n\nAll schemes are closed to future accrual. Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with additional future accrual for active members.\n\n## (i) UK schemes\n\nIn the UK, the Group operates three main pension schemes, the ASPS, the RAC Scheme which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011 and the FPPS, which was acquired as part of the Friends Life acquisition in 2015. As the defined benefit sections of the UK schemes are now closed to both new members and future accrual, existing deferred members in active service and new entrants participate in the defined contribution section of the ASPS. The UK schemes operate within the UK pensions' regulatory framework.\n\n## (ii) Other schemes\n\nIn Ireland, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Ireland Staff Pension Fund (AISPF) and the Friends First Group Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (FFPS) which was acquired as part of the Friends First acquisition in June 2018. Future accruals for the AISPF and FFPS schemes ceased with effect from 30 April 2013 and 1 April 2014 respectively. The Irish schemes are regulated by the Pensions Authority in Ireland.\n\nThe Canadian defined benefit pension plan ceased accruals with effect from 31 December 2011. The Canadian pension plan currently in force is a Defined Contribution Pension Plan that is subject to the Pensions Benefits Act (Ontario), Income Tax Act (Canada), and oversight of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario.\n\n## (b) IAS 19 disclosures\n\nDisclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, Ireland and Canada, are given below. Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.",

Due to different measurement bases applying for accounting purposes, the premium paid by the scheme exceeded the valuation of the scheme asset recognised. In the table above, this has been recognised as a loss in the actual return on assets (see note 57 for further information). The scheme assets recognised are transferable and so have not been subject to consolidation within the Group's financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Economic movements, including movements in interest rates and in spreads on government and corporate bonds, and movements impacting other assets. This has resulted in an increase in the valuation of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) not fully offset by the increase in the fair value of fixed income securities and other assets.\n- \u00b7 The losses were partially offset by actuarial gains relating to updated demographic assumptions (including longevity).\n\n## (ii) Scheme assets\n\nScheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December. Total scheme assets are comprised by country as follows:\n\n|                                                                                | UK \u00a3m   | Ireland \u00a3m   | Canada \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | UK \u00a3m   | Ireland \u00a3m   | Canada \u00a3m   | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Bonds                                                                          | 7,804   | 545          | -           | 8,349           | 7,969   | 530          | 63          | 8,562           |\n| Equities                                                                       | -       | 18           | -           | 18              | -       | 18           | -           | 18              |\n| Property                                                                       | 14      | -            | -           | 14              | 74      | -            | -           | 74              |\n| Pooled investment vehicles                                                     | 2,093   | 253          | 185         | 2,531           | 1,710   | 273          | 132         | 2,115           |\n| Derivatives                                                                    | 3       | 52           | -           | 55              | (158)   | 56           | -           | (102)           |\n| Insurance policies                                                             | 3,992   | -            | -           | 3,992           | 3,423   | -            | -           | 3,423           |\n| Repurchase agreements                                                          | (2,436) | (203)        | -           | (2,639)         | (646)   | (191)        | -           | (837)           |\n| Cash and other 1                                                               | (361)   | 13           | 5           | (343)           | (1,063) | 3            | 2           | (1,058)         |\n| Total fair value of scheme assets                                              | 11,109  | 678          | 190         | 11,977          | 11,309  | 689          | 197         | 12,195          |\n| Less: consolidation elimination for non- transferable Group insurance policy 2 | (431)   | -            | -           | (431)           | (432)   | -            | -           | (432)           |\n| Total IAS 19 fair value of scheme assets                                       | 10,678  | 678          | 190         | 11,546          | 10,877  | 689          | 197         | 11,763          |\n\n- 1.

Where the investments are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in 'Cash and other'. There are no significant judgements involved in the valuation of the scheme assets. Insurance policies are valued on the same basis as the pension scheme liabilities, as required by IAS 19.\n\n## (iii) Assumptions on scheme liabilities\n\nThe valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent funding actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the standard's requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2023.\n\n## The projected unit credit method\n\nThe inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis. This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method. This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings. It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe main financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are:\n\n|                                                                          | UK                                                                       | Ireland                                                                  | 2023 Canada                                                              | UK                                                                       | Ireland                                                                  | 2022 Canada                                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Inflation rate 1                                                         | 3.1 %                                                                    | 2.1 %                                                                    | 2.75 %                                                                   | 3.5 %                                                                    | 2.6 %                                                                    | 2.75 %                                                                   |\n| General salary increases 2                                               | 5.2 %                                                                    | 3.6 %                                                                    | 3.25 %                                                                   | 5.3 %                                                                    | 4.1 %                                                                    | 3.25 %                                                                   |\n| Pension increases 3                                                      | 3.2 %                                                                    | 0.6 %/0.7 %                                                              | -

For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.\n\n## Mortality assumptions\n\nMortality assumptions are material in measuring the Group's obligations under its defined benefit schemes. The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.\n\nThe mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2023 for scheme members are as follows:\n\n|         |

mortality tables. The tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience. However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption. For the ASPS, which is the most material scheme to the Group, the allowance for mortality improvement is per the actuarial profession's CMI\\_2022 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments model (2022: CMI\\_2021 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments) with zero weight on 2022 data within the model. Instead of placing weight on 2022 data within the CMI improvements model, a separate adjustment is made to reflect the impact that the drivers of excess mortality in 2022 and 2023 are expected to have in future years. There is a long-term improvement rate of 1.50% for both males and females (2022: 1.50% for both males and females). The CMI\\_2022 tables have been adjusted to allow for greater mortality improvements in the annuitant population relative to the general population on which CMI\\_2022 is based, using a parameter of 0.15% for males and 0.20% for females, tapering to zero between ages 90 and 110 (for 2022 the same approach was taken with respect to CMI\\_2021). Long-term improvement rates are set to taper to zero between ages 85 and 110 (2022: long-term improvement rates taper to zero between ages 85 and 110).\n\n## Illustrative sensitivity analysis\n\nSignificant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are discount rate, inflation rate and mortality. Movements in the defined benefit obligation are mitigated by the impact on the assets from economic movements including interest rates and price inflation, as well as the longevity sensitivity impact due to the insurance policy and longevity swap assets held by the UK pension schemes. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined by changing the respective assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant.",

The effect of assuming all members in the schemes were one year younger.\n\nIt is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\n## Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation\n\nThe discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 13 years (2022: 13 years) in ASPS, 15 years (2022: 15 years) in FPPS, 13 years (2022: 14 years) in the RAC scheme, 15 years (2022: 15 years) in AISPF, 22 years (2022: 23 years) in FFPS and 9 years (2022: 9 years) in the Canadian scheme.\n\nThe expected undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme, ASPS, is shown in the chart below:\n\n## Undiscounted benefit payments (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iv) Risk management and asset allocation strategy\n\nThe investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes. To meet these objectives, the schemes' assets are invested in a portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities as detailed in section (b)(ii). The investment strategy continues to evolve over time and is expected to match the liability profile closely with swap overlays to improve interest rate and inflation matching. The schemes are generally matched to interest rate and inflation risk relative to the funding bases.\n\n## Main UK scheme\n\nThe Company works closely with the trustee, who is required to consult with the Company on the investment strategy.\n\nInterest rate and inflation rate risks are managed using a combination of liability-matching assets and swaps. Exposure to equity and property risk has been reducing over time and credit risk is managed within risk appetite. Currency risk is relatively small and is largely hedged. The other principal risk is longevity risk. This risk has reduced due to the ASPS entering into a longevity swap in 2014 covering approximately \u00a33.5 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.\n\nSince October 2019 the ASPS has completed multiple bulk annuity buy-in transactions with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, a Group Company. These transactions have covered approximately \u00a33.4 billion of liabilities related to deferred pensioners and current pensioners, removing the investment and longevity risk for these members from the scheme.\n\n## Other schemes\n\nThe other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme. In 2015, the RAC pension scheme entered into a longevity swap covering approximately \u00a30.4 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.",

The assumptions adopted for triennial actuarial valuations are determined by the trustees and agreed with the Group and are normally more prudent than the assumptions adopted for IAS 19 purposes, which are best estimate.\n\nFor the ASPS, the latest formal actuarial valuation was completed with an effective date of 31 March 2021 and showed that the ASPS was fully funded on its technical provisions basis consistent with the requirements of the UK pension regulations.\n\nContributions of around \u00a360 million are expected to be paid during 2024. This includes cash settlements from the non-transferable annuity policy, as well as deficit reduction contributions to the FPPS, AISPF and Canadian scheme.\n\n## (c) Defined contribution (money purchase) section of the ASPS\n\nThe trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds. Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their risk appetite and their retirement plans. Members of this section contribute at least 2% of their pensionable salaries, and depending on the percentage chosen, the Group contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits. These contribution rates remained unchanged until June 2017. From 1 July 2017, for every 1% additional employee contribution, the Group will contribute an additional 0.1% employer contribution.

Further details about these notes are given in note 26.\n\n## (ii) The contractual maturity dates of undiscounted cash flows for these borrowings are:\n\n|                                           | Principal \u00a3m   |   Interest \u00a3m | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | Principal \u00a3m   |   Interest \u00a3m | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Within one year                           | 331            |            42 | 373             | 260            |            60 | 320             |\n| 1 to 5 years                              | 314            |           138 | 452             | 306            |           194 | 500             |\n| 5 to 10 years                             | 350            |           133 | 483             | 370            |           197 | 567             |\n| 10 to 15 years                            | 125            |            66 | 191             | 145            |           151 | 296             |\n| Over 15 years                             | 20             |            19 | 39              | 29             |            43 | 72              |\n| Total contractual undiscounted cash flows | 1,140          |           398 | 1,538           | 1,110          |           645 | 1,755           |\n\nThe carrying value of the loan notes issued in connection with IWR lifetime mortgages is \u00a3345 million lower (2022: \u00a3331 million lower) than the anticipated payment at maturity.

The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment of interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the relevant Property Fund and they have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders' funds of any companies in the Group. Loans of \u00a3207 million (2022: \u00a3143 million) included in the table above relate to Property Funds.\n\nOther non-recourse loans primarily include external debt raised by special purpose vehicles in the IWR long-term business. The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the shareholders' funds of any companies in the Group. The outstanding balance of these loans at 31 December2023 was \u00a352 million (2022: \u00a352 million).\n\n## (v) Securitised mortgage loan notes\n\nLoan notes have been issued by special purpose securitisation companies in the UK.

These approaches are designed to produce a best estimate of the cost of settling liabilities, with a risk adjustment reflecting the uncertainty associated with these liabilities. The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ, for example because experience may be worse than that assumed, or future non-life business claims inflation may differ from that expected, and hence there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.\n\n## Business Interruption\n\nThere continues to be a significant degree of uncertainty in relation to business interruption claims arising from COVID-19 and on-going test case litigation. On 17 October 2022, the High Court handed down its judgment on the preliminary issues trial of Stonegate Pub Co Ltd vs MS Amlin Corp Member Ltd (and others) and related cases. Aviva was not a party to the cases but is affected by the final outcome of these cases. The High Court ruled in favour of the parties on different issues, and all parties initially appealed the majority of the preliminary decisions made by Justice Butcher. Whilst the Greggs and Stonegate actions settled after the appeals on confidential terms the Court of Appeal heard the remaining Various Eateries v Allianz appeals and on 16 January 2024 handed down judgment dismissing both parties appeals. As a result the decisions of the High Court by Justice Butcher stand.\n\nIn Canada, we are party to a number of litigation proceedings challenging coverage under certain policies; however, we believe we have a strong argument that there is no pandemic coverage under these policies. In the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been established for such claims based on information available at the reporting date. The Group purchases reinsurance protection on its property portfolio that includes coverage for business interruption and is collecting or seeking reinsurance recoveries of business interruption losses that are covered by reinsurance .\n\nFor further information on our general insurance risk management see note 54(f).\n\n## (b) Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards\n\nIn the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards. Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in the UK, Ireland and Canada. Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty. However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims and substantial reinsurance cover now in place, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.\n\n## (c) Guarantees on long-term savings products\n\nAs a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and investment products. Note 42 gives details of these guarantees and options. Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level. The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## (d) Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Group's insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates. A number of the Group's UK subsidiaries are dual regulated (directly authorised by both the PRA (for prudential regulation) and the FCA (for conduct regulation)) while others are solo regulated (regulated solely by the FCA for both prudential and conduct regulation). Between them, the PRA and FCA have broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firm's authorisation; to investigate marketing and sales practices; and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.\n\nThe Group's regulated businesses have compliance resources to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and take corrective action when warranted. However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.\n\nThe impact of any such finding (whether in the UK or overseas) could have a negative impact on the Group's reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers. Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results, operations and/or financial condition and divert management's attention from the day-to-day management of the business.\n\n## (e) Structured settlements\n\nThe Group has purchased annuities from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants. As a result of these arrangements, the Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for these types of arrangements is approximately \u00a3537 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a3641 million) . Credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability. This risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the Canadian life insurance industry compensation plan. As at 31 December 2023, no information has come to the Group's attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in life insurers from which it has purchased annuities and consequently no provision for credit risk is required.\n\n## (f) Other\n\nIn the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation. In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.\n\nIn addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group. In the opinion of the directors, no material unprovisioned loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.\n\nThere are a number of charges registered over the assets of Group companies in favour of other Group companies or third parties. In addition, certain of the Company's assets are charged in favour of certain of its subsidiaries as security for intra-Group loans.\n\n## 51 - Commitments\n\nThis note gives details of our commitments to capital expenditure. See note 23 for further information on lease commitments.\n\nContractual commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures of infrastructure loans, equity funds, investment property and property and equipment, which have not been recognised in the financial statements, are as follows:\n\n|                              | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Infrastructure loan advances | 104       | 384       |\n| Investment property          | 191       | 361       |\n| Property and equipment       | -         | 70        |\n| Other investment vehicles\u00b9   | 193       | 246       |\n| Total commitments            | 488       | 1,061     |\n\nNotes 19 and 20 set out the commitments the Group has to its joint ventures and associates.\n\n## 52 - Group capital management\n\n## (a) Group capital\n\nThe Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory it operates in. At a Group level, we have to comply with the requirements established by the PRA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Solvency II capital regime requires insurers to calculate regulatory capital adequacy at both individual regulated subsidiaries and an aggregate Group level. Non-UK entities have been included in Group solvency in line with Solvency II requirements. Other financial sector entities (including fund management) are included at their proportional share of the capital requirement according to the relevant sectoral values. In addition, non-UK businesses including Canada, are subject to the locally applicable capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nGroup capital is represented by Solvency II own funds. The Solvency II position disclosed is based on a 'shareholder view'. The shareholder view is considered by management to be more representative of the shareholders' risk exposure and the Group's ability to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) with eligible own funds and aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position.\n\nIn arriving at the shareholder position, the following adjustments are made to the regulatory Solvency II own funds:\n\n- \u00b7 The contribution to the Group's SCR and own funds of the most material fully ring fenced with-profits funds of \u00a31,408 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a31,369 million) and staff pension schemes in surplus of \u00a3397 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u00a3394 million) are excluded. These exclusions have no impact on Solvency II surplus as these funds are self-supporting on a Solvency II capital basis with any surplus capital above SCR not recognised;\n- \u00b7 A notional reset of the transitional measure on technical provisions (TMTP), calculated using the same method as used for formal TMTP resets. This presentation avoids step changes to the Solvency II position that arise only when the formal TMTP reset points are triggered. The 31 December 2023 Solvency II position is based on a formal reset of the TMTP, in line with the requirement to reset the TMTP at least every two years and hence no adjustment is required. The 31 December 2022 Solvency II position includes a notional reset.\n\n|                                                              | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Estimated Solvency II regulatory own funds as at 31 December | 18,824    | 18,668    |\n| Adjustments for:                                             |           |           |\n| Fully ring-fenced with-profits funds                         | (1,408)   | (1,369)   |\n| Staff pension schemes in surplus                             | (397)     | (394)     |\n| Notional reset of TMTP                                       | -         | (437)     |\n| Estimated Solvency II shareholder own funds at 31 December   | 17,019    | 16,468    |\n\nSolvency II own funds are comprised of a combination of shareholders' funds, preference share capital, subordinated debt, and deferred tax assets measured on a Solvency II basis. During the year, the Group redeemed \u00a30.3 billion of Tier 2 subordinated debt and issued \u00a30.5 billion of of Tier 2 subordinated debt (see note 47).\n\nSolvency II surplus at the Group level represents the excess of eligible Solvency II own funds over the Group's solvency capital requirements calculated in accordance with Solvency II requirements. The Group maintained capital in excess of the SCR at all times during 2023. All regulated subsidiaries complied with their capital requirements throughout the year.\n\nFurther information on the Group's Solvency II position, shareholder view, including a reconciliation between IFRS equity and own funds can be found in the Other information section. This information is estimated and is therefore subject to change. It is also unaudited.\n\n## (b) Risks and capital management objectives\n\nThe primary objective of capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure, in a manner consistent with our risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business. Capital is a primary consideration across a wide range of business activities, including product development, pricing, business planning, merger and acquisition transactions and asset and liability management. A Capital Management Standard, applicable Group-wide, sets out minimum standards and guidelines over responsibility for capital management including considerations for capital management decisions and requirements for management information, capital monitoring, reporting, forecasting, planning and overall governance.\n\nThe Group manages capital in conjunction with solvency capital requirements and in line with the dividend policy and capital framework.\n\n- \u00b7 We aim to deliver sustainable dividends at a level that is resilient in times of stress and is covered by the capital and cash generated from our businesses;\n- \u00b7 At the core of our capital framework is financial strength in accordance with risk appetite and efficient deployment of capital. See note 54 for more information about the Group's risk management approach;\n- \u00b7 Key elements of our capital framework are as follows:\n- \u00b7 Solvency II shareholder cover ratio working range of 160%-180%\n- \u00b7 Centre liquid assets of at least \u00a31 billion\n- \u00b7 Solvency II debt leverage ratio below 30%\n- -To maintain our AA credit rating metrics;\n- \u00b7 After the payment of our regular dividend, surplus capital is available for investment in the business to support growth and top quartile efficiency objectives, focussed bolt-on M&A where this delivers attractive risk adjusted returns and the opportunity is in line with our strategy, and any additional returns to shareholders releasing excess capital over time;",

Subsidiary capital appetites and working ranges are reviewed regularly by subsidiary boards.\n\n## Intra-group capital arrangements\n\nConsistent with our capital management framework, the Group has in place intra-group arrangements to provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries. In the normal course of business, the Group will provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries in certain circumstances. While the Group considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to its regulated subsidiaries and its policyholders.\n\n## 53 - Statement of cash flows\n\nThis note gives further detail behind the figures in the statement of cash flows.\n\n## (a) The reconciliation of profit/(loss) before tax to the net cash inflow from operating activities is:\n\n|                                                                       | 2023 '\u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Profit/(loss) before tax                                              | 1,690      | (2,239)              |\n| Adjustments for:                                                      |            |                      |\n| Share of loss/(profit) of joint ventures and associates               | 71         | (8)                  |\n| Dividends received from joint ventures and associates                 | 81         | 47                   |\n| (Profit)/loss on sale of:                                             |            |                      |\n| Investment property                                                   | 10         | 8                    |\n| Investments                                                           | (3,374)    | (1,909)              |\n| Fair value (gains)/losses on:                                         |            |                      |\n| Investment property                                                   | 301        | 1,150                |\n| Investments                                                           | (8,852)    | 48,667               |\n| Borrowings                                                            | (74)       | 16                   |\n| Depreciation of property and equipment                                | 67         | 57                   |\n| Equity compensation plans, equity settled expense                     | 61         | 58                   |\n| Impairment and expensing of:                                          | 3          | (73)                 |\n| Goodwill on subsidiaries                                              | -          | (77)                 |\n| Financial investments, loans and other assets                         | 3          | -                    |\n| Acquired value of in-force business and intangibles                   | -          | 4                    |\n| Amortisation of:                                                      | 489        | 537                  |\n| Premium/discount on fixed maturity securities                         | 306        | 328                  |\n| Premium/discount on borrowings                                        | 6          | (1)                  |\n| Premium/discount on non-participating investment contracts            | 59         | 68                   |\n| Acquired value of in-force business and intangibles                   | 118        | 142                  |\n| Interest expense on borrowings                                        | 335        | 450                  |\n| Net finance income on pension schemes                                 | (39)       | (42)                 |\n| Foreign currency exchange gains                                       | (50)       | (778)                |\n| (Increase)/decrease in reinsurance assets                             | (424)      | 1,338                |\n| Decrease in deferred acquisition costs                                | 70         | 49                   |\n| Increase/(decrease) in insurance liabilities and investment contracts | 22,222     | (36,754)             |\n| Increase in other assets 2                                            | (854)      | (5,948)              |\n| Changes in working capital                                            | 21,014     | (41,315)             |\n| Net purchases of investment property                                  | (1,016)    | (434)                |\n| Net proceeds on sale of investment property                           | 317        | 408                  |\n| Net (purchase)/sales of financial investments                         | (13,698)   | 11,493               |\n| Net purchases of operating assets                                     | (14,397)   | 11,467               |\n| Total cash generated (used in)/from operating activities              | (2,664)    | 16,093               |\n\nThe cash flows presented in this statement cover all the Group's activities and include flows from both policyholder and shareholder activities.

We accept the risks inherent to our core business lines of life, general insurance and health, and asset management. We diversify these risks through our scale, geographic spread, the variety of the products and services we offer and the channels through which we sell them. We receive premiums which we invest to maximise risk-adjusted returns, so that we can fulfil our promises to customers while providing a return to our shareholders. In doing so we have a preference for retaining those risks we believe we are capable of managing to generate a return.\n\nOur sustainability and financial strength are underpinned by an effective risk management process and risk intelligent culture, which helps us identify major risks to which we may be exposed, establish appropriate controls and take mitigating actions for the benefit of our customers and investors. The Group's risk strategy is to invest its available capital to optimise the balance between return and risk while maintaining an appropriate level of economic (i.e. risk-based) and regulatory capital.\n\nThe key elements of our risk management framework comprise: our risk strategy and risk management forward plans; risk governance, including risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities; and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing.\n\n## Risk Environment\n\nMacroeconomic risk has been elevated throughout 2023. The expectation for 2024 is that global growth is expected to slow. Impacts of interest rate raises have not been fully passed on (e.g. through mortgage refinancing). Analysts continue to comment on the current increased level of gearing present across industries. Affordability remains a concern because of the global economic climate, and will continue to impact all customers, including relatively affluent customers. Customer experience and retention will continue to require close monitoring.\n\nHeightened geo-political tensions continue into 2024, with the likelihood of further global social and economic fragmentation.\n\nWe expect continued and heightened regulatory change in 2024 and beyond. In 2023, the Group's UK business implemented the FCA's Consumer Duty for open products and is implementing it for closed products by July 2024. Across the industry, we continue to see significant challenges as firms navigate the implementation across existing business, together with embedding the regulation. The implementation of the FCA's Consumer Duty has maintained a high-level of regulatory scrutiny on the fair value of customer outcomes of products provided by the insurance industry.\n\nThe Group continues to maintain strong solvency and liquidity positions through a range of scenarios and stress testing. Our capital and liquidity positions have been tested by recent market conditions and have been shown to be robust and resilient.",

In response we have increased the protection level of anti-malware and cyber incident security controls. We continue to monitor threat intelligence data and update our controls to maintain protection against new and emerging ransomware variants, including controls in respect of our suppliers.\n\nThe Group remains committed to supporting a low carbon economy that will improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement target on climate change. In March 2021, we set an ambition to become a Net Zero carbon company by 2040 and we are continuing to act to mitigate and manage the impact of climate change on our business. We use scenario analysis as an input to our risk assessment processes to test the resilience of our business strategy and adapt our business to ensure its longevity as an asset manager, asset owner, insurer and pension provider. For example, we calculate a Climate Value at Risk (VaR) against Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios to assess the climate-related risks and opportunities under different emission projections and associated temperature pathways. A range of different financial indicators and metrics are used to assess and monitor the impact of climate change on our investments and insurance liabilities. Examples of these include: building the possibility of extreme weather events into our general insurance pricing, reinsurance programme design and monitoring actual weather-related losses versus expected weather losses by business. We originate assets for their climate credentials. We have defined an Investment in Sustainable assets metric, which is implemented with reference to external frameworks and is set out in our climate reporting policies in the Aviva plc Climate-related Financial Disclosure report 2023.\n\nThe Group implemented IFRS 17 insurance contracts from 1 January 2023. The adoption of IFRS 17 has significantly impacted the measurement and presentation of the contracts in scope of the standard. IFRS 17 introduces the concept of a contractual service margin (CSM) liability that defers future unearned profit on insurance contracts. The recognition of a CSM for our life businesses has resulted in a material reduction in the reported IFRS net asset value of the Group on transition to IFRS 17, with a stock of future profits held on the balance sheet as a liability and released over time. The cash flows and underlying capital generation of our businesses are unaffected by IFRS 17, and the standard has no impact on our Solvency II performance metrics or the Group financial targets we have announced. Furthermore, we do not expect IFRS 17 to impact on the dividend policy and dividend guidance.\n\n## (a) Risk management framework (RMF)\n\nThe Group's Risk management framework is at the heart of every business decision and is key to a robust control environment and the Group's sustainable success. The key components of our RMF are: risk appetite; risk governance, including risk policies and business standards; risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities; and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing. A risk taxonomy is maintained for a consistent approach to risk identification, measurement and reporting, and to determine application of the Group Risk Appetite Framework and the risks for which a Risk Policy is required. The taxonomy is arranged in a hierarchy with more granular risk types grouped into the following principal risk categories: credit and market, liquidity, life insurance, general insurance (including health), operational and strategic risk. Risks falling within these types may affect a number of outcomes including those relating to solvency, liquidity, profit, reputation and conduct.\n\nTo promote a consistent and rigorous approach to risk management across all businesses we have a set of risk policies and business standards which set out the risk strategy, appetite, framework, key controls, and minimum requirements for the Group's worldwide operations. The business units' chief executive officers make an annual declaration supported by an opinion from the business units' chief risk officers that the system of governance and internal controls was effective and fit for purpose for their business throughout the year.\n\nThe Group's Risk Appetite Framework was refreshed during the year, with revised and new risk appetites, preferences and tolerances considered and approved by the Risk Committee.\n\nA regular top-down key risk identification and assessment process is carried out by the Risk function. This includes the consideration of emerging risks and is supported by deeper thematic reviews. This process is replicated at the business unit level. The risk assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.\n\nRisk models are an important tool in our measurement of risks and are used to support the monitoring and reporting of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available. We carry out a range of stress (where one risk factor, such as equity returns, is assumed to vary) and scenario (where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary) tests to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged. For those risk types managed through the holding of capital, being our principal risk types except for liquidity risk, we measure and monitor our risk profile based on the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).\n\nRoles and responsibilities for risk management in Aviva are based around the 'three lines of defence' risk governance model where ownership for risk is taken at all levels in the Group. Line management in the business is accountable for risk ownership and management, including the implementation and embedding of the RMF. The risk function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge of the risk identification, measurement, monitoring, management and reporting processes and for developing the RMF, as well as providing advisory support to the business on risk innovation. Internal audit provides an independent assessment of the risk management framework and internal control processes.",

The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take.\n\nThree Group-level management committees (Group Executive Risk Committee, Group Asset Liability Committee and the Disclosure Committee) exist to assist members of the Aviva Executive Committee in the discharge of their delegated authorities and their accountabilities within the Aviva Governance Framework and in relation to their defined regulatory responsibilities.\n\nThe RMF of a small number of our joint ventures and strategic equity holdings differs from the Group RMF outlined in this note. We work with these entities to understand how their risks are managed and to align them, where possible, with the Group RMF so not to unduly increase the overall risk exposure of the Group.\n\nThe types of risks to which the Group is exposed have not changed significantly during the year and remain credit, market, liquidity, life insurance, general insurance and health, asset management and operational risks. These risks are described below.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to the Group, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks. Credit risk is taken so that the Group can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders. In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, because of the better expected riskadjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.\n\nOur approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements. Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security investments, structured asset investments, bank deposits, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance counterparties.\n\nThe Group manages its credit risk at business unit and Group level. All business units are required to implement credit risk management processes (including limits frameworks), operate specific risk management committees and report and monitor their exposures against detailed pre-established risk criteria. At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis and operate a Group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.\n\nWe did not experience a material increase in credit defaults in 2023, with pro-active management of the credit portfolio in a challenging macroeconomic environment. We continue to monitor closely any deterioration in the credit markets. Our capital position includes an allowance for the expected potential impacts from downgrades and defaults.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the Group's current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.\n\n## (i) Financial exposures by credit ratings\n\nFinancial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued. AAA is the highest possible rating. Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings. Financial assets with ratings outside this range are classified as sub-investment grade. The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure of the Group for financial and reinsurance contract assets with external credit ratings. 'Not rated' assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.\n\n|                                                                   | AAA %               | AA %                           | A %    | BBB %   | Below  BBB %   | Not  rated %         | 2023 Maximum  exposure \u00a3m   | AAA %   | AA %   | A %                    | BBB %   |        | Below  BBB %   | Not  rated %         | Restated 1,2 2022 Maximum  exposure \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------|---------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------|--------|------------------------|---------|--------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed maturity  securities 1                                      |                     | 11.7 %  39.0 %  24.2 %  13.4 % |        |         | 4.7 %          |                      | 7.0 %  113,889              |         |        | 16.2 %  35.1 %  23.6 % |         | 14.7 % | 4.6 %          |                      | 5.8 %  103,776                           |\n| Reinsurance contract  assets 2                                    | - %  76.0 %  23.1 % |                                |        | - %     | - %            | 0.9 %                | 6,534                       |         |        | - %  75.7 %  24.3 %    | - %     |        | - %            | - %                  | 6,308                                    |\n| Reinsurance assets for  non-participating  investment contracts 2 |                     | - %  50.7 %                    | 45.6 % | 3.7 %   | - %            | - %                  | 4,713                       |         |        | - %  56.4 %  37.0 %    |         | 6.6 %  | - %            | - %                  | 5,290                                    |\n| Other investments                                                 | 0.8 %               | 0.2 %                          | 0.6 %  | 0.2 %   |                | - %  98.2 %   39,370 |                             | - %     | - %    |                        | - %     |        |                |                      |                                          |\n|                                                                   | - %                 | - %                            | 0.2 %  | 0.5 %   |                | - %  99.3 %   31,685 |                             | - %     |        | 0.1 %                  |         |        |                | - %  99.9 %   34,520 |                                          |\n| Loans 1, 2 Total                                                  |                     |                                |        |         |                |                      | 196,191                     |         | - %    | 0.2 %                  | 0.4 %   |        |                | - %  99.4 %   29,633 | 179,527                                  |",

Of these securities most are allocated an investment grade internal rating using a methodology largely consistent with that adopted by an external rating agency.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets, without taking collateral or these hedges into account, is represented by the carrying value of the financial instruments in the statement of financial position. For reinsurance contract assets the maximum exposure reflects the carrying value less the value of CSM.\n\nThese comprise debt securities, reinsurance assets, derivative assets, loans and receivables. The carrying values of these assets are disclosed in the relevant notes: financial investments (note 28), reinsurance assets (note 40), loans (note 25) and receivables (note 29). The collateral in place for these credit exposures is disclosed in note 56.\n\n## (ii) Other investments\n\nOther investments include: unit trusts and other investment vehicles; derivative financial instruments, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements; and other assets, including deposits with credit institutions and minority holdings in property management undertakings.\n\nThe credit quality of the underlying debt securities within investment vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment mandates for these funds which determine the funds' risk profiles. At the Group level, we also monitor the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles against Group set limits.\n\nA proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable. Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall appetite for market risk.\n\n## (iii) Loans\n\nThe Group loan portfolio principally comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy;\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions. These loans are fully collateralised by other securities;\n- \u00b7 Healthcare, infrastructure and PFI loans secured against healthcare, education, social housing and emergency services related premises; and\n- \u00b7 Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.\n\nWe use loan to value, interest and debt service cover and diversity and quality of the tenant base metrics to internally monitor our exposures to mortgage loans. We use credit quality, based on dynamic market measures, and collateralisation rules to manage our stock lending activities. Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders and are collateralised by the underlying policies.\n\n## (iv) Credit concentration risk\n\nThe long-term and general insurance and health businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations applicable in most markets and the Group credit policy and limits framework, which limit investments in individual assets and asset classes. Credit concentrations are monitored as part of the regular credit monitoring process and are reported to the Group Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). With the exception of government bonds, the largest aggregated counterparty exposure within shareholder assets is to the Swiss Reinsurance Company Limited (including subsidiaries), representing approximately 1.4% of the total shareholder assets.\n\n## (v) Reinsurance credit exposures\n\nThe Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings. The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer. Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite. The Group Capital and Group Risk teams have an active monitoring role with escalation to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Group ALCO and the Board Risk Committee as appropriate.\n\n## (vi) Securities finance\n\nThe Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK and smaller operations in some other businesses. The risks within this activity are mitigated by collateralisation and minimum counterparty credit quality requirements.\n\n## (vii) Derivative credit exposures\n\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades. This risk is generally mitigated through holding collateral for most trades. Residual exposures are captured within the Group's credit management framework.\n\n## (viii) Unit-linked business\n\nIn unit-linked business the policyholder bears the direct market risk and credit risk on investment assets in the unit funds and the shareholders' exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent of the income arising from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## (ix) Impairment of financial assets\n\nImpairment is calculated using an expected credit loss model for financial assets measured at amortised cost and lease receivables, with reference to historical experience of losses adjusted for forward-looking information, as discussed in accounting policy U.\n\n## (c) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse financial impact resulting, directly or indirectly from fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices. Market risk arises in business units because of fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.\n\nAt Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders. We actively seek some market risks as part of our investment and product strategy.\n\nThe management of market risk is undertaken at business unit and at Group level. Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints. The Group Capital team is responsible for monitoring and managing market risk at Group level and has established criteria for matching assets and liabilities to limit the impact of mismatches because of market movements.\n\nIn addition, where the Group's long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where most investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, so to satisfy the policyholders' risk and reward objectives. The Group writes unit-linked business, primarily in the UK. The shareholders' exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.\n\nIn respect of IBOR, significant progress has been made, with a substantive majority of the Group's original exposure already resolved. The Group's only remaining exposure to GBP LIBOR relates to a small number of currently fixed-rate public bonds that would revert to LIBOR-referencing floating rates in the event of a non-call by the issuer at the next call date. We continue to assess the likelihood of this event. The Group's exposure to CDOR relates to a small number of interest rate swaps whose transition will be planned prior to CDOR's termination after 28 June 2024.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, \u00a353 million of non-derivative financial assets, \u00a310 million of derivative financial assets and \u00a32 million of derivative financial liabilities had yet to transition to an alternative risk-free rate.\n\nThe most material types of market risk that the Group is exposed to are described below.\n\n## (i) Equity price risk\n\nThe Group is subject to direct equity price risk arising from changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio. Our most material indirect equity price risk exposures are to policyholder unit-linked funds, which are exposed to a fall in the value of the fund thereby reducing the fees we earn on those funds, and participating contracts, which are exposed to a fall in the value of the funds thereby increasing our costs for policyholder guarantees. We also have some equity exposure in shareholder funds through equities held to match inflation-linked liabilities.\n\nWe continue to limit our direct equity exposure in line with our risk preferences. At a business unit level, investment limits and local investment regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities. The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.\n\nEquity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options. Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of risk models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates. An equity hedging strategy remains in place to help control the Group's overall direct and indirect exposure to equities.\n\nSensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section (h) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (ii) Property price risk\n\nThe Group is subject to property price risk directly because of holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide and indirectly through investments in mortgages and mortgage backed securities. Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and is subject to local regulations on investments, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices. We maintain a conservative loan-to-value on our commercial mortgage portfolio. Exposure to property risk on equity release mortgages from sustained underperformance in the UK House Price Index (HPI) is mitigated by capping loan to value on origination at low levels and regularly monitoring the performance of the mortgage portfolio.\n\nSensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section (h) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from the Group's investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities. A number of policyholder product features have an influence on the Group's interest rate risk. The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values. Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 42.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We manage and hedge our interest rate exposure through setting risk tolerance levels on a Solvency II cover ratio basis. Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.\n\nIncreasing interest rates as a result of the monetary policy response to inflationary pressures will positively impact the Group's regulatory capital cover ratio. This could be offset by the negative impact of credit downgrades, counterparty defaults, claims and maintenance expenses and lapse rates if high inflation persists and the economy stagnates or falls. Conversely, rising credit spreads will adversely impact IFRS shareholders' equity, see section (h)(i) Sensitivity test analysis.\n\nThe Group typically manages interest rate risk by investing in fixed interest securities which closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities where such investments are available. In particular, a key objective is to at least match the duration of our annuity liabilities with assets of the same duration, and in some cases where appropriate cash flow matching has been used. These assets include corporate bonds, residential mortgages and commercial mortgages. Should they default before maturity, it is assumed that the Group can reinvest in assets of a similar risk and return profile, which is subject to market conditions. Interest rate risk is also managed in some business units using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors.\n\nOther product lines of the Group, such as protection, are not significantly sensitive to interest rate or market movements. For unit-linked business, the shareholder margins emerging are typically a mixture of annual management fees and risk/ expense charges. Risk and expense margins are largely unaffected by low interest rates. Annual management fees could increase if there was a move towards low interest rates which increases the value of unit funds. For the UK annuities business interest rate exposure is mitigated by closely matching the duration of liabilities with assets of the same duration.\n\nThe UK participating business includes contracts with features such as guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options and minimum surrender and maturity values. These liabilities are managed through duration matching of assets and liabilities and the use of derivatives, including swaptions. As a result, the Group's exposure to sustained low interest rates on this portfolio is not material. Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 42.\n\nProfit before tax on General Insurance and Health Insurance business is generally a mixture of insurance, expense and investment returns. The asset portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities. The portfolio investment yield and average total invested assets in our General Insurance and Health business are set out in the table below.\n\n|                   |                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                   | Portfolio investment yield 1 | 2.74%  | 2.33%  |\n| Average assets \u00a3m |                              | 13,319 | 13,082 |\n\nThe nature of the business means that prices in certain circumstances can be increased to maintain overall profitability. This is subject to the competitive environment in each market. If there are future falls in interest rates the investment yield would be expected to decrease in future periods.\n\nSensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section (h) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (iv) Inflation risk\n\nInflation risk arises primarily from the Group's exposure to general insurance claims inflation, to inflation linked benefits within the defined benefit staff pension schemes and within the UK annuity portfolio and to expense inflation. Increases in long-term inflation expectations are closely linked to long-term interest rates and so are frequently considered with interest rate risk. Exposure to inflation risk is monitored through capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing. The Group typically manages inflation risk through its investment strategy and, in particular, by investing in inflation linked securities and through a variety of derivative instruments, including inflation linked swaps. Inflation risk is an ongoing concern in the current macroeconomic environment and we are monitoring the potential impact on the profits and margins of the Group and our counterparties which could impact their credit quality.\n\n## (v) Currency risk\n\nThe Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profits contract liabilities or are hedged. As a result the foreign exchange gains and losses on investments are largely offset by changes in unit-linked and with-profits liabilities and fair value changes in derivatives attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. Approximately 26% of the Group's Insurance Revenue from continuing operations arises in currencies other than sterling.\n\nThe Group's net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are sterling, euro and Canadian dollars ($CAD). The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements. However, the Group does use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge planned dividends from its subsidiaries, and specifically its currency risk exposure from the anticipated sale proceeds of Aviva Singapore (see note 55(a)(ii)).",

This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.\n\nExcept where the Group has applied net investment hedge accounting (see note 55(a)(i)), foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency borrowings are recognised in the income statement, whereas foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nAt 31 December, the Group's net assets by currency was:\n\n|          | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Sterling | 9,821     | 10,759               |\n| Euro     | 324       | 286                  |\n| $CAD     | 565       | 5                    |\n| Other    | (1,110)   | (836)                |\n| Total    | 9,600     | 10,214               |\n\nA 10% change in sterling to euro/$CAD period-end foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on net assets and a 10% change in sterling to euro/$CAD average foreign exchange rates applied to translate foreign currency profits would have had the following impact on profit before tax, including resulting gains and losses on foreign exchange hedges.\n\n|                               | Impact on  net assets \u00a3m   | 2023 Impact on  profit before  tax \u00a3m   | Impact on net  assets \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 Impact on  profit before  tax \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| 10% increase in sterling/euro | (32)                       | 22                                      | (29)                       | 17                                                 |\n| 10% decrease in sterling/euro | 32                         | (26)                                    | 29                         | (21)                                               |\n| 10% increase in sterling/$CAD | (57)                       | (39)                                    | (1)                        | (20)                                               |\n| 10% decrease in sterling/$CAD | 57                         | 48                                      | 1                          | 24                                                 |\n\nThe balance sheet changes arise from retranslation of business unit statements of financial position from their functional currencies into sterling, with above movements being taken through the currency translation reserve. These balance sheet movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit. Net asset and profit before tax figures are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities.\n\n## (vi) Derivatives risk\n\nDerivatives are used by a number of the business units. Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes, or to structure specific retail savings products. Activity is overseen by the Group Capital and Group Risk teams, which monitor exposure levels and approve large or complex transactions.\n\nThe Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.\n\n## (vii) Correlation risk\n\nThe Group recognises that lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates. These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the internal capital model and in scenario analysis.\n\n## (d) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. The relatively illiquid nature of insurance liabilities is a potential source of additional investment return by allowing us to invest in higher yielding, and less liquid assets such as commercial mortgages and infrastructure loans. The Group seeks to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due through the application of a Group liquidity risk policy and business standard and through the development of its liquidity risk management plan.\n\nAt Group and business unit level, there is a liquidity risk appetite which requires that sufficient liquid resources be maintained to cover net outflows in a stress scenario. In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Group maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities (\u00a31,700 million) from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.",

While interest rates have oscillated over 2023, we have not experienced the sharp and rapid rise in interest rates seen at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Following the experience in 2022, the liquidity buffers were strengthened and we have sufficient liquidity to withstand a similar liquidity squeeze.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nThe following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial assets held to meet them. A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and derivative liabilities is given in notes 47 and 55(b)(ii), respectively. Contractual obligations under leases and capital commitments are given in note 23 and note 51.\n\n## (i) Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities\n\nFor insurance and participating investment contract liabilities, including reinsurance contract liabilities, the following table shows the estimates of the present value of future cash flows at 31 December 2023 and 2022 analysed by estimated timing.\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts, almost all may be surrendered or transferred on demand. The earliest contractual maturity date is therefore 2023 statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability.\n\nHowever, we expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and therefore the table below reflects the expected cash flows for these contracts, rather than their contractual maturity date.\n\n| 2023                                                                  | Within 1 year \u00a3m   | One to Two  years \u00a3m   | Two to Three  years \u00a3m   | Three to

Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the 'On demand or within 1 year' column. Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument. The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis. The first repricing and call date is normally ten years or more after the date of issuance. Most of the Group's investments in equity securities and fixed maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice.\n\n## (e) Life insurance risk\n\nLife insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality, morbidity and longevity risk and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels, exercising of policyholder options and management and administration expenses.\n\nThe Group chooses to take measured amounts of life insurance risk provided that the relevant business has the appropriate core skills to assess and price the risk and adequate returns are available. The Group's underwriting strategy and appetite is communicated via specific policy statements, related business standards and guidelines. Life insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at the Group level.\n\nThe Group's life insurance risk continues to be dominated by exposure from our UK business. Longevity risk remains the most significant life insurance risk due to the Group's annuity portfolio. We are also exposed to longevity risk through the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, to which our economic exposure has been reduced since 2014 by entering into a longevity swap covering the majority of pensioner in-payment scheme liabilities in force at the time. We purchase reinsurance for some of the longevity risk relating to our annuity business and this also includes the bulk annuity buy-in transactions with the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme that have been carried out since 2019, including two tranches in 2023.\n\nWe have reinsurance in place across all our businesses to reduce our net exposure to potential losses. In the UK we have extensive quota share reinsurance in place on Individual Life Protection business and for UK Group Life Protection we use surplus reinsurance for very large individual claims.\n\nMore generally, life insurance risks are believed to provide a significant diversification against other risks in the portfolio. Life insurance risks are modelled within the internal capital model and are subject to sensitivity and stress and scenario testing. COVID-19 has continued to present uncertainty, but overall we expect limited future impact to our business. The potential impacts of climate change also present uncertainty regarding future insurance risk experience, and these are considered when setting assumptions for future experience.\n\nRecent persistency experience has been generally resilient to cost-of-living pressures and has not shown significant deterioration in the short term. There remains some uncertainty about the potential for this to continue, which is being monitored closely. External factors that may impact future persistency experience include prolonged high inflation and interest rates, increased stock-market volatility and changes in legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe assumption setting and management of life insurance risks is governed by the Group-wide business standards covering underwriting, pricing, product design and management, in-force management, claims handling and reinsurance. The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Mortality and morbidity risks are managed through comprehensive medical underwriting, input and advice from medical experts, as well as frequent monitoring and analysis of company experience. Reinsurance treaties are in place to provide further mitigation.\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk is managed through monitoring and analysis of the Group's experience, as well as considering the latest external industry data and emerging trends. While individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and any associated capital implications. The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.\n- \u00b7 Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience and benchmarking against local market information. Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed. Lapses and their associated financial impact are reduced through appropriate design of products to meet current and, where possible, future customer needs. Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve the retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.\n- \u00b7 Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through robust cost controls and efficiency targets, together with frequent monitoring of expense levels.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of changes in policyholder behaviour due to the exercise of options, guarantees and other product features embedded in its long-term savings products. These product features offer policyholders varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms. The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units and exposes Aviva to changes in policyholder behaviour in the exercise of options as well as market risk.\n\nExamples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are:\n\n- \u00b7 Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options and guaranteed insurability options.\n- \u00b7 Guarantees: embedded floor (guaranteed return), maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment and the 'no negative equity' associated with the Equity Release business; and\n- \u00b7 Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.\n\nThe impact of these is reflected in the capital model and managed as part of the asset liability framework. Further disclosure on financial guarantees and options embedded in contracts and their inclusion in insurance and investment contract liabilities is provided in note 42.\n\n## (f) General insurance risk and health risk\n\nThe Group writes a balanced portfolio of general insurance risk (including personal motor, household, commercial motor, property and liability), as well as global exposure to corporate specialty risks. This risk is taken on, in line with our underwriting and pricing expertise, to provide an appropriate level of return for an acceptable level of risk. Underwriting discipline and a robust governance process is at the core of the Group's underwriting strategy.\n\nThe Group's Health Insurance business (including private health insurance, critical illness cover, income protection and personal accident insurance, as well as a range of corporate healthcare products) exposes the Group to morbidity risk (the proportion of our customers falling sick) and medical expense inflation.\n\nProvisions made for insurance liabilities are inherently uncertain. Due to this uncertainty, general and health insurance reserves are regularly reviewed by qualified and experienced actuaries at the business unit and Group level in accordance with the Group's reserving framework. These and other key risks, including the occurrence of unexpected claims from a single source or cause and inadequate reinsurance protection/risk transfer, are subject to an overarching risk management framework and various mechanisms to govern and control our risks and exposures.\n\nWe recognise that the severity and frequency of weather-related events has the potential to adversely impact provisions for insurance liabilities and our earnings, with the result that there is some seasonality in our results from period to period. Large catastrophic (CAT) losses arising as a result of these events are explicitly considered in our economic capital modelling to ensure we are resilient to such CAT scenarios, and this modelling considers the impact of climate change on the frequency and severity of potential future events. The impact of actual weather-related losses compared to the expected losses based on the long-term average was 2% worse (2022: 12% worse) for UK & Ireland General Insurance and 17% worse (2022: 35% worse) for Canada General Insurance.\n\nMore broadly, the materiality and time horizon over which climate-related risks and opportunities affect our business depend on the specific insurance products, geographies and investments being considered. Notwithstanding that the impact on general insurance liabilities is mitigated by the short-term nature of the business, the ability to re-price annually, and by the Company's reinsurance programmes, the physical effects of climate change will most likely result in more risks and perils becoming either uninsurable or unaffordable over the longer term and the need for more urgent action increases.",

On 17 October 2022, the High Court handed down its judgment on the preliminary issues trial of Stonegate Pub Co Ltd vs MS Amlin Corp Member Ltd (and others) and related cases. Aviva was not a party to the cases but is affected by the final outcome of these cases. The High Court ruled in favour of the parties on different issues, and all parties initially appealed the majority of the preliminary decisions made by Justice Butcher. Whilst the Greggs and Stonegate actions settled after the appeals on confidential terms the Court of Appeal heard the remaining Various Eateries v Allianz appeals and on 16 January 2024 handed down judgment dismissing both parties appeals. As a result the decisions of the High Court by Justice Butcher stand.\n\nIn Canada, we are party to a number of litigation proceedings, including class actions that challenge coverage under our commercial property policies; however, we believe we have a strong argument that there is no pandemic coverage under these policies.\n\nThe Group purchases reinsurance protection on its property portfolio that includes coverage for business interruption and is collecting or seeking reinsurance recoveries of business interruption losses that are covered by reinsurance. The Group's general insurance business does not have material underwriting exposure to Israel, Palestine, Russia or Ukraine, and does not conduct operations in the affected regions.\n\nThe conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine and ongoing disruption to global supply chains have the potential to lead to heightened claims inflation in 2024 and may increase the uncertainty associated with the cost of settling general insurance claims. While the impacts of heightened claims inflation can be mitigated via new business pricing actions, our ability to price for inflation is dependent on market, competitor and customer behaviour. The time lag between premium earning and claims emergence means that some adverse impact on profitability could be expected.\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nSignificant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group. The basis of these purchases is underpinned by analysis of capital, earnings and capital volatility, cash flow and liquidity and the Group's franchise value.\n\nDetailed actuarial analysis is used to calculate the Group's extreme risk profile and then design cost and capital efficient reinsurance programmes to mitigate these risks to within agreed appetites. For businesses writing general insurance we analyse the natural catastrophe exposure using various probabilistic catastrophe models which are benchmarked against external catastrophe models widely used by the rest of the (re)insurance industry.\n\nThe Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third-party reinsurers. The Group purchases a Group-wide catastrophe reinsurance programme to protect against its peak catastrophe losses in excess of a 1 in 250 year return period (1 in 500 year return period in Canada). The total Group potential retained loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure peril (Northern Europe Windstorm) is approximately \u00a3200 million on a per occurrence basis. The Group purchases a number of general insurance business line specific reinsurance programmes with various retention levels to protect both capital and earnings, and has reinsured 100% of its latent exposures to its historic UK employers' liability and public liability business written prior to 31 December 2000.\n\n## (g) Operational risk (including conduct risk)\n\nOperational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events including changes in the regulatory environment. We have limited appetite for operational risk and aim to reduce these risks as far as is commercially sensible.\n\nThe Group continues to operate, validate and enhance its key operational controls and purchase insurance to minimise losses arising from inadequate or ineffective internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The Group maintains constructive relationships with its regulators around the world and responds appropriately to developments in relation to key regulatory changes. The Operational Risk Appetite framework enables management and the Board to assess the overall quality of the operational risk environment relative to risk appetite and where a Business Unit (or the Group) are outside of appetite, require clear and robust plans to be put in place in order to return to appetite. As part of our continual improvements of our risk management approach to keep pace with the business, increasing regulatory expectations, and the macroeconomic and geo-political environment, we continue to implement risk and control improvements throughout the organisation and across all three lines of defence. Those improvements continue to strengthen and enhance our risk management capabilities and enable us to operate a stronger control environment, improve understanding and accountabilities of risks, reduce the complexity of how the business thinks about and manages risks and create greater collaboration across the first and second lines of defence to provide higher quality advice and challenge.",

This includes a programme of resilience and crisis response testing to ensure customer harm is minimised and the continued financial safety and soundness of Aviva's business. Operational resilience disciplines and assessments have been used in response to global events, including: changes to the geo-political environment, financial market instability and the continuity of winter power supplies.\n\nWe rely on several outsourcing providers for critical business processes, customer servicing, investment operations and IT support. To manage the risk of failure of a critical outsourcing provider, businesses are required to identify business critical outsourced functions (internal and external) and for each to have exit and termination plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place in the event of supplier failure, which are reviewed annually. We also carry out supplier financial stability reviews at least annually.\n\nIncreasing geo-political tensions more generally have heightened the risk of cyber security attacks on the Group or its suppliers, with the potential to cause business service interruption and/or data or intellectual property theft. In response Aviva continues to actively monitor the threat environment and enhance its IT infrastructure and cyber controls to identify, detect and prevent attacks. Aviva's cyber defences are regularly tested using our own 'ethical hacking' team and we have engaged our suppliers to put in place all reasonable measures so that services to Aviva and our customers are protected.\n\nAction is in hand to strengthen the control framework for the current risks Generative Artificial Intelligence presents as well as exploit the opportunities for process efficiency, better pricing and underwriting, product personalisation and improved customer service.\n\nThe Group actively monitors social and other media in order to manage misinformation about our business, products, colleagues and customers should we be targeted by a hostile actor, taking corrective media action if necessary.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, whether or not founded, as well as wider geo-political and economic external events or trends, could impact our brands or reputation. Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us (or any of our intermediaries) do not perform as expected (whether or not the expectations are founded) or customers' expectations of the product change.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister has indicated that a general election is going to take place in the second half of 2024, most likely in the autumn. There will be heightened sensitivity around policy and associated risks during this period as a high profile company.\n\nWe have designed our products and business processes so that we treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints. Failure to treat our customers fairly is counter to our purpose, values and culture and could result in regulatory action and penalties, as well as impact our brands and/or reputation.\n\nThe FCA Consumer Duty (\"the Duty\") requires firms to 'act to deliver good customer outcomes' by managing the risks posed to those good outcomes; these are our customer conduct risks. Achieving the expectations of the Duty aligns with our strategic priority of becoming the go-to customer brand for Insurance, Wealth and Retirement. To meet the July 2023 implementation deadline, we enhanced our Group-wide conduct risk policy to strengthen the definition and scope to reflect the Duty. We refreshed the conduct risk appetite and sharpened guidance around good customer outcomes and foreseeable harm. Senior Manager role profiles and their statements of responsibility have been refreshed and we revised strategy agendas to enhance the focus on customer outcomes and reviewed coverage of customer outcomes in monitoring. We have updated our policies and business standards (including those relating to people and reward) where needed.\n\nThe Group is directly exposed to the risks associated with operating an asset management business through its ownership of Aviva Investors. The underlying risk profile of our asset management risk is derived from investment performance, specialist investment professionals and leadership, product development capabilities, fund liquidity, margin, client retention, regulatory developments, fiduciary and contractual responsibilities. Funds invested in illiquid assets such as commercial property are particularly exposed to liquidity risk. The risk profile is regularly monitored.\n\nA client relationship team is in place to manage client retention risk, while all new asset management products undergo a review and approval process at each stage of the product development process, including approvals from legal, compliance and risk functions. Investment performance against client objectives relative to agreed benchmarks is monitored as part of our investment performance and risk management process, and subject to further independent oversight and challenge by a specialist risk team, reporting directly to the Aviva Investors' Chief Risk Officer.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## (h) Risk and capital management (i) Sensitivity test analysis\n\nThe Group uses a number of sensitivity tests to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently. Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on the Group's key financial performance metrics to inform the Group's decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.\n\n## (ii) Life insurance and investment contracts\n\nThe nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements. Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the inforce policies for each business unit. Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business. A number of the key assumptions for the Group's central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements.\n\n## (iii) General insurance and health business\n\nGeneral insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.\n\n## (iv) Sensitivity test results\n\nIllustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below. For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged. See below for further details on the limitations of the sensitivity analysis.

For business (including with-profits funds and unit-linked contracts) where changes in the market risk variables result in movements that offset to nil, having no overall impact on profit or shareholders' equity, the offsetting movements in the insurance and investment contract balances and investment assets are excluded from this sensitivity analysis. Impacts on the Group's pension schemes are also excluded:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The affected underlying insurance contracts and related reinsurance contracts are measured under IFRS 17 and the impacts on fulfilment cash flows (FCF) and on the CSM are shown separately as these components are not fully symmetrically impacted by possible changes in assumptions.\n\n|                                       | Insurance contracts balances   | Insurance contracts balances   | Insurance contracts balances   | Reinsurance contracts balances   | Reinsurance contracts balances   | Reinsurance contracts balances   |                             | Shareholder's        |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| 2023                                  | FCF \u00a3m                         | CSM \u00a3m                         | Profit or loss \u00a3m              | FCF \u00a3m                           | CSM \u00a3m                           | Profit or loss \u00a3m                | Total profit  before tax \u00a3m | equity after  tax \u00a3m |\n| Life insurance business               |                                |                                |                                |                                  |                                  |                                  |                             |                      |\n| 10% increase in expenses              | (243)                          | 273                            | 30                             | 3                                | (6)                              | (3)                              | 27                          | 21                   |\n| 10% increase in lapse rates           | (16)                           | (13)                           | (29)                           | (38)                             | 56                               | 18                               | (11)                        | (8)                  |\n| 2% increase in assurance mortality    | (212)                          | 243                            | 31                             | 138                              | (164)                            | (26)                             | 5                           | 4                    |\n| 2% decrease in annuitant mortality    | (357)                          | 461                            | 104                            | 169                              | (258)                            | (89)                             | 15                          | 11                   |\n| General insurance and health business |                                |                                |                                |                                  |                                  |                                  |                             |                      |\n| 10% increase in expenses              | (126)                          | -

In reality, changes may occur over a period of time and there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration that the Group's assets and liabilities are actively managed. Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group's financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.\n\nAs investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocations and taking other protective action.",

The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rates at all terms. These results should not be used to calculate the impact of non-parallel yield movements.\n- b.The sensitivity analysis assumes equivalent assumption changes across all markets i.e. UK and non-UK yield curves move by the same amounts, equity markets across the world rise or fall identically\n\nAdditionally, the movements observed by assets held by Aviva will not be identical to market indices so caution is required when applying the sensitivities to observed index movements.\n\n## 55 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThis note gives details of the various financial instruments the Group uses to mitigate risk.\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with the Group's overall risk management strategy. The objectives include managing exposure to market, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.\n\nIn the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments. The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction. The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held (or issued) by the Group.\n\nThe fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.) master agreements or their equivalent. Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure. In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties. See note 56 for further information on collateral and net credit risk of derivative instruments.\n\n## (a) Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe Group adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2023 and it has formally assessed and documented the hedge effectiveness for financial instruments designated as hedge instruments in accordance with IFRS 9. For the 2022 comparatives, the Group applied the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting.\n\n## (i) Net investment hedges\n\nTo reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has designated a portion of its Euro and Canadian dollar denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge the currency components of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The matching currency denomination of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries and the loan liabilities in the Group leads to an economic relationship, where a change in the value of the asset as a result of changes in the foreign exchange rate will be offset directly by an opposite change in the value of the liability. The maturity analysis of the liabilities is presented in note 47. The Group's net investments are designated into a hedge relationship in Canada such that the value hedged matches exactly the nominal amounts of the hedging instrument being used. The Group has applied a hedge ratio of 1:1 (2022: 1:1) for the net investment hedge in Canada. The Group applied a hedge ratio of 0.54:1 (2022: 1:1) to the net investment hedge for Ireland. During 2023, \u20ac900 million subordinated notes were designated into the net investment hedge to replace the \u20ac500 million senior notes that matured in the year. The hedge ratio has reduced as a result.\n\nAt inception, the nature of the economic relationship is such that the net investment hedge is expected to be highly effective, however, ineffectiveness or discontinuation of the hedging relationship may arise should a disposal of a foreign subsidiary included in the net investment hedge occur during the period.\n\nOther risks except for currency risk associated with the Group's net investments in its foreign subsidiaries are not covered by these hedging arrangements.\n\n## (ii) Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group applies cash flow hedging to a highly probable forecast transaction. The currency component of the derivatives used to hedge currency risk from the expected $SGD 1.4 billion sales proceeds of Aviva Singapore (2022: no cash flow hedging) is designated in cash flow hedge. The currency derivatives convert the $SGD proceeds to Sterling at predetermined rate at maturity, and there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument due to the matching currency.\n\nThe Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 since the notional of the currency derivatives match the expected proceeds from the disposal. No ineffectiveness is expected from the cash flow hedge. The forward element of the currency derivatives of \u00a30.7 million, representing the time value of money, is excluded from the hedge relationship and deferred in the hedge instruments reserve until disposal.",

The amounts of cash collateral receivable or repayable are included in notes 29 and 48 respectively. Collateral received and pledged by the Group is detailed in note 56.\n\n## 56 - Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar arrangements\n\n## (a) Offsetting arrangements\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nAviva mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements, where practical, and into ISDA master netting agreements for each of the legal entities to facilitate its right to offset credit risk exposure. The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aviva or its counterparty.\n\nDerivative transactions requiring Aviva or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit default swaps. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities. The derivative assets and liabilities in the table below are made up of the contracts described in detail in note 55.\n\nAviva participates in a number of stock lending and repurchase arrangements. In some of these arrangements cash is exchanged by Aviva for securities and a related receivable is recognised within Loans to banks in note 25. These arrangements are reflected in the tables below. In instances where the collateral is recognised in the statement of financial position, the obligation for its return is included within Payables and other financial liabilities in note 48.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The collateral received must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts. Transfer of title always occurs for the collateral received. In many instances, however, no market risk or economic benefit is exchanged and these transactions are not recognised in the statement of financial position in accordance with our accounting policies, and accordingly not included in the following tables.\n\n|                                                     |                   |                    |                                                                    | Amounts under a master netting agreement  but not offset under IAS 32   | Amounts under a master netting agreement  but not offset under IAS 32   | Amounts under a master netting agreement  but not offset under IAS 32   | Amounts under a master netting agreement  but not offset under IAS 32   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements | Gross  amounts \u00a3m | Amounts  offset \u00a3m | Net amounts  reported in the  statement of  financial  position \u00a3m | Financial  instruments \u00a3m                                               | Cash collateral \u00a3m                                                      | Securities  collateral  received/ pledged \u00a3m                            | Net amount \u00a3m                                                           |\n| Derivative financial assets                         | 2,618             | -

The actual amount of collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables above in the case of over-collateralisation.\n\nThe total amount of collateral received which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default, excluding collateral related to balances recognised within Loans to banks disclosed in note 25, was \u00a36,827 million (2022: \u00a34,877 million), all of which other than \u00a3245 million (2022: \u00a3322 million) is related to securities lending arrangements. Collateral of \u00a31,050 million (2022: \u00a31,568 million) has been received related to balances recognised within Loans to banks in note 25. \u00a377 million (2022: \u00a356 million) included within cash and cash equivalents has been pledged as collateral in respect of the Group's UK pension schemes. Under the agreements, cash is only transferred to the pension schemes to fund bulk annuity buy-in transactions with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited or in the event of the Group defaulting on its pension obligations. The value of collateral that was actually sold or repledged in the absence of default was \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\nThe level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Group's risk exposure. The fair values of collateral received approximate to their carrying amounts.",

The Group has equity interests in these joint ventures, together with the provision of administration services and financial management to many of them. Our fund management companies also charge fees to these joint ventures for administration services and for arranging external finance.\n\nKey management personnel of the Company may from time to time purchase insurance, savings, asset management or annuity products marketed by group companies on equivalent terms to those available to all employees of the Group. In 2023, other transactions with key management personnel were not deemed to be significant either by size or in the context of their individual financial positions.\n\nOur UK fund management companies manage most of the assets held by the Group's main UK staff pension scheme, for which they charge fees based on the level of funds under management. The main UK scheme holds investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies with other group companies, as explained in note 46(i). As at 31 December 2023, the Friends Provident Pension Scheme (FPPS), acquired in 2015 as part of the acquisition of the Friends Life business, held an insurance policy of \u00a3431 million (2022: \u00a3432 million) issued by a group company, which eliminates on consolidation.

At the same time, the merger reserve was reduced by \u00a33,750 million. On 17 May 2022, the B shares were redeemed at 101.69 pence per share, which resulted in a \u00a33,750 million reduction in the B share capital account and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve.

During the year coupon payments of \u00a334 million were made (2022: \u00a317 million).\n\n## M - Contingent liabilities\n\nDetails of the Company's contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 50.\n\n## N - Risk management\n\nRisk and capital management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, notes 52 and 54.\n\nThe business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiaries and joint venture operations. Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves, and full details of the major risks and the Group's approach to managing these are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 54. Such investments are held by the Company at cost in accordance with accounting policy D.\n\nFinancial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. The credit quality of receivables and other financial assets is monitored by the Company and provisions are made for expected credit losses. There are no material expected credit losses over the lifetime of the financial assets.\n\nFinancial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings (details of which are provided in note J and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 47) and loans owed to subsidiaries. Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.\n\n## (a) Interest rate risk\n\nLoans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates. The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments (which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations) held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each company's net exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, for short-term commercial paper, the Company is affected by changes in these rates to the extent the redemption of these borrowings is funded by the issuance of new commercial paper or other borrowings. Further details of the Company's borrowings are provided in note J and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 47.\n\nThe effect of a 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates on floating rate loans due to and from subsidiaries and on refinancing short-term commercial paper as it matures would be a decrease/increase in profit before tax of \u00a390 million (2022: decrease/increase of \u00a392 million). We manage and hedge our interest rate exposure through setting risk tolerance levels on a Solvency II cover ratio basis. Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.\n\n## (b) Currency risk\n\nThe Company's direct subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world. The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 54(c)(v).\n\nThe Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in Euros and Canadian dollars.\n\n## (c) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. The Company's main sources of liquidity are liquid assets held within the Company and its subsidiary Aviva Group Holdings Limited and dividends received from the Group's insurance and asset management businesses.\n\nSources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long-term instruments including commercial papers and medium and long-term debt.\n\nIn addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Company maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.\n\nMaturity analysis of external borrowings and amounts due to and by subsidiaries are provided in notes J, K and F respectively.\n\n## (d) Intra-group capital arrangement\n\nConsistent with our capital management framework, the Group has in place intra-group arrangements to provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries. In the normal course of business, the Group will provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries in certain circumstances. While the Group considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to its regulated subsidiaries and its policyholders. See note 52 for more detail on risks and capital management objectives.\n\n## O - Related party transactions\n\nThe Company had the following related party transactions.\n\nLoans to and from subsidiaries are made on normal arm's-length commercial terms. The maturity analysis of the related party loans is as follows:\n\n## (a) Loans owed by subsidiaries\n\n|                                  | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within one year                  | 607       | 546       |\n| One - five years                 | 992       | 1,624     |\n| Over five years                  | 481       | 494       |\n| Total loans owed by subsidiaries | 2,080     | 2,664     |\n\nThe interest received on these loans is \u00a373 million (2022: \u00a367 million). See note A.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, Aviva International Holdings Limited, an indirect subsidiary, transferred an unsecured loan with the Company of \u20ac250 million to Aviva Group Holdings Limited, its direct subsidiary. The loan, originally entered into on 7 May 2003, accrues interest at a fixed rate of 5.5% with settlement to be paid at maturity in May 2033. As at the statement of financial position date, the total amount drawn down on the loan was \u00a3217 million (2022: \u00a3221 million).\n\nOn 23 December 2014, the Company provided an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a32,000 million to Aviva Group Holdings Limited, its subsidiary, with an initial maturity date of 3 September 2018, which was subsequently extended to 31 December 2023. The company has renewed this facility on 1 January 2024 to further extend the maturity date to 31 December 2028. The loan has to date accrued interest at a fixed rate of 0.895% but from 1 January 2024 will accrue interest at the GBP Sonia Swap Rate plus the Five Year Credit Default Swap Spread. As at the statement of financial position date, the total amount drawn down on the facility was \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil).",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures\n\n## Overview\n\nIn order to fully explain the performance of our business, we discuss and analyse our results in terms of financial measures which include a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). APMs are non-GAAP measures which are used to supplement the disclosures prepared in accordance with other regulations, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Solvency II. We believe these measures provide useful information to enhance the understanding of our financial performance. However, APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the amounts determined according to other regulations.\n\nThe APMs utilised by Aviva may not be the same as those used by other insurers and may change over time. The calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Changes in APMs:\n\n## New APMs introduced following the adoption of IFRS 17\n\nThe Group has applied IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts retrospectively from 1 January 2023. This standard has brought significant changes to the measurement and presentation for insurance, participating investment and reinsurance contracts. Consequently, we have introduced new APMs in 2023 that provide useful information under the standard:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating value added;\n- \u00b7 Stock of future profit;\n- \u00b7 Gross written premiums (GWP);\n- \u00b7 Adjusted IFRS Shareholders' equity; and\n- \u00b7 Adjusted IFRS Shareholders' equity per share.\n\n## APMs amended following the adoption of IFRS 17\n\nIn addition, we have made certain changes to existing APMs to ensure that they remain relevant and useful for stakeholders. The Group adjusted operating profit and combined operating ratio, claims, commission, and expense ratios APM disclosures have all been updated to reflect the implementation of IFRS 17.\n\nValue of new business on an adjusted Solvency II basis (VNB) has also been amended following a review of the basis of preparation. The revised APM is considered more useful as it avoids distortions in the value of new business due to timing differences in asset origination or temporary reinsurance gaps.\n\nSolvency II return on equity is now presented both with and without an adjustment for excess capital, now that we have completed our capital return initiatives over the last two years.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit, controllable costs, Solvency II operating own funds generation and Solvency II operating capital generation now exclude integration and restructuring costs that relate to a well-defined programme that materially changes the scope of our business or manner in which its conducted. There is no impact on 2022 comparatives.\n\nFurther details on these changes are provided in the relevant sections below.\n\n## Other changes to APMs\n\nMethodology has been updated in two areas that impact operating APMs, unrelated to the adoption of IFRS 17. The changes relate to:\n\n(i) an update to the methodology to report the volatility from the impact of market movements on policyholder tax in the Heritage business in non-operating investment variances and economic assumption changes; and\n\n- (ii) a change in the calculation of general insurance investment return from a long-term investment return (LTIR) to an expected return approach as used for life business, with variances between expected and actual return being reported in non-operating investment variances and economic assumption changes.\n\n2022 comparatives have been restated to reflect these changes.\n\nBoth of the methodology changes impact the following APMs:\n\n- \u00b7 Group adjusted operating profit\n- \u00b7 Operating earnings per share\n- \u00b7 IFRS return on equity\n\nThe second methodology change impacts the following APMs:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvency II operating own funds generation\n- \u00b7 Solvency II operating capital generation\n- \u00b7 Solvency II return on equity\n- \u00b7 Solvency II return on capital\n\nIn addition, following a review of the presentation of Solvency II operating own funds generation and Solvency II operating capital generation, management actions and other are now only separately disclosed for life business.\n\nIFRS net asset value (NAV) and IFRS NAV per share have been renamed to IFRS Shareholders' equity and IFRS Shareholders' equity per share to better reflect the descriptions within the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These measures provide useful information regarding the ongoing efficiency of these businesses following the achievement of the Group's 2018 cost saving target.\n\nFurther details on APMs derived from IFRS measures and APMs derived from Solvency II measures are provided in the following sections. A further section describes other APMs.\n\n## APMs derived from IFRS measures\n\nA number of APMs relating to IFRS are utilised to measure and monitor the Group's performance.\n\n- \u00b7 Group adjusted operating profit\n- \u00b7 Operating value added\n- \u00b7 Stock of future profit\n- \u00b7 Gross written premiums (GWP)\n- \u00b7 Combined operating ratio (COR)\n- \u00b7 Claims, commission, expense and distribution ratios\n- \u00b7 Operating earnings per share (Operating EPS)\n- \u00b7 Controllable costs\n- \u00b7 IFRS return on equity (RoE)\n- \u00b7 IFRS Shareholders' equity per share\n- \u00b7 Adjusted IFRS Shareholders' equity per share\n- \u00b7 Assets Under Management (AUM) and Assets Under Administration (AUA)\n- \u00b7 Net flows\n- \u00b7 Aviva Investors revenue\n- \u00b7 Cost income ratio (CIR)\n- \u00b7 Cost asset ratio\n\nDefinitions and additional information, including reconciliation to the relevant amounts in the IFRS financial statements and, where appropriate, commentary on the material reconciling items are included within this section.\n\n## Group adjusted operating profit\n\nGroup operating profit is an APM that supports decision making and internal performance management of the Group's operating segments that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting the life and non-life insurance businesses. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items. The various items excluded from Group adjusted operating profit, but included in IFRS profit before tax, are:\n\n## (a) Investment variances and economic assumption changes\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for life and non-life business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities. This includes movements in the liabilities to with-profit policyholders that offset the operating result of non-profit contracts written in the with-profit funds. Group adjusted operating profit also includes the effect of the mismatch between movements in expected future insurance contract cash flows measured at current discount rates and the corresponding adjustment to the contractual service margin (CSM) measured at locked in rates. The expected rate of return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification.\n\nFor fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk. The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the opening 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit includes the effect of variances in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions such as changes in expected cashflows for non-life claims. Changes due to economic items such as market value movement and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe exclusion of short-term investment variances from this APM reflects the long-term nature of much of our business. The Group adjusted operating profit, which is used in managing the performance of our operating segments, excludes the impact of economic variances to provide a comparable measure year-on-year.",

Directly attributable I&R costs will be reflected in the CSM and the impact recognised in Group adjusted operating profit as CSM is amortised.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, IWR announced a 15-year extension to our key strategic partnerships with Diligenta and FNZ to simplify our operations and support our growth ambitions, with further changes improving how we serve our customers. Integration and restructuring costs of \u00a361 million have been incurred during 2023 in relation to this simplification, with additional costs expected to be incurred over the period 2024-2028. This programme will rationalise our administration platforms to remove complexity and improve customer outcomes. The costs will cover changes to data and systems and expenditure to deliver associated efficiency savings. Benefits of this restructuring programme will include a reduction in the operating cost base of the IWR business, resulting in higher cash generation and cash remittances.\n\n## (d) Other items\n\nOther items are those items that, in the directors' view, are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. At 31 December 2023, other items are a net loss of \u00a3176 million (2022: \u00a341 million gain) which comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a392 million relating to fees paid to bondholders in respect of certain modifications to the terms and conditions of the Group's \u00a3600 million Tier 2 Fixed to Floating notes. This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the costs arise from a strategic decision relating to the financing of the group as a whole and not to the operating performance of the Group or its operating segments;\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a371 million relating to provisions for indemnities entered into through acquisition and disposal activity. This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the acquisition and disposal activity is considered strategic in nature;\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a32 million relating to costs directly associated with the acquisition of Optiom O2 Holdings Inc by Aviva Canada; and\n- \u00b7 Charges totalling \u00a311 million relating to the cost of the employee free share award announced in 2022, and fees and charges associated with the 2023 share buyback programme.\n\n## Other items at 2022 comprised :\n\n- \u00b7 The following items which are disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as they relate to acquisition and disposal activity that we consider to be strategic in nature:\n- -A gain of \u00a377 million relating to negative goodwill on the acquisition of Aviva India, which is excluded from Group adjusted operating profit for consistency with the treatment of impairment of goodwill;\n- -A charge of \u00a315 million arising from third party reinsurance, accepted by Aviva from the former Aviva France general insurance entity, which was terminated on 31 December 2021;\n- -A net release of provisions relating to acquisition and disposal activity of \u00a31 million;\n- -A charge of \u00a37 million relating to costs directly associated with the acquisition of Succession Wealth; and\n- \u00b7 Charges of \u00a315 million relating to the cost of the employee free share award, and fees and charges associated with the share buyback and return of capital to ordinary shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is defined as the operating profit in the period plus the operating change in the contractual service margin (CSM) (gross of tax). Operating changes in the CSM include new business, interest accretion, expected return, experience variances, assumption changes and release of CSM and exclude economic variances and economic assumption changes.\n\nNon-operating changes in the CSM consist of investment variances, economic assumption changes, and integration and restructuring costs that are directly attributable to insurance contracts. This includes integration and restructuring costs (gross of tax) of \u00a395 million (2022: \u00a3nil) representing the present value of the costs expected to be incurred in relation to simplification of the infrastructure of our IWR business and improvements to how we serve our customers. \u00a3143 million has been recognised in operating changes in CSM reflecting lower expense assumptions. Additional benefits in excess of the costs are expected to be recognised in future years as contracts are migrated and the programme delivers the expected efficiencies.\n\nFor business measured using the general measurement model (GMM) the CSM is calculated using locked-in rates, so investment variances and economic assumption changes will be limited to changes in expenses due to inflation. For contracts measured under the variable fee approach (VFA), variance between the expected return on the shareholder share of underlying assets and the actual return are reported as non-operating changes in CSM.\n\nThis APM is relevant for the life insurance business and is a more complete and useful measure of the value generated in the period, reflecting the benefit of writing new business and assumption changes in the period. No adjustment is made for the future value of the businesses for which no CSM liability has been established and operating value added is equal to operating profit.\n\n|                                                                                                | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Group adjusted operating profit before tax attributable to shareholders' profits (restated 1 ) | 1,467     | 1,350     |\n| Operating changes in CSM                                                                       | 851       | 426       |\n| Operating value added                                                                          | 2,318     | 1,776     |",

It is presented at the Group total. The releases from the stock of future profit are a key driver of profit for our life insurance business and these releases are provided for our IWR Protection, Annuities, Heritage and Ireland businesses.\n\n## Gross written premiums (GWP)\n\nGWP is a measure of volumes written in the period for the general Insurance business. It was previously reported under the IFRS 4 income statement and therefore was a GAAP measure. Following adoption of IFRS 17, GWP is classified as an APM. GWP is useful for understanding the growth of the business. Reconciliations of GWP to insurance revenue is set out below. Reconciling items arise from presentational differences between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17, and timing differences between writing premiums and recognising insurance revenue.\n\n|                                                                                                 | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross written premiums                                                                          |        | 10,888    | 9,749     |\n| Movement in unearned premiums on contracts measured under the premium allocation approach (PAA) |        | (668)     | (359)     |\n| Instalment income                                                                               |        | 69        | 67        |\n| Reclassification resulting from the adoption of IFRS 17                                         |        | -         | 34        |\n| Insurance revenue from general insurance business                                               | 4(a)   | 10,289    | 9,491     |\n| Insurance revenue from other segments                                                           | 4(a)   | 8,208     | 7,398     |\n| Insurance revenue                                                                               | 5      | 18,497    | 16,889    |",

It is used to monitor the profitability of lines of business. A COR below 100% indicates profitable underwriting.\n\nThe COR presentation has been updated for IFRS 17. The main differences in the calculation relate to using a risk adjustment rather than reserve margins, specific allowances for onerous business and reallocations between the numerator and denominator of the calculation. COR continues to be presented on a net of reinsurance basis, but now includes the impact of discounting as aligned to IFRS 17 requirements (discounted COR).\n\nThe Group considers COR with claims measured on an undiscounted basis (undiscounted COR) to align more closely to the way in which the business is managed, and undiscounted COR is disclosed alongside discounted COR.\n\nThe Group discounted and undiscounted COR are shown below.\n\n|                                                              | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Total claims and benefits - GI and Health                    | 8      | (6,557)   | (6,237)              |\n| Adjusted for the following:                                  |        |           |                      |\n| Claims and benefits - Health                                 |        | 454       | 371                  |\n| Claims recoverable from reinsurers                           |        | 474       | 652                  |\n| Losses on onerous contracts (including recoveries) and other |        | (16)      | (48)                 |\n| Total incurred claims (included in COR)                      |        | (5,645)   | (5,262)              |\n| Insurance service expense - GI and Health                    | 4(b)   | (9,664)   | (9,172)              |\n| Adjusted for the following:                                  |        |           |                      |\n| Insurance service expenses- Health                           |        | 582       | 435                  |\n| Insurance service expenses recoverable from reinsurers       |        | 473       | 650                  |\n| Remove incurred claims                                       |        | 5,645     | 5,262                |\n| Include non attributable expenses and other                  |        | (35)      | (20)                 |\n| Total commission and expenses (included in COR) 2            |        | (2,999)   | (2,845)              |\n| Total underwriting costs - discounted                        |        | (8,644)   | (8,107)              |\n| Remove discounting benefit                                   |        | (327)     | (75)                 |\n| Underwriting costs - undiscounted                            |        | (8,971)   | (8,182)              |\n| Insurance Revenue - GI and Health                            | 4(b)   | 10,925    | 10,049               |\n| Adjusted for the following:                                  |        |           |                      |\n| Insurance Revenue - Health                                   |        | (637)     | (558)                |\n| Allocation of reinsurance premiums                           |        | (963)     | (896)                |\n| Net insurance revenue (included in COR)                      |        | 9,325     | 8,595                |\n| Discounted Combined operating ratio (COR)                    |        | 92.7 %    | 94.3 %               |\n| Undiscounted Combined operating ratio (COR)                  |        | 96.2 %    | 95.2 %               |\n\n## Claims, commission, expense and distribution ratios\n\nFinancial measures of the performance of our general insurance business which are calculated as incurred claims, earned commission or earned expenses expressed as a percentage of net insurance revenue, which can be derived from the COR table above. The ratios are meaningful to stakeholders because they enhance understanding of the profitability of the business sold. The commission ratio and expense ratio are aggregated together to calculate the distribution ratio, which is the key efficiency metric for general insurance business.\n\n## Operating earnings per share (Operating EPS)\n\nOperating EPS is calculated based on the Group adjusted operating profit attributable to ordinary shareholders net of tax, deducting non-controlling interests, preference dividends and direct capital instrument coupons divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, after deducting treasury shares. Operating EPS is considered meaningful to stakeholders because it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by adjusting for the effects of non-operating items. A reconciliation between operating EPS and basic EPS can be found in note 15.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These predominantly consist of staff costs, central costs, property and IT related costs and other expenses. Controllable costs also include indirect acquisition costs, such as underwriting overheads, and claims handling costs. These are considered to be controllable by the operating segments.\n\n## Controllable costs excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment of goodwill, associates and joint ventures; amortisation and impairment of other intangible assets acquired in business combinations; and amortisation and impairment of acquired value of in-force business. These items relate to merger, acquisition and disposal activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from controllable costs which is principally used to manage the performance of our operating segments;\n- \u00b7 Costs in relation to product governance and mis-selling. These costs represent compensation and redress payments made to policyholders and are excluded from controllable costs because they have characteristics of claims payments;\n- \u00b7 Premium based taxes, fees and levies that vary directly with premiums. These costs are by their nature a direct cost incurred as a result of generating premium income, and therefore not a controllable operational overhead;\n- \u00b7 Integration and restructuring costs recognised in 'other expenses' that relate to a well-defined programme that materially changes the scope of our business or the manner in which it is conducted; and\n- \u00b7 Other amounts that, in management's view, are not representative of underlying day-to-day expenses involved in running the business, and that would distort the year-on-year controllable costs trend. In 2023 these primarily include;\n- -A charge of \u00a392 million relating to fees paid to bondholders in respect of certain modifications to the terms and conditions of the Group's \u00a3600 million Tier 2 Fixed to Floating notes. This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the costs arise from a strategic decision relating to the financing of the group as a whole and not to the operating performance of the Group or its operating segments;\n- -\u00a378 million of costs where the implementation of IFRS 17 has required a change in income statement classification but not within the boundary of controllable costs;\n- -A charge of \u00a371 million relating to provisions for indemnities entered into through acquisition and disposal activity. This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the acquisition and disposal activity is considered strategic in nature; and\n- -Charges totalling \u00a311 million relating to the cost of the employee free share award announced in 2022, and fees and charges associated with the 2023 share buyback programme.\n\nA reconciliation of other expenses in the IFRS consolidated income statement to controllable costs is set out below:\n\n|                                                                                                    | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other expenses 1                                                                                   | 8      | 2,443     | 2,225     |\n| Add: other acquisition costs 1                                                                     | 8      | 1,055     | 999       |\n| Add: claims handling costs 1                                                                       |        | 239       | 330       |\n| Less: amortisation and impairment of intangibles acquired in business combinations                 |        | (52)      | (54)      |\n| Less: amortisation and impairment of acquired value of in-force business on investment contracts 1 | 8      | (59)      | (68)      |\n| Add/(less): foreign exchange gains/(losses) 1                                                      | 8      | 146       | (73)      |\n| (Less)/add: product governance and mis-selling costs                                               |        | (63)      | 12        |\n| Less: integration and restructuring costs                                                          |        | (61)      | -         |\n| Less: premium based income taxes, fees and levies                                                  |        | (220)     | (216)     |\n| Less: other costs 1                                                                                |        | (256)     | (3)       |\n| Controllable costs                                                                                 |        | 3,172     | 3,152     |\n\nBaseline controllable costs are controllable costs included in the scope of the 2018 cost saving target baseline.

Net flows when positive in the period can be referred to as net inflows and when negative as net outflows.\n\n## Aviva Investors revenue\n\nAviva Investors revenue includes AMCs received, plus transaction fees and other related income, and is stated net of fees and commissions paid. It is a useful measure of revenue earned from fund management activities. Aviva Investors recognises fee income in the segmental income statement within both fee and commission income and inter-segment revenue. Fees and commissions paid are classified in other operating expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The internal allocation of AUM and AUA  to  Insurance,  Wealth  &  Retirement  and  Aviva  Investors  provides  the  most  relevant  information  to  assess  the efficiency of these businesses.\n\n## APMs derived from Solvency II measures\n\nThe Group is a regulated entity under the Solvency II regulatory framework and therefore uses a number of APMs that are derived from Solvency II measures in addition to those that are derived from IFRS based measures.\n\nA number of key performance measures relating to Solvency II are utilised to measure and monitor the Group's performance and financial strength\n\n- \u00b7 Solvency II shareholder cover ratio\n- \u00b7 Value of new business on an adjusted Solvency II basis (VNB)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II Present Value of New Business Premium (PVNBP)\n- \u00b7 Annual premium equivalent (APE)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II operating capital generation (Solvency II OCG)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II future surplus emergence\n- \u00b7 Solvency II return on capital (Solvency II RoC)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II return on equity (Solvency II RoE)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II net asset value per share (Solvency II NAV per share)\n- \u00b7 Solvency II debt leverage ratio\n\nThe Solvency II regulatory framework requires insurers to hold own funds in excess of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). Own funds are available capital resources determined under Solvency II. This includes the excess of assets over liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet, calculated on best estimate, market consistent assumptions and includes transitional measures on technical provisions (TMTP), subordinated liabilities that qualify as capital under Solvency II, and off-balance sheet own funds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a number of subsidiaries utilise the standard formula rather than a riskbased capital model to assess capital requirements, the overall Group SCR is calculated using a partial internal model, and it is shown after the impact of diversification benefit.\n\nThe 'shareholder view' of Solvency II is considered by management to be more representative of the shareholders' riskexposure and the Group's ability to cover the SCR with eligible own funds and aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position. In arriving at the shareholder view, the following adjustments may be made to the regulatory Solvency II position:\n\n- \u00b7 The contribution to the Group's SCR and own funds of the most material fully ring-fenced with-profits funds and staff pension schemes in surplus are excluded. These exclusions have no impact on Solvency II surplus as these funds are self-supporting on a Solvency II capital basis with any surplus capital above SCR not recognised.\n- \u00b7 A notional reset of the TMTP, calculated using the same method as used for formal TMTP resets. This presentation avoids step changes to the Solvency II position that arise only when the formal TMTP reset points are triggered.\n- \u00b7 Adjustments for future regulatory changes that are finalised but not yet implemented at the reporting date in order to show a more representative view of the Group's solvency position.\n\nThe reconciliation presented below shows the key differences between Group equity on an IFRS basis and Solvency II own funds on a shareholder view. Additional items bridging from Solvency II shareholder own funds to Solvency II regulatory own funds are presented subsequently.\n\n|                                                               | Note   | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Total Group equity on an IFRS basis                           |        | 9,600     | 10,214               |\n| Exclude preference shares and tier 1 notes                    |        | (696)     | (696)                |\n| Exclude non-controlling interests                             | 39     | (318)     | (310)                |\n| Add back CSM                                                  | 40(c)  | 7,248     | 6,480                |\n| Exclude tax on CSM                                            |        | (1,779)   | (1,585)              |\n| IFRS adjusted shareholders' equity                            |        | 14,055    | 14,103               |\n| Goodwill                                                      | 17     | (2,100)   | (2,102)              |\n| Acquired value of in-force business                           | 18     | (461)     | (521)                |\n| Deferred acquisition costs (net of deferred income)           | 30, 49 | (710)     | (783)                |\n| Other intangibles                                             | 18     | (507)     | (419)                |\n| Elimination of goodwill and other intangible assets           |        | (3,778)   | (3,825)              |\n| Removal of IFRS risk adjustment                               | 40(b)  | 1,162     | 1,326                |\n| Inclusion of Solvency II risk margin                          |        | (1,278)   | (2,922)              |\n| TMTP (on a notional reset basis)                              |        | 1,407     | 2,319                |\n| Revaluation of subordinated liabilities                       |        | 196       | 265                  |\n| Asset, liability and other accounting valuation differences 2 |        | 682       | 1,323                |\n| Tax differences                                               |        | (403)     | (631)                |\n| Exclude staff pension schemes in surplus (net of tax)         |        | (669)     | (996)                |\n| Solvency II unrestricted shareholder tier 1 own funds         |        | 11,374    | 10,962               |\n| Restricted tier 1                                             |        | 946       | 946                  |\n| Tier 2                                                        |        | 4,526     | 4,264                |\n| Tier 3                                                        |        | 173       | 296                  |\n| Estimated Solvency II shareholder own funds                   |        | 17,019    | 16,468               |\n| Adjustments for:                                              |        |           |                      |\n| Fully ring-fenced with-profit funds                           | 52     | 1,408     | 1,369                |\n| Staff pension schemes in surplus                              | 52     | 397       | 394                  |\n| Regulatory vs. notional TMTP valuation differences            | 52     | -         | 437                  |\n| Estimated Solvency II regulatory own funds                    |        | 18,824    | 18,668               |\n\nEstimated Solvency II regulatory own funds of \u00a318,824 million (2022: \u00a318,668 million) is \u00a32,016 million(2022: \u00a31,838 million) greater than estimated Solvency II regulatory net assets of \u00a316,808 million (2022: \u00a316,830 million), primarily due to recognition of eligible subordinated debt capital less adjustments for ring-fenced funds restrictions.",

For contracts that are repriced more frequently, weekly or monthly economic assumptions have been used. The economic assumptions follow Solvency II rules for risk-free rates, volatility adjustment and matching adjustment.\n\nThe operating assumptions are consistent with the Solvency II balance sheet. When these assumptions are updated, the year-to-date VNB will capture the impact of the assumption change on all business sold that year.\n\nAviva applies a Matching Adjustment (MA) to certain obligations in IWR, using methodology which is set out in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR). The MA used for 2023 UK new business (where applicable) was 133 bps (2022 restated: 123 bps). The MA is an addition to the rate used to discount Solvency II best-estimate liabilities, to reflect the return on the matching assets used. In the calculation of VNB, an MA is applied based on the target allocation of assets backing new business. This allocation will be different to the MA applied at the portfolio level.\n\n## New business margin\n\nNew business margin (VNB margin) is calculated as value of new business on an adjusted Solvency II basis (VNB) divided by the present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) and expressed as a percentage.\n\n## Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP)\n\nPVNBP measures sales in the Group's life insurance business. PVNBP is derived from the present value of new regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts plus 100% of single premiums from new business written in the financial period and is expressed at the point of sale. The discounted value of regular premiums is calculated using the same methodology as for VNB. PVNBP also includes any changes to existing contracts which were not anticipated at the outset of the contract that generate additional shareholder risk and associated premium income of the nature of a new policy.\n\n|                                                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Protection and Health (Insurance)                      | 3,006     | 2,507     |\n| Wealth and Other                                       | 23,470    | 22,877    |\n| Retirement (Annuities and Equity Release)              | 7,088     | 6,238     |\n| Ireland                                                | 1,934     | 1,657     |\n| Insurance, Wealth & Retirement                         | 35,498    | 33,279    |\n| International investments (India, China and Singapore) | 2,048     | 1,172     |\n| Group present value of new business premiums (PVNBP)   | 37,546    | 34,451    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This provides useful information on sales and new business when considered alongside VNB.\n\n| Protection and Health                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP)      | 3,006     | 2,507     |\n| Remove capitalised value of future regular premiums | (2,591)   | (2,148)   |\n| Annual premium equivalent (APE)                     | 415       | 359       |\n\n## Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG)\n\nSolvency II operating own funds generation measures the amount of Solvency II own funds generated from operating activities and incorporates an expected return on investments supporting the life and non-life insurance businesses. Solvency II operating own funds generation is used to assess sustainable growth. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items.\n\nThe expected investment returns assumed within Solvency II OFG are consistent with the returns used for Group adjusted operating profit. Solvency II OFG includes the effect of variances in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions (for example, longevity) and model changes that are non-economic in nature.\n\nConsistent with the Group adjusted operating profit APM, Solvency II OFG and Solvency II OCG exclude investment variances, economic assumption changes, and integration and restructuring costs.\n\nSolvency II operating own funds generation is the own funds component of Solvency II OCG (see next section).\n\n## Solvency II operating capital generation (Solvency II OCG)\n\nSolvency II operating capital generation (Solvency II OCG) measures the amount of Solvency II capital the Group generates from operating activities. Capital generated enhances Solvency II surplus which can be used to support sustainable cash remittances from our businesses, which in turn, supports the Group's dividend as well as funding further investment to provide sustainable growth.\n\nSolvency II OCG reflects Solvency II OFG and operating movements in the SCR including the impact of capital actions, for example, strategic changes in asset mix including changes in hedging exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is also based on a linear run-off of the TMTP. These items may affect the actual amount of Solvency II OCG earned from existing business in future periods.\n\nFor business subject to short contract boundaries under Solvency II, allowance has been made for the impact of renewal premiums as and when they are expected to occur.\n\nThe projected surplus, which is primarily expected to arise from the release of risk margin (including transitional measures) and solvency capital requirement as the business runs off over time, is expected to emerge through Solvency II OCG in future years.\n\nThe cash flows are real-world cash flows, i.e. they are based on best estimate non-economic assumptions used in the Solvency II valuation and real-world investment returns rather than risk-free. The expected investment returns are consistent with the methodology used in the Group adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Solvency II return on equity (Solvency II RoE)\n\nSolvency II RoE is used as an economic value measure by the Group to assess growth and performance.\n\nSolvency II RoE is calculated as:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating own funds generation less preference dividends, equity RT1 note coupons, adjusted to replace the run-off of TMTP with the economic cost of holding TMTP (calculated as Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital plus 1-yr swap rate, multiplied by the opening TMTP on a shareholder basis), divided by:\n- \u00b7 Opening unrestricted tier 1 shareholder Solvency II own funds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excess capital is derived as Solvency II shareholder own funds in excess of our target shareholder cover ratio (currently 180%). Now that we have completed our capital return initiatives over the last two years, we have reported Solvency II RoE with and without adjustment for excess capital.\n\nSolvency II RoE is calculated on an annualised basis and is shown below:\n\n|                                                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   | Restated 1 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|\n| Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG)                  | 1,729     | 1,540                |\n| Adjustment to replace TMTP run-off with economic cost of TMTP                 | (41)      | 64                   |\n| Less preference share dividends                                               | (38)      | (38)                 |\n| Less RT1 note coupons                                                         | (34)      | (17)                 |\n| Adjusted Solvency II OFG (less preference share dividends & RT1 note coupons) | 1,616     | 1,549                |\n| Opening unrestricted tier 1 shareholder Solvency II own funds                 | 10,962    | 15,697               |\n| Solvency II return on equity                                                  | 14.7 %    | 9.9 %                |\n\nSolvency II RoE (adjusted for excess capital) has increased by 2.7pp to 18.3% (2022: 15.6%).

The excess capital as at 1 January 2022 was \u00a35,813 million and this included capital set aside for the \u00a33.75 billion capital return, \u00a31 billion further debt reduction over time, pension scheme payment, Succession Wealth acquisition and final 2021 dividend.\n\n## Solvency II return on capital (Solvency II RoC)\n\nSolvency II return on capital is an unlevered economic value measure as it is used to assess growth and performance in our businesses before taking debt into account. It is calculated on an annualised basis.\n\nSolvency II RoC is calculated as:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating own funds generation adjusted to replace the run-off of TMTP with the economic cost of holding TMTP (calculated as Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital plus 1-yr swap rate multiplied by the opening TMTP on a shareholder basis), divided by:\n- \u00b7 Opening shareholder Solvency II own funds.\n\nFor UK general insurance only, capital held for internal risk appetite purposes is used instead of opening shareholder Solvency II own funds. This removes any distortions arising from our general insurance legal entity structure and therefore ensures consistency in measuring performance across markets. This is only applicable to UK general insurance Solvency II return on capital and not to the aggregated Group Solvency II return on equity measure.\n\nA reconciliation of Solvency II return on capital by market to Group return on equity is provided below.\n\n|                                                        | 2023                                       | 2023                               | 2023                                     | Restated 1 2022                            | Restated 1 2022                    | Restated 1 2022                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                        | Solvency II OFG  (post TMTP adjustment) \u00a3m | Opening  shareholder own  funds \u00a3m | Solvency II  return on  capital/equity % | Solvency II OFG  (post TMTP adjustment) \u00a3m | Opening  shareholder own  funds \u00a3m | Solvency II return  on capital/equity % |\n| Insurance, Wealth & Retirement (IWR)                   | 1,256                                      | 12,564                             | 10.0 %                                   | 1,432                                      | 13,830                             | 10.4 %                                  |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance 2                       | 315                                        | 2,491                              | 12.6 %                                   | 261                                        | 2,339                              | 11.2 %                                  |\n| Canada General Insurance                               | 339                                        | 1,800                              | 18.8 %                                   | 274                                        | 1,746                              | 15.7 %                                  |\n| Aviva Investors                                        | 19                                         | 387                                | 4.9 %                                    | 24                                         | 400                                | 6.0 %                                   |\n| International investments (India, China and Singapore) | 156                                        | 1,187                              | 13.1 %                                   | 106                                        | 982                                | 10.8 %                                  |\n| Corporate centre costs and Other 2                     | (219)                                      | (1,961)                            | N/A                                      | (279)                                      | 2,853                              | N/A                                     |\n| Less: Senior and subordinated debt                     | (178)                                      | (4,264)                            | N/A                                      | (214)                                      | (5,880)                            | N/A                                     |\n| Less: RT1 coupon and preference shares 3               | (72)                                       | (946)                              | N/A                                      | (55)                                       | (450)                              | N/A                                     |\n| Less: Net deferred tax assets                          | -                                          | (296)                              | N/A                                      | -                                          | (123)                              | N/A                                     |\n| Solvency II return on equity at 31 December            | 1,616                                      | 10,962                             | 14.7 %                                   | 1,549                                      | 15,697                             | 9.9 %                                   |",

Cash remittances eliminate on consolidation and hence are not directly reconcilable to the Group's IFRS consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Excess centre cash flow\n\nThis represents the cash remitted by business units to the Group centre less central operating expenses and debt financing costs. Excess centre cash flow is a measure of the cash available to pay dividends, reduce debt or invest back into our business. Excess centre cash flow does not include cash movements such as disposal proceeds or capital injections. Excess centre cash flow when positive in the period can be referred to as excess centre cash inflows and when negative as excess centre cash outflows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Cautionary statement\n\nThis document should be read in conjunction with the documents distributed by Aviva plc (the 'Company' or 'Aviva') through The Regulatory News Service (RNS).This announcement contains, and we may make other verbal or written 'forward-looking statements' with respect to certain of Aviva's plans and current goals and expectations relating to future financial condition, performance, results, strategic initiatives and objectives (including, without limitation, climate-related plans and goals). Statements containing the words 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'projects', 'plans', 'will', 'seeks', 'aims', 'may', 'could', 'outlook', 'likely', 'target', 'goal', 'guidance', 'trends', 'future', 'estimates', 'potential', 'objective', 'predicts', 'ambition' and 'anticipates', and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking. By their nature, all forwardlooking statements involve risk and uncertainty. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Aviva believes factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forwardlooking statements in the announcement include, but are not limited to: the impact of ongoing uncertain conditions in the global financial markets and the national and international political and economic situation generally (including those arising from the escalation of Russia-Ukraine and IsraelPalestine conflicts into wider regional conflicts); market developments and government actions; the effect of credit spread volatility on the net unrealised value of the investment portfolio; the effect of losses due to defaults by counterparties, including potential sovereign debt defaults or restructurings, on the value of our investments; the impact of changes in short or long-term interest rates and inflation reduce the value or yield of our investment portfolio and impact our asset and liability matching; the impact of changes in equity or property prices on our investment portfolio; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the effect of market fluctuations on the value of options and guarantees embedded in some of our life insurance products and the value of the assets backing their reserves; the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments; the effect of adverse capital and credit market conditions on our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital; changes in, or restrictions on, our ability to initiate capital management initiatives; changes in or inaccuracy of assumptions in pricing and reserving for insurance business (particularly with regard to mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates), longevity and endowments; a cyclical downturn of the insurance industry; the impact of natural and man-made catastrophic events (including the longer-term impact of COVID-19) on our business activities and results of operations; the transitional, litigation and physical risks associated with climate change; failure to understand and respond effectively to the risks associated with environmental, social or governance ('ESG') factors; our reliance on information and technology and third-party service providers for our operations and systems; the impact of the Group's risk mitigation strategies proving less effective than anticipated, including the inability of reinsurers to meet obligations or unavailability of reinsurance coverage; poor investment performance of the Group's asset management business; the withdrawal by customers at short notice of assets under the Group's management; failure to manage risks in operating securities lending of Group and third-party client assets; increased competition in the UK and in other countries where we have significant operations; regulatory approval of changes to the Group's internal model for calculation of regulatory capital under the UK's version of Solvency II rules; the impact of recognising an impairment of our goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives; changes in valuation methodologies, estimates and assumptions used in\n\nthe valuation of investment securities; the effect of legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the impact of operational risks, including inadequate or failed internal and external processes, systems and human error or from external events and malicious acts (including cyber attack and theft, loss or misuse of customer data); risks associated with arrangements with third parties, including joint ventures; our reliance on third-party distribution channels to deliver our products; funding risks associated with our participation in defined benefit staff pension schemes; the failure to attract or retain the necessary key personnel, including quality financial advisers; the failure to act in good faith, resulting in customers not achieving good outcomes and avoiding foreseeable harm; the effect of systems errors or regulatory changes on the calculation of unit prices or deduction of charges for our unit-linked products that may require retrospective compensation to our customers; the effect of a decline in any of our ratings by rating agencies on our standing among customers, broker-dealers, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of our products and services; changes to our brand and reputation; changes in tax laws and interpretation of existing tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business; changes to International Financial Reporting Standards relevant to insurance companies and their interpretation; the inability to protect our intellectual property; the effect of undisclosed liabilities and other risks associated with our business disposals; and other uncertainties, such as diversion of management attention and other resources, relating to recent and future acquisitions, combinations or disposals within relevant industries; the policies, decisions and actions of government or regulatory authorities in the UK, the EU, the US, Canada or elsewhere, including changes to and the implementation of key legislation and regulation (for example, FCA Consumer Duty and Solvency II). Please see Aviva's most recent Annual Report and Accounts for further details of risks, uncertainties and other factors relevant to the business and its securities. Aviva undertakes no obligation to update the forward looking statements in this announcement or any other forwardlooking statements we may make. Forward-looking statements in this report are current only as of the date on which such statements are made. The climate metrics, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements used in this document should be treated with special caution, as they are more uncertain than, for example, historical financial information and given the wider uncertainty around the evolution and impact of climate change. Climate metrics include estimates of historical emissions and historical climate change and forward-looking climate metrics (such as ambitions, targets, climate scenarios and climate projections and forecasts). Our understanding of climate change and its impact continue to evolve. Accordingly, both historical and forward-looking climate metrics are inherently uncertain and, therefore, less decision-useful than metrics based on historical financial statements.\n\nThis report has been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company, as a body, and no other persons.
