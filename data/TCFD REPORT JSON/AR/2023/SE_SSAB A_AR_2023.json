        "page_content": "## Another strong year\n\nSumming up 2023, SSAB had another strong year. Our operating result amounted to SEK 16.5 billion, lower than last year's record but still at a good level. We continue to generate strong cash flow, which increased during the year to SEK 16.2 billion. We initiated a share buyback program in 2023 and the Board proposes a dividend of SEK 5.00 per share. Our strong financial position is an advantage ahead of the comprehensive transformation that SSAB and the steel industry are facing.\n\nIt was a relatively weak year on the European steel market, our largest market. Inflation and higher interest rates dampened demand, especially in the construction sector. The North American heavy plate market continued to be at a good level, even though prices decreased compared to the high level seen in 2022. In SSAB Special Steels, demand was also affected by a weaker European market and shipments were somewhat lower than in 2022. But it is only a matter of time before growth returns, thanks to drivers in the form of higher productivity and better sustainability performance. Our highquality products have the most advanced properties, which is demonstrated by a 40% share of the global market in wear steel.\n\n## More resilient SSAB\n\nOur result demonstrates that we can manage a cyclical slowdown better than before, with higher profitability. We have become better at quickly adjusting costs to lower demand and we have\n\ngradually improved the product mix through a higher share of products with significant added value.\n\n## Progress in the automotive industry\n\nAn example of this is the world-leading product portfolio in high-strength steels for the automotive industry that we have built up. This includes cold-rolled products, so called ultra highstrength steels that provide greater impact protection in cars while reducing weight. We also benefit from our leading position in steel with no carbon dioxide emissions. Automakers and their subcontractors want to sign cooperation agreements to be able to take stock of the properties of fossil-free steel before the future ramp-up of volumes. This means that SSAB can access new platforms with existing customers and also attract new customers already today. Our shipments of AHSS products in the Automotive segment increased by 22% in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Launch of unique steel\n\nSpring 2023 saw us launch SSAB Zero, a unique steel with virtually 0.0 kg CO2e/kg of steel. Unlike our fossil-free steel, which is produced with iron ore, SSAB Zero is made from recycled scrap. We use renewable electricity and biofuel to produce the steel slabs in Montpelier in the USA. In other words, we do not need to reallocate emissions or use other technical accounting solutions to reduce the emissions on paper. Our flexible production system means that we can process the steel downstream in both the USA and Europe, and ship to customers all over the world. We shipped more than 50,000 tonnes of SSAB Zero in 2023 and will ramp this up in 2024.\n\n## Oxel\u00f6sund being transformed to fossil free\n\nSSAB plans to close all its coke plants and blast furnaces, thereby largely removing all direct carbon dioxide emissions. The first step is to transform the steel plant in Oxel\u00f6sund and a start was made on construction of the new electric arc furnace during 2023. All the necessary permits are now in place and the transformation is proceeding to plan. Not only will this significantly improve our environmental performance, but also give us greater flexibility to adjust production in response to quick changes in demand and pave the way for more advanced products. The next step in the plan is to build modern mini-mills with integrated processing in Lule\u00e5 and Raahe.\n\nThere is a good platform for our transformation in Sweden with good access to fossil-free electricity and top-quality iron ore. But we need to make effective use of these advantages otherwise the transformation in Sweden risks being delayed, which will in turn affect the conditions for the industry and future\n\ninvestments. Permit processes in Sweden are lengthy and unpredictable. Furthermore, our competitors in France and Germany, for example, have been promised multi-billion euro subsidies to transform their production. In our other home markets, Finland and North America, the prerequisites are significantly better, especially regarding permit processes.\n\n## 'Infrastructure investments in the USA impact positively on the steel market'\n\n## Infrastructure investments in the USA\n\nPoliticians in the USA have clearly pointed the way. At the federal level, major new programs are now being launched in the form of the Infrastructure Bill and Inflation Reduction Act to upgrade the transport system, roads, ports and energy production. US infrastructure has been neglected in some areas and there are now pentup needs. Among other things, the American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that the investments will increase demand for steel by several million tonnes for many years to come, in many cases with demands for locally produced steel. SSAB's products in North America are used for construction equipment, wind turbines, bridges and shipbuilding. Investments in infrastructure also benefit demand for highstrength steels.\n\n## Safer workplace\n\n## Favorable long-term outlook\n\nSSAB aims to be the world's safest steel company with zero lost time injuries. The positive trend in fewer lost time injuries continued in 2023, and most of our large production sites did not have a single lost time injury during the year. Lost time injury frequency (LTIF), including contractors, decreased to 0.87 (1.06). There is a strong correlation between a safe workplace and high productivity.\n\n## Updated financial targets\n\nHigh productivity is key to SSAB being able to reach industry-leading profitability. In 2023, we revised our financial targets, primarily with regard to the capital structure. We now have a net gearing framework to keep to, which among other things means that our owners can take comfort in the fact that the pace of transformation will be adapted to the capacity of the balance sheet.\n\n## Supporting UN global sustainability goals\n\nA strong financial position is the basis for being able to run the business in a sustainable way. SSAB has clear and ambitious sustainability work, which is not only intended to reduce our environmental impact and to improve our safety culture but also encompasses business ethics, responsible sourcing and equality at our workplaces. The work is based on UN Global Compact principles on responsible business, to which SSAB has been a signatory for many years. We have also committed to contribute to longterm sustainable development in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn the short term, there will always be more or less uncertainty with regard to the business cycle. In the longer term, SSAB has every possibility to perform well. We continue to lead the green transition in the steel industry. The investments we have ahead of us will not only remove our CO2 emissions but also significantly improve our cost position in Europe. Given the major infrastructure investments, the US market is very interesting from a mid-term perspective. We will continue to invest in high-strength steel capacity, a market that is enjoying structural growth. Through our work with continuous improvement, we can take advantage of more initiatives from our employees and I would like to thank all employees, you are the key to our future success.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank all our shareholders for their confidence in SSAB. I am convinced that SSAB will continue to transform into a even more sustainable and more profitable company.\n\n## Martin Lindqvist,\n\nPresident and CEO",

The plan is to replace the coke plant and blast furnace with an electric arc furnace which can use recycled steel and sponge iron as raw material. Work on construction of the new electric arc furnace started in November in the presence of Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom the left: Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Adam Axelsson (project member, Steel transformation, SSAB), Johnny Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (head of SSAB Special Steels and site manager at SSAB Oxel\u00f6sund) and Martin Lindqvist (President and CEO of SSAB).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safer workplace\n\nFurther improvement was seen in employee and contractor safety at SSAB. Group lost time injury frequency (LTIF) decreased to 0.87 (1.06), which is largely thanks to the fact that there were no lost time injuries in SSAB's operations in Finland in 2023. SSAB Europe's safety program, under which all employees received two-weeks of safety training, was completed during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Made from recycled scrap steel using fossil-free electricity and biogas, SSAB Zero has practically no fossil carbon emissions. SSAB thereby strengthened its leading position in the green transition in the steel industry through a comprehensive offering of steel without fossil-free carbon dioxide emissions, regardless of raw material. Volvo Group, Alfa Laval, Cargotec, Epiroc and Peab were among the customers to sign agreements for deliveries of SSAB Zero. SSAB Zero is also available at Tibnor AB and selected Nordic distribution partners: Stena St\u00e5l AB, St\u00e5lgross AB and Norsk St\u00e5l AS.\n\n## First in fossil free\n\nMany new products featuring SSAB fossil-free steel were launched during 2023. Among other things, the world's first building made with fossil-free steel was inaugurated through a collaboration between Peab and SSAB, together with Ruukki Construction and the real estate company Wihlborgs. In addition, the first consumer products were shipped in the form of a watch made using fossil-free steel powder by Swedish watchmaker TRIWA and the first item of furniture in the form of a bench by Norwegian urban furniture maker Vestre. Forvia, one of the automotive industry's largest subcontractors, also showcased a seat frame where an important part of the construction is made of fossil-free steel. Volvo Construction Equipment delivered the first dumper built with fossil-free steel to the US market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSAB visit during top trade meeting\n\nIn May, a number of decision-makers visited SSAB and Hybrit Development AB's pilot plant in Lule\u00e5 in conjunction with a trade and technology meeting between the EU and the USA. Visitors included US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager and Swedish Government and business representatives.",

The fossil carbon emissions of SSAB Zero in operations are 0.0 kg CO2e per kg steel - including purchased energy (scope 1 and 2). The electricity used is fossil free, which is ensured through guarantees of origin. For other energy, SSAB applies emissions factors accepted by the market for the electricity used and can ensure fossil-free electricity through guarantees of origin. SSAB Zero is unique on the market since SSAB does not use mass balancing allocation or carbon emission offsetting. The product's low carbon has been verified by a third party.

The two blast furnaces and coke plant in Oxel\u00f6sund will be closed down and a new electric arc furnace with the associated raw material handling will be built.\n\nThe transformation of Oxel\u00f6sund will mean not only a fossil-free production system, but also increased capacity for advanced high-strength steel and greater flexibility. After transformation, SSAB will be able to make steel with no fossil CO2 emissions using a flexible mix of fossil-free sponge iron and scrap as raw materials.\n\nFurthermore, there are plans to transform the steel mills in Lule\u00e5 and Raahe into cost-effective mini-mills with electric arc furnaces, integrated hot rolling and further processing. The plants in Borl\u00e4nge and H\u00e4meenlinna will be further developed at the same time in line with the new production processes.\n\nNo formal investment decisions regarding these steel mills and plants have yet been taken.\n\nSSAB's transformation plan for the Nordic production system will largely involve the elimination of all carbon dioxide emissions from our own operations in around 2030. The closure of SSAB's blast furnaces will reduce direct carbon dioxide emissions by around 90%, which corresponds to an annual reduction of more than 8 million tonnes. The remaining direct emissions relate mainly to different heating processes, where SSAB is working to find alternative fuels. SSAB's transformation is significant in relation to Nordic climate goals. Sweden's total carbon dioxide emissions can reduce by around 10% and Finland's by around 7%.\n\nThere are a number of important factors for SSAB to be able to implement the transformation:\n\n- \u00b7 Availability of electricity at the sites in Sweden and Finland\n- \u00b7 Availability of raw materials, primarily fossilfree sponge iron and scrap\n- \u00b7 Level playing field for all European steel companies regarding state aid\n- \u00b7 Permits for transformation of the installations\n- \u00b7 Availability of the relevant competence\n- \u00b7 Regulation resulting in costs for emitting carbon dioxide\n\n'SSAB's transformation means Sweden's total carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced by around 10% and Finland's by around 7%.'",

When the blast furnaces are replaced with electric arc furnaces in around 2030, use of electricity will increase by around 4.5 TWh, of which 2.5 TWh in Sweden. This can be compared with an electricity surplus of 33 TWh in Sweden in 2022.\n\nAlthough there is plenty of electricity available in Sweden and Finland for SSAB's transformation, the challenge is to get power distribution to the steel mills in Sweden. The existing connections to the electricity grid are dimensioned based on SSAB's blast furnaces, which in this context have low electricity consumption. Once the blast furnaces are replaced by electric arc furnaces, a more robust connection to the main grid will be needed. Decisions on new power lines are taken by the local network operator concerned.\n\n'The planned electric arc furnace will melt both fossilfree sponge iron and scrap.'\n\n## Flexible raw material supply\n\nThe planned electric arc furnaces will melt both fossil-free sponge iron and scrap. Scrap is mixed to a certain extent already in blast furnace-based production today.\n\nFossil-free sponge iron will initially be produced at a commercial scale in LKAB's demonstration plant outside G\u00e4llivare in Sweden. The feedstock from the demonstration plant is estimated to correspond to the production of 1.2 million tonnes of crude steel a year. Access to fossil-free electricity has a highly important role in the making of sponge iron. The demonstration plant is estimated to need around 5 TWh of electricity a year.\n\nSSAB will increase purchases of scrap for the Nordic production system. Whereas there is currently a surplus of scrap in Europe and the USA, demand for scrap is likely to increase in line with the transformation of the steel industry. SSAB's strategy to use a flexible mix of scrap and fossil-free sponge iron will be an advantage in the supply of raw material.\n\n## Level playing field regarding state aid\n\nA number of SSAB's competitors in Europe have received state aid. SSAB has not assumed it will receive any significant aid in its plans to implement the transformation, but at the same time it is important to have a level playing field in terms of state aid to prevent a distortion of competitive conditions.\n\nThe HYBRIT initiative, which SSAB owns 1/3 of, has received EUR 143 million in support from the EU's Innovation Fund as well as SEK 520 million from the Swedish Energy Agency. LKAB has been further granted SEK 3.1 billion for construction of the demonstration plant outside of G\u00e4llivare.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are tasked with coordinating and supporting the Group's sustainability work, for example regarding health and safety, environmental issues and business ethics. During the year, an internal Council for Corporate Responsibility was established, which includes the CEO, General Counsel, Head of Sustainability, Divisional Heads and the Head of Ethics & Compliance.\n\n## Important documents for sustainability\n\nThe documents below are published on SSAB's website. Besides these, there are also directives and instructions for, among other things, the work with inclusion and diversity. All directives and instructions apply to the entire Group and all divisions and subsidiaries are responsible for implementing them.\n\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 Directive and instruction regarding health and safety\n- \u00b7 Directive and instruction regarding the environment\n- \u00b7 Directive and instruction regarding energy\n- \u00b7 Directive and instruction regarding quality work\n- \u00b7 Directive and instruction regarding anticorruption\n- \u00b7 Directive and instruction regarding competition compliance\n\n## Due diligence, risk management and complaints\n\nSSAB works risk-based and strategically with sustainability issues. The process includes risk identification, policy development, strategy formulation and the development of measures\n\nthat are implemented in a structured way for each sustainability aspect concerned. The process is usually coordinated by the sustainability function at Group level and is followed up against sustainability targets decided by the Board. The follow-up is reported in the Sustainability Report.\n\nAt SSAB, risk management is integrated into the annual strategy process. Sustainability risks, including climate-related risks, are included in the overall risk assessment and presented annually to the Board of Directors. During the year, SSAB initiated work to develop the systematic assessment of risks of adverse impacts on people and the environment, as well as the process for assessing sustainability-relevant risks with a financial impact on the Group.\n\nAll production facilities have a management system for occupational health and safety, in accordance with ISO 45001. Environmental and climate work takes place primarily within the framework of ISO 14001, and all production facilities are certified in accordance with this standard.\n\nComplaints can be reported through the line to the manager or immediate manager, via local internal reporting channels and the whistleblower function Ethics Line. In addition, SSAB has regular meetings with union representatives. Any complaints are followed up and dealt with. In addition, there are various stakeholder dialogs with suppliers, customers, authorities and stakeholder organizations.\n\nDuring the year, SSAB did not receive any significant fines and no events that resulted in sanctions.\n\n## Sustainability and remuneration\n\nSSAB's remuneration policy is described in the Board of Directors' Report. The short-term variable salary component (STI) may include financial and non-financial goals. The nonfinancial targets must be linked to sustainability. The sustainability goal for 2023 was lost time injury frequency (LTIF). The targets are decided by the Board of Directors and the sustainability goal applies to all employees who have an STI.\n\nA fundamental part of SSAB's long-term strategy is the goal to transform to fossil-free steelmaking. The long-term variable salary component (LTI) is linked to sustainability through effective transformation work and is measured by both a financial and non-financial goal. The 2023 program comprised two targets: The relative total return on the SSAB share over a three-year period and a sustainability goal covering the total sales of products without fossil carbon dioxide emissions. The goals regarding LTI are proposed by the Board of Directors for resolution by the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## About the Sustainability report\n\nSSAB's Sustainability report 2023 has been prepared in accordance with GRI Standards, and also includes sustainability reporting in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. EY has conducted a limited assurance examination of the Sustainability Report (pages 29-67, excluding pages 42-45) and has expressed its conclusions on the Statutory\n\nSustainability Report (page 103).

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities for and governance of environmental work\n\nSSAB's Group Executive Committee has adopted directives and instructions concerning the environment and energy. The governing documents ensure that SSAB contributes to a safe, environmentally responsible and profitable business model by developing products and services in collaboration with customers and suppliers, and that SSAB will continue to use raw materials and energy in innovative and efficient ways, while minimizing waste. The Energy Directive clarifies the importance of the energy issue for the Group and the work on energy efficiency.\n\nThe Group's CTO is responsible for environmental work, including energy issues. Environmental managers in each country coordinate the work through, for example, environmental councils with representatives from the divisions as well as Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. Responsibility for compliance with environmental work lies with the line organization and each site has its own environmental function to monitor compliance with legislation and environmental permits. The local environmental functions also take care of local stakeholder dialogs, such as contact with supervisory authorities. All of SSAB's production sites are certified according to ISO 14001. Environmental work is monitored at different levels: locally, for divisions and subsidiaries, and across the Group. Follow-up is carried out, for example, in relation to legal requirements, requirements from\n\nauthorities and other environmental aspects that have been identified as significant. Carbon dioxide emissions are a parameter that is monitored at all levels and also reported quarterly and annually.\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nSSAB's annual carbon dioxide emissions in Sweden and Finland correspond to approximately 10% and 7% respectively of total national emissions. This makes it extremely important for SSAB to reduce emissions to help each country reach its climate goals.\n\nMost of SSAB's direct carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1) come from Nordic iron ore-based steel production and originate from the use of coke and coal as reducing agents in steelmaking. SSAB's Nordic mills are among the most CO2efficient in the world, mainly due to the use of high-grade iron ore pellets and high-quality coke. There are limited opportunities to further reduce emissions in current processes, and before the planned transformation is completed, direct emissions will vary with steel production.\n\nIndirect carbon dioxide emissions from purchased energy (Scope 2) come primarily from the operation of electric arc furnaces at the sites in the USA, but also, for example, from the use of electricity for rolling steel, both in the USA and the Nordics. SSAB purchases electricity and heating based on the energy mix available in each local market, except for the site in Montpelier, USA, where the electricity supplier gives local industrial customers priority for\n\nrenewable electricity, mainly wind power. In Finland and Sweden, SSAB purchases some fossil-free electricity verified by guarantees of origin.\n\nOther indirect carbon dioxide emissions, scope 3, mainly include emissions from purchased raw materials and products, transport and freight from suppliers and/or to customers, and from the processing of sold products. During the year, SSAB commissioned an external party to carry out a complete calculation of scope 3 for the\n\nbaseline year 2018 and 2022. This was done in conjunction with the process of updating the greenhouse gas emissions target under the Science Based Targets initiative. The calculation is more extensive than previously reported values and is partly based on other calculation methods. The values are therefore not comparable. See Definitions for more information.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n| Thousand tonnes                                                                       | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions                                                      |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Gross Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions                                                | 9,915  | 9,844  | 10,641 | 9,471  | 10,154 | 10,332 |\n| Share of Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions  from regulated emission trading schemes, % | 94     | 94     | 93     | 92     | 93     | 93     |\n| Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions                                                      |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Gross market-based Scope 2 greenhouse gas  emissions                                  | 1,157  | 1,179  | 1,029  | 1,339  | 1,427  | 1,487  |\n| Significant Scope 3 greenhouse gas  emissions                                         |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Purchased goods and services                                                          | n/a    | 6,741  | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 6,182  |\n| Capital goods                                                                         | n/a    | 116    | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 74     |\n| Fuel and energy-related activities                                                    | n/a    | 496    | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 501    |\n| Upstream transportation and distribution                                              | n/a    | 2,255  | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 2,629  |\n| Waste generated in operations                                                         | n/a    | 189    | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 44     |\n| Business traveling                                                                    | n/a    | 4      | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 9      |\n| Employee commuting                                                                    | n/a    | 11     | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 12     |\n| Upstream leased assets                                                                | n/a    | 41     | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 29     |\n| Processing of sold products                                                           | n/a    | 1,499  | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 1,691  |\n| Total Scope 3 GHG emissions                                                           | n/a    | 11,352 | n/a    | n/a    | n/a    | 11,169 |\n| Total greenhouse gas emissions                                                        |        | 22,375 |        |        |        | 22,987 |",

        "page_content": "## Targets and outcomes\n\nDuring 2023, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were in line with those of the previous year. During the year, work on the transformation has progressed and focused, among other things, on obtaining the necessary environmental permits in Lule\u00e5 and Raahe.\n\nThe environmental permit application for Raahe was submitted in April 2023 and the corresponding application for Lule\u00e5 in November 2023. The plant in Oxel\u00f6sund received a new environmental permit in 2020 and construction of the new electric arc furnace began in 2023.\n\nSSAB's targets for greenhouse gas emissions are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), based on an ambition level of \"below 2\u00b0C\". This includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 and represents a 35% reduction in emissions between 2018 and 2032.\n\nNo major reductions in emissions are expected in the first few years of the period, although the increased proportion of renewable electricity at the site in Montpelier in the USA has made a positive contribution. The big reductions in emissions will take place in connection with the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking. SSAB plans to update its emission targets in 2024 to bring them into line with the 1.5\u00b0C target. SSAB also intends to include other indirect CO2 emissions, Scope 3, in the target.\n\nUpdating of the target will include the accelerated transformation of the Nordic production sites, which was communicated in January 2022 and thus did not form the basis of the current climate target approved by SBTi in 2020. The update will also include SSAB's commitment within the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign to set a long-term net zero target for Scope 1, Scope 2 and relevant parts of Scope 3.\n\n## Target: Reduction of CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) compared with the base year 2018\n\n|                                 | 2023   | Target  2023   | Target  2025   | Target  2026   | Target  2030   | Target  2031   | Target  2032   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| CO2e reduction, million  tonnes | 0.7    | 0.5            | 1.2            | 1.8            | 3.1            | 4.0            | 4.1            |\n| CO2e reduction                  | 6 %    | 4 %            | 10 %           | 15 %           | 26 %           | 34 %           | 35 %           |\n\n## Target: Resource efficiency\n\n| Thousand tonnes    | 2023   | Target  2023   | Target  2024   | Target  2026   | Target  2030   |\n|--------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Steel volume saved | 1,059  | 1,050          | 1,095          | 1,165          | 1,290          |\n\nAs a result of the transition to fossil-free steelmaking, SSAB will switch to using fossil-free sponge iron and scrap as raw materials. Regardless of the raw material, SSAB assesses that steelmaking in the new production plants will be both eligible and aligned with the EU Taxonomy, although it is currently difficult to determine what limits will apply to the new production technology. See the Taxonomy section for SSAB's taxonomy reporting.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emissions by country\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental benefits of SSAB's steel (resource efficiency)\n\nSSAB has a wide range of high-strength and wear-resistant steels that, due to lower weight and higher capacity, already provide environmental benefits today in the usage phase in customers' end products. In 2023, a total weight reduction of 1,059 (1,071) thousand tonnes of steel in end products was achieved as customers upgraded to SSAB's high-strength steels compared to practices in each customer segment.\n\nThe year saw the launch of SSAB Zero, the first commercial steel with 0.0 kg CO2e/kg of steel (scope 1 and 2). This steel is made using scrap steel as the raw material at SSAB's mill in Montpelier, USA. The production process takes place in electric arc furnaces powered by fossil-free electricity or biogas. Shipments in 2023 amounted to more than 50,000 tonnes. At the same time, SSAB continued to make pilot shipments of fossil-free steel based on fossilfree sponge iron.",

Systematic work is therefore undertaken on energy efficiency and energy recovery at all sites, as well as on electricity generation from process gases at steel mills, in order to ensure high system efficiency and limit total emissions. Total energy consumption (including electricity, purchased fuels and purchased heat) was 9,142 (8,961) GWh, and energy intensity amounted to 1,175 (1,229) kWh/ tonne crude steel.\n\nElectricity is the largest energy source, accounting for approximately 50% of total energy consumption. Electricity is used primarily to power the electric arc furnaces at the US sites. Natural gas, propane and fuel oil are mainly used for various heating and heat treatment processes.\n\nBy recovering process gases and heat energy at coking plants, blast furnaces and steel mills, SSAB not only uses the energy for its own purposes, but also produces electricity and district heating, which are sold externally.\n\n## Energy consumption and mix (GRI 302-1)\n\n| GWh                                                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fossil fuel consumption                                       |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Natural gas                                                   | 3,206  | 3,255  | 3,680  | 3,708  | 3,361  |\n| Propane                                                       | 1,053  | 932    | 815    | 684    | 817    |\n| Oil                                                           | 200    | 187    | 163    | 214    | 425    |\n| Total fossil fuel consumption                                 | 4,459  | 4,374  | 4,658  | 4,606  | 4,603  |\n| Share of fossil fuels in total energy  consumption, %         | 49     | 49     | 50     | 51     | 50     |\n| Renewable fuel consumption                                    |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Biogas                                                        | 8      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Biodiesel                                                     | 40     | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Total  renewable fuel consumption                             | 48     | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Share of renewable fuels in total energy  consumption, %      | 1      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Electricity and heat consumption                              |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Electricity, purchased                                        | 3,495  | 3,532  | 3,357  | 3,271  | 3,448  |\n| Electricity produced from process gases                       | 1,121  | 1,037  | 1,342  | 1,184  | 1,056  |\n| Heat, purchased                                               | 19     | 18     | 18     | 21     | 28     |\n| Total electricity and heat consumption                        | 4,635  | 4,587  | 4,717  | 4,476  | 4,532  |\n| Share of electricity and heat in total energy  consumption, % | 51     | 51     | 50     | 49     | 50     |\n| Electricity and heat sold                                     |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Heat, sold                                                    | 1,161  | 1,095  | 1,193  | 1,098  | 1,165  |\n| Total electricity and heat sold                               | 1,161  | 1,095  | 1,193  | 1,098  | 1,165  |\n| Total energy consumption, gross                               | 9,142  | 8,961  | 9,375  | 9,082  | 9,135  |\n| Net total energy consumption (deduction for  sold heat)       | 7,981  | 7,866  | 8,182  | 7,984  | 7,970  |\n\nRecovered energy has been used to produce district heating at the sites in Lule\u00e5, Raahe and Oxel\u00f6sund since the 1980s, corresponding to around 90% of local district heating needs.\n\nSSAB has already hedged most of its electricity consumption in the Nordic region through financial instruments and physical delivery (see note D.3).

        "page_content": "## Climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nThe steel industry accounts for about 7% of total carbon dioxide emissions globally and is thus clearly impacted by increased regulations and market changes aiming for a low-carbon society. At the same time, the potential effects of an increasingly changing climate must be taken into account, especially with regard to SSAB's production sites and supply chain. For SSAB, climate risks primarily include two aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 The steel industry will face both new, stricter rules, such as the EU's emissions trading system, and changed market conditions as the outside world seeks to reduce emissions.\n- \u00b7 A changing climate can impact SSAB's operations, both at its own sites and in the value chain.\n\nSSAB began work on developing fossil-free steelmaking back in 2016 and in recent years has closely monitored various risks resulting from global warming, such as increased regulation on climate issues and carbon dioxide emissions, but also opportunities for SSAB such as greater demand for steel with a lower climate footprint. A key part of SSAB's strategy is to lead the green transition in the steel industry.\n\nClimate-related risks for the next three years are included in the annual Group-wide risk process. Various climate-related issues are also included in the annual strategy process, such as business strategy aspects concerning the transformation\n\nto fossil-free steelmaking. See SSAB's risk management section.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nDuring 2022, SSAB conducted an overall analysis of the business strategy based on two different climate scenarios - low and high future levels of carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) performed simulations regarding local climate change at SSAB's largest production sites. The results of the scenario analysis are presented on the next page.\n\n## SSAB's business strategy in different climate scenarios\n\nSSAB's strategy to transform to fossil-free steelmaking and to be the first steel company to bring fossil-free steel to market is well positioned in both scenarios. The greatest risks linked to the business strategy relate more to the ability to transform operations to the set schedule. These risks are largely due to external factors that SSAB has little control over, such as access to fossilfree electricity.\n\n## Consequences of climate change\n\nAt a general level, SMHI's simulation showed that the largest climate effects at SSAB's facilities, both in scenarios with low and high future emissions, are expected to occur in the form of a warmer climate and increased precipitation. For the Nordic facilities, especially in northern Sweden and Finland, this may mean increased precipitation in the form of rain during the winter. SSAB continuously reviews any physical climate risks at the local level and takes these into account in both the planning and implementation of the transformation of the sites to fossil-free\n\nsteelmaking. The additional cost for this is not expected to be material for the Group as a whole.\n\nDuring the year, a number of events linked to climate change, such as high temperatures and precipitation, occurred in the outside world.\n\nThis has not resulted in increased costs or other financial consequences for SSAB, but shows an increased risk in society in general of higher costs for adaptation and measures linked to climate change. For more information about the financial impact of climate risks, see the Risk section and notes A.2, C.1 and C.5.\n\n## Examples of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n|                            | Products and services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Politics and  regulation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Politics and regulation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Technology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk/opportunity           | First in fossil-free steel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Price development of  CO2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Delay in the  transformation to  fossil-free steelmaking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Unsuccessful  implementation of  transformation  program and  investments                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Description                | SSAB aims to be the  first steel company to  bring fossil-free steel to  market.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Within the EU, the  price for CO2  emissions is set  within the ETS system  and the cost to the  steel industry is  expected to increase  in pace with the  phasing out of free  allocations of  emission allowances.

The two scenarios are based on the IPCC's climate scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, as well as descriptions in SSP 1 and SSP 5. SSAB also commissioned the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) to analyze the potential physical impacts of future climate change. This analysis was also based on RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The physical climate analysis included temperature, precipitation, wind strength and water supply. A total of 10 different indicators were analyzed. The analysis used three different time periods: short-term (until 2040), medium-term (2040-2070) and long-term (2070-2100). See Definitions for explanations and more information.\n\n'SSAB's strategy to transform to fossil-free steelmaking and to be the first steel company to bring fossil-free steel to market is well positioned in both scenarios.'\n\n| Future scenario    (approx. 2050)    | Society as a whole                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The steel industry's position in each scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | SSAB's market position                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Climate at SSAB's plants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scenario 1: Low future    emissions  | Global temperature rise has been limited to 2  degree Celsius and CO2 emissions are  negative by the end of the century. Global  agreements have resulted in a strict  international climate policy and high costs  associated with CO2 emissions. High demand  for sustainable products and high regulatory  pressure have contributed to all industries  transitioning to a low climate footprint. | Large steel companies have switched to  fossil-free steel production or production with  low CO2 emissions, partly due to strong  demand. Steel with a low carbon footprint has  been developed over time and become a  standard product. The ability to adapt quickly  is and has been a competitive advantage. | Steel with a low CO2 footprint is becoming the  new normal. During a transitional period,  fossil-free steel can probably justify higher  added value for the customer compared to  standard steel. But this price premium is  considered to be less likely when the entire  industry has made the transition. | The average temperature has increased at  most of SSAB's production sites. Locally, the  amount of precipitation has also increased,  for example at the Lule\u00e5 site. The average  temperature in the Baltic Sea has risen  slightly.                                                                           |\n| Scenario 2: High future    emissions | Global temperature rise has increased to 4  degree Celsius by the end of the century and  CO2 emissions are 3 times higher than today.  Global agreements on climate policy and  binding emission reduction commitments  have not been reached. The population's  resource-intensive lifestyle continues, and                                                                                        | Many steel producers have continued to use  carbon-intensive production methods, but a  small number have chosen to make the  transition and assume a niche position with  low CO2-emission steel.                                                                                                               | There is demand for fossil-free steel, but  probably to a lesser extent than for the above  scenario. The possible price premium for  fossil-free steel is not considered to be as  distinct, but can probably be realized over a  longer period of time.                                                      | The average temperature has increased at  all of SSAB's production sites. Precipitation  has also increased, both in summer and  winter, especially at the plants in the Nordic  countries. The average temperature in the  Baltic Sea has risen slightly and the amount  of water in waterways has increased. |",

        "page_content": "## Disclosures according to EU Taxonomy\n\nSSAB's steel operations are included in the EU Taxonomy under the category Manufacturing of iron and steel (delegated act for Climate). Steel production includes all economic activities that are part of the SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe and SSAB Americas divisions, which in principle account for 100% of SSAB's carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1).  SSAB has no other operations (including related to nuclear energy or natural gas) that have been deemed material in relation to the Group's consolidated revenues, capital expenditure or operational expenses, or that are covered by the delegated acts for other environmental objectives. See Definitions section for further explanation of KPI's.\n\n## Definitions of economic activities\n\nThe following NACE codes are relevant in the category Manufacturing of iron and steel:\n\n- \u00b7 C19.10 Manufacture of coke oven products\n- \u00b7 C24.10 Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys\n- \u00b7 C24.20 Manufacture of tubes, pipes, hollow sections and related fittings, of steel\n- \u00b7 C24.32 Cold rolling of narrow strip\n- \u00b7 C24.52 Casting of steel\n- \u00b7 C25.11 Manufacture of metal structures and parts of structures\n- \u00b7 C25.61 Treatment and coating of metals SSAB's steel divisions also run operations without specific NACE codes, such as pickling, annealing, slitting, cut-to-length and packaging. In addition, there are also supporting or complementary activities such as water withdrawals, wastewater treatment\n\nplants, recycling of residuals, landfill facilities, power plants, and production of hydrogen and oxygen. SSAB has concluded that these activities are also included in the category Manufacturing of iron and steel.\n\n## Technical screening criteria for climate\n\nThe EU Taxonomy includes technical screening criteria for how economic activities can be considered to contribute significantly to reducing climate impact or to contributing to climate change mitigation.\n\n- \u00b7 None of SSAB's steel mills that produce iron ore-based steel meet the limits for the production of hot metal or coke.\n- \u00b7 SSAB's scrap-based steelmaking in electric arc furnaces uses more than 90% recycled steel and thereby meets the criteria.\n\n## Criteria for not causing significant harm\n\nSSAB's scrap-based steelmaking is not considered to cause significant harm, based on SSAB's analysis of the taxonomy criteria. This analysis is based on SSAB's assessment of the purpose of the regulation and on a materiality perspective.\n\n- \u00b7 Climate adaptation: SSAB's climate risk analysis has been conducted in accordance with accepted climate models. No material risks have been identified. Read more on the previous page.\n- \u00b7 Water and marine resources: SSAB's scrapbased sites have the necessary permits for the withdrawal of water, discharges of process water and surface storm water. Both sites have established procedures and processes to enhance effluent water quality and to reduce discharge volumes. Both sites are located in areas with low water stress.\n- \u00b7 Pollution: At SSAB's scrap-based sites, there are two fire protection agents with a low concentration (<1%) of persistent organic pollutants, known as POPs. Traces of mercury can occur in a small number of products linked to the production processes. Four kinds of refrigerants with ozone-depleting substances are in use; these are being replaced in accordance with applicable regulations. SSAB considers there to be compliance with both the RoHS Directive and REACH Annex XVII (Restrictions List). SSAB's use of chemicals does, however, include certain substances on the Restrictions List, but their use is not in conflict with the current requirements. Substances under REACH Article 59 (Candidate List) or other substances that meet the criteria under REACH Article 57 may be present in the chemicals used by SSAB. These potential substances are not described in more detail here, since SSAB's steelmaking in the USA can be categorized as important to society. This is based on the fact that steelmaking is a socalled Critical Manufacturing Sector, according to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Presidential Policy Directive 21. Regarding requirements for best available technology and prescribed emission levels, SSAB's operations in the USA are subject to US regulations. SSAB has the required environmental permits, and it is considered that operations meet all relevant requirements.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity: Biodiversity risks resulting from emissions to water, air or land are managed within the framework of the environmental permits that exists for the operations. The necessary precautions have been taken and the risks are therefore not considered\n\nsignificant. SSAB complies with all relevant US regulations in this area, even though SSAB has not yet been obliged to draw up a formal environmental impact assessment for its sites. Furthermore, the US sites are not close (within 50 km) to any area deemed to be particularly sensitive, such as Natura 2000 sites, UNESCO World Heritage Sites or other areas of particular importance for biodiversity.\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nThe taxonomy also includes what are known as minimum safeguards, which mean that companies must have processes in place to ensure that international frameworks for responsible business are complied with in their own operations and in the value chain, e.g., the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. SSAB considers that the work performed in areas such as business ethics, anti-corruption, occupational health and safety, employees and responsible sourcing corresponds to such processes and addresses identified risks. See also the section on Human Rights.\n\n## Change compared with the previous year\n\nRevenue from SSAB's scrap-based steelmaking decreased less relative to other income during the year. Investments in not-Taxonomy-aligned activities increased in relative terms due, among other things, to higher costs of emission allowances. Operating expenses also increased more in relative terms for not-Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\n## Financing in line with the taxonomy\n\nSSAB's sustainability-linked bonds will be used for general corporate purposes and not for any specific part of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Pollution\n\nSSAB's operations are energy-intensive, which primarily generates carbon dioxide emissions, but also gives rise to other significant emissions to air from various combustion processes and emissions to water via cooling water and contaminated process water. All in all, there are emissions to air, water and soil. This is part of SSAB's systematic improvement work aimed at minimizing environmental impact. SSAB ensures that emissions are kept within the framework of discharge conditions and other requirements from environmental authorities.\n\n## Lower dust emissions in Oxel\u00f6sund\n\nClosing the blast furnaces at SSAB's mill in Oxel\u00f6sund will not only mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions corresponding to 3% of Sweden's emissions but also a sharp decrease in dust emissions, such as coal dust, and sulfur dioxide emissions. Nitrogen oxides emissions are also expected to fall.\n\n## Other significant air emissions (GRI 305-7)\n\n| Tonnes                         | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Particulate matter (PM)        | 576    | 531    | 595    | 510    | 596    |\n| Sulfur dioxide emissions (SOx) | 3,578  | 2,393  | 3,492  | 2,549  | 3,243  |\n| Nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) | 3,426  | 3,484  | 3,135  | 3,274  | 3,316  |\n\n## Emissions to water\n\n| Tonnes           |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Suspended solids |    353 |    302 |    164 |     76 |    196 |\n| Mineral oil      |      2 |      2 |      1 |      2 |      2 |\n\n## Circular economy (materials and waste)\n\nWhenever possible, SSAB recycles and reuses residual materials in steelmaking processes to extract more value, reduce the use of virgin raw materials and minimize the volume of waste taken to landfill. For example, the use of scrap can be optimized in steelmaking in order to reduce the need for iron ore as feedstock.\n\nIn its Nordic operations, SSAB works with the recirculation of materials for its own production: processing and sales of by-products such as slag, as well as the handling of waste that has no environmentally or economically justifiable recipient.\n\n## Scrap as raw material\n\nIn the US plants, almost 100% scrap metal is used as a raw material and the Nordic iron orebased plants also use about 20% scrap metal as raw material. In total, SSAB's annual use of scrap amounted to 3.7 (3.7) million tonnes.\n\n## Slag utilization\n\nSteel production gives rise to a number of different residuals, such as slag, sludge and dust. Materials that cannot be recirculated internally are processed into by-products, and sold externally. By-products such as slag are used in various industries, for example in road construction and as substitutes for cement.\n\n## Recycling and management of waste\n\nIf there is no environmentally or economically viable alternative to make use of waste, it must be sent either to internal landfills or to external waste recipients, in accordance with current legislation.\n\nSSAB has its own landfill sites at the major sites in the Nordic region, for example for dust and sludge from iron and steel production. These landfills are operated in accordance with the required permits and compliance is monitored by regulatory authorities. SSAB does not have its own landfill sites or waste transportation in the USA. The material sent to landfill sites is sampled by a third-party supplier and classified before delivery.\n\nAll SSAB sites have their own monitoring and data collection systems that meet the requirements of the authorities. SSAB works on an ongoing basis to reduce waste volumes and increase the use of residuals.\n\n## Targets and outcomes\n\nSSAB's circularity target is defined as the total use of scrap and fossil-free sponge iron in Nordic steel production. The target is for the use of scrap and fossil-free sponge iron in the Nordic region to reach 29% per tonne crude steel by 2025, when the site in Oxel\u00f6sund has been converted to an electric arc furnace. The outcome for 2023 was 19% (19%).\n\nSSAB also has a target for all Nordic annual slag production to be taken into use internally or externally from 2025 and beyond. The outcome for 2023 was 120% (83%) due to high external demand for slag.",

        "page_content": "## Water\n\n## Responsibilities and governance\n\nWater withdrawal and discharges to water are regulated in accordance with decisions from the respective environmental authority. There are local instructions at each site, for example, for the maintenance of treatment plants and checks on discharges to water. In Sweden and Finland, there is also coordinated inspection of the water quality in the water bodies where discharges occur. These checks are financed jointly with other operations that impact the same recipient.\n\n## Surface water withdrawal (freshwater)\n\nSSAB withdraws cooling water from rivers, lakes and other waters, such as the Lule\u00e4lv river (the site in Lule\u00e5), the Dal\u00e4lven river (Borl\u00e4nge), the Nyk\u00f6pings\u00e5n river (Oxel\u00f6sund), the Kuljunlahti basin (Raahe) and lake Vanajavesi (H\u00e4meenlinna). The site in Iowa withdraws water from the Mississippi River. The site in Alabama uses groundwater. This corresponds to less than 1% of SSAB's total freshwater withdrawal.\n\n## Surface water withdrawal (salt/brackish water\n\nFor the sites in Lule\u00e5, Raahe and Oxel\u00f6sund, SSAB also withdraws cooling water from the Baltic Sea.\n\n## Areas of water stress\n\nAccording to WRI's water stress analysis, all SSAB's steel mills are located in areas facing a low risk of water stress, with the exception of Oxel\u00f6sund, which is located in an area with a medium to high risk due to low groundwater levels. However, SSAB does not use groundwater as cooling water in Oxel\u00f6sund, and the need for surface water in the form of fresh water will be reduced when the plant is converted into an electric arc furnace system. The planned electric arc furnace will be cooled with sea water.\n\n## Water important in steelmaking\n\nThe steel industry requires huge volumes of waters in its processes. This is why all SSAB's production sites are in the vicinity of water, which is primarily used to cool the steel, in annealing processes, for example. Water is also used to scrub process gases and as a lubricant, as well as rinsing and flushing water in, for example, pickling.\n\n## Total water withdrawal by source (303-1)\n\n| Million m 3            |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Surface water (inland) |    193 |    190 |    196 |    180 |    180 |\n| Surface water (sea)    |    204 |    196 |    205 |    198 |    198 |\n| Municipal water        |      2 |      2 |      1 |      1 |      1 |\n| Total water withdrawal |    398 |    388 |    402 |    379 |    379 |\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nSSAB strives to integrate ecosystem services into its operations in order to promote biodiversity. This is a long-term undertaking that involves a wide range of activities, from taking ecosystem services into account when planning and developing operations, to preserving and maintaining the flora and fauna that already exist. It may also involve utilizing vegetation within the industrial sites in order to reduce the spread of dust and bind airborne pollutants, or to create recreational areas for the general public. Ecosystem services is a term that embraces all products and services provided by nature's ecosystems and which contribute to human welfare and quality of life.\n\n## Local initiatives\n\nThere are many examples of local agreements with municipalities, county administrative boards or stakeholder organizations, in which SSAB collaborates with biologists from government agencies or other organizations, for example to preserve dead wood to create habitats for fauna, to plan for nesting boxes or the natural establishment of vegetation and meadowland, for example in connection with the decommissioning of landfill sites.\n\n## Examples from previous years:\n\n- \u00b7 Inventory of, among other things, nature values and nesting birds in the industrial areas of both Lule\u00e5 and Raahe\n- \u00b7 Agreement with Borl\u00e4nge Municipality to preserve a valuable recreational area in Islingbyholen with a unique environment and significant natural and cultural values, and to\n\nkeep it accessible to the public. SSAB has also worked with the municipality to adapt land and vegetation by an existing noise barrier in order to create a large-scale insect hotel.\n\n- \u00b7 Restoration of wetland upstream of the site in Oxel\u00f6sund in collaboration with the Swedish Anglers Association and landowners in the area. The wetlands provide a regenerated spawning ground for pike in the L\u00e5ngsj\u00f6n lake in S\u00f6rmland in order to stabilize the ecosystem locally, reduce the discharge of nutrients into the Baltic Sea and, in the long term, to reduce algal bloom.\n\n## Biodiversity in Lule\u00e5\n\nSSAB has developed a plan to strengthen biodiversity in Svart\u00f6n, the site of SSAB Lule\u00e5. This is a step in our ambition to increase biodiversity in conjunction with the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking. The starting point is to benefit the red-listed and already established bird species existing in the area. The plan also includes measures to create and strengthen suitable habitats, nesting sites and foraging areas by among other things preserving vegetation, creating ponds, ditches and wetlands, and open grassy areas. The plan will be updated in more detail as the transformation of SSAB Lule\u00e5 progresses. The proposed measures will result in increased biodiversity in the area.",

SSAB seeks to provide opportunities for employees to grow professionally within the organization, as well as a safe and welcoming workplace where work-life balance is important.\n\nAt the end of the year, SSAB had 15,126 employees, 200 fewer compared to the previous year. Most of SSAB's employees are in Sweden, followed by Finland and the USA. 96% are permanently employed and 21% of the workforce are female. Employee turnover was  8.0% (8.1%), and 709 (990) new employees were hired during the year.\n\n## Corporate culture\n\nSSAB's corporate culture is summarized by the SSAB Way platform, which describes what SSAB offers and what is expected of its employees. The SSAB Way includes, among other things, vision and values, expectations of employees through SSAB's Code of Conduct, and tools and criteria for managers and employees in working towards SSAB's goals. The SSAB Way is the starting point for the Annual Talks dialogs.\n\n## Competence development\n\nSSAB has several internal development programs for different levels of the organization, such as an internal business development program and a training module for middle managers. SSAB also has trainee programs, for example with a focus on technology and leadership.\n\nOne key element of competence development is the Annual Talks Dialogs, where the focus is on the individual development plan. 92% (92%) of office workers had Talks Dialogs in 2023.\n\n## Collective bargaining agreements and trade union representation\n\nAll SSAB employees in Sweden and Finland are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and approximately 78% of employees in Sweden and Finland are represented by trade unions. There are different arrangements for employees in the USA and other countries in accordance with practice and labor legislation in each country. SSAB respects employees' rights to organize in accordance with national laws and regulations. SSAB provides channels for employees to engage in the company's activities and express their views, for example through information meetings or employee surveys. The trade unions at SSAB in Europe have a European Works Council (EWC), where, for example, SSAB's management provides information about matters of importance to employees.\n\n## Personnel who are not employees\n\nAt SSAB, work is performed by different contractors, partners and external consultants in all parts of the organization and in different types of work areas, such as cleaning of premises, maintenance work at the production sites and various kinds of IT services. SSAB does not have a central follow-up of the different external resources, but this is managed at a local level.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nSSAB's remuneration policy is described in the Section Remuneration guidelines for senior executives. SSAB reports total remuneration for the CEO and the average total remuneration for employees in the parent company in the Remuneration report. SSAB does not follow up on the average wage increase for the Group as a whole.\n\n## Permanent employees\n\n|                     | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Permanent employees | 14,565 | 14,568 | 14,235 |\n| Country             |        |        |        |\n| Sweden              | 6,209  | 6,135  | 5,962  |\n| Finland             | 4,581  | 4,551  | 4,501  |\n| USA                 | 1,481  | 1,405  | 1,340  |\n| Gender              |        |        |        |\n| Women, %            | 20     | 20     | 19     |\n| Men, %              | 80     | 80     | 81     |\n\n## Full-time employees\n\n|                     | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Full time employees | 14,715 | 14,921 | 14,656 |\n| Country             |        |        |        |\n| Sweden              | 6,243  | 6,276  | 6,105  |\n| Finland             | 4,620  | 4,679  | 4,678  |\n| USA                 | 1,500  | 1,413  | 1,346  |\n| Gender              |        |        |        |\n| Women, %            | 21     | 20     | 20     |\n| Men, %              | 79     | 80     | 80     |\n\n## Total workforce\n\n|                        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employee category      |        |        |        |\n| Total workforce        | 15,126 | 15,326 | 15,078 |\n| Permanent employees, % | 96     | 95     | 94     |\n| Temporary employees, % | 4      | 5      | 6      |\n| Full-time, %           | 97     | 97     | 97     |\n| Part-time, %           | 3      | 3      | 3      |\n| Country                |        |        |        |\n| Sweden                 | 6,500  | 6,507  | 6,105  |\n| Finland                | 4,731  | 4,809  | 4,678  |\n| USA                    | 1,500  | 1,413  | 1,346  |\n| Gender                 |        |        |        |\n| Women, %               | 21     | 20     | 20     |\n| Men, %                 | 79     | 80     | 80     |\n\n## SSAB Academy\n\nWith support from the EU's Just Transition Fund, during the year, SSAB launched the SSAB Academy in Lule\u00e5 which is SSAB's training for employees to develop and exchange skills for the fossil-free transformation. SSAB Academy has started with two pilot courses launched in fall 2023 - one for certified electricians and the other in leadership training with a focus on change management.",

To achieve this, SSAB works on the basis of the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 All accidents and work-related illnesses can and must be prevented\n- \u00b7 Employee engagement and education are required for successful safety work\n- \u00b7 Safe working is a requirement for employment at SSAB\n- \u00b7 Good work in health and safety also delivers good business results\n- \u00b7 Health and safety issues should be integrated into the business process\n\nAll employees and contractors are entitled to a healthy work environment without accidents. Unfortunately, in SSAB's operations there is a risk of accidents and injuries for employees and contractors, primarily at the production sites. The most common types of accidents are wounds, sprains, strains, fractures and concussion.\n\n## Responsibilities and governance\n\nSafety work is integrated into SSAB's management system and summarized in the Group's governing document for safety, which has been adopted by the Group Executive Committee. The Directive for health and safety summarizes SSAB's ambition in the industry and emphasizes the importance of not compromising on safety work and the responsibility of  the individual to work safely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe directive is supplemented by SSAB's instructions for health and safety, which summarize the principles and requirements for safety work. The head of Sustainability is responsible for both the steering documents, which were last updated in 2019. SSAB's safety principles meet or exceed all applicable laws, regulations and internal requirements. The safety management system meets the requirements of ISO 45001 and has been implemented at all SSAB sites. Safety work also includes issues relating to process safety.\n\nAll SSAB sites are required to systematically identify safety risks and take action to minimize these risks. Local occupational health and safety programs must be developed in accordance with legislation in each country. This is generally done by local health and safety committees consisting of representatives of local company management and employees. In Sweden and Finland, there are health and safety committees at all workplaces with more than 50 employees. In the USA, there are several health and safety committees, which provide employees with the\n\n## Successful safety work\n\nThe SSAB H\u00e4meenlinna production unit, which also includes the plants in Kankaanp\u00e4\u00e4 and Finsp\u00e5ng, has had no work-related injuries for the past three years. This good improvement in safety is the result of many measures and the steadfast commitment of all employees. All employees have, in principle, participated in SSAB Europe's safety training.\n\nopportunity to participate in health and safety issues.\n\nThe line organization has overall responsibility for health and safety issues, compliance with applicable safety requirements and for conducting risk assessments. All divisions have their own safety targets, which are followed up regularly by the Group Executive Committee. Group-wide collaboration on health and safety issues is ensured by two groups:\n\n- \u00b7 The Health and Safety Council has primary responsibility for coordinating safety work, proposing policies and strategic initiatives to the Group Executive Committee and promoting a positive safety culture within SSAB. The Council is the decision-making body on operational safety issues and consists of senior employees from all SSAB divisions.\n- \u00b7 The Safety Expert Group consists of experts from SSAB's major sites, divisions and subsidiaries, with the purpose of sharing information on, for example, preventive measures.",

All employees must sign SSAB's safety pledge, which is a commitment to always put safety first. This also applies to contractors and others working at SSAB's sites.\n\n## Contractor safety\n\nEvery year, a significant number of employees from external companies work at SSAB, especially in maintenance and repairs. Based on a risk assessment, some contractors are screened to see if they have robust safety procedures. SSAB also provides safety training sessions and discussion forums in order to increase their safety awareness.\n\n## Targets and outcomes\n\nSSAB primarily monitors safety work through lost time injury frequency (LTIF) and total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) per million hours worked. See the Definitions section for more information. All divisions and subsidiaries have annual targets for LTIF and TRIF and the outcome is reported monthly to the Group Executive Committee, which also decides safety work targets.\n\nOverall safety performance during the year was good. The number of accidents resulting in absence of more than one day per million hours worked (LTIF) fell to 0.87 (1.06) and TRIF fell to 6.2 (7.8). The large increase in the LTI severity rate is mostly due to two very long sick leaves.\n\n## Work-related injuries (GRI 403-9)\n\n|                        | 2023       | 2022       | 2021       | 2020       | 2019       |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Total                  |            |            |            |            |            |\n| LTIs                   | 25         | 30         | 48         | 101        | 126        |\n| LTIF                   | 0.87       | 1.06       | 1.8        | 3.7        | 4.2        |\n| TRIF                   | 6.2        | 7.8        | 9.2        | 9.7        | 12.4       |\n| Employees              |            |            |            |            |            |\n| Fatal accidents        | -          | -          | -          | -          | -          |\n| High consequence  LTIs | 2          | -          | 2          | 9          | 7          |\n| Total LTIs             | 18         | 17         | 37         | 73         | 102        |\n| LTIF                   | 0.72       | 0.69       | 1.6        | 3.2        | 4.0        |\n| TRIF                   | 5.8        | 7.5        | 9.3        | 9.7        | 12.4       |\n| Hours worked           | 25,153,659 | 24,521,439 | 23,585,560 | 22,767,926 | 25,474,602 |\n| Subcontractors         |            |            |            |            |            |\n| Fatal accidents        | -          | -          | -          | -          | -          |\n| High consequence  LTIs | -          | -          | -          | 4          | -          |\n| Total LTIs             | 7          | 13         | 10         | 28         | 24         |\n| LTIF                   | 1.96       | 3.50       | 3.2        | 7.7        | 5.6        |\n| Hours worked           | 3,564,809  | 3,740,095  | 3,166,893  | 3,654,969  | 4,319,125  |\n\nSSAB's operations in Finland particularly contributed to lower LTIF and TRIF during the year. The good outcome of SSAB's safety work is a result of the work to improve the Group's safety culture in recent years. This work has above all focused on preventive work, accountability and education. SSAB will continue work to further strengthen the safety culture going forward.\n\n## Targets for safety work\n\n|                      | 2023   | Target 2023   | Target 2024   | Target 2026   |\n|----------------------|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Number of fatalities | -      | -             | -             | -             |\n| LTIF                 | 0.87   | 1.50          | < 1.00        | < 1.00        |\n| TRIF                 | 6.2    | 6.2           | 5.5           | 4.5           |\n| LTI severity rate    | 37     | 10            | 10            | 10            |\n\n## LTIF by country/region (employees)\n\n|                   | 2023   | 2022   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sweden            | 1.02   | 1.38   |    2.6 |    3.3 |    3.7 |\n| Finland           | -      | 0.69   |    1.3 |    5.5 |    5.4 |\n| USA               | 1.36   | 1.41   |    0.5 |    1.9 |    2.7 |\n| Rest of Europe    | 2.20   | 0.72   |    1.8 |    3.2 |    3.2 |\n| Rest of the world | -      | -      |    2.4 |    2.4 |    3.4 |\n\n## TRIF by country/region (employees)\n\n|                   |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sweden            |    7.8 |    8.1 |    9   |   10.6 |   15.4 |\n| Finland           |    4.1 |    7.8 |   12.8 |   12.6 |   12.1 |\n| USA               |    5   |    5.4 |    4.7 |    4   |    8.2 |\n| Rest of Europe    |    4.8 |    7.2 |    6.2 |    5.4 |    6.6 |\n| Rest of the world |    3.7 |    5.6 |    7.2 |    8.7 |   20   |",

This work is also important for SSAB to be able to attract and retain employees in the future. Gender equality is an important area when it comes to diversity. The metal and mining industry generally has a skewed gender distribution among employees, which also characterizes the composition of SSAB's workforce.\n\n## Governance and responsibilities\n\nWork on inclusion and diversity is summarized in governing documents at Group level and contains SSAB's principles for an inclusive workplace where all employees have the same rights. The governing document addresses nine grounds of discrimination (gender, transgender identity, ethnic or national affiliation, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital or parental status, political opinion or trade union membership). The governing document is supplemented by an employee handbook and various training events. Inclusivity, diversity and a non-discriminatory corporate culture are also part of the mandatory training on the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe line organization has overall responsibility for inclusion and diversity. During the year, all divisions set targets in the area of inclusion and\n\ndiversity. These are being monitored regularly by the Group Executive Committee. The work is coordinated by the HR function at Group level.\n\nIssues concerning inclusion and equal treatment are monitored through activities including the annual employee survey. The SSAB Ethics Line also provides employees with the opportunity to anonymously report cases of discrimination, for example, (see also Business Ethics and anticorruption).\n\n## Strategy, targets and outcomes\n\nThe strategy for inclusion and diversity is decided by the Group Executive Committee strategy based on three aspects: the overarching target is the proportion of women among line managers. The target for 2025 was set at 23% of women, compared with the outcome for the year of 22% (20%). The proportion of women among the total number of employees was 21%. Additional key figures in gender equality are regularly monitored.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\n- \u00b7 SSAB strengthened internal and external communication on diversity with the aim of focusing on how employees act and develop.\n- \u00b7 Several different internal councils were formed for the exchange of experience and cooperation between, for example, different areas of activity and countries.\n- \u00b7 Training initiatives within HR and Communications to ensure that processes and information are inclusive and nondiscriminatory.\n- \u00b7 Implementation of training for managers on how they can support and develop an inclusive environment. SSAB Americas continued to focus on training in non-discrimination and inclusion. Training is mandatory for all managers and employees and roughly 100 people received training in 2023. Furthermore, several global leadership programs have been developed to more clearly integrate perspectives on the importance of inclusion and diversity.\n\nSSAB has already participated in several different networks aimed at increasing diversity in the steel industry, such as Female Leader Engineer, and Teknikspr\u00e5nget in Sweden, Women in Tech, and Inklusiiv in Finland, and the Association of Women in the Metal Industries in the USA.\n\n## Target and outcome: Gender equality\n\n| %                               |   2023 |   2022 |   Target  2023 |   Target  2025 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Share of women  (line managers) |     22 |     20 |             21 |             23 |\n\n## Management and employees, by gender, employee category and age group (GRI 405-1) Board 1)\n\n|              | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total number | 7      | 8      | 7      | 8      |\n| Female       | 3      | 3      | 3      | 4      |\n| Male         | 4      | 5      | 4      | 4      |\n| Aged < 30    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Aged 30-50   | -      | -      | -      | 1      |\n| Aged > 50    | 7      | 8      | 7      | 7      |\n\n- 1) Members appointed by the employees (6) are not included.\n\n## Group Executive Committee\n\n|              | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total number | 11     | 11     | 11     | 11     |\n| Female       | 4      | 4      | 4      | 3      |\n| Male         | 7      | 7      | 7      | 8      |\n| Aged < 30    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Aged 30-50   | 1      | 2      | 2      | 4      |\n| Aged > 50    | 10     | 9      | 9      | 7      |\n\n## Employees\n\n| %          |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Female     |     21 |     21 |     20 |     20 |\n| Male       |     79 |     79 |     80 |     80 |\n| Aged < 30  |     13 |     14 |     14 |     12 |\n| Aged 30-50 |     52 |     52 |     52 |     53 |\n| Aged > 50  |     35 |     34 |     34 |     35 |\n\n## Frontline workers\n\n| %          |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Female     |     13 |     13 |     12 |     11 |\n| Male       |     87 |     87 |     88 |     89 |\n| Aged < 30  |     17 |     18 |     18 |     15 |\n| Aged 30-50 |     49 |     49 |     49 |     51 |\n| Aged > 50  |     34 |     33 |     33 |     34 |\n\n## Office employees\n\n| %          |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Female     |     34 |     33 |     33 |     33 |\n| Male       |     66 |     67 |     67 |     67 |\n| Aged < 30  |      7 |      7 |      7 |      8 |\n| Aged 30-50 |     56 |     57 |     57 |     57 |\n| Aged > 50  |     37 |     36 |     36 |     35 |",

        "page_content": "## Human rights and fair labor conditions\n\nSSAB is a member of the UN Global Compact and supports its principles regarding human rights, labor rights, the environment and anticorruption. SSAB also supports the human rights expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights, the core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. SSAB is committed to implementing processes to prevent, identify and address any negative impact on human rights that the business may cause or contribute to.\n\n## Human rights in SSAB's Code of Conduct\n\nSSAB's Code of Conduct states that SSAB does not tolerate any form of discrimination and that inclusion and diversity are important issues. SSAB has zero tolerance for harassment and no forms of child labor, forced labor, slave labor or illegal labor, including trafficking and other forms of modern slavery, may occur. To prevent risks concerning human rights, SSAB complies with local legislation and international standards for human rights. In addition to the Code of Conduct, policy documents at Group level provide further guidance in areas such as inclusion and diversity. A large part of the work concerns cooperation with the trade unions and SSAB providing channels for employees to engage and express their opinions. Human rights are an important aspect when SSAB screens suppliers.\n\n## Process for human rights risks\n\nSSAB continuously reviews risks and processes to prevent, identify and address any negative impact on human rights that the business may cause or contribute to.\n\nSSAB has already conducted an assessment of human rights, including measures to limit and prevent risks. During the year, the Group-wide Ethics Council updated the previous risk assessment of human rights.\n\nNo significant risks were identified, but priority areas include health and safety, the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, fair employment and working conditions, and non-discrimination, mainly for employees and employees of suppliers. A further area is the rights of indigenous peoples. During the year, a stakeholder dialog was therefore conducted with a S\u00e1mi village affected by SSAB's transformation in Lule\u00e5, with the aim of increasing knowledge about the land area in question and reindeer husbandry.\n\nIn 2024, further stakeholder dialogs are planned to discuss priority areas and the work to establish action plans continues.\n\n## Business ethics and anti-corruption\n\nSSAB operates in markets with different cultures, values and traditions. SSAB has zero tolerance of bribery and corruption and has a high level of ambition in the area of business ethics. Work on business ethics and anti-corruption primarily involves SSAB's own employees, but indirectly also customers and business partners. SSAB's suppliers are also covered by a Code of Conduct for suppliers.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nSSAB's work within responsible business is based on the Code of Conduct. It is SSAB's ethical compass that sets out how employees are expected to behave vis \u00e0 vis stakeholders and in the market by translating SSAB's values into actions. The Code of Conduct covers areas such as health and safety, the environment, human rights and business ethics and forms the basis for SSAB's commitments in these areas. The Code of Conduct is supplemented by a guide to clarify SSAB's principles of business ethics. The Code of Conduct and the related guide are available on SSAB's website and the intranet.\n\n## Governance and responsibilities\n\nThe Code of Conduct was adopted by the Board of Directors and updated in 2022. In addition to this, SSAB's Group Executive Committee has adopted instructions on anti-corruption work and business ethics reviews of partners representing SSAB in areas with a high risk of corruption and on the Ethics Line whistleblower system and internal reporting channels.\n\nAt Group level, the Ethics & Compliance function is responsible for the strategic work and the implementation of new legislation concerning business ethics and anti-corruption. Responsibility for compliance with the instructions rests with the line organization. Coordination takes place within a Group-wide Ethics Council. During the year, an internal Council for Responsible Business was also established, which comprises the CEO, General Counsel, Head of Sustainability, heads of divisions and the Head of Ethics & Compliance.\n\n## Reporting and whistleblowing channels\n\nSSAB encourages employees to report any violations of laws or the Code of Conduct. The Code states that no person who reports irregularities on reasonable grounds may be subjected to reprisals or harassment. Reports can be submitted to individuals such as the line manager or an HR representative. These cases are followed up regularly within the line organization. Employees within the EU can also report via local reporting channels for whistleblowing, established in accordance with\n\n## SSAB Ethics Line\n\nSSAB's global whistleblowing system, Ethics Line, is available in almost all countries where SSAB operates. Reports can be made in 13 languages. Ethics Line allows anonymous reporting 24/7 either online or by telephone. Employees who do not have access to the Ethics Line have other reporting channels.",

        "page_content": "the implementation of EU Directive 2019/1937. Information about reporting channels is available on SSAB's intranet and external website. The persons who are authorized to receive and investigate reports from the reporting channels will receive internal training.\n\nReporting can also take place through SSAB's global whistleblowing system, the Ethics Line. Ethics Line reports are managed by a steering group for case management. The steering group consists of SSAB's Head of Internal Audit, Head of Ethics & Compliance and Head of HR Compliance. The Head of Internal Audit informs SSAB's Audit Committee quarterly of all Ethics Line reports, including summaries of ongoing investigations, without disclosing personal data.\n\nIn 2023, 39 (17) incidents were reported via the Ethics Line and following investigation, action was taken in 14 cases: 7 related to discrimination and harassment, 4 to compliance with rules, 1 to the Code of Conduct, 1 to corruption and 1 related to conflict of interest. 3 cases are still under investigation and 22 cases were not considered to be within the scope of whistleblowing cases and the persons reporting were referred to other reporting channels. None of the discrimination cases reported during the year concerned gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion or belief, disability, but concerned other forms of alleged discrimination or harassment. No reports of human rights violations were received. Nor were any sanctions or damages imposed for cases reported to the Ethics Line. The reason for the increase in the number of reported incidents during the year may be attributed to SSAB's launch of a new platform for the Ethics Line earlier in the year that facilitates\n\nreporting and to the updating of the Code of Conduct.\n\n## Anti-corruption work\n\nSSAB works to prevent and detect corruption through anti-corruption directives and instructions with associated training and a handbook on business ethics, which is available on the intranet. The policy documents contain information on how SSAB defines bribery and improper benefits and how employees are expected to act in their contacts with suppliers, customers and other business partners. SSAB also has an instruction for business ethics review, which primarily covers agents and distributors in areas of high-risk for corruption. The instruction means that SSAB may not enter into agreements with business partners representing SSAB until an initial assessment shows that they respect SSAB's business ethics rules.\n\nAudits of risks of fraud and corruption are also included in audit reviews of subsidiaries. Whereas the audits have not revealed any concrete irregularities, they have identified opportunities to reduce risks. These opportunities for improvement are addressed in accordance with the action plans that have been developed. SSAB also encourages employees and external stakeholders to report any corruption incidents through the reporting channels.\n\n## Anti-corruption clause in agreements\n\nSSAB includes anti-corruption clauses in agreements with business partners, and SSAB's Code of Conduct for Suppliers clarifies that all forms of corruption and bribery are unacceptable\n\nand that suppliers should work to prevent it. The majority (116 out of 133) raw material contracts in the Nordic business during 2018-2023 refer to the Supplier Code of Conduct. Contracts with companies within the Hardox Wearparts network include anti-corruption clauses as well as reference to SSAB's Code of Conduct and governing documents for anti-corruption (412 contracts in 2017-2023).\n\n## Training & tools\n\nSSAB's training module on the Code of Conduct, which also includes anti-corruption work and information on how to report non-compliance, is mandatory for all employees. The module is available in ten languages and employees must complete the module every three years. Completion of the training for new employees is one of SSAB's targets within business ethics.\n\nSSAB conducts regular training in business ethics, aimed primarily at managers and employees in sales and purchasing, who are at greater risk of being exposed to corruption in their daily work. SSAB also provides internal training in competition law and anti-corruption.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nDuring the year, SSAB launched a new internal training module on the Code of Conduct (see above). In addition, internal training was conducted regarding the review of business partners representing SSAB and corruption risks, as well as on human rights.\n\nSSAB also continued efforts to establish new internal channels within the EU for reporting misconduct where cases are handled by locally appointed persons. During the year, a new\n\nplatform for the whistleblower system, the Ethics Line, was launched to facilitate an effective dialog between persons submitting reports and internal investigators. The system was also opened up to external stakeholders.\n\n## Targets and outcomes\n\nAt the end of 2023, 76% (89%) of all new employees had begun the onboarding process, which includes completing the Code of Conduct training module. See Definitions for more information. From 2023 onwards, the target only applies to new employees. All members of the Group Executive Committee have already completed the training in business ethics. 96% (90%) of SSAB employees have access to the Ethics Line. At the end of the year, 94% (96%) of the target group had completed the competition law training module and 90% (80%) the module in anti-corruption, which is aimed primarily at employees in sales and purchasing, who are exposed to a greater risk of exposure to corruption in their daily work.

        "page_content": "## Responsible sourcing\n\nIt is important that SSAB's suppliers act responsibly, and that they comply with SSAB's sustainability guidelines. By placing demands on suppliers and following up on their work, SSAB can contribute to positive development when it comes to sustainability in the value chain.\n\nSSAB's purchases take place primarily from Sweden, Finland and other European countries (60% of purchases is attributable to Europe), but also from the US (33%). Only a small proportion come from other countries, primarily Australia. In 2023, SSAB purchased products, materials and services to a value of approximately SEK 76 (85) billion. Scrap is the largest purchasing category, followed by iron ore, and coal and coke. These three categories accounted for approximately 33% of the Group's total costs.\n\nWork on sustainability in the supply chain includes both SSAB's direct suppliers and, to an increased extent, their subcontractors, in some cases at multiple levels. It also includes SSAB's employees with sourcing responsibility, in the form of training modules and instructions.\n\nIn SSAB's supply chain, there may be a risk above all of adverse environmental impacts, such as soil, air and water pollution, adverse impacts on biodiversity as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Health and safety and human rights are also important issues.\n\n## Responsibilities and governance\n\nSSAB's Supplier Code of Conduct is adopted by the Group Executive Committee and is available on SSAB's website. The Supplier Code of Conduct is an integral part of SSAB's way of doing business and forms the basis for environmental and social requirements. To support employees with sourcing responsibility, there are also instructions on sustainability work and procedures for follow-up on sustainability at suppliers. At Group level, the sustainability function within the Sourcing Department is responsible for strategic work and coordination through, for example, regular meetings for those responsible for sourcing within the Group. Responsibility for compliance with the instructions rests with the line organization. Targets and outcomes are followed up regularly. The sustainability function within the Sourcing department is also responsible for the Group's Scope 3 calculation.\n\n## Target and outcome: Responsible sourcing (GRI 414-1)\n\n|                                                                | Target 2023   | Target 2025   | Target 2030   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share of new suppliers that  are sustainability risk  assessed | 100 %         | 100 %         | 100 %         | 88 %   | 91 %   | 88 %   |\n| Share of total spend  sustainability-assessed                  | 95 %          | 96 %          | 98 %          | 20 %   | 97 %   | 96 %   |\n| Number of audits/evaluations                                   | 40            | 100           | 100           | 111    | 80     | 24     |\n\n## Identification and assessment of supplier risks\n\n## No conflict minerals\n\nSSAB risk-assesses suppliers based on factors such as risks to the environment, working conditions, human rights and corruption. Assessment is made with the help of an external tool. Each supplier has a risk profile based on country and industry risk. Suppliers assessed as moderate or high risk must answer additional questions regarding corporate governance, social conditions and environmental work, and SSAB takes any necessary action based on this.\n\n## Risk assessments and audits\n\nThe annual audit plan defines at which suppliers risk assessment or third-party audits are to be conducted. The selection is based, among other things, on the supplier's sustainability work (including health and safety).\n\n## Actions against modern slavery\n\nSSAB supports and respects internationally established human rights and has taken several measures to prevent child labor, forced labor, slavery and human trafficking from occurring in the supply chain. These measures include updating SSAB's Supplier Code of Conduct, risk assessments and audits, and training of SSAB employees.\n\nSSAB does not use so-called conflict minerals (gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum), and on request will provide customers with a certificate confirming this. Regarding expanded conflict minerals (cobalt and mica), cobalt is not used in end products from SSAB's steelmaking. Mica may be present in steel color coatings. SSAB is currently investigating the presence of mica together with the paint suppliers.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\n- \u00b7 A new Supplier Code of Conduct was launched at the beginning of the year to better reflect SSAB's own Code of Conduct, stricter customer requirements for sustainability in the supply chain, and new EU directives.\n- \u00b7 SSAB completed the implementation of a new supplier assessment tool that will facilitate risk assessment, allowing it to focus on specific areas, such as human rights.\n- \u00b7 The process of setting a target for other indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 3) was initiated in connection with the update of the Group's targets for Scope 1 and 2. In connection with this, SSAB commissioned a new, more comprehensive scope 3 calculation for 2018 and 2022 (see Definitions for more information). Scope 3 emissions are reported in the Climate section.\n- \u00b7 Introduction of the possibility for external stakeholders, such as employees of suppliers, to report violations of SSAB's Code of Conduct.\n- \u00b7 Work to reduce CO2 emissions from transports.",

        "page_content": "## Targets and outcomes\n\nDuring the year, 88% (91%)  of SSAB's new suppliers were assessed from the sustainability risk aspect and 20% (97%) of medium and highrisk suppliers were assessed from the sustainability aspect. The lower figures for the year are due to the introduction of the new supplier assessment tool. As a result, more suppliers than earlier were classified as medium or high risk, and the risk assessment was reset. SSAB intends to evaluate a large percentage of its suppliers based on total spend in 2024.\n\nDuring the year, 111 (80) risk assessments and sustainability audits were conducted. Deviations from SSAB's expectations of suppliers were noted in two cases. One vendor has remedied the discrepancies. In the second case, SSAB chose to terminate the cooperation. In other audits, SSAB highlighted several areas for improvement, such as how suppliers can work with sustainability at their subcontractors and how they can set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Fossil-free transport\n\nIn 2021, SSAB joined the First Movers Coalition, an initiative to create demand for low-carbon technology in the market. SSAB has committed to 30% of purchased transport services being fossil-free by 2030. In 2023, SSAB reduced direct truck transports by partially switching to rail transport for transports to the Baltic States and Poland. SSAB has also started work on a so-called green transport corridor from SSAB in Borl\u00e4nge, via Gothenburg, to Ghent, Belgium.\n\n## SSAB's climate policy engagement\n\nSSAB's collaboration with political decisionmakers, on a global, European and national level, aims to inform about opportunities and challenges associated with the decarbonization of the steel industry. Climate policy, energy policy and industrial policy are areas of specific interest for SSAB, as well as issues related to public funding and efficient permit processes.\n\nSSAB is pursuing the following issues, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate policy: SSAB supports the European Green Deal and Climate Law, including the target of a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030. For the upcoming EU 2040 target, SSAB calls for an ambitious target of at least a 90% net reduction compared to 1990 levels, and that the EU should strive to become climate neutral by 2040.\n- \u00b7 Energy policy: Transformation of the industry depends on access to fossil-free energy inputs, especially electrification. Accelerating the expansion of fossil-free electricity production, allocation of electricity capacity and access to transmission grids are important issues for SSAB.\n- \u00b7 EU, ETS and CBAM: SSAB supports the EU's policy priorities on access to finance, a level playing field, a robust clean-tech demand policy and investment in innovation. Effective implementation of the revised EU ETS (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, CBAM), which SSAB supports, will be important.\n- \u00b7 Public funding: SSAB advocates caution regarding state aid, which can easily distort the\n\nEU's internal market and increase the cost of the technology needed for the transformation. If used, subsidies should focus on research and development and the scaling up of new technologies, not on subsidizing already commercially available technologies.\n\nSSAB's climate policy engagement is adopted by the CEO and is based on the corporate strategy, the Code of Conduct and SSAB's support for the goals in the Paris Agreement. For lobbying activities in the EU, SSAB is registered in the EU Transparency Register, registration number 835967332819-32.\n\nDuring 2023, an assessment was made whether those industry organizations and member organizations of which SSAB is a member represent climate-related positions that SSAB stands behind and/or are in line with the goals in the Paris Agreement. The assessment shows that all member organizations meet SSAB's expectations.\n\n## Membership of organizations and advocacy organizations\n\n| Globally      | Leadership Group for Industry  Transition (LeadIT), Energy  Transitions Commission (ETC),  First Movers Coalition                |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe        | Eurofer, Corporate Leadership  Group (CLG), indirectly via Hybrit  Development AB                                                |\n| Sweden        | Jernkontoret, Confederation of  Swedish Enterprise, SKGS-  Skogen, Kemin, Gruvorna och  St\u00e5let, Fossil Free Sweden,              |\n| Finland       | Finnish Metal Producers, Large  Finnish Electricity Consumers,  Federation of Finnish Technology  Industries                     |\n| North America | American Iron and Steel Institute  (AISI), National Association of  Manufacturers (NAM), Steel  Manufacturers Association  (SMA) |",

Method         | In 2023, SSAB commissioned an external party to  conduct a full calculation of Scope 3 in conjunction with  the process to update the climate target. The  calculations were made for the base year 2018 and  2022 only. The new calculation differs from the previous  report mainly due to the updating of the methodology in  line with guidelines in the Science Based Targets  initiative Steel sector guidance; different emission  factors and increased data coverage (unlike earlier, the  subsidiaries Tibnor and Ruukki Construction are  included in the new calculation).

ID no. 556016-3429\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe have been engaged by the Board of SSAB AB (publ) to undertake a limited assurance engagement of SSAB AB (publ)'s Sustainability Report for the year 2023. The scope of the Sustainability Report has been defined on pages 65-67. The Statutory Sustainability Report is defined on page 103.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board and Executive Management\n\nThe Board of Directors and Executive Management are responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report including the Statutory Sustainability Report in accordance with applicable criteria and the Annual Accounts Act respectively. The criteria are defined on page 33 in the Sustainability Report and are part of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines published by GRI (The Global Reporting Initiative) that are applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation principles that the Company has developed. This responsibility includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibilities of the auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on our limited assurance procedures and to express an opinion regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report. Our engagement is limited to historical information presented in this document and does therefore not include future oriented information.\n\nWe have conducted our engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information . A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. Our examination regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report has been conducted in accordance with FAR's accounting standard RevR 12 The auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report . A limited assurance engagement and an examination according to RevR 12 are different from and substantially less in scope than reasonable assurance conducted in accordance with IAASB's Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.\n\nThe firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires that we design, implement and operate a system of quality management including polices or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are independent of SSAB AB (publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited review and an examination according to RevR 12 do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. The conclusion based on limited assurance procedures and an examination according to RevR 12 does not provide the same level of assurance as a conclusion based on reasonable assurance.\n\nOur procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the Executive Management as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBased on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Management.\n\nA Statutory Sustainability Report has been prepared.\n\nStockholm, March 5, 2024\n\nErnst & Young AB\n\nRickard Andersson        Outi Alestalo\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant\n\nExpert member of FAR",

The Board of Directors had decided that shareholders could exercise their voting rights also by postal voting in accordance with the provisions of SSAB's Articles of Association.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting adopted the annual report and consolidated financial statements for 2022 released by the Board of Directors and the CEO, decided on the allocation of the company's profit and granted the directors and CEO discharge from liability. The general meeting decided on the remuneration to the Board and the auditors in accordance with the Nomination Committee's proposals. It was further resolved that the Board will comprise seven directors and accordingly Petra Einarsson, Lennart Evrell (who was elected Chairman of the Board), Bernard Fontana, Marie Gr\u00f6nborg, Martin Lindqvist (President and CEO), Mikael M\u00e4kinen and Maija Strandberg were re-elected as Boar d members. Bo Annvik had declined re-election to the Board.\n\nUpon proposal by the Nomination Committee, it was decided that the number of auditors should be one registered auditing company and Ernst & Young AB was re-elected as auditors for one year until the Annual General Meeting 2024.\n\nThe Board of Directors' proposal for the allocation of the company's earnings was presented to the Annual General Meeting.

The changes compared with the previous version mainly relate to how any conflicts of interest in the Nomination Committee are to be handled, and how the Nomination Committee is to act when a shareholder who has appointed a member has sold parts of his holding of SSAB shares and no longer constitutes one of the major shareholders.\n\nThere may be no more than six members in total. The member representing the largest shareholder in terms of votes shall be Chairman of the Nomination Committee. The composition of the Nomination Committee was announced on www.ssab.com on September 27, 2023.\n\nShareholders were able to submit proposals to the Nomination Committee by, until December 31, 2023. The Nomination Committee's proposals will be published no later than in conjunction with the notice of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn connection with the issuance of the notice of the Annual General Meeting, the Nomination Committee will publish a reasoned statement regarding its proposal for a Board on www.ssab.com.\n\n## Nomination Committee's diversity policy\n\nSSAB works actively to advance diversity within the company. As a part of this work, the company, through the Nomination Committee, applies rule 4.1 in the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Corporate Code) as its diversity policy. In accordance with rule 4.1 in the Corporate Code, the Board is to have a composition appropriate to the company's operations, phase of development and other relevant circumstances. The Board members elected by the shareholders' meeting are collectively to exhibit diversity and breadth of qualifications, experience and background. The company is also to strive for gender balance on the Board.\n\nThe Nomination Committee shall consider the diversity policy when preparing its proposals for",

In addition, the Board of Directors continuously discusses diversity within the organization. The objective of the diversity policy is to cater to the importance of sufficient diversity within the Board in order to encourage independent opinions and a critical approach which will contribute to efficient Board work in the company.\n\nDuring the financial year 2023, the Nomination Committee's diversity policy has been considered in connection with the Nomination Committee's work ahead of the 2023 Annual General Meeting and the 2024 Annual General Meeting. This has resulted in a diversified and appropriate Board composition with Board members that possess the qualifications and experience in for the Board important areas, such as sustainability and environment.\n\n## Work of the Nomination Committee ahead of the 2024 Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Nomination Committee was appointed in September 2023 and has convened 5 times during the fall. Additional meetings are planned during the first quarter of 2024 before the Annual General Meeting. At a meeting in October, the Nomination Committee took part in the Board's evaluation process and the outcome of the evaluation that took place during the fall as a whole.\n\nThe Nomination Committee has discussed the composition of the Board, and agreed on the fundamental Board member requirements, including the requirements on independent members. The Nomination Committee particularly took into account in its Board proposal the need for diversity and breadth, the\n\nrequirements to strive for gender balance on the Board, and also taken into account qualifications and experience in areas important to the company.\n\nThe Nomination Committee engages in continuous work in identifying and evaluating potential new directors. In submitting proposals for fees to the Board of Directors and its committees, the Nomination Committee, among other things, conducted an overview of Board fees in similar companies. Prior to the election of an auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2024, the Audit Committee has conducted an evaluation of the audit performance presented to the Nomination Committee at its December meeting. At the same meeting, the committee's recommendation regarding both election of auditors and fees was presented. The Nomination Committee followed the Audit Committee's recommendation when presenting its proposals to the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Nomination committee ahead of the 2024\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\n| Name, appointed by                                           | Share (%) of voting capital as at  December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Stefan Lor\u00e9hn, LKAB  (Chairman of the  Nomination Committee) | 16.0                                                   |\n| Kimmo Viertola, the  Government of Finland                   | 8.0                                                    |\n| Emilie Westholm, Folksam                                     | 5.6                                                    |\n| Lennart Evrell (Chairman of  the Board of Directors)         | -                                                      |\n\n## Board of directors\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board\n\nThe overall task of the Board of Directors is to manage the company's affairs in the best interests of both the company and its shareholders. The Board must regularly assess the Group's financial position and evaluate the operative management. The Board decides, among other things, on matters concerning the Group's strategic focus and organization, and decides on material capital expenditure (exceeding SEK 100 million). The Board is also ultimately responsible for the Group's sustainability work.\n\nWhen applicable, the Board prepares proposals for guidelines regarding the determination of salary and other remunerations to the CEO and other members of the company's senior management for decision at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Rules of procedure of the Board\n\nEach year, the Board adopts the rules of procedure, including instructions to the CEO, which, among other things, govern the allocation of work between the Board and the CEO.\n\nThe rules of procedure further regulate the frequency of Board meetings and the allocation of work among the Board's committees. The rules of procedure state that there must be a Remuneration Committee and an Audit Committee. Ahead of each Board meeting, the directors receive a written agenda and full documentation to serve as the basis for decisions. Each Board meeting conducts a review of the Group's accident statistics, the current state of the business, the Group's results,\n\nfinancial position and follow-up and revision of the Group's sustainability objectives. Other issues addressed include competition and the market situation.\n\n## Chair of the Board\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors presides over the Board's work, represents the company on ownership issues and is responsible for the evaluation of the work of the Board. In addition, the Chair of the Board is responsible for regular contact with the CEO and for ensuring that the Board performs its duties.\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nUnder the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors consists of a minimum of five and a maximum of ten members elected by the general meeting. The Board is quorate when more than half of the total number of directors is present. Taking into consideration the company's operations, phase of development and circumstances in general, the Board must have an appropriate composition which is characterized by diversity and breadth as regards the competence, experience and background of its members. New directors undergo an introduction course to rapidly acquire the knowledge expected in order to best promote the interests of the company and its shareholders.\n\n## Work of the Board in 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors held 12 meetings at which minutes were taken and at which the Board was quorate at all times. SSAB's General Counsel, who is not a director, served as secretary to the Board.",

The first half of 2023 was marked by a relatively sustained demand and high price levels for the Company's heavy plates products in North America. In Europe, the economic cycle slowed in the later part of the first half of 2023 and got worse during the second half. Actions were initiated in order to meet the weaker market by adjust production, costs and staffing. The actions included for example temporary and permanent lay-offs.\n\nHeavy plate demand and prices in North America remained at a relatively high level during the year. The global demand for high-strength steel products were good with relatively stable prices during the year, however the European market weakened during the second half of the year.\n\nSafety work has top priority in the Group and at every meeting the Board keeps close track of lost time injury frequency and the corrective actions implemented by the company. The Board also follows the company's sustainability performance with regular follow-ups of achievements of targets and continuously follows the company's most important operative, as well as strategic key figures. The Board has spent considerable time on questions related to the transformation to fossil free steel production and has during the year visited SSAB's sites in Oxel\u00f6sund, Virsbo and Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden and Montpelier, USA.\n\nThe Board has also during the year, based on the authorization granted by the General Meeting held on the April 18, 2023, resolved to implement a buy-back program of own shares for a total maximum amount of SEK 2,5 billion.\n\nThis year's Board evaluation took place in connection with a board meeting in October, at which the Chairman's performance and the work of the Board's committees was evaluated. The evaluation was administered by SSAB's General Counsel. An extensive questionnaire was answered by each Board member individually, after which the answers were compiled by SSAB's General Counsel and anonymously presented to the Board ahead of the subsequent discussion.\n\nThe questionnaire included mainly questions related to the Board's efficiency and collective competence to handle Board responsibilities in relation to important areas for the company such as the heavy processing industry, international marketing and sales, major investment projects, finance, IT and digitalization. The evaluation also included questions regarding the Board's efficiency and knowledge regarding the company's impact on different sustainability areas. No direct measures were deemed necessary as a result of the evaluation, but identified focus areas are under continuous follow-up.",

Fraud, loss/misappropriation of assets and deficiencies in business ethics are further risks assessed and managed, to, by reasonable means, ensure sound internal control of financial reporting. SSAB's operation are characterized by processes involving well-established procedures and systems.\n\nOverall risk assessments at the Group level constitute an integrated part of the ongoing reporting to the Group Executive Committee and the Board of Directors, and it constitutes the basis of the assessment of risks for errors in financial reporting. Financial risks, such as exchange risks, refinancing risks, counterparty risks, interest risks and credit risks are mainly managed by the parent company's treasury function, in accordance with the Group's Finance Policy (see notes D.2 and D.3).\n\n## Control activities\n\nThe primary purpose of control activities is to prevent and identify at an early stage significant financial reporting errors so that they can be addressed and rectified. Control activities, both manual and automated, take place both at general and more detailed levels within the Group. Routines and activities have been designed to manage and mitigate significant risks associated with financial reporting as identified in the risk analysis. Corrective measures, implementation, documentation and quality assurance take place at Group, subsidiary or process level, depending on the nature and affiliation of the control activity. As with other processes, the relevant head is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of control activities.\n\nThere is a more systematic approach to identifying financial risks and financial reporting risks, as well as documentation of controls as to how such risks are to be prevented and identified. The controls are adapted to each unit's work processes and systems structure, and these are evaluated through self-assessment supplemented with monitoring and review by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninternal audit. This way of working has been implemented in a system covering the entire Group which is used when verifying the reliability of financial reporting.\n\nControl activities are carried out at all levels across the Group. For example, there are in every division Controller functions which analyze and follow up deviations and forward reports in the company. Monitoring by the Group Executive Committee takes place, among other things, through regular meetings with heads of divisions and subsidiaries with regard to operations, their financial position and results, as well as financial and operational key performance indicators. The Board of Directors analyzes, on an ongoing basis,\n\namong other things, business reports in which the Group Executive Committee describes the most recent period and comments on the Group's financial position and results. This is how major fluctuations and deviations are followed up to minimize the risk of errors in financial reporting.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nSSAB has well-established information and communication procedures to support the completeness and accuracy of the financial reporting.

The performance criteria for the CEO's STI consist of 100% Group objectives.\n\nThere are three Group objectives that are measured against predetermined threshold levels; 1) EBITDA margin compared to peer group 1) , 2) Operating cash flow in relation to adjusted operating result before depreciation and amortization, and 3) A sustainability objective measuring the accident frequency with lost time which lead to absence of more than one day (LTIF).\n\nThe STI objectives have been designed to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by being clearly linked to the business strategy and increased value creation for the company.\n\nA prerequisite for STI payment is that the Group shows a positive adjusted operating result (excluding items affecting comparability). This threshold was reached for 2023 and the STI outcome is distributed as follows. 1) SSAB's EBITDA margin exceeded the peer group's average EBITDA margin by 10.0 percentage points, which provides maximum payout. 2) The Operating cash flow in relation to adjusted operating result objective reached 107%, which provides maximum payout. 3) The accident frequency (LTIF) was measured at 0.87, and provides a maximum payout as well.\n\nFor further details on the STI remuneration for the CEO, see table 2(a).\n\n## LTI Remuneration for the CEO 2023\n\nThe LTI program is cash-based and has been measured over a period of three years (20212023).

Distributor inventory levels remained low.\n\nIn Europe, market demand was relatively weak during 2023. Higher inflation and higher interest rates had a negative impact especially on the Construction segment. The inventory levels were assessed to be normal or somewhat low at the end of 2023.\n\nGlobal demand for high-strength steel slowed somewhat down during the second half of 2023, especially in Europe.\n\nIn North America, the price for heavy plate decreased from the high level of 2022. In Europe, market prices for strip increased during the first quarter of 2023 before coming back down again. There was some upturn in prices at the end of the year. European heavy plate prices were on a negative trend during the year. Market prices for similar products in China showed the same trend as in Europe.",

Coking coal is sources from Australia, the USA and Canada, usually on annual supply contracts with monthly prices. SSAB's mills in the USA use recycled steel material and source scrap metal on the spot market. The lead times and payments terms for iron ore have a combined effect, which impacts the result around one quarter later than the change in market price, while coking coal has a lead time of around one and a half quarters. Scrap purchase prices have a lead time of around one month.

The plan is to build electric arc furnaces and cost efficient steel mills, so-called mini-mills, in both Lule\u00e5 and in Raahe, which can use a mix of sponge iron and recycled steel. In 2023, SSAB's Board of Directors made an investment decision for the conversion of Oxel\u00f6sund. The construction of the new electric arc furnace started at the end of 2023. The plan is to start fossil-free steelmaking in Oxel\u00f6sund, based on recycled scrap and sponge iron by the end of 2026.\n\nThere is a strong demand for steel without carbon dioxide footprint and SSAB has entered into several partnerships with major customers during the year. Among other things, SSAB signed letters of intent with Vattenfall, Sandvik and Scania regarding future deliveries of fossil-free steel. At the end of 2023, the world's first building in Sweden using fossil-free steel was inaugurated, through a collaboration between Peab and SSAB, together with Ruukki Construction and the property company Wihlborgs.\n\nIn the beginning of 2023, SSAB launched a completely new scrap-based steel, SSAB Zero, with 0.0 kg emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents per kg of steel - the world's first commercial product of its kind. In 2023, sales amounted to more than 50,000 tonnes. Beside Europe, interest also increased strongly in the USA. During 2023, SSAB extended the partnership with GE Vernova Onshore Wind to supply SSAB Zero steel for onshore wing towers in North America. GE Vernova will be able to manufacture onshore wind towers with the lowest carbon footprint within the onshore wind industry.",

The figures for 2022 include the goodwill impairment of SEK 33,291 million.\n\n## Equity\n\nWith result of SEK 13,029 (-10,886) million and other comprehensive income (mostly consisting of translation differences) of SEK -1,977 (9,898) million attributable to the owners of the parent company, the shareholder's equity attributable to the owners of the parent company amounted to SEK 67,872 (67,124) million, corresponding to SEK 65.91 (65.18) per share.\n\n## Share buyback program\n\nThe 2023 Annual General Meeting gave the Board of Directors an authorization to decide on the purchase of own Class A and/or Class B shares from Nasdaq Stockholm and/or Nasdaq Helsinki on one or more occasions before the next Annual General Meeting in 2024.\n\nIn October, 2023, SSAB's Board of Directors resolved to implement a share buyback program for a total maximum amount of SEK 2.5 billion. The purpose of the share buyback program is to adjust the company's capital structure to create greater value for its shareholders. The Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2024 that it resolves to reduce the share capital by cancellation of the shares acquired by the company.\n\nThe allocation between the share classes A and B reflect the current trading volume of the two share classes, entailing that 25% (i.e. up to SEK 625 million) is allocated to the purchase of Class A shares and 75% (i.e. up to SEK 1,875 million) to the purchase of Class B shares. Purchases commenced on October 26, 2023 and will end between February 2 and March 11, 2024. The total number of treasury shares held by SSAB will not at any time exceed 10% of the total number of shares.\n\nOn December 31, 2023 SSAB held 18,276,773 (-) treasury shares, of which 4,489,777 (-) were Class A shares and 13,786,996 (-) Class B shares. The value of treasure shares amounted to SEK 1,347 (-) million. Transaction costs related to the share buyback program amounted to SEK 1 million in 2023.\n\n## Assets with indefinite useful life\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually at the end of the fourth quarter or if there is an indication of a decline in value. The impairment test for 2023 did not result in any impairment. In 2022, an impairment of SEK 33,291 million was recognized primarily related to the acquisitions of Ipsco and Rautaruukki and reported as an item affecting comparability.\n\n## Assets with an indefinite useful life per cash-generating unit\n\n| SEK millions                                 |   Dec 31 2023 |   Dec 31 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Tibnor                                       |            31 |            31 |\n| Ruukki Construction                          |           318 |           318 |\n| Total goodwill                               |           349 |           349 |\n| Ruukki Construction (Rautaruukki trade name) |           439 |           440 |\n| Total assets with an indefinite useful life  |           787 |           789 |\n\n## Dividend and allocation of profit\n\nA dividend of SEK 5.00 (8.70) per share is proposed for the financial year of 2023. Consideration relating to proposed allocation of profit in note D.7 and Proposed allocation of profit on page 179 are part of the Board of Directors' Report.\n\n## Business segments\n\nSSAB is organized into five reportable business segments with a clear profit responsibility. The business segments consist of the three divisions: SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe and SSAB Americas as well as the fully owned subsidiaries Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. Tibnor and Ruukki Construction are operated as independent subsidiaries by their respective Boards.\n\nThe business segment information is presented excluding items affecting comparability. As of January 1, 2023 the business segments' adjusted operating result includes depreciation/amortization on surplus values on tangible and intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Ipsco and Rautaruukki. Comparative information has been updated accordingly. For more information about business segments, see the Strategy report section Business segments and note B.1 in this Annual Report.",

Close collaboration with strategic customers and customer segments provide conditions for a market-driven product development that creates increased value also for end-customers. This is particularly evident for SSAB's high-strength steels, where also technical customer support is an important part of research and development. Continuous work is also carried out in the process development for increased cost efficiency, sustainable processes and energy conservation. During the year, research and development investments amounted to SEK 387 (360) million.\n\n## Environment\n\nSteel production is an energy intensive process affecting the environment through carbon dioxide emissions among other impacts. SSAB's blast furnaces are among the most carbon dioxide efficient in the world, but in Sweden and Finland, SSAB's blast furnaces are still among the country's largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions. The impact on the local environment in the vicinity of SSAB's plants has decreased significantly in recent decades. Technical development and increasingly stringent external demands dictate constant improvements in the operations.\n\nThe most important environmental aspects for SSAB are:\n\n- \u00b7 Air emissions reductions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particulate matter\n- \u00b7 Water effluent reductions of nitrogen and suspended substances\n- \u00b7 Efficient use of raw materials and energy\n- \u00b7 Landfill waste minimization\n\nSSAB's operations are subject to environmental permits with hundreds of environmental conditions governing among other things production levels, emissions into the air and water, noise levels, and rules regarding landfill sites.\n\n## Permitted production at the Swedish plants 1)\n\n| Thousand tonnes         | Location     | Permitted  production   | Production  2023   | Production  2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Coke                    | Lule\u00e5        | 800                     | 647                | 653                |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund    | 530                     | 333                | 356                |\n| Hot metal               | Lule\u00e5 2)     | -                       | 1,989              | 1,896              |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund    | 2,000                   | 929                | 924                |\n| Steel slabs             | Lule\u00e5        | 2,500                   | 1,866              | 1,796              |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund    | 1,900                   | 968                | 983                |\n| Hot-rolled steel        | Borl\u00e4nge     | 3,200                   | 2,047              | 1,951              |\n|                         | Oxel\u00f6sund 3) | 1,000                   | 513                | 559                |\n| Pickled steel           | Borl\u00e4nge     | 2,500                   | 1,319              | 1,197              |\n| Cold-rolled steel       | Borl\u00e4nge     | 1,400                   | 700                | 651                |\n| Annealed steel          | Borl\u00e4nge     | 900                     | 603                | 556                |\n| Organic-coated products | K\u00f6ping       | 30                      | 20                 | 21                 |\n|                         | Finsp\u00e5ng 4)  | 40                      | 22                 | 28                 |\n| Steel tubes             | Virsbo       | 125                     | 11                 | 17                 |\n\n- 1) In North America, the permitted production levels are determined through maximum permitted hourly production volumes and not applicable for Finnish sites.\n- 2) Not regulated.\n- 3) Delivery of plate.\n- 4) Unit million m\u00b2.\n\n## Sustainability report\n\nIn accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, Chapter 6, Section 11, SSAB AB has chosen to establish the statutory sustainability report as a separate report, see p. 29-67.

Many of the factors are beyond SSAB's control. Prudent risk management supports the achievement of SSAB's strategic objectives and targets and ensures business continuity.\n\n## Risk governance and management process\n\nResponsibility for the long-term, overall management of strategic risks is governed by the company's delegation policy, from the Board of Directors to the CEO and from the CEO to the heads of each division and subsidiary. The divisions and subsidiaries are primarily responsible for managing the operational risks in the Group.\n\nSSAB's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is integrated into the annual strategy process and is managed by the Chief Financial Officer. The purpose of the process is to achieve SSAB's strategic objectives and targets, as well as to ensure business continuity, even in the event of fluctuations on the global steel market. The process includes an annual risk assessment conducted by the divisional and subsidiary managers as part of their strategy process. The result of the Group risk assessment is reported to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors.\n\nSSAB's insurance function is tasked with procuring Group-wide protection for insurable risks. The Group's treasury function manages financial risks centrally. SSAB's internal control function supports the divisions in identifying risk areas and establishing control processes to mitigate identified risk areas. SSAB's internal audit function conducts audits of SSAB's operations, including internal controls and processes, and recommends improvements. For more information about the Group's internal audit function, see the Corporate Governance Report.\n\nFinancial and/or reputational impact from sustainability factors are integrated in the ERM-process and assessed by all divisions. During 2023, SSAB started up the process of integrating the assessment of sustainability impact risks (risk for negative impact on environment and people) in the divisional ERMprocess.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nThe risk level of any risk is calculated based on the estimated impact (financial/reputational impact) and likelihood (probability of occurrence).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Borrowing takes place primarily through the parent company, taking into  consideration the Group's financial targets. For mitigating liquidity and refinancing risks,  SSAB has sufficient cash balance and committed credit lines in place. The refinancing risk is  minimized by diversifying funding sources with the objective that long-term loans will have an  even maturity and an average term to maturity in excess of three years.

Currency risks: SSAB's currency exposure, related to translation exposure, largely relates to  the translation risk regarding net assets of foreign subsidiaries. This exposure is partly  hedged through borrowing in foreign currency. The objective is to minimize the foreign  exchange impact on the net debt/equity ratio. As a consequence of the strong cash flow and  resulting positive net cash position, no net gearing hedges are currently in place, but in the  case of a change in net debt position, the hedges will be reinstalled according to financial  instructions.

The guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the annual general meeting 2022. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.\n\n## The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\n\nSSAB's business strategy aims to establish the company as an industry leader in terms of both profitability and sustainability among comparable companies. SSAB's stated objective is to become the safest steel company in the world to work in, and shall in addition adhere to high environmental standards and be a responsible partner to all stakeholders. A more detailed description of the business strategy can be found on the company's website.\n\nA successful implementation of the business strategy and safeguarding of the company's long-term interests require that the company can recruit and retain qualified employees. For this, the company must be able to offer competitive remuneration in the labor market on which the executives operate. These guidelines are intended to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration, which in turn promotes the company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability.\n\n## Types of remuneration, etc.\n\nThe remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary, variable cash remuneration consisting of a short-term variable component (\"STI\") and a longterm variable component (\"LTI\"), pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally, the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on other remuneration or incentive programs, including share-related or share price-related remuneration.\n\nSTI remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria to be measured over a period of one year. The criteria shall be designed to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests, including sustainability. STI may amount to not more than 75 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary for the CEO and not more than 50 per cent for other senior executives.\n\nLTI remuneration shall be share related or share price related and shall thereby be approved by the general meeting. The objectives of LTI shall be to create a common interest for the company\n\nmanagement and the shareholders to drive the business towards long-term good return on the SSAB shares and to promote the company's ability to recruit and retain key employees.\n\nFor the CEO and other senior executives pension benefits shall be contribution-based except in those cases where so provided in the rules of a general pension plan (e.g. the Swedish ITP2 plan). The retirement age should be set individually, however, in no case earlier than the age of 62. In the event the employment terminates prior to the retirement age, the executive shall receive a paid-up policy for earned pension.\n\nVariable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits, except in those cases where so provided in the rules of a general pension plan. The pension premiums shall amount to not more than 50 per cent of the annual pensionable salary.\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, health insurance, medical insurance and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.\n\nRemuneration under employment subject to other rules than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\n## Termination of employment\n\nUpon termination of an employment, the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed salary for 24 months for the CEO and 18 months for the other senior executives. The period of notice may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive.\n\nFor senior executives outside Sweden, the termination period and severance pay may deviate from the above stated due to legislation or local market practice.",

The financial objectives shall comprise at least 60 per cent of the Group objectives and shall be linked to EBITDA margins in relation to a comparison group of the company's competitors, own EBITDA level or margin, return on capital employed, the company's cash flow or the company's stock turnover. The non-financial Group objectives shall be linked to sustainability.\n\nThe unit objectives may be different for different units. For units with clear profit responsibility, the unit objectives shall to at least 50 per cent consist of financial objectives that shall be linked to sales, volumes, operating profit, operating margins, cost savings, return on capital employed or cash flows. The remaining part of the unit objectives shall consist of operational objectives linked to sustainability and fulfillment of the unit's strategic plan. For other units, the unit objectives shall be designed so that they clearly contribute to the fulfillment of the respective unit's strategy, including sustainability.\n\nFor the CEO, STI shall to at least 85 per cent consist of group objectives and to the remaining part of quantitative or qualitative individual objectives aimed at increased value creation for the company. For senior executives with clear own profit responsibility, STI shall to at least 45 per cent consist of unit objectives and to the remaining part of group objectives. For other senior executives, STI shall to at least 70 per cent of group objectives and to the remaining part of unit objectives.\n\nThe variable cash compensation programs shall be structured such that the Board of Directors has the possibility, should exceptional circumstances prevail, to restrict the payment of variable cash compensations, or to decline to make such payment, where such a measure is deemed reasonable and compatible with the company's responsibilities to its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nTo which extent the objectives for variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated when the measurement period has ended. Following a proposal from the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other senior executives, the Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation in consultation with the CEO. When the Board of Directors assesses how\n\nthe financial objectives have been met, this should be done against the latest published financial information with any adjustments that the Board of Directors considers necessary or appropriate.\n\nBefore the payment of variable cash compensation is effected, the Board of Directors must verify that the objectives linked to the remuneration have been met and that the remuneration has been calculated correctly.\n\n## Salary and employment conditions for employees\n\nIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines, salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income, the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time, in the Board of Directors' and the Remuneration Committee's basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.\n\n## The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management, the application of these remuneration guidelines as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The CEO and other senior executives do not participate in the Board of Directors' or the Remuneration Committee's processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting.\n\n## Derogation from the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is motivated to serve the company's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters, including also preparation of resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.",

The parent company is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm with a secondary listing on Nasdaq Helsinki.\n\nSSAB is a global steel company that is a world leader in high-strength steel and related services. SSAB's vision is to contribute to a stronger, lighter and more sustainable world and it aims to become the first steelmaking company in the world to offer fossil-free steel on the market, and to largely eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from its operations around 2030.\n\nSSAB is organized into five business segments: the three steel divisions SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe and SSAB Americas as well as the fully owned subsidiaries Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. The Group's steel mills are located in Sweden, Finland and the USA and the Group employs approximately 15,000 persons.\n\n## Corporate information\n\nCompany name\n\nSSAB AB (publ)\n\nRegistration number\n\n556016-3429\n\nLegal form\n\nLimited liability company\n\nCountry of incorporation\n\nSweden\n\nDomicile and principal place of business\n\nStockholm, Sweden\n\nCompany address\n\nBox 70, SE-101 21 Stockholm, Sweden\n\n## A.2 Principles of preparation of the report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSAB's consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2023 covering the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023 have been prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual accounts act (1995:1554) as well as IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that have been adopted by the EU. In addition, the Swedish Corporate Reporting Board's recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for the Group, has been applied. SSAB's Annual report according to the ESEF regulations is published in XHTML format in Swedish at the Group's website.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Swedish kronas unless stated otherwise. All figures have been rounded and consequently the sum of individual figures may deviate from the presented aggregate figure. Key figures have been calculated using exact figures.\n\n## Accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting principles, and include the accounts of the parent company, SSAB AB (publ) and all Group companies. Subsidiaries are consolidated using the acquisition method and constitute of all entities over which SSAB has control.\n\nFor each acquisition, the Group determines whether non-controlling interests in the acquired company are reported at fair value or at the proportion of the net assets of the acquired company represented by the holding. Acquisition costs are expensed when they occur and reported according to the nature either as administrative expenses or other operating expenses.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Swedish kronas, which is the parent company's functional and reporting currency. Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. In certain cases, the actual rate is approximated to the average rate during a month. Exchange rate differences relating to the business activities are reported within the operating result in other operating income and expenses, while differences attributable to financing activities are reported in financial income and expenses.",

Translation differences are recognized to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and reported in translation reserve in equity.\n\nGoodwill and adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value arising from acquisitions of foreign subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities in the foreign operations and thus translated with the closing day rates of the period.\n\n## Changes in IFRS Accounting Standards\n\nStandards, changes and interpretations that are relevant to the Group became effective in 2023 AMENDMENTS TO IAS 1, DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES, effective as of January 1, 2023. The Amendments required entities to disclose information on their material accounting policies instead of significant ones. The Amendments defined what is material accounting policy information and explained how to identify it, and further clarified that immaterial accounting policy information does not need to be disclosed. The Group has applied these Amendments as of January 1, 2023. The Amendments impacted the presentation of Group's accounting principles in the financial report.\n\nAMENDMENTS TO IAS 8, CHANGES IN ESTIMATES, effective as of January 1, 2023. The Amendments clarified how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in estimates and assumptions. The Group has applied these Amendments as of January 1, 2023. The Amendments did not impact the Group's financial reports.\n\nAMENDMENTS TO IAS 12, DEFERRED TAXES, effective as of January 1, 2023. The Amendments required companies to recognize deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group has applied these Amendments as of January 1, 2023. The Amendments impacted the presentation of the notes in the Group's financial report.\n\nAMENDMENTS TO IAS 12, DEFERRED TAXES resulting from INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM PILLAR TWO MODEL RULES, effective as of January 1, 2023. In 2021, the Organization for Economic cooperation and development (OECD) published model rules for Pillar Two (Global AntiBase Erosion Proposal, or GloBE) to reform international corporate taxation. The related Amendments to IAS 12 include a temporary exception to the requirement to recognize and disclose information about deferred taxes arising from Pillar Two model rules, including tax rules that implement a domestic minimum top-up tax described in Pillar Two. SSAB is within the scope of the Pillar Two model rules, and has applied the temporary exceptions to the requirements on deferred tax reporting as of January 1, 2023. Accordingly, the Group neither recognizes nor discloses information about deferred taxes relating to the Pillar Two rules. More information on SSAB's adaptation of the Pillar Two model rules can be found in the note E.1. Current assessment is that the implementation is expected to have minor effects on Group's total income tax expense and effective tax rate.\n\n## Standards, changes and interpretations relevant to the Group that have not became effective, yet, and have not been prematurely applied by the Group\n\nAMENDMENTS TO IAS 1, CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES AS CURRENT OR NON-CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES WITH COVENANTS, effective as of January 1, 2024. The Amendments clarify the IAS 1 criterion for classifying a liability as non-current: company must have a right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period, and further clarify the disclosure requirements when the company' right to defer the settlement is subject to compliance with covenants. The Group will apply these Amendments as of January 1, 2024. The Amendments are not expected to have significant impact on the Group's future financial reports.\n\nAMENDMENTS TO IFRS 16, LEASE LIABILITY IN A SALE AND LEASEBACK, effective as of January 1, 2024. The Amendment adds subsequent measurement requirements for sale and leaseback transactions into IFRS 16. The Group will apply these Amendments as of January 1, 2024. The Amendments are not expected to have significant impact on the Group's future financial reports.",

The Amendments require companies to provide additional disclosures about supplier finance arrangements to assess the impact these arrangement have on liabilities, cash flows and liquidity risk. The Group will apply these Amendments when they are adopted by the EU, earliest as of January 1, 2024. The Amendments may impact the note disclosures in the Group's future financial reports.\n\nAMENDMENTS TO IAS 21, LACK OF EXCHANGEABILITY, effective as of January 1, 2025, not yet adopted by the EU. The Amendments require a consistent approach to assess whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency and, when it is not, to determine the exchange rate to use and disclosures to provide. The Group will apply these Amendments when they are adopted by the EU, earliest as of January 1, 2025. The Amendments are not expected to have significant impact on the Group's future financial reports.\n\n## Key assessments and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of a number of estimations for accounting purposes. In addition, management must make certain assessments when applying the Group's accounting principles. The applied assumptions are evaluated and revised to reflect changes in the Group's operating environment and circumstances. Although the assessments and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge, the actual outcome may deviate from the assessments made and estimates used.\n\nKey assessments and assumptions are included in particular in those notes in which complex assessment is required or which the assumptions and estimations are of material significance, and the table in the beginning of the notes to the consolidated financial statements outlines these notes.\n\n## Risks related to climate change\n\nThe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommends companies to report on their climate-related risks and opportunities and to improve transparency on how to address them. SSAB has analyzed these risks and opportunities through two alternative scenarios: a low future emissions scenario and a high future emissions scenario. SSAB's business strategy to transform into fossil-free steelmaking is well positioned in both scenarios. The expected physical climate change effects for SSAB include rising temperatures and precipitation levels in most of SSAB's production sites, but additional related costs are not expected to be significant.\n\nConsequently, the main risks relate to the Group's transformation to fossil-free steelmaking. The transformation itself is a significant opportunity for the Group, but risks include delays in the transformation due to political and regulatory reasons, as well as unsuccessful implementation of the transformation program and investments. There is also uncertainty on emission allowance price development. For more information, see Climate-related risks and opportunities in the Sustainability Report.\n\nThe transformation to fossil-free steelmaking will impact SSAB's financial reporting. The remaining useful lives of the assets in Sweden and Finland that will be replaced in the transformation are reviewed regularly. In June, 2023, the SSAB Board of Directors made the investment decision regarding the conversion of the Oxel\u00f6sund mill in Sweden with the aim to start production with the new system in the end of 2026. Consequently, SSAB revised the remaining useful life estimates for the assets that will be replaced and become obsolete by the new production system so that these assets will be depreciated to their residual values by the end of 2026. As of July, 2023 the change increased SSAB's annual depreciation by approximately SEK 40 million. Regarding value-in-use calculations for impairment testing, climate risks have been taken into account to the extent they could be estimated. Future capital expenditure and other cash flows regarding the transformation to fossil-free steelmaking have not been included in the calculations. For more information, see note C.1 for useful lives of tangible fixed assets and impairment testing.",

These performance measures provide complementary information about the company's performance, financial position and cash flows and are used by the Group's executive management.

Operating result\n\nSSAB's adjusted operating result decreased in 2023 compared to the record level in 2022 mainly due to weaker market and lower steel prices, especially in Europe. During 2023, SSAB further consolidated its leadership in the green transition in the steel industry and launched the SSAB Zero steel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nB.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B.1\n\nBusiness segments\n\n## B.2\n\nRevenue\n\n## B.3\n\nOperating expenses\n\n## B.4\n\nCompensation to employees\n\n## B.5\n\nOther operating income/expenses\n\n## B.6\n\nAffiliated companies, joint ventures and related party transactions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating result",

The operating segments are the three divisions: SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe, SSAB Americas and the subsidiaries Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. Tibnor and Ruukki Construction are operated as independent subsidiaries by their respective Boards and act at arm's length in relation to the rest of SSAB. More information about the business segments is included in the Board of Directors' Report.\n\nIn addition, there are other businesses that are not reportable segments since they do not meet the thresholds set forth in IFRS 8 and they are not monitored separately by the Group Executive Committee. They are included in 'Other'. For more information on external revenues per business segment, see note B.2 and information on non-current assets per geographical area, see note C.1.\n\n## Business segments\n\n| 2023 SEK millions                                                  | SSAB Special Steels   | SSAB Europe   | SSAB Americas   | Tibnor   | Ruukki Construction   | Other   | Group adjustments   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------------|---------|---------------------|---------|\n| External revenue                                                   | 31,443                | 39,300        | 29,389          | 13,557   | 5,799                 | -       | -                   | 119,489 |\n| Internal revenue                                                   | 702                   | 6,927         | 385             | 133      | 11                    | -       | -8,158              | -       |\n| Total revenue                                                      | 32,145                | 46,227        | 29,775          | 13,691   | 5,810                 | -       | -8,158              | 119,489 |\n| Adjusted operating result                                          | 6,752                 | 1,183         | 9,651           | -220     | -6                    | -891    | -                   | 16,467  |\n| Operating result                                                   | 6,752                 | 1,183         | 9,651           | -220     | -6                    | -891    | -                   | 16,467  |\n| Net financial income and expenses                                  | -                     | -             | -               | -        | -                     | -       | -                   | 248     |\n| Result before tax                                                  | -                     | -             | -               | -        | -                     | -       | -                   | 16,716  |\n| Material cost items                                                |                       |               |                 |          |                       |         |                     |         |\n| Raw materials, including change in inventory                       | 18,130                | 23,069        | 6,953           | -6       | 11                    | -       | -191                | 47,966  |\n| Other materials, goods and services, including change in inventory | -2,752                | 5,673         | 9,084           | 12,133   | 3,959                 | -61     | -8,246              | 19,789  |\n| Compensation to employees                                          | 3,704                 | 5,898         | 966             | 876      | 882                   | 649     | -                   | 12,974  |\n| Depreciation, amortization and impairments                         | 1,260                 | 1,723         | 223             | 208      | 208                   | 51      | -                   | 3,674   |\n| Maintenance capital expenditure                                    | 774                   | 1,357         | 284             | 72       | 73                    | 25      | -                   | 2,585   |\n| Strategic capital expenditure                                      | 1,259                 | 349           | 36              | 69       | 175                   | -       | -                   | 1,889   |\n| Total capital expenditure                                          | 2,033                 | 1,706         | 320             | 141      | 248                   | 25      | -                   | 4,474   |",

The Group Executive Committee is the chief operating decision maker responsible for business segments' performance assessment and resource allocation. The segment reporting corresponds to the internal management reporting to the Group Executive Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe main measure in assessing the business segments' performance is the adjusted operating result, which excludes the items affecting comparability. Adjusted operating result is an alternative performance measure, and more information can be found in Note A.3.\n\nFrom January 1, 2023 onwards the business segments' adjusted operating result includes depreciation/amortization on surplus values on tangible and intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Ipsco and Rautaruukki, which were earlier excluded. Comparative information has been updated accordingly.",

The performance obligation related to these goods are satisfied and revenue is recognized at the point in time when the control of the goods has been transferred to the customer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegarding sales of steel and steel products as well as distribution of steel and other metals, the control is transferred when the goods are transferred to the customer and the Group does not retain any disposition right or opportunity to actually control the goods, and there are no outstanding unsatisfied performance obligations that might affect the customer's approval of the goods. In practice, revenue is typically recognized upon delivery of the goods to the customer according to the agreed delivery terms and conditions.\n\nRevenue is recognized at transaction price less value added tax. Variable revenue components include volume discounts, other bonuses and refunds related to customer claims. These items are estimated based of forecasted volumes and historical information, and recognized as a reduction in revenue and accounts receivable. When a customer claim is expected to be settled with a replacement product instead of a refund, the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold and current provisions. Liabilities relating to customer contracts include accruals for volume discounts, bonuses and claims as well as advance payment received from customers and are presented in note C.4.\n\nContract revenue from agreements which extend over more than twelve months is not material and, therefore, it is not disclosed.",

The remuneration for the President is further discussed in the Remuneration Report. Compensation to the President and other members of the Group Executive Committee consists of a fixed salary component, a short-term variable salary component, and a long-term variable salary component.\n\n## Short-term variable compensation\n\nThe short-term variable salary component for 2022 (paid in 2023) is related to: A) three Group objectives, 1) EBITDA margin compared to peer group (Arcelor Mittal Europe, BE Group, JFE, Kingspan, Kl\u00f6ckner, Lindab, Nucor, Salzgitter, Tata Steel Europe, US Steel and Voestalpine), 2) net operating working capital in relation to sales and 3) a sustainability objective measuring injury frequency, combined with B) divisional financial and operational objectives.\n\nFor the President, the individual objectives account for 15% of the total short term variable pay whereas the other 85% relate to SSAB Group Objectives. For Executive Vice Presidents of Group functions, the Group objectives account for 100%, and for divisional Executive Vice Presidents the Group objectives account for 40% and divisional objectives for 60%.\n\nThe short-term variable salary component is capped at 75% of base pay for the President and at 50% for others, except for the divisional head of SSAB Americas, who receives variable compensation competitive in the local market: Meeting the targets result in variable pay of 60% of base pay whereas extremely good performance may amount to a maximum of 180% of base pay. In 2023, the outcomes of the short-term variable compensation in relation to base pay were on cash-basis as follows: 54,5% (39,8%) for the President and on average 49,0% (33,9%) for the other Group Executive Committee members.\n\n## Compensation to employees\n\n| SEK millions                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Wages and salaries and other compensation | 10,307 | 9,680  |\n| Social security expenses                  | 1,612  | 1,318  |\n| Pension expenses                          | 1,055  | 1,094  |\n| Total                                     | 12,974 | 12,091 |\n\nFor more information on pensions, see note D.8.\n\n| Compensation and benefits for the Group Executive Committee 1)   |   President |   President |   Other Group Executive Committee |   Other Group Executive Committee |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| SEK millions                                                     |      2023   |      2022   |                            2023   |                            2022   |\n| Fixed salary 2)                                                  |        14.1 |        13.6 |                              45.7 |                              39.7 |\n| Other benefits 3)                                                |         0.4 |         0.4 |                               1.6 |                               2.3 |\n| Short-term variable salary, paid 4)                              |         7.1 |         4.9 |                              21.6 |                              12.3 |\n| Long-term variable salary, paid 4)                               |         2.6 |         2.1 |                              10.9 |                               8.3 |\n| Total compensation before social security and pension  expenses  |        24.2 |        21   |                              79.8 |                              62.6 |\n| Social security expenses                                         |         7.6 |         6.6 |                              13.5 |                               9.9 |\n| Pension expenses                                                 |         6.3 |         6.1 |                              14.1 |                              14.4 |\n| Total                                                            |        38.1 |        33.8 |                             107.4 |                              86.9 |",

Raahen Voima Oy and Manga LNG Oy are considered material based on their financial information in relation to the other affiliated companies and joint ventures, whereas Hybrit Development AB has strategic materiality due to its role in SSAB's transformation to fossil-free steelmaking.\n\n## AP     Affiliated companies and joint arrangements\n\nSSAB's affiliated companies are companies in which the Group has significant but not controlling interest in the company. SSAB typically defines significant influence based on the share of votes, the share being between 20% and 50% of the votes. Voting power is the determining factor also if the ownership exceeds 50%. SSAB's joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures, which means that SSAB and one or several parties have joint controlling interest and are entitled to the net assets.\n\nAffiliated companies and joint ventures are reported using the equity method. Shares of the earnings in affiliated companies and joint ventures are reported in the operating result when the operations of these companies are related to SSAB's operations and considered to be of a business nature.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Related party transactions and balances\n\n| SEK millions              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                   |        |        |\n| Affiliated companies      | 689    | 1,309  |\n| Joint ventures            | 12     | 22     |\n| Cost of goods sold        |        |        |\n| Affiliated companies      | -1,089 | -1,735 |\n| Joint ventures            | -89    | -275   |\n| Accounts receivable       | 117    | 31     |\n| Accounts payable          | 99     | 61     |\n| Other current liabilities | 113    | 117    |\n\nRevenues from related parties relate to sales of gas and fuel to energy producing companies as well as sales of services.

The goodwill allocation to business segments is based on expected contributions from the business acquisition giving rise to the goodwill item.\n\nRecoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is based on value-in-use calculations that are based on the company's budgets and forecasts regularly produced by the management. Cash flows beyond a five-year period are extrapolated applying a long-term growth rate that does not exceed the long-term rate of growth for the market in which the cash-generating units operate.\n\nThe annual impairment test for 2023 did not result in a goodwill impairment. In 2022, goodwill was impaired by SEK 33,291 million, which was primarily related to the acquisitions of Ipsco and Rautaruukki. The impairment was reported as part of cost of goods sold and as an item affecting comparability, see notes A.3 and B.3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A&A     Assessments in impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives\n\nWhen calculating the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units to assess any impairment, a number of assumptions about future conditions and estimates of parameters is made.\n\nKey assumptions include discount rate (WACC), long-term growth rate and development in volumes, sales prices, costs and capital expenditure. The discount rate is defined separately for each business segment to reflect specific risks applicable to the segment and it is based on the average long-term interest rates during November-December and is stated before tax. The longterm growth rate corresponds to the forecasts available in industry and analyst reports as well as management's strategic assumptions and knowledge of the steel industry. The estimated gross margins are based on historical results and expected market trends for each business segment. Climate risks have been taken into account to the extent that they could be estimated. Future capital expenditure and cash flows regarding SSAB's transformation to fossil-free steelmaking have not been included in the calculations. An increase in discount rate of 0.5 percentage points for Tibnor and Ruukki Construction would not imply any impairment.

The free allocation did not fully cover the consumption and a cost accrual of SEK 774 (212) million was recognized in accrued expenses (see note C.4). In 2023 SSAB bought 2.4 million tonnes of emission rights and sold 1.5 million tonnes. The same amount of rights that was sold was purchased back with forward contracts. The sold rights generated a loss of SEK 123 ( gain of SEK 670) million which is reported in deferred income (see note C.4). The value of the future deliveries of emission rights is presented in contingent liabilities in note E.4. At year-end 2023, SSAB owned emission rights amounting to SEK 7 (18) million. The granted emission rights are stated at an acquisition value of SEK\n\n0.\n\n## A&A     Assessments regarding useful lives of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets\n\nUseful lives are a key assumption impacting materially the values of intangible and tangible fixed assets, and these estimates are revised when changes to the previous estimates are identified.\n\nThe useful life of the Group's assets in Sweden and Finland is under regular review, as a result of the Group's strategic plans to transition to fossil-free steelmaking in the Nordic operations. Group Executive Committee has defined milestones or circumstances (e.g. an investment decision) for it to revise the remaining useful life estimates of the assets that will be replaced by the upcoming investments. Factors impacting the remaining useful life evaluation include, for example, the order in which the mills will be transformed and the length of various approval processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn June, 2023, SSAB's Board of Directors made an investment decision for a new electric arc furnace (EAF) with associated raw material handling in Oxel\u00f6sund, Sweden. The aim is to start production with the new system in the end of 2026. Consequently, SSAB revised the remaining useful life estimates for the assets that will be replaced and become obsolete by the new production system so that these assets will be depreciated to their residual values by the end of 2026. As of July, 2023 the change increased SSAB's annual depreciation by approximately SEK 40 million.\n\n## AP     Intangible and tangible fixed assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntangible and tangible fixed assets are reported at acquisition value less any accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment.\n\nThe acquisition value includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset or bringing it ready for its intended use, such as purchase price including any customs duties, transportation costs, costs related to preparation of the site, as well as costs related to installation, project management, testing and project commissioning. Costs for SSAB personnel directly contributing to the project are included in the acquisition value. Borrowing costs are included in the acquisition cost of the asset in material long-term investment projects. If cash flow hedge accounting is applied on capital expenditure, the realized fair value of these derivatives is also included in the acquisition value. Restoration expenses occurring at the disposal of a fixed asset are included in the acquisition value only if a reasonable estimate of such expenses can be made. In such case also a provision for restoration is recognized. See note C.5 for more information on restoration expenses and related provisions. Expenditure for material replacement components are added to the asset value or recognized as a separate asset only when the component is expected to be used for more than 3 years. All other forms of repairs and maintenance are recognized as expenses during the period in which they occur.\n\nIn SSAB's capital expenditure reporting, strategic capital expenditures are defined as investments that increase the cash flows through acquisitions of businesses and investments in plant expansion or technology that enhances competitiveness, while maintenance capital expenditure is defined as investments involving maintenance, rationalization or replacements that are made in order to maintain competitiveness as well as investments to comply with regulatory requirements.",

Land is assumed to have a perpetual useful life and is thus not depreciated.\n\nCapital gains and losses on the sale of tangible fixed assets are recognized as the difference between the net proceeds received from the sales and the reported value of the asset in the statement of profit or loss as other operating income or other operating expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives include goodwill and certain trademarks.\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets and tangible fixed assets\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life (including goodwill) are tested for any impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications of potential impairment. Depreciated/ amortized assets are tested for impairment when signs indicate a potential impairment. Impairment losses are reported as an expense within the operating result.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nEmission rights are reported as intangible assets at cost less any accumulated impairment. The cost for the rights received for free is zero. Emission rights with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment on a quarterly basis. Provision is made if a shortfall in emission rights is identified between owned rights and the rights to be delivered due to actual emissions. Gains or losses from sale of emission rights are deferred and recognized as other operating income or expense during the same periods as the related emission expenses.",

The lease liability is initially recognized at the present value of future lease payments. If discount rate is not implicit in the lease agreement, an incremental borrowing rate is defined per currency by Group Treasury taking into account the lease term and lessee credit risk. When contract includes both lease and non-lease elements, or fixed and variable elements, it is evaluated case by case based on materiality whether the lease liability includes only the fixed lease elements or whether the non-lease elements are included, as well.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is measured at initial value less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment, and taking into account any re-measurements. If the ownership of the asset transfers to SSAB at the end of the lease period, the useful life of the asset is estimated similarly as for purchased fixed assets. Extension options are considered in the lease term when it is highly probable that the option will be utilized.\n\nThe Group applies an exception to the above principles to low value leases, where no right-of-use asset or lease liability is recognized. These are recognized as rental and lease expenses within the operating result on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group defines low value leases as, for example, office equipment such as printers, copying machines, coffee machines and other assets having a value of less than around SEK 50 thousand in new condition. No rightof-use asset or lease liability is also recognized for lease contract with truly variable lease fees, which are recognized as expenses within the operating result.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The share of inventories which is booked as expense amounted to SEK 96,936 (93,805) million during the period, of which SEK 462 (588) million was reported as an expense relation to impairment of inventories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInventory value is materially affected by assumptions and estimates regarding product costing, the assumptions used in the net realizable value calculations and estimates of obsolescence. Assumptions, such as first-in-first-out (FIFO), are applied in the valuation of inventory. Determining the quantities of certain input materials is complex and requires assumptions and estimates such as volume/weight.\n\n## AP     Inventories\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group applies the weighted average value method or FIFO (first in, first out) method to estimate the acquisition cost of inventories. SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe, SSAB Americas and Ruukki Construction mainly use the weighted average value method whereas Tibnor mainly uses the FIFO method.\n\nThe net realizable value is normally the sales price less production and selling expenses. With respect to products in the trading operations, the replacement cost with an added estimated gross margin is used as the best gauge of the net realizable value. In respect of raw materials, the replacement cost is used as the best gauge of the net realizable value. However, raw materials are not written down below the acquisition cost if the end product they are included in is expected to be sold at a price exceeding the manufacturing cost. Obsolescence of inventory is evaluated and inventory value impaired according to the Group's guideline for various materials and products.",

However, such activities will become relevant only when SSAB ceases to conduct operations in the area, and the needed expenditure is typically estimated when closures of operations are decided upon. In transformation to fossil-free steel production, in particular the blast furnaces and the coke ovens will be decommissioned. However, no material costs relating to the dismantling of this equipment has been identified. Restoration of these areas is not yet assessed relevant as the operations will continue on these sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AP     Provisions\n\nProvisions for restructuring measures are made when a detailed, formal plan for the measures is in place and well-founded expectations created among the affected parties. Provisions are reviewed during each reporting period.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nSSAB participates in the EU's emission rights trading system. Provision is made if a shortfall in emission rights is identified between owned rights and the rights to be delivered due to actual emissions. Emission rights are reported as intangible assets and are booked at acquisition value.\n\n## Environmental restoration expenses\n\nExpenses for environmental measures associated with previous operations and which do not contribute to current or future revenue are booked as a cost when incurred. The provision is calculated based on interpretations of applicable environmental legislation and regulations. Provisions are usually not recognized for land clean-up and restoration of industrial areas where operations are still conducted, since it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation on timing and cost of such clean-up.",

The Group's operations are dependent on the business cycle, and the target is to maintain the net debt/equity ratio between -20% to 20%. Since 2021, SSAB has reported net cash, and consequently a negative net debt/equity ratio, and strong cash flow in 2023 has further increased the net cash. The main objective of capital management is to ensure the ability to continue to operate and to generate good return for the shareholders.\n\nEquity can be managed by dividends, share buybacks, or new issues of equity. SSAB's dividend target is to distribute 40% of the result for the year as dividends. More information on the on-going share buyback program can be found in note D.7. Debt can be managed by raising new debt through capital market or banks, managing the utilization of financing facilities as well as repaying debt. The targets of debt management include optimized maturity structure and finance cost for the debt.\n\n## D.2 Net debt/cash\n\n## Net debt/(cash)\n\n| SEK millions                             | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Assets in net debt/cash                  |         |         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                | 28,916  | 24,900  |\n| Current interest-bearing receivables     | 41      | 40      |\n| Receivables from pension obligations     | 188     | 97      |\n| Other non-current receivables            | 37      | 59      |\n| Derivative assets in net debt/cash       | 84      | 250     |\n| Total                                    | 29,265  | 25,347  |\n| Liabilities in net debt/cash             |         |         |\n| Non-current interest-bearing liabilities | 6,282   | 6,291   |\n| Current interest-bearing liabilities     | 1,428   | 1,882   |\n| Lease liabilities                        | 2,912   | 2,504   |\n| Liabilities from pension obligations     | 343     | 318     |\n| Derivative liabilities in net debt/cash  | 93      | 65      |\n| Total                                    | 11,059  | 11,060  |\n| Total net debt/(cash)                    | -18,206 | -14,287 |\n\nNet debt is an alternative performance measure.

Funding plans are reviewed regularly based on divisions' cash flow forecasts.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, long-term borrowing amounted to SEK 6,282 (6,291) million primarily through the capital markets and the existing note programs and to some extent through banks. European Medium Term Note program (EMTN) is used for long-term borrowing up to ten years, while Swedish and Finnish commercial paper programs are used for short term (< 1 year) borrowing. The program limit of the EMTN program is EUR 2,000 million, while the Swedish commercial paper program has a limit of SEK 5,000 million and the Finnish commercial paper program of EUR 500 million. At year-end, long-term borrowing within the EMTN program\n\namounted to SEK 5,224 (5,668) million, while the Swedish and Finnish commercial paper programs were not utilized (Swedish program SEK 150 million).\n\nDuring the year, SSAB issued two five-year unsecured sustainability-linked bonds of SEK 2,100 million. The interest rate level is linked to SSAB meeting the various milestones in the company's climate goals, which are also approved by the Science Based Target Initiative.\n\nAt year-end, the Group's liquidity buffer, consisting of cash, short-term investments and nonutilized binding credit facilities, amounted to SEK 37,155 (35,158) million, equal to 31% (27%) of the revenue.\n\nTo the extent surplus liquidity arises, the Group seeks to repay its loans. If that is not possible, the funds are deposited with approved banks. On December 31, 2023, the total loan portfolio amounted to SEK 7,711 (8,173) million, with an average term to maturity of 6.2 (5.7) years.\n\n## Contractual cash flows, December 31, 2023\n\n| SEK millions                                   | Book value   | Contractual cash flow   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   | Later   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Loans                                          |              |                         |        |        |        |        |        |         |\n| Capital market debt                            | 7,406        | 9,542                   | 1,481  | 318    | 2,255  | 198    | 2,276  | 3,014   |\n| Bank loans                                     | 304          | 304                     | 304    | -      | -      | -      | -      | -       |\n| Total, loans                                   | 7,710        | 9,846                   | 1,785  | 318    | 2,255  | 198    | 2,276  | 3,014   |\n| Accounts payable                               | 17,001       | 17,001                  | 17,001 | -      | -      | -      | -      | -       |\n| Derivatives, outflow                           | 362          | 362                     | 310    | 14     | 26     | 9      | 3      | -       |\n| Derivatives, inflow                            | 419          | 419                     | 233    | 67     | 91     | 21     | 7      | -       |\n| Total, loans, accounts payable and derivatives | 24,654       | 26,790                  | 18,863 | 265    | 2,190  | 186    | 2,272  | 3,014   |\n\nInterest flows are calculated based on interest rates and exchange rates at year-end.

To the extent the utilization is not probable, the fee is treated as a prepaid expense for the liquidity and amortized over the period of the facility.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, immediately accessible bank balances as well as other short-term deposits with an original term to maturity of less than three months (short-term investments). Overdraft facilities are reported in the statement of financial position as borrowing among current interest-bearing liabilities.\n\nFinancial risk management is governed by the Group's Directive of Financial Risk Management, which defines the responsibilities, processes and other principles of financial risk management. The objectives for financial risk management are to reduce volatility in the Group's earnings and ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group's operations. Most financial transactions take place through the parent company's treasury function in Stockholm, Sweden and through SSAB Finance Ireland in Ireland.\n\nFinancial risks include market and credit risks as well as liquidity and refinancing risks. Credit risks related to accounts receivable are discussed in note C.4 while liquidity and refinancing risks are discussed in note D.2. For a detailed description of the Group's financial risks, see section Financial risks and sensitivity analysis in the Board of Directors' Report.\n\n## Market risks\n\nMarket risks result from changes in market prices, which can affect the Group's earnings or financial position, and include interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity price risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk and hedges\n\nOn December 31, 2023, Group's interest-bearing liabilities amounted to SEK 7,711 (8,173) million, of which SEK 3,218 (3,966) million has a fixed interest or is swapped to a fixed interest. Including the interest rate swaps, the average fixed interest term was 1.4 (0.9) years. For the net debt at the year-end, including interest hedging, a change in market interest rates of 100 basis points (1 percentage point), would change the result for the year by SEK 156 (125) million.\n\nAt year-end, the value of interest rate swaps converting floating to fixed interest (entered into to secure cash flow in conjunction with interest payments) was SEK 67 (129) million. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied for these swaps and no inefficiency was identified during the year. The outstanding interest rate derivatives had an average maturity of 20 (32) months at year-end.\n\nThe Group's interest-bearing assets amounted to SEK 29,265 (25,347) million and consisted almost exclusively of cash and cash equivalents at variable interest rates.",

Reported accounts payable and receivables in major currencies are hedged in order to minimize the effect of exchange rates to the Group's earnings. Major investments and projects in foreign currency can be hedged based on management decision. Other commercial currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales in foreign currency are short-term in nature and thus no hedging takes place. Instead, they are exchanged on the spot market.\n\nIn 2023, the Group had a net cash inflow of foreign currency of SEK 20 (13) billion. The most important currency flows are shown in a diagram in section Financial risks and sensitivity analysis in the Board of Directors' Report.\n\nA five percentage point devaluation of the Swedish krona against the Group's two most important currencies, the US dollar and euro, including hedges, would have a positive impact on the result of the year of SEK 449 (293) million with respect to the US dollar and a positive impact of SEK 196 (558) million with respect to euro. Additionally, equity would be positively affected by the translation effect of foreign subsidiaries, net of equity hedges, by SEK 1,921 (3,393) million.\n\nIn 2023, net exchange rate differences amounted to SEK -326 (-163) million in operating result and SEK -119 (191) million in financial income and expenses. The breakdown accounts receivable and payable per currency is presented in note C.4.\n\n## Borrowing per currency\n\n| SEK millions     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|\n| SEK              | 5,385  | 3,995  |\n| USD              | 2,190  | 2,272  |\n| EUR              | -3     | 1,885  |\n| Other currencies | 140    | 18     |\n| Total            | 7,711  | 8,173  |\n\nThe translation exposure in net investments is hedged primarily through debt in the same currency. Consequently, borrowing in euro and the US dollar has not been separately hedged. In the absence of such debt, currency derivatives may be used instead. On December 31, 2023, these net investments amounted to EUR 1,768 (1,755) million and USD 2,091 (4,854) million, respectively. During 2023, SSAB applied net investment hedging only in relation to its investments in US dollar covering a part of the investment intended to be distributed as dividend to the parent company. This dividend was executed during Q4 2023, and the hedges consequently closed. The accumulated change in fair value reserve, before tax, relating to net investment hedging amounted to SEK -4,667 (-4,934) million at year-end. No inefficiency was identified during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, cash flow hedge accounting was applied to partly hedge the currency risk of euro capital expenditure. At year-end, these derivative instruments had a net fair value of SEK -29 (-) million. There was no inefficiency in this program as of December 31, 2023.\n\nFair value hedge accounting is applied in connection with certain purchases in euros. At year-end, such purchase orders amounted to SEK -1.7 (-1.6) billion. At year-end, derivative instruments related to fair value hedging had a net fair value of SEK -9 (68) million, while purchase orders subject to hedge accounting and accounts payable related to hedged purchase orders were SEK 9 (-68) million. Thus, there was no inefficiency at year-end.\n\nAt year-end, the net fair value of non-hedge accounted derivative instruments amounted to SEK -253 (-209) million, of which SEK -175 (-242) million was reported in operating result in other operating income and SEK -78 (33) million was reported in financial income and expenses. The outstanding FX derivatives had an average maturity of 5 (3) months at year-end.\n\n## Commodity price risk and hedging\n\nInformation about the commodity price risk can be found in the Board of Directors' Report in section Financial risks and sensitivity analysis. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied for hedging price risk of electricity and iron ore.\n\nElectricity price risk relating to forecasted electricity consumption at the mills is partly hedged with derivative instruments and partly by physical delivery contracts. At year-end, the amount of forecasted purchases hedged with electricity derivatives was 3,035 (3,011) GWh and the net fair value of the related derivative instruments was SEK 275 (1,242) million. There was no inefficiency at year-end. The outstanding electricity derivatives had an average maturity of 23 (30) months at December 31, 2023.\n\nIron ore is hedged in limited volumes using average swaps. At year-end, the forecasted purchases hedged with iron ore derivatives amounted to 26,900 (91,015) tonnes and the net fair value of related derivative instruments was SEK 6 (2) million. There was no inefficiency at year-end. The outstanding iron ore derivatives had an average maturity of 0 (4) months at year-end.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nThe limits for individual counterparties are evaluated continuously. For derivative transactions, SSAB has the ISDA framework in place. On December 31, 2023 the total counterparty risk was SEK 28,954 (26,289) million, of which derivative instruments accounted for SEK 38 (1,388) million and investments in cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 28,916 (24,900) million.",

Interest swaps are used to hedge exposure to interest rate risks. The fair value of currency forward contracts and currency swaps is calculated based on forward contract prices on the balance sheet date, while interest rate swaps are valued calculated on the basis of future discounted cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounted derivative contracts are classified as hedging the fair value of a reported asset or liability or a signed delivery order (fair value hedging), hedging a planned transaction (cash flow hedging), or hedging a net investment in a foreign company.\n\nIn fair value hedging, the fair value changes of derivative instruments are reported in the cost of goods sold within the statement of profit or loss together with the changes in the fair value of the asset or liability or the delivery order to which the hedging relates.\n\nIn cash flow hedging and net investment hedging, the effective part of the fair value changes of derivative instruments is reported in other comprehensive income, whereas the gains or losses attributable to the ineffective part are reported as financial items in the profit or loss. If cash flow hedges relate to capital expenditure, the realized fair value of the derivatives is recognized in the acquisition value of the asset.\n\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness during the term of the hedging relationship include significant changes in credit risk of one of the parties and, in case of cash flow hedge, change in timing of the payment of the hedged item or high probability of forecasted volumes exceeding the actual outcomes.",

Electricity and iron ore derivatives are on level 1 as their fair values are based on listed market values. The rest of the financial instruments are classified on level 2 as their fair valuation is based on other observable market data than listed prices.\n\nFair value on commodity price derivatives is calculated based on market prices on applicable exchanges. The fair value of currency derivatives is calculated based on current forward prices at the reporting date. Fair value of interest rate derivatives are calculated based on the discounted cash flow method.\n\nAccounts receivable are reported in the amount expected to be received following the assessment of expected credit losses. Other current interest-bearing receivables consist of restricted cash with a term to maturity of less than 12 months, whereas cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and bank deposits with short maturities. For both of these items the fair values are estimated to be substantially consistent with the book value.\n\nNon-current and current interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of debt that is valued at amortized cost. Fair values have been calculated based on the interest rate for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year. Accounts payable are reported in the amount which is expected to be paid and are valued at acquisition value.\n\n## Netting of derivative assets and liabilities\n\nIf full netting in accordance with ISDA agreements had been applied, the derivative instruments would have amounted to SEK 57 (1,231) million of financial assets and SEK 0 (0) million of financial liabilities.\n\n## AP     Financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial assets in this category include investments and accounts receivable, other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. Expected credit losses are assessed for accounts receivable and other current receivables, accounting principles are presented in the note C.4.\n\nFinancial liabilities in this category include borrowings, accounts payable and other payables. See note D.2 for accounting principles on borrowings and C.4 for accounting principles for accounts payable and other payables.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in this category include derivative instruments to which hedge accounting is applied.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets managed and evaluated based on fair values are included in this category. Derivative instruments, to which hedge accounting is not applied, are included in this category as well. Changes in value are reported in the statement of profit or loss, either in operating result for derivative instruments relating to business activities or in financial income and expenses for derivative instruments relating to financial activities. For more information on accounting principles related to derivative instruments and hedge accounting, see note D.3.",

The purpose of the program is to adjust SSAB's capital structure to create greater value for the shareholders. The Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2024 that it resolves to reduce the share capital by cancellation of the shares acquired by SSAB.\n\nThe allocation between the share classes A and B reflect the current trading volume of the two share classes, entailing that 25% (i.e. up to SEK 625 million) is allocated to the purchase of Class A shares and 75% (i.e. up to SEK 1,875 million) to the purchase of Class B shares. Purchases commenced on October 26, 2023 and will end between February 2 and March 11, 2024. The total number of treasury shares held by SSAB will not at any time exceed 10% of the total number of shares.\n\nOn December 31, 2023 SSAB held 18,276,773 (-) treasury shares, of which 4,489,777 (-) were Class A shares and 13,786,996 (-) Class B shares. The value of treasury shares amounted to SEK 1,347 (-) million. Transaction costs related to the share buyback program amounted to SEK 1 million in 2023.\n\n## Considerations relating to proposed allocation of profit\n\nThe Board of Directors propose a dividend of SEK 5.00 (8.70) per share for 2023, corresponding to SEK 5,149 (8,960) million, the final amount will be calculated based on the number of outstanding shares after the completion of the share buyback program. The remaining profit to be carried forward to next year. In the Annual General Meeting of 2024, the shareholders can either approve or reject this proposal.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the retained earnings of the Group were SEK 21,993 (19,149) million and the parent company's unrestricted equity was SEK 65,193 (65,603) million. The equity included unrealized gains from financial instruments reported at market value of SEK 59 (184) million. On December 31, 2023, the Group's net cash amounted to SEK 18,206 (14,287) million, resulting in the net debt/equity ratio of -27% (-21%). As the Group's operations are affected by the business cycle, the net debt/equity ratio target is between -20% and 20%. The Group reported a result for the year amounted to SEK 13,038 (-10,877) million, and adjusted result for year of SEK 13,038 (23,062) million. The Group's policy is to distribute 40% of the profit after tax as dividends.\n\nIn 2022, the SSAB Board of Directors made a directional strategic decision to fundamentally transform the Nordic strip production. This is a major step in SSAB's green transition to become the first steel company in the world to offer fossil-free steel on the market, and to high extent remove carbon dioxide emissions from its own operations around 2030. In June 2023, SSAB's Board of Directors made an investment decision for the conversion of Oxel\u00f6sund mill in Sweden, which is an important step in SSAB's transformation to fossil-free steel production. The transformation will involve major investments in the Nordic operations over the next 10 years. In its dividend proposal, the Board of Directors has taken into consideration the future investment needs as well as the solid financial position and net cash of the Group.\n\n## AP     Dividends\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDividends proposed by the Board of Directors do not reduce equity until the Annual General Meeting has approved the resolution regarding the payment of dividend.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhen the parent company or any other Group company purchases company's own shares, the purchase price, including transaction costs, is deducted from the parent company's retained earnings as treasury shares until the shares are cancelled.",

The defined benefit plans cover retirement pension and survivors' pensions.\n\nThe liabilities on pension obligation reported in the statement of financial position relate to the defined benefit plans. The Group's major benefit-based pension plans are Rautaruukki's Finnish pension scheme (A-s\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6), Finnish defined benefit plans and the Norwegian pension scheme (CCB Pensionskasse) but there are also smaller pension plans in Sweden and in USA. The plans are covered by a re-insured provision in the balance sheet and by pension benefit plans and funds.\n\nFor the defined contributions plans, regular payments are made to government and independent institutions, who take over the obligations towards the employees.\n\n## Sweden\n\nBlue collar employees are included in the SAF/LO plan, which is a defined contribution pension plan. White-collar employees are included in the ITP plan. Both plans are based on collective agreements and comprise of several employers from various industries.\n\nThe ITP plan has two parts, the ITP1, a defined contribution pension plan valid for employees born 1979 or later, and the ITP2, a defined contribution pension plan valid for employees born before 1979. The major part of the ITP2 plan is managed by SSAB within the FPG/PRI system. Funding takes place through a provision covered by a credit insurance in F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsbolaget PRI Pension guarantee. Part of the ITP2 plan is covered through an insurance within Alecta. Additionally, SSAB AB has other defined benefit obligations relating to individual pension agreements with earlier employees and senior executives.\n\nSome white-collar employees in Sweden are covered by a defined benefit-based ITP2 plan for age and family pension (alternative family pension) through an insurance by Alecta. According to a statement from Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 10 the ITP plans financed through insurance by Alecta are classified as a defined benefit plans that comprises of several employers. For the financial year 2023 (as well as 2022) the Company did not have access to all information to be able to disclose its proportional share of the pension obligation, the plan assets and the administration costs, and consequently, has not been able to account the plans as a defined benefit plans. The benefit-based\n\nITP2 plan covered through an insurance by Alecta is therefore accounted as a defined contribution plan. The expected fees in 2024 for the ITP2 insurances that are with Alecta amount to SEK 41 million.\n\nThe collective consolidation level of the market value of the assets in Alecta, as a percentage of the insurance obligations, is calculated using the insurance technical methods and assumptions by Alecta, which do not correspond with IAS 19. The collective consolidation level is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 155%. If the collective consolidation level is outside of these thresholds, actions are taken to revert back to the normal interval. At a low consolidation level, an action can be to increase the agreed fees for new take-outs and/or existing benefits. At a high consolidation level, an action can be to reduce premiums. At the end of the year, Alecta's surplus, on a collective consolidation level, was 157% (172%).\n\n## Pension expenses\n\n| SEK millions                                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fees for contribution-based plans                              | 808    | 881    |\n| Fees for pension insurance policies with Alecta                | 139    | 136    |\n| Pension expenses, benefit-based plans                          | 17     | -8     |\n| Special employer's contributions                               | 91     | 85     |\n| Other                                                          | 1      | 1      |\n| Total pension expenses in operating result                     | 1,055  | 1,094  |\n| Net interest expense on benefit-based plans                    | 4      | 5      |\n| Total pension expenses in statement of profit or loss          | 1,060  | 1,099  |\n| Net actuarial (gains)/losses before tax on benefit-based plans | -50    | -105   |\n| Total pension expenses in comprehensive income                 | 1,010  | 994    |\n\n## Net pension obligations in the statement of financial position\n\n| SEK millions                          |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Liabilities from pensions obligations |    343 |    318 |\n| Receivables from pension obligations  |    188 |     97 |\n| Net pension obligations               |    155 |    221 |\n\nPayments to defined benefit plans in 2024 are expected to be SEK 35 million.",

The investment portfolio may also be subject to other risks, such as credit risk on bonds and exposure to the real estate market.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nDefined benefit pension obligations are calculated using a discount rate based on the interest rate on first-class corporate bonds. A decrease in the bond interest rate increases pension obligations, although this is partly offset by an increase in the value of plan assets.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nPension benefits are subject to increases based on inflation and, thus, an increase in inflation.",

These assumptions are used to determine the size and cost of the commitment. The assumptions are proposed by external independent actuaries and approved by the management.\n\nA sensitivity analysis has been done on above actuarial assumptions since changes in them can impact the defined benefit obligation. Analysis has been done by considering a change in each assumption separately, and any relations between the assumptions have not been taken into account. Considering the total amount of the Group's net benefit-based pension obligations, reasonable changes in the assumptions are not expected to result into material change in the Group's net pension obligation.\n\n## AP     Pensions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group has both contribution-based and benefit-based pension plans in place. Generally, the plans are financed through payments to insurance companies or manager-administered funds. For benefit-based plans, the Group bears the risk that the costs for the promised payments will be higher that estimated.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of financial position, the net of the estimated present value of the benefit-based obligations and fair value of the managed assets is reported either as a liability from pension obligations or as a receivable in other non-current assets.\n\nThe ITP2 plan for supplementary pensions for salaried employees is a collective benefit-based plan financed through a purchased pension insurance with the mutual insurance company, Alecta. As no information is available to report this plan as a benefit-based plan, it is reported as contribution-based, and thus premiums paid to Alecta during the year are reported as pension expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In December 2023, the government of Sweden enacted the Pillar II income tax legislation, effective as of December 31, 2023 and applicable for financial years starting as of January 1, 2024. Under the legislation, the Group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its GloBE effective tax rate per jurisdiction and a 15% minimum rate. All entities within the Group had an effective tax rate that exceeds 15% in 2023, except for 10 subsidiaries that operate in Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Saudi-Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.\n\nBased on the figures for 2023, the net results of the entities with an effective tax rate below 15% totaled approximately 6.4% of the Group's net result, of which Ireland accounted for 6.3% with an effective tax rate of 13%. Ireland has announced a change in the statutory tax rate from 12.5% to 15% as of 2024 to comply wit the Pillar II regulations. The current assessment is therefore that the implementation of the Pillar II tax legislation is expected to have minor effects on the Group's total income tax expense and effective tax rate. However, due to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating GloBE income, and to the fact that the rules have yet to be implemented in some other\n\njurisdictions, the quantitative impact of the enacted, or substantively enacted, legislation cannot not yet be properly estimated. Thus, even entities currently having an effective tax rate above 15% might still be impacted by the Pillar II legislation and top-up tax may apply. The Group continues to closely monitor the implementation and effects of the Pillar II rules.",

The company must assess the probability of utilizing the deferred tax receivables to offset future taxable profits. Future changes in taxation legislation and trends in the business environment will impact the Company's future taxable profits and thus the possibility to utilize deferred tax receivables on loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences. A change in the probability assessment of future taxable profits could have either a positive or negative effect on the Group's result for the year. Key assessments and assumptions are also made regarding recognition of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to tax risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AP      Income taxes\n\nThe Group continuously evaluates the claims made in income tax returns regarding situations where applicable tax rules are subject to interpretation and assess whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group values the reported taxes either based on the most probable amount or the expected value depending on which method best predicts the outcome of the uncertainty.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nTemporary differences that give rise to deferred tax receivables and liabilities arise primarily through accelerated depreciation of fixed assets, profits from intra-group inventory transactions, untaxed tax allocation reserves, leasing contracts,  unutilized losses carried forward, as well as fair value adjustments relating to business combinations.\n\nThe Group applies the IAS 12 temporary exception, and does not recognize or disclose information on deferred taxes related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\n## E.2 Acquisitions and divestments\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring 2023, Tibnor acquired 100% of the shares in the Swedish entity St\u00e5lshoppen i \u00d6rebro AB with revenue of SEK 34 million in 2022.

The Group's other contingent liabilities consist mainly of guarantees on liabilities of associated companies for which the Group has individual responsibility as well as unrecognized pension obligations. Other commitments relate mainly to forward contracts for emission rights.\n\n## Conditions not reported as contingent liability\n\nThe Group is involved in a very limited number of legal disputes concerning insurance and warranty matters, as well as complaints. The anticipated outcome of these cases has been taken into consideration in the accounting.\n\nSSAB's fully owned subsidiary SSAB EMEA AB has a 50% holding in Oxel\u00f6sunds Hamn AB. A legal process was underway since 2017 when Swedish Customs had imposed specific purchase taxes and VAT on imports. During 2022 Oxel\u00f6sunds Hamn paid SEK 245 million to Swedish Customs and SSAB EMEA AB compensated the payment to Oxel\u00f6sunds Hamn.",

These differences between the principles applied by the parent company and the Group result from limitations to apply IFRS to the parent company due to the provisions of the Swedish Annual Reports Act and the Swedish Pension Obligations (Security) Act, and also, in certain cases, for tax reasons. In addition, the Swedish Corporate Financial Reporting Board's recommendation RFR 2, Accounting for Legal Entities, has been applied.\n\nAffiliated companies and joint arrangements: In the parent company, affiliated companies and joint ventures are reported in accordance with the acquisition value method.\n\nLeases - lessee: In the parent company, all lease agreements are recognized as a straight-line cost over the lease term.\n\nPensions: The parent company reports benefit-based pension plans in accordance with the local rules.\n\nDividends: An anticipated dividend is reported when the parent company is exclusively entitled to decide on the amount of the dividend and has decided prior to the balance sheet date on the amount of the dividend and ascertained that the dividend will not exceed the dividend capacity of the subsidiary.\n\nGroup contributions: Group contributions received and provided, and the tax consequences thereof, are reported as a transfer to untaxed reserves, and the tax effect as a tax expense/income in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 2.

Financial risk management\n\nFinancial risk management is governed by the Group's Directive of Financial Risk Management, which defines the responsibilities, processes and other principles of financial risk management. The objectives for financial risk management are to reduce volatility in the Group's earning and ensure sufficient liquidity for the Group's operations. Most financial transactions take place through the parent company's treasury function in Stockholm, Sweden and through SSAB Finance Ireland in Ireland. More information on financial risk management can be found in the Board of Directors' Report and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements: in relation to market risks and counterparty risks in note D.3 and in relation to liquidity and refinancing risk in note D.2.\n\nThe parent company may incur credit losses related to its receivables from other Group companies. These receivables are mainly loan receivables that relate to the parent company's role to provide financing to its subsidiaries, and they are analyzed for expected credit losses. Receivables were not impaired due to expected credit losses in 2023 nor in 2022.\n\n## 15.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 92-179 in this document.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2023 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2023 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.\n\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company's audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities as described in the section Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.",

Depreciation is based on the assets cost and estimated useful life. The estimated useful life is largely based on assumptions that significantly affect the reported total value of tangible fixed assets and the size of annual depreciation and write-down costs related to the same.\n\nSSAB is currently in a transition process where they are working to offer fossil-free steel to the market in 2026, and to eliminate its carbon emissions by around the year 2030 by fully transitioning production to fossil-free steel production. A significant part of existing tangible fixed assets will therefore gradually be replaced with new ones suitable for fossil-free steel production. The transition required extensive and regular review as well as assessments regarding useful life in respect of the company's current tangible fixed assets, where management has set milestones (e.g., an investment decision) to revise estimates of the remaining useful life for the assets that will be replaced  by the upcoming investments,  and identify any write-down needs. Factors that influence the assessment of the remaining useful life include, for example, the order in which plants will be converted and the length of various approval processes. Furthermore, SSAB's operations are affected by the global climate risks and climate changes the world is facing, which also increase the uncertainty regarding future events, which in turn could affect useful lives and valuation of current tangible fixed assets.\n\nBased on the above, we have assessed the valuation of tangible fixed assets as a particularly significant area in our audit.\n\nOur audit procedures have amongst other procedures included;\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of the company's process for determining acquisition values, deprecation, write-downs and useful lives.\n- \u00b7 Review of assets acquired during the year and estimated useful lives.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the climate risks impact on asset's estimated useful life and the company's evaluation of the same.\n- \u00b7 Review of the company's assumptions and forecasts for impairment tests.\n- \u00b7 Examination of used discount rate and assumption of long-term growth by comparison with other companies operating in the same industry.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of the valuation and calculation models used, aided by our own internal valuation experts.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Analysis of own sensitivity analyses regarding the company's impairment test.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the reliability of previous years' forecasts by comparing previous years' forecasts to actual outcomes.\n- \u00b7 Audit of the disclosed information in the Group annual report.\n\n## Other Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts\n\nThis document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-91. The remuneration report for financial year 2023 also constitutes other information. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or mistakes.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company's financial reporting process.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or mistakes and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or mistakes, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from mistakes, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of the company's internal control relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's\n\nand the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions.\n\nWe must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit. We must also inform of significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified.\n\nWe must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the company's organization and the administration of the company's affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the\n\nBoard of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect:\n\n- \u00b7 has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or\n- \u00b7 in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\n- \u00b7 As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company's situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors' proposed appropriations of the company's loss we examined whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.",

Our responsibility under this recommendation is described in more detail in the Auditors' responsibility section. We are independent of SSAB AB (publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF report in accordance with Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), and for such internal control that the Board of Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to prepare the ESEF report without material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the ESEF report is in all material respects prepared in a format that meets the requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures performed.\n\nRevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve reasonable assurance that the ESEF report is prepared in a format that meets these requirements.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are\n\nconsidered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the ESEF report.\n\nThe audit firm applies ISQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and other Assurance and Related Services Engagements and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with professional ethical requirements, professional standards and legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe examination involves obtaining evidence, through various procedures, that the ESEF report has been prepared in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error. In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor considers those elements of internal control that are relevant to the preparation of the ESEF report by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls. The examination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n\nThe procedures mainly include validation of that the ESEF report have been established in a valid XHTML-format, and a reconciliation of the ESEF report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nFurthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of whether the ESEF report has been marked with iXBRL which enables a fair and complete machine-readable version of the consolidated statement of financial performance, financial position, changes in equity, cash flow and notes.\n\nErnst & Young AB, Box 7850, 103 99 Stockholm was appointed auditor of SSAB AB (publ) by the general meeting of the shareholders on the 6 April 2022 and has been the company's auditor since the 8 April 2019.\n\nStockholm 5 March, 2024\n\nErnst & Young AB\n\n## Rickard Andersson\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant",
