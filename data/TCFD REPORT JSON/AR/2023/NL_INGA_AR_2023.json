This report also contains consolidated and parent company financial statements, and other information.\n\nING's purpose is empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. In this report we describe how we live up to this purpose and how we created value for our stakeholders over the year.\n\n## Who this report is for\n\nThis report is intended to inform stakeholder groups that have an impact on, or are affected by our business. This includes customers, communities, investors and shareholders, regulators and supervisors, employees, suppliers, government authorities, and non-governmental organisations. It aims to give stakeholders a balanced overview of our activities and ability to create and sustain value.\n\nWe welcome reactions and views, which can be emailed to communication@ing.com. Additional disclosures are available on ing.com.\n\n## Approach to integrated reporting\n\nIn this report we disclose our results, strategy and management approach in the context of external developments, as well as emerging and existing risks and opportunities. Our ambition is to continuously improve our financial and non-financial disclosures and to continue to create a compliant, balanced, transparent and accessible integrated report for stakeholders that supports ING's strategy.\n\nIn this annual report, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, references to 'ING Groep' and 'ING Group' refer to ING Groep N.V. and references to 'ING', the 'Company', the 'Group', 'we' and 'us' refer to ING Groep N.V. and its consolidated subsidiaries. ING Groep N.V.'s primary banking subsidiary is ING Bank N.V. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, 'ING Bank'). References to 'Executive Board' or 'EB', and 'Supervisory Board' or 'SB', refer to the Executive Board or Supervisory Board of ING Groep N.V., respectively. References to 'Management Board Banking' or 'MBB' refer to the management board of ING Bank N.V.\n\nThe last time we published an annual report was on 9 March 2023, covering the year 2022. This report, on the year 2023, was published on 7 March 2024.\n\nING's integrated annual report is compiled with input from business experts, vetted by senior managers, and discussed and approved by members of the MBB and EB. Final approval is given by the SB. The EB is ultimately responsible for the content, accuracy and integrity of the report.\n\n## Report content and materiality\n\nIn compiling this report, we take into account the topics that can have a material impact on our business. As a large financial institution, ING has a direct economic, social and environmental impact, as well as a significant indirect impact through its lending and investment activities. We report on these, and other relevant matters, in our value creation model in the 'ING at a glance' section of this report.\n\nWe continuously listen to stakeholders and adapt the execution of our strategy and reporting to meet evolving expectations. For materiality analyses, we consult stakeholder groups in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Please refer to 'Stakeholder engagement' in 'The world around us'. The results of these materiality analyses, including materiality disclosures, were used to define content for this report, which has been reviewed and approved by the EB.\n\n## Reporting guidelines\n\nThis report is prepared in accordance with Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standard, the Dutch Accounting Standard 400 and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). The content and quality criteria specified by these standards, including sustainability context, stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, completeness, balance, comparability, clarity, timeliness, accuracy and reliability, are integral to our reporting process.\n\nThe GRI's Universal Standards represent the most significant update since the GRI transitioned from providing guidance to setting standards in 2016. These standards provide requirements for reporting on each identified material topic. The Global Reporting Initiative table, including additional explanations on some material topics, is not included in the annual report itself, but in a separate annex to the annual report on ing.com.\n\nThis report is aligned with the UN Principles for Responsible Banking (UN PRB), a global sustainable banking framework. The UN PRB reporting and self-assessment template is a tool used by financial institutions to evaluate their alignment with the Principles. The UN PRB self-assessment is not included in the annual report itself, but in a separate annex to the annual report on ing.com.",

        "page_content": "- > About this report\n\nThe International Integrated Reporting Framework serves as a reference in compiling this report, including our value creation model.\n\nFurthermore, the consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant articles of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The company financial statements of ING Groep N.V. are prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Scope and boundaries\n\nThe report covers the period 1 January to 31 December 2023. Data and content in this report aims to provide an accurate and balanced account of ING's economic, social and environmental performance. The scope and boundaries for each material topic and metrics are detailed either in text where the topic is introduced, or by references to ing.com.\n\n## Assurance\n\nAssurance for the non-financial information in the Report of the Executive Board, is provided by KPMG Accountants N.V. (KPMG). For the year ended 31 December 2023, KPMG has reviewed and provided a limited level of assurance on the non-financial information in the Report of the Executive Board (including GRI and UN PRB). In previous years, KPMG audited and provided a reasonable level of assurance, on the GRI materiality assessment, data for the Net Promoter Score for Retail Banking and on Channel Availability. In light of the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), effective as of 2024 and for which the regulatory required assurance level is limited, the level of assurance has been aligned and set to limited for all non-financial information.\n\nThe financial statements, which include the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements, are subject to reasonable assurance. For the year ended 31 December 2023, KPMG has audited the ING's consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and BW2 title 9 and ING's company financial statements in accordance with BW2 title 9.\n\n## Creating value\n\nThere are many ways we can create value for stakeholders. Customers entrust us with their money and expect us to meet their needs. We enable them to do so by offering loans and other financial products and services. By doing this in a profitable way, we maintain adequate capital levels and create financial capital that we invest and distribute to shareholders. We aim to develop human capital by offering learning and development opportunities to employees, equipping them with skills and capabilities for the future. At the\n\nsame time, our actions may involve risks for our stakeholders. We are aware of this and take mitigating actions, where possible.\n\nOur 'value creation model' shows how our strategy enables value to flow through our business and how we use different types of input to create long-term value for stakeholders. This also includes the impact that we have on society and our planet, which we link to four UN Sustainable Development Goals: 8) decent work and economic growth, 10) reduced inequalities, 12) responsible consumption and production, and 13) climate action.",

Our biggest contribution to our stakeholders is made by fulfilling our function as a bank. We process payments, keep customers' money and their data safe, extend loans, make investments and provide other financial services to customers.\n\nThere are many ways we can create value for stakeholders. Customers entrust us with their money and expect us to meet their needs. We enable them to do so by offering loans and other financial products and services. By doing this in a profitable way, we can maintain adequate capital levels, invest in our business and distribute cash to our shareholders. We aim to develop human capital by offering learning and development opportunities to employees, equipping them with skills and capabilities for the future. At the same time, our actions may involve risks for our stakeholders. We are aware of this and take mitigating actions, where possible.\n\nOur approach is inclusive and collaborative, working with others to make a bigger impact. We believe that no single sector, much less one bank, can solve global issues like climate change, or financial crime. When it comes to tackling challenges like these, we are dependent on collective action for real, positive change. By working together with governments and other businesses, banks can help develop sustainable ways to deal with economic challenges, tackle climate change and protect customers, the bank and the financial system against financial economic crime.\n\nThe value creation model shows how our strategy enables value to flow through our business and how we use different types of input to create long-term value for stakeholders. This also includes the impact that we generate for society and our planet, which we link to four UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 8) decent work and economic growth, 10) reduced inequalities, 12) responsible consumption and production, and 13) climate action.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, ING aims to offer a sustainable and attractive return to shareholders.\n\nING's distribution policy is a pay-out ratio of 50% of resilient net profit. Resilient net profit is defined as net profit adjusted for significant items not linked to the normal course of business. The 50% pay-out may be in the form of cash, or a combination of cash and share repurchases, with the majority in cash. Additional distributions are considered periodically, taking into account alternative opportunities, macro-economic circumstances and the outcome of our capital planning.\n\nResilient net profit was \u20ac7,520 million in 2023, of which \u20ac3,760 million has been reserved for distribution. In line with the definition of resilient net profit, the impact of applying IAS 29 hyperinflation accounting to the consolidation of ING's subsidiary in T\u00fcrkiye has been excluded. Therefore, resilient net profit is \u20ac234 million higher than net profit.\n\nAn interim dividend over 2023 of \u20ac0.35 per ordinary share was paid in cash on 14 August 2023. Following ING's distribution policy of a 50% pay-out ratio on resilient net profit, the Executive Board has proposed a final dividend over 2023 of \u20ac0.756 per ordinary share, to be paid in cash on 3 May 2024. This is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in April 2024.",

This target level is above ING's fully loaded CET1 ratio requirement of 10.76% as per the end of 2023 and implies a management buffer of around 175 basis points. ING aims to converge its CET1 ratio towards its target of around 12.5% by the end of 2025. In line with this plan and ING's distribution policy, the following additional distributions have been conducted in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 On 16 January 2023, an additional distribution was paid to shareholders in cash, amounting to \u20ac297 million or \u20ac0.082 per ordinary share. The payment was part of a \u20ac1.5 billion programme to distribute capital to shareholders and followed a share buyback programme under which 107,032,745 ordinary shares were repurchased in 2022 for a total consideration of \u20ac1.2 billion.\n- \u00b7 On 2 March 2023, ING completed a share buyback programme for a maximum total amount of \u20ac50 million, under which 3,155,748 ordinary shares were repurchased. The purpose of the share repurchase programme was to meet obligations under the share-based compensation plans.\n- \u00b7 On 13 October 2023, ING completed a \u20ac1.5 billion share buyback programme that started on 12 May 2023, under which 121,317,501 ordinary shares were repurchased.

It is fair to say that it was a challenging year on many counts: geopolitical and economic shocks, supply-chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, climate-related and other natural disasters, wars, and the continuing trend of societal and political fragmentation across the globe. Against this backdrop, we are proud that we were able to navigate these conditions successfully, make good progress on our strategy, and deliver a set of strong financial results.\n\nWe believe the numbers speak for themselves. We have benefited from the rapidly rising interest rates, which provided a welcome change after many years of headwinds from negative rates. We believe our performance is a testimony to the strength and resilience of our universal banking model and client focus. Needless to say, it is the hard work and dedication of our colleagues, serving customers in over 40 countries, that has made this possible.\n\nOur continued success will depend on our ability to adequately serve our clients in the societies we operate in. We want to strengthen our position as a leading European universal bank, based on our strategic priorities of providing a superior customer experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do. Our efforts are underpinned by our focus on providing seamless digital services, using scalable technology and operations, staying safe and secure, and unlocking our people's full potential.\n\nAs a bank, we play an important role for the customers we serve and for the economies and societies we operate in. We drive economic progress and prosperity by absorbing risks, facilitating investments, savings, and payments, by keeping the financial system secure, and people's money and data safe. We also have an important role to play in the green transition.\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges we face, which can become an existential threat to the societies we operate in, and therefore to our business model and our collective well-being. We believe that we can and do play an important role in the transition to a more sustainable world. In 2023, we further sharpened a number of policies, including on the gradual phasing out of financing upstream oil and gas activities towards 2040, and on restricting financing of mining and use of coal for steel making. We worked with industry experts and others to create a financing framework for the aluminium industry, in line with earlier established standards for steel and shipping. In addition, we are committed to tripling our financing of renewable energy to \u20ac7.5 billion per annum by 2025, up from our target set in 2022 of \u20ac2.5 billion. In Retail Banking, our focus was predominantly on the transformational aspects of energy usage in our mortgage portfolios, and in the investment products we offer.",

Our approach is fundamentally driven by data and science, and we will continue to adapt our financing policies accordingly. Given the magnitude of the challenge, we believe that sustainable change can only be achieved through collaboration between public and private institutions. We need all parties to make the necessary impact. We have engaged with - and will continue to intensify our engagement with - clients, industries, experts, scientists, politicians, governments, and regulators to formulate, amend, and enact policy changes. We also urge all our stakeholders to do their bit in this important transformational journey it is about our common destiny.\n\nTechnology in the broadest sense is an essential enabler for the delivery of services and products to our clients, and the related customer experience, and a backbone of our efficiency drive. Therefore, we will continue to invest in IT, data, and digitisation in the coming years. We realise there is uncertainty about the protection and usage of data. We are also aware of our obligations when it comes to data and usage of artificial intelligence. We have taken and will continue to take the necessary measures to fulfil that moral and societal obligation.\n\nWith respect to our business model, we have made significant progress in recent years, focusing our Retail and Wholesale Banking franchises. In Retail, this has meant building on our unique digital proposition with a human touch, and in Wholesale Banking, a technology-enhanced focus on our corporate and financial institutional clients. For some time now, we have also been working on diversifying our revenue streams. One avenue we will explore is further developing a wealth-management stream. In a changing and uncertain world, wealth management is no longer the preserve of a few but a necessity for all. We believe we have all the necessary ingredients embedded in our Retail and Business Banking franchise to successfully execute a wealth-management strategy.\n\nWe are acutely aware of our societal obligations and the role that financial institutions are expected to play. We can only do that successfully in a stable economic and political environment. As a European bank, we have long subscribed to the idea of Europe and its importance in the context of economic and social stability and growth. Central to that idea of growth, and economic and social inclusion, are the Banking and Capital Markets unions. We will continue to engage with all stakeholders on this subject. These are not just nice-tohave propositions but essential building blocks to the prospect of a strong Europe, anchored in her core values, and able to take on the challenges of a polarised world.\n\nIn conclusion, we expect 2024 to have continuing political and economic challenges. We are confident we have all the necessary capabilities and tools on hand to manage the challenges whatever they may be, and to continue to deliver value to our clients as well as healthy returns, building on our strong and growing customer base and good underlying performance. We are aware of our responsibilities and obligations to all our stakeholders, and we will do all that is humanly possible to fulfil that expectation. We thank you in advance for your support.\n\n## Steven van Rijswijk\n\nChief executive officer\n\n## Karl Guha\n\nChairman",

        "page_content": "- > The world around us\n\n## The world around us\n\nOur business is closely shaped by what's happening in the world around us, from economic and political developments to the changing regulatory environment, global trends and societal issues.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nING's stakeholders are persons or organisations that may be directly or indirectly affected by our activities, or who may have an impact on our activities or ability to provide products and services. Banks operate in a heavily regulated environment. It is therefore key that we anticipate and understand the impact of legislative and regulatory developments and assess their impact on our customers and business. New laws and regulations should contribute to financial stability, sustain a competitive environment and enable us to provide excellent quality services to our customers and to society as a whole. That's why we participate in the debate on the direction of public policy and regulatory developments in the European Union and the countries where ING is active. We analyse proposed legislation to assess its potential impact.\n\nWe regularly engage with customers, investors, policymakers - banking regulators, supervisors, officials and politicians - as well as NGOs, industry associations, think tanks, academics and other members of society. When determining ING's position, we weigh the interests of ING and all the stakeholders involved and seek to strike the right balance between possibly conflicting viewpoints.\n\nNext to having one-off consultations on specific topics, we engage in ongoing dialogues about our role in society, our products and services, our business performance and other topics. This is done at both expert level within our business units and at senior management and Board level.\n\nEngaging with stakeholders also clarifies our approach to sustainability. Under the section 'How we engage' on ing.com, we explain how we do it, including collaborating, listening and by being transparent.\n\nWe contribute to various international initiatives such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. ING is a member of platforms such as the\n\nEquator Principles Association and we use international frameworks such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to develop our sustainability approach and priorities.\n\nAn overview of partnerships, memberships and endorsements is available at ing.com.\n\nAn ongoing dialogue with stakeholders can help to drive internal change at ING, including by enhancing our environmental and social risk management policy and improving awareness of the wider impact of our business conduct. Equally, ING can drive change by sharing subject-matter expertise with external working groups and think tanks such as the RMI Center for Climate-Aligned Finance.\n\n## Understanding what matters most\n\nTo help us understand the most significant impacts on the economy, environment, people, including impacts on human rights, which are most important for ING, a materiality assessment is carried out among internal and external stakeholders. It is conducted in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines. It follows a three-year cycle that consists of an extensive materiality assessment followed by two light annual updates. An extensive analysis took place in 2023. The process examined relevant internal ING documentation and sought in-depth analysis on peers, industry trends and regulation. We've incorporated the views of stakeholder groups in the impact assessment. The outcome of this process has resulted in the determination of material topics that ING reports on. These topics were approved by ING's Executive Board.",

        "page_content": "- > The world around us\n\n## Our operating environment .\n\nGeopolitical and economic events not only have a significant impact on customers and individuals, but also on financial institutions like ING.\n\nThe global economy was lacklustre in 2023. A buoyant reopening phase, which drove GDP growth to well above pre-pandemic levels, was followed by a weaker spell driven by higher inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and a disappointing Chinese economy. Europe, being an open economy, suffered from this weak global environment and the simmering impact of the energy crisis on industry, resulting in stagnant economic activity.\n\nHowever, inflation came down significantly in advanced economies, in part driven by lower energy prices, a fading of supply-chain problems, and of course higher interest rates.\n\nChina had a weak 2023 due to underwhelming household consumption upon reopening of the economy, continued problems in the real estate sector (which is still dealing with a debt overhang), and slowed demand for production from advanced markets. The latter put pressure on industrial production and exports.\n\nThe United States has been the positive exception, with resilient 2023 GDP growth. The US economy was supported by continued high government spending, but also by consumers running down excess savings. This, in turn, kept the job market roaring, which supported income. The effect of higher interest rates started to show but did not curb economic activity too much. This drove the Fed funds rate to five-and-a half percent and while a recession was expected, it did not materialise.\n\nThe US economy continued to perform well despite significant financial stress in the first half of the year. The failure of several smaller American banks caused instability and forced governments and central banks to take action. Eurozone banks were not significantly affected, but the industry did experience a degree of financial stress. In Switzerland, this financial distress contributed to the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS. Overall, monetary tightening had a significant effect on borrowing and deposit growth, but did not result in a major downturn in activity in advanced markets.\n\nThe performance of the eurozone economy in 2023 was stagnant. Germany underperformed the eurozone average due to a larger share of energy-intensive industries, which continued to suffer from higher energy prices (despite a decline from 2022 peaks) and overall competitiveness problems. Eurozone consumers struggled with the loss of purchasing power, with household consumption remaining below its late-2022 peak throughout the year.\n\nHowever, the labour market remained strong in the eurozone and bankruptcies have not meaningfully increased. The inflation rate also fell substantially, which caused the European Central Bank (ECB) to pause interest-rate rises after raising the deposit rate to a record high of four percent.\n\nIn general, 2023 saw a smaller impact on the economy from geopolitical events than 2022. While global risks did not abate, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war had a more muted effect on advanced markets as energy prices remained much more subdued and the Israel-Gaza conflict did not result in significant spillovers to the global economy. Still, the effect on the eurozone was larger than in other major markets, resulting in a weaker economic performance than peers like the US.",

Our strategy - making the difference for people and the planet - is built around this purpose.\n\nIn a world that is constantly changing, we aim to be digital and sustainability pioneers, skilled at adapting to the trends impacting our business. Our two overarching priorities are providing customers with a superior customer experience (CX) and aiming to put sustainability at the heart of what we do. These priorities are supported by four 'enablers': providing seamless digital services, using our scalable technology and operations, staying safe and secure, and unlocking our people's full potential.\n\n## Providing customers with a superior experience\n\nAs an organisation, we need to be customer focused - after all, customers are who we're here for, our reason for being. We want to provide them with the products and services they need: executing payments and other transactions, keeping and managing their money and savings and extending loans and making investments. Our aim is to do all that with an experience that is easy, instant, personal and relevant. We realise that different types of customers have different needs. We can make a difference by helping them to plan for the future and make informed financial decisions, and by providing suitable financial products and customised advice. Read more on how we cater to our customers' needs, private individuals, small businesses and large corporates in 'Superior customer experience'.\n\n## Putting sustainability at the heart of what we do\n\nWe have a role in society to define new ways of doing business that align with economic changes, growth and social impact. Climate change is one of the world's biggest challenges, threatening societies as we know them today. We're determined to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for customers, society and the environment. We want to lead by example by striving for net zero in our own operations. We also want to play our part in the low-carbon transformation that's necessary to achieve a sustainable future, aiming to steer our financing towards meeting global climate goals and working with clients to achieve their own sustainability goals. Read more on our sustainability efforts in the 'ESG overview'.\n\n## Our enablers\n\n## Providing seamless digital services\n\nWe know that we can serve our customers better if we use robust, 'always-on' channels, providing dataenabled personalised experiences and end-to-end digitalising processes, with human intervention only where needed or desired.\n\n## Using scalable technology and operations\n\nA technology and operations foundation that is modular and scalable brings many benefits, including support for providing a superior customer experience, increased safety, speeding up time-to-volume, shortening time-to-market, and lowering cost-to-serve.\n\n## Staying safe and secure\n\nFor a bank, trust is the starting point, the most basic requirement for all stakeholders. People trust us with their money and with their data, and keeping that safe is crucial. As a gatekeeper to the financial system, we play an important role in the collective fight against fraud, cybercrime, and financial and economic crimes.\n\n## Unlocking our people's full potential\n\nPeople are our greatest asset. We seek to attract, develop and retain the best people, and our sustained success is founded on their continued commitment. What will unlock their full potential is our inclusive Orange culture where everyone has the opportunity to develop and have impact for our customers and society. In 2023, we focused on three pillars to deliver for our people: 'talent & leadership', 'culture & organisation' and 'Employee Experience'.

What this looks like depends on the type of customer. For private individuals and small businesses, our emphasis is predominantly on mobile banking, while for mid-corporate and Wholesale Banking clients it's all about personal relationships and sector and network expertise.\n\n## What we strive for\n\nIn response to changing expectations in today's always-on digital society, ING wants to offer customers an experience that is easy, instant, personal and relevant.\n\nEasy is about taking the complexity out of banking, making it intuitive, transparent and understandable so customers feel confident. For example, we aim to clearly price products and services, avoid complicated jargon and always be accessible.\n\nInstant is about customers having solutions at their fingertips that put them in the driver's seat of their finances and make them feel in control by allowing them, for instance, to switch seamlessly between selfservice banking on the app and personal advice in a branch. Different groups of customers have different requirements. For private individuals and some Business Banking clients (i.e. the self-employed and small and medium-sized enterprises), the emphasis is on mobile, for both products and services.\n\nPersonal is about recognising customers as individuals and getting to know their needs, goals and challenges so they feel valued. For example, to tailor messaging to their specific situation.\n\nRelevant is about bringing value to customers, anticipating their needs, and proactively providing the right insights, advice and solutions at the right time, making them feel empowered. For example, by guiding them on important financial decisions, such as re-financing a mortgage in an environment of rapidly increasing interest rates.\n\nFor Business Banking mid-corporates and Wholesale Banking clients, the emphasis remains on deepening client relationships, offering deep sector knowledge and networking expertise, tailored products and advice, supported by seamless digital delivery and services.\n\n## Retail Banking - Private Individuals\n\nFor customers using Retail Banking products and services, ING intends to provide a seamless digital, mobileled experience that's easy, instant, personal and relevant. We want to engage with our customers on mobile at every stage of their journey and give them personalised products and services based on relevant, datadriven insights. Seamless end-to-end digital delivery of customer services is an enabler for a superior customer experience to earn, and keep, the primary relationship.\n\nEarning 'primary relationships' with customers is an important driver for profitable growth. It leads to deeper relationships, greater customer satisfaction, and ultimately customers choosing us for more of their banking needs. We want to be our customers' first partner for their financial business. In Retail Banking, primary customers have at least two active ING products. One of these should be a current account into which they deposit regular income. In 2023, the number of primary customers increased by 750,000 over the course of a year to 15.3 million. Particularly strong growth was achieved in Germany (+252,000), Spain (+129,000), and the Netherlands (+99,000).\n\n## A seamless digital, mobile-led experience\n\nReflecting customer demand, we are continuously improving our mobile capabilities. In 2023, over 62 percent of customers used mobile banking only (mobile device login through the app or mobile device login through the website), compared to 58 percent in 2022. High adoption of mobile banking is especially visible in T\u00fcrkiye (90 percent), Romania (84 percent), the Netherlands (69 percent), and Spain (66 percent).\n\nIn the Netherlands, Australia, Germany, and Spain, over 60 percent of new customers are now fully digitally onboarded, due to continuous improvements in the mobile onboarding flow. Those improvements aim to make digital onboarding available to as many new customers as possible. Similar efforts are underway in other Retail countries.\n\nMore customers are using remote video advice and digital self-service channels. We can connect with customers across multiple channels through ING's cloud-based customer interaction platform for phone, chat and video contacts. Our global customer interaction platform is used across seven Retail countries and in Wholesale Banking to harmonise the experience and ensure customers receive the same services everywhere. This year, we continued to expand the platform's footprint, rolling out voice functionality in Germany and Romania, and chat/chatbot capabilities in Italy. In total, the platform facilitated more than 100,000 video meetings and over 1.8 million authenticated chat conversations in 2023.",

It works by rounding up every transaction on a customer's current account and automatically transferring the difference to their savings account. In Spain, we also connected Everyday Roundup to investment products to help customers who want to start investing, little by little.\n\nIn March, ING in Australia introduced Everyday Roundup to Charity, becoming the first Australian bank to launch a charitable round-up feature. This enables customers to round up eligible everyday card transactions to the nearest dollar or five dollars and donate the difference to a charity.\n\nING in Germany expanded its current account to include a sustainable option. Customers of the so-called 'Future current account' pay one additional euro per month, and can choose between various social and ecological projects that are selected in partnership with the social impact company share\u00ae. These projects are supported by the amount equal to the monthly payment made by the customer. Additionally, a sustainable use of deposits is earmarked to sustainability criteria defined by ING Germany. These take the UN principles for responsible banking into account and are aligned with the EU taxonomy. By the end of 2023, 21,000 'Future current accounts' were opened, resulting in more than \u20ac90 million in sustainable deposits that are matched with sustainable loans and investments.\n\nDealwise, a smart shopping platform available in the app in Romania, Germany and Belgium, offers personalised deals, supporting customers to save on their daily spending.\n\n## Mortgage products\n\nIn Belgium, we launched the HomeHub functionality - a new online journey that takes the customer through the mortgage application process in just four steps, including a conditional approval. A customer can now simulate this process using the Quick & Easy Simulator, as well as make an appointment using the recently launched Call me back flow. Customers can get an overview of required documents and check the status of their application via the HomeHub.\n\nIn the Netherlands, orientating customers who have made an appointment via mobile app or web can now digitally prepare for their appointment by uploading documents based on a personalised document list.\n\nIn Belgium and Romania, digitalising partial repayments simplified this process for customers, enabling them to make changes online to reduce a monthly charge and/or reduce the duration of a loan. This gives our clients more control of their financing without hassle. In Belgium, these digitalisation efforts led to over 98 percent of early repayment requests being processed automatically or with minimal manual effort (only\n\none simple check by the employee). In Romania, customers who visit an ING office monthly to make an early repayment with loan duration reduction can now make the same changes online.\n\nING in Poland introduced a fully digital process for customers that apply for a change to their mortgage agreement. In the second half of 2023, almost all customers (>99 percent) conducted the change of the mortgage tenor online. Additionally, since the fourth quarter of 2023, customers in Poland can also change their repayment account and/or repayment date online.\n\n## Investment products\n\nING customers have access to smart digital investment tools to make investing accessible. Leveraging the Dutch investment platform, entry products Easy Invest and Self Invest are now also available in Belgium. Easy Invest is the most basic product for clients with no experience of investing independently. It consists of an online risk assessment that helps clients choose the risk level they can tolerate when starting to invest in one of ING's mutual funds. Self-Invest is ING's online brokerage platform offering a wide selection of international equities for clients to invest in directly by themselves.\n\nIn Germany, our self-execution investment tool is serving more than two million clients. Additionally, our clients in Germany can make use of our robo-adviser, offered in partnership with online wealth manager Scalable Capital.\n\n## Insurance products\n\nING works together with several insurance partners in various markets to offer our customers compelling insurance products, based on local customer needs. We offer insurance related to bank products as well as a range of standalone non-life insurance policies. We enhanced our insurance proposition in 2023, for example, by launching car insurance in Spain, improving our home, car, health and travel insurance in the Netherlands, and adding pet insurance to our product offering in T\u00fcrkiye.",

Private markets' importance in the economy is increasing worldwide, and adding our services fits in with ING Private Banking's ambition to serve customers even better with innovative investment solutions.\n\nIn Belgium, we introduced a new concept of family business events. Over 12 events, 600 family business owners were invited to exchange views on the transition of a family business to the next generation. Our customers appreciated these events, combining both the business and private wealth needs.\n\n## Retail Banking - Business Banking\n\nThe Business Banking segment covers the following three sub-segments:\n\nSelf-employed and micro companies: Independent professionals or small companies that employ up to 10 people and have a turnover up to one million euros.\n\nSMEs: Small to medium-sized companies that employ between 10 and 250 people and have a turnover of between one and 10 million euros.\n\nMid-corporates: Sophisticated larger companies employing more than 250 employees with a turnover of between 10 million and 250 million euros.\n\nBusiness Banking serves customers in seven markets: the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, T\u00fcrkiye and Germany. Our customers are focused on managing and growing their businesses profitably in an ever-changing and increasingly complex environment. Our goal is to support them through relevant, seamless, trusted and personal financial solutions in key moments.\n\nWe apply a needs-based customer segmentation approach that differentiates between basic, and more complex and/or specific needs. This enables customers to 'self-serve' using our strong digital foundation but also access remote and face-to-face advice, when needed.\n\nWe are therefore advancing our digitalisation roadmap to create a seamless customer experience by digitalising key customer journeys: from onboarding to customer in life, and from lending solutions to daily banking and payments. We have placed emphasis on critical customer journeys, including digital onboarding in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, and T\u00fcrkiye. Furthermore, we offer instant and fast-track lending solutions in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Romania, and T\u00fcrkiye to cater to our customers' lending requirements. These solutions have significantly enhanced our end-to-end digital rates for lead-tocash and customer-acquisition journeys.\n\nFor more complex and specific needs, especially for bigger SMEs and mid-corporates, we offer customised relationship banking. This not only covers tailored solutions and advice, but also sector expertise and access to ING's international network.\n\n## Customer Experience (CX) day\n\nAs part of ING's focus on continuous improvement of the customer journey, we hold an annual customer experience (CX) day. On 28 September, ING held its fourth global CX day where over 8,000 colleagues from across the bank, together with customers, put their collective minds together to come up with tangible ideas to delight our customers and make their experiences easy, instant, personal and relevant. The event attracted employees from Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking, ING Hubs, and support functions all around the world. Together, they identified over 400 improvements to delight our customers, some of which were created and tested on the day.\n\n## Measuring NPS\n\nOne of the ways we measure our ability to deliver a superior customer experience is through the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS indicates whether customers would recommend ING to others. We compare our NPS to selected peers in each market.\n\nOur ambition is to achieve a number one NPS ranking in all 10 of our Retail markets. In 2023, ING ranked number one in five of our 10 Retail markets: Australia, Poland, Germany, Romania and Spain. ING ranks in the top three in another four markets: the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy and Belgium (all ranked third). In Australia, Belgium and Italy, ING's NPS improved versus last year, while Germany, Romania and Spain maintained their strong NPS.",

        "page_content": "- > Superior customer experience\n\nWe ran a separate NPS programme in 32 Wholesale Banking markets throughout 2023, to ensure a broad coverage of our client base. ING's relationship NPS score rose to an all-time high of 72 (on a scale of -100 to +100), compared to last year's score of 67. All regions showed an increase in NPS and response rate, with the latter rising from 71 percent to 76 percent overall. The number of detractors decreased from 54 to 33. The NPS result aids our efforts to continuously improve our customer service and product offering. For how the NPS score is calculated, see the 'ESG appendix'.\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\nING's ambition is to provide corporate clients and financial institutions with the financial solutions they need across their value chains. Underpinning our work is the 'ING difference', three major characteristics that offer value to clients:\n\n- 1. Our global reach, with local experts: no matter where clients are, our network of experts offers them a seamless local experience with a global view.\n- 2. We're sector experts: clients trust us to provide tailored solutions to meet their needs.\n- 3. We're sustainability pioneers: we're not just leaders in sustainable finance; we work hand-in-hand with clients to address some of the most pressing issues in the world today.\n\nING's Wholesale Banking business line network covers three regions: EMEA, APAC and the Americas. To bring our local experts closer to clients, we focused on hiring more talent for client-facing teams in 2023 - such as for our trade and commodity finance team in Switzerland, our sustainable finance team in Asia, and our investment banking team in the Netherlands.\n\nWholesale Banking clients benefit from our deep sector knowledge of over seven sectors and 29 sub-sectors, including: commodities, food and agriculture; corporate sector coverage; energy; infrastructure and real estate; financial institutions; technology, media, telecom and healthcare; transport and logistics. Together with our target sector research capabilities and our client segmentation model, we aim to help clients navigate the highs and lows of economic cycles, providing them with relevant advice, data-driven insights and customised, integrated solutions that support their business ambitions.\n\nAs a large wholesale bank, with billions of euros flowing through our balance sheet, ING aims to play an important role in accelerating our clients' transitions to net zero by 2050. In addition to the financial support and incentives we provide, we help and advise clients by putting our sector expertise, international network, climate-action experience and other sustainability-related insights to work for them. This includes our Terra approach, which uses science-based and sector-agreed pathways for getting our in-scope sector portfolios in sync with reaching net zero by 2050, and guides us in making business decisions that aim to accelerate the transition. To better assess the climate performance of our clients and use these insights to identify risks and opportunities for supporting them in their transitions, we have developed a bespoke 'client transition\n\nplan' tool. This online platform is where we have started to centrally collect, assess and monitor the publicly disclosed climate transition plans of each client. For more information on Terra and the client transition tool, see 'Environment'.\n\nOur support comes in the form of financing too. In 2023, we saw \u20ac115 billion of volume mobilised and closed 792 sustainability transactions. One example is the green loan provided by ING as sole bank for the implementation of RetuRO Sistem Garantie Returnare, an important circular-economy project in Romania. The loan will finance the set-up of regional centres, which will aim to collect, sort and prepare more than six billion returned plastic, glass and metal beverage packages for recycling each year.\n\nIn 2023, ING won the Euromoney Award for Best Bank for ESG in Germany, as well as five awards at the Global Finance Magazine Sustainable Finance Awards. These included the global award for Outstanding Leadership in Sustainable Bonds for the third year running, three regional awards in Western Europe for Outstanding Leadership in Sustainable Finance, Sustainable Bonds and ESG-related Loans respectively, and a country award for Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in the Netherlands. Our client segmentation model aligns our strengths with client needs and plays an important role in deepening relationships. ING's way of working allows us to respond rapidly to our clients' changing needs, and to close the gap between local and global specialists, making an impact in our markets.\n\n## Strengthening our foundations\n\nAs part of our efforts to strengthen our product foundations, we continued to develop our proprietary platform, InsideBusiness, in 2023. This included setting up alerts for payments, improving user verification to comply with local anti-money laundering regulation, and making it easier to download lending notices, among other updates. Additionally, we rolled out real-time instant payments in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Portugal, and digitalised the account-opening journey in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.\n\nTo further streamline and simplify the infrastructure in our Financial Markets business, we continued to enhance our digital ecosystem in 2023, from introducing new process automation, APIs and algorithms across sales and e-trading to providing better pricing, greater stability, and more insights.\n\nFollowing the creation of our dedicated Payment & Settlements Services (PSS) organisation in 2022, we continued to implement strategic change within Transaction Services in 2023 by laying the groundwork for a new structure that took effect on 1 January 2024. This includes a separation of commercial product management activities from delivery activities, enabling us to evolve our product offering to deliver competitive and seamless digital solutions for clients at pace, amid a rapidly changing macroeconomic environment.",

We want to be the strategic partner for our clients in transformational moments in the boardroom and also accelerate our capital velocity deliverables. Under CMA, we're upgrading and refocusing our commercial engine, including selective senior hires, to ensure we have the right capabilities to support our clients throughout their lifecycle.\n\n## Finding new ways to help customers stay a step ahead\n\nING is proud of its innovative culture and considers this an important contributor to a superior customer experience. To keep surprising customers in a fast-moving competitive environment, we need to keep finding fresh ways to translate emerging trends and technologies into new business opportunities. Therefore we also experiment with new and emerging technology (e.g. digital assets, generative AI), translating it into bite-sized use cases, with central oversight.\n\nFor incremental-type innovations that support our strategic priorities of CX and sustainability, such as digitalising processes, we believe this is best done within individual business lines (Retail, Business Banking, and Wholesale Banking) where we are closer to the customer.\n\nBlacksmith was established in 2017, as part of ING Labs Singapore, and offers a single platform to digitalise and automatically apply policy requirements to KYC processes. It also delivers standardised and actionable customer due diligence (CDD) files. In 2023, Blacksmith reduced ING's time spent on desk research as part of the CDD process by 48 percent. This removed a lot of the manual work for analysts, who must typically collect data and analyse how its attributes are risk rated according to ING policies. Blacksmith also onboarded Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) to digitalise the KYC processes for financial institutions.\n\nAlso in 2023, ING sold Invisible Tickets, a next-gen ticketing and payment solution that allows commuters to pay for the cost of travel using their mobile phone, to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is part of India's largest multinational group. TCS will be taking the Invisible Tickets solution to the next level by introducing it to railway and public transport operators around the globe.\n\nXLINQ is an enterprise software development and SaaS platform with a unique technology to generate secure and compliant software automatically from business knowledge captured. ING Labs served as an incubator for XLINQ, which spun out of ING in June 2023. ING retains a warrant to become a minority shareholder and is a client of XLINQ in several ING countries. XLINQ has two big corporate clients in the financial services and energy sectors that use its platform to develop reliable software faster with lower costs.",

This also means helping customers and society to stay a step ahead of the challenges they're facing. Climate change is one of the world's greatest challenges. Also, people may struggle with inequality, poor financial health, or a lack of basic human rights. There's a growing sense of urgency and rising expectations that governments and businesses must help tackle these challenges.\n\nING aims to put sustainability at the heart of what we do, defining new ways of doing business that align economic growth with positive environmental and social impact.\n\nOur priorities are as follows:\n\nClimate action: This is our main focus. We want to lead by example by striving for net zero in our own operations. We aim to play our part in the low-carbon transformation that is necessary to achieve a sustainable future, steering the most carbon-intensive parts of our lending portfolio towards reaching net zero by 2050. Read more on ING's climate action in 'Environment'.\n\nCollaboration: We work with clients to achieve their own sustainability goals, increasing our impact through partnerships and coalition-building. Read more in 'ESG overview'.\n\nClimate-related, environmental and social risk: We manage the most relevant environmental and social risks. We also contribute to positive change by supporting clients that seek continuous improvement in environmental and social practices. Read more in 'Environment'.\n\nFinancial health and inclusion: We're working to advance financial health and inclusion for customers and communities. Read more in 'Social'.\n\nEmpowering colleagues: We empower colleagues to contribute to it all, for example by providing them with the right knowledge and training. Read more in 'Social'.\n\nING's sustainability efforts have been recognised externally by environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating agencies and other benchmarks. In 2023, Sustainalytics assessed our management of ESG material risk as 'strong'. Also in 2023, investment research firm MSCI awarded ING an AA ESG rating for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nAs society transitions to a low-carbon economy, so do our clients, and so does ING. The low-carbon transition cannot happen overnight. Even though we finance a lot of sustainable activities, we still finance more that's not, which is a reflection of the current global economy and how far the world still needs to go. Our approach follows data and science, and evolves as the available science evolves. We want to be part of the solution and strongly believe we can make the most impact by engaging with clients, talking to them about their climate goals, and helping finance what they need to reach them.\n\nWhile we are committed to doing our part, we know that the world's problems cannot be solved by one sector, much less by one bank. We specifically call on governments and regulators to guide the transition more firmly. They have to help answer the question \"What does 'good' look like?\". We believe an inclusive approach is the best way to make a meaningful impact. From climate to human rights and financial health, we seek to increase our impact through partnerships and coalition-building\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\n## How we are making the difference\n\nING is making the difference by concentrating on two overarching strategic priorities: giving customers a superior experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do. To put these into practice, and to make that difference for all customers, we have defined four enablers: providing seamless digital services, using scalable technology and operations, staying safe and secure, and unlocking our people's full potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. The 2022 comparatives have been adjusted, reflecting the enhanced process as further explained in the next paragraphs.\n\n## Providing seamless digital services\n\nIn a world where accelerating digitalisation is one of the main global trends impacting banking, customers are spending more and more time online. That's why we want to make their lives easier by giving them a seamless digital service.\n\nCustomers deserve an easy, instant, personal and relevant experience at every touchpoint, from the way we communicate and onboard them to how we provide products and handle customer requests. ING facilitates this by developing, maintaining and enhancing personalised, reliable digital services that aim to be available 24/7.\n\nDeveloping, maintaining and enhancing these basics gives us the foundation for providing a superior customer experience. By digitalising key customer journeys, we are enabling a superior customer experience at a reduced cost-to-serve, while measuring impact through NPS and cost efficiency. In 2023, our Digi Index Score was 71.2 percent. The Digi Index concerns a figure that reflects the average of straightthrough processing (STP) rates of key customer journeys that are handled without manual intervention.\n\nThe previously reported Digi Index Score was based on scores from countries that included global and local processes. Global processes are aligned and consistent throughout countries, while local processes could differ slightly per country. Starting from the first quarter of 2023, the Digi Index has been 'rebaselined' to enhance consistency and comparability. Currently, only 33 global processes are used as a baseline, and local processes have been eliminated. All STP processing has been updated retrospectively, meaning comparative figures have been adjusted and are based on the 33 global processes. The unadjusted 2022 Digi Index Score amounted to 64.4 percent and, as a result of the rebaselining, the adjusted 2022 score amounts to 66.8 percent. Our previously reported aim of reaching a Digi Index Score of over 75 percent by 2025 has not been adjusted.\n\nIndividual customers increasingly only use the mobile channel. For them, our emphasis continues to be on mobile and further improving our mobile capabilities.\n\nIn 2023, 77.4 percent of our communication was personalised. We use data analytics and machine learning to personalise digital services for customers. Personalising customer interactions helps customers make more informed financial decisions and supports mobile sales, while also reducing the need for customers to use other channels. Given the importance of data for offering personal and relevant services, data security and privacy protection are crucial.",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\n## Data analytics\n\nING uses advanced data analytics to help achieve both superior customer experience and sustainability priorities, making the difference for customers, colleagues and society.\n\nHandling calls better by further digitalising our contact centre processes plays a significant role in driving a better customer experience. In 2023, ING's Analytics team implemented speech analytics as a metric tool in the Netherlands and Belgium, providing generated insights into the root causes of contact centre calls, and helping ING to improve its digital journeys in the app and website. In parallel, ING has further promoted virtual assistants. These work to provide more precise answers to address customer FAQs, resulting in active bots in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Poland and T\u00fcrkiye, handling up to 45 percent of the incoming chat volumes.\n\nFor Retail and Business Banking, ING's Analytics team has developed acceptance and affordability models in the lending process with the goal to improve customers' digital experience and to ensure we are safe and secure. In the Netherlands, the artificial intelligence-based lending models enabled instant loan decision and granting within a few minutes instead of days, achieving a higher acceptance ratio by three percent while keeping the same risk level. In Germany, the use of transactional data based on customer consent has allowed for the redevelopment of the consumer loan models. This has led to a notable increase in loan production and approval ratings, helping the business to provide services to more eligible customers.\n\nING has also used analytics to reduce advertisement blindness (where consumers consciously or subconsciously ignore advertisements) to improve relevancy, and enable hyper-personalisation. In 2023, pivotal enhancements to ING's recommendation engine resulted in highly personalised campaign management and, eventually, higher customer engagement. We've updated the underlying model to a deep-learning method, helping us tailor our offerings to better meet customer needs. Meanwhile, real-time processing has been enabled to address customers' needs instantaneously.\n\nIn Wholesale Banking, advanced analytics has helped the front office in their preparations for client interactions, ensuring our colleagues can provide better ideas and ask relevant questions at relevant times.\n\nFor example, we use the entity-matching model, which uses a name-matching algorithm to identify our own clients in datasets, even if the data is not perfectly organised. Using just a small amount of information, it helps us better understand how our clients behave within our network.\n\nThe Analytics team continued to focus on improving the customer due-diligence (CDD) process for Wholesale Banking, leading to a clearer process for our clients and eliminating the need to ask related questions in person.\n\nMore broadly, the team continued to provide support to protect our customers and the bank against increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts, such as impersonation scams, through AI-based detection models.\n\nAdditionally, ING, as a partner of the Kickstart AI foundation in the Netherlands, hosted a hackathon with the foundation in 2023 to boost progress of the Allow More initiative. Based on existing research by the Dutch government, up to 15 percent of those who are eligible for a financial allowance don't claim it. Allow More aims to help individuals identify whether they may be eligible for these allowances. This can encourage more people to use the available help, which could improve the financial situation of many people in the Netherlands. As a result of the hackathon, analysis and model development based on the method generated during the hackathon will be followed across a few banks.\n\nOn top of the existing models, ING's Analytics team continues to improve the customer experience by exploring new technologies. ING recognises the potential of generative AI (GenAI) and we are taking a prudent and responsible approach to doing this in a safe and secure way. To better learn about both the opportunities and risks, we explored opportunities in two areas with a central oversight: Customer contact (like chatbots and transcript analysis) and software engineering (to write code or fix bugs).\n\nAs an example, we piloted LLM (large language models) technologies to improve our chatbot performance and help customers. The first phase of the pilot came to a close in 2023 with promising customer satisfaction and deflection improvements - the rate at which our alternative channels and self-service resources fulfil demand. These experiments have shown there is value in incorporating GenAI into our processes. In 2024, we will expand our GenAI explorations into a few selected areas: KYC, marketing content generation and early warning systems. Application of GenAI technology in these domains has the highest potential to transform our business processes and contribute to our ambition of a superior customer experience.\n\n## Scalable technology and operations\n\nReflecting our role as a digital-first bank and to enable a superior customer experience, ING believes that scalable technology and operations foundations are key requirements. We have therefore made this an integral part of our strategy. Standardisation and automation give us a shorter time to market, quicker time to volume, consistent and higher quality, and improved productivity. Scalable technology and operations also help us attract and retain talent by offering employees the opportunity to not only work with technology but also collaborate across countries and make an impact globally. Scalable technology allows ING to create specific and local propositions that serve our customers, while leveraging ING's scale when it comes to engineering, security, and data experts.",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\n## Scalable technology\n\nOur scalable technology strategy provides a foundation for the modular components we use to build and operate propositions. It allows ING countries to introduce propositions quickly and easily, while providing the opportunity to add local flavour.\n\nOur scalable technology is divided into three parts: ING's private cloud infrastructure (IPC), our engineering pipeline (OnePipeline), and our banking technology platform, with its extendable and reusable services and components. Given the flexibility and scalability of public cloud technology in general, ING has chosen a hybrid cloud strategy, i.e., using public cloud providers in addition to IPC. Cloud computing is an important component for scaling our digital capabilities. IPC is where we store and manage applications and data such as channel applications, core banking systems and other banking applications. We measure IPC adoption by the percentage of physical cores - also known as processing cores or CPU cores - in IPC compared to the total number of physical cores in ING data centres globally. By the end of 2023, 63 percent of all physical cores in ING were on IPC (2022: 52 percent). By the end of 2025, we expect that figure to have risen to at least 70 percent.\n\nOnePipeline, our continuous integration and delivery pipeline, provides engineers with a consistent and secure global capability to develop, test and deploy software. OnePipeline's key features are being compliant, secure and reliable. In addition, the platform allows for simple ways of collaboration between multiple teams. We invest heavily in infrastructure, test and risk automation. At the end of 2023, 62.9 percent of applications were onboarded to this pipeline (2022: 48 percent). We measure the pipeline's adoption by the number of applications onboarded to the pipeline (used to develop and deploy to production), compared to the total number of applications registered in our IT management platform across all ING entities. Our ambition is to have 90 percent of applications on OnePipeline by 2025.\n\nTouchpoint is part of our banking technology platform. Touchpoint provides a set of reusable shared services, freeing up capacity for engineers to create more value for customers and employees. By using these shared platform services like an authentication service or Engagement suite, engineers can realise business solutions like Instant Payments and Open Banking quicker and easier. We measure the Touchpointenabled customer online traffic using the Touchpoint authentication, represented by the number of Touchpoint-enabled unique customer authentications against the total ING number of unique customer authentications. At the end of 2023, approximately 64 percent of customer logins used Touchpoint (2022: approximately 60 percent). By 2025, we expect that figure to increase to 84 percent.\n\n## Digital access\n\nIn a digital society, customers expect to have round-the-clock access to digital channels, including their banking services. To live up to their expectations, we strive to provide uninterrupted access to our banking services, while allowing for scheduled maintenance and downtime. In Retail Banking in 2023, our digital channel availability for the Netherlands and Belgium was 99.56 percent.\n\nING's Chief Technology Office has been diligently working on the identification and analysis of the root causes of major incidents experienced in 2023. Based on the outcome, we took measures to strengthen our reliability. For example, we started a reliability programme across the Tech organisation, including an extensive training for all Tech employees, with the aim of strengthening the overall resilience of our channels.\n\nFor Wholesale Banking clients worldwide, the availability for our Inside Business payments channel and for our Inside Business Connect channel (file transfer) was 100 percent. These figures are based on outputs of availability monitoring processes, which are run with a high frequency per hour.\n\n## Payment & Settlement Services\n\nThe Payment & Settlement Services organisation (PSS), part of the CTO (Chief Technology Office), covers the full scope of payment and settlement services for Retail and Wholesale Banking.\n\nOur scalable tech and ops provide PSS with high-quality and efficient payment, settlement, and openbanking services, leveraging our scalable payment and settlement solutions. As of 2023, PSS processed well over four billion transactions through our central payment engines.\n\nWe aim to further consolidate most of our payment services on this platform, improving quality and reducing price per transaction.\n\n## Scalable operations\n\nOur scalable operations are driven by digitalisation and capability hubs, focusing on becoming fully STP, leveraging expertise and using scale, and sharing productive, quality services across the ING network.\n\nCapability hubs provide shared services and solutions across ING worldwide. The hubs are mainly located in the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and the Philippines. In 2023, 34 percent of operations were carried out with the support of these hubs, compared to 32 percent in 2022. Our aim for 2025 is to have the hubs carry out at least 50 percent of the operational work.\n\nBy digitalising client contacts, accelerating remote advice, and increasing the use of chatbots, we reduced inbound contacts to contact centres by 18 percent in 2023 (versus 2021). We aim for 30 percent less in 2025 (versus 2021). Similarly, by automating and centralising our know-your-customer (KYC) activities this year, we reached 58 percent of KYC workforce in our hubs and expect to increase that to 60 percent by 2025 through more consolidation, automation and straight-through processing.",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\n## Staying safe and secure\n\nTrust is the starting point, the most basic requirement, for all stakeholders. That's especially true for a digital-first bank like ING. People trust us with their money and their data. Keeping these safe, and maintaining this trust, is crucial. See also 'Risk management'.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nThe risk appetite framework (RAF) combines various financial and non-financial risk appetite statements (RAS) into a single, coordinated approach, to provide the business with a clear overview of the relevant risks and the tools to manage them. These tools include the boundaries and instruments set for each risk type that help to manage the risk appetite. This view allows the EB, the MBB, and senior management to pursue ING's business strategy in a safe, secure and compliant way while meeting regulatory requirements at all times. See also 'Risk management'.\n\n## Anti-money laundering and KYC\n\nKnowing who we do business with helps to protect our clients, ING and the financial system against financial economic crimes. As part of our continuing anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, we screen customers, carry out due-diligence checks, and monitor transactions for unusual or suspicious activities. In 2023, we strengthened our KYC by enhancing our global way of working. Read more about KYC and AML in 'Compliance risk' in 'Risk management'.\n\n## Cyberthreat landscape\n\nCybercrime remains a continuous threat to companies and to financial institutions in particular. Ransomware is one of the prime threats, with phishing the most common way that attackers gain access to a company's system or network. Phishing is also used to plant information-stealing malware or for drive-by download attacks - the unintentional download of malicious code to users' computers or mobile phones.\n\nOther high-ranking threats are attacks against availability, or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, used against the financial sector and digital services operators for reputational damage and/or extortion. Different types of cyberthreats are not only relevant for the financial industry, but are increasingly hitting their supply chains. ING continues to invest in cybersecurity capabilities in all domains (prevention, detection, response and recovery).

This involved a customer data leak for private customers who, when opening a current account with ING, used the German legal account change assistance (Gesetzliche Kontowechselhilfe). German banks are legally obliged to support private customers in moving their account from the old to the new bank in this defined generic process. ING in Germany informed authorities and affected customers about the incident and provided safety instructions and contact options to further protect personal information.\n\n## Preventative measures\n\nBeing cybercrime-resilient is a high priority. We continuously test our IT and IT organisational resilience, and perform crisis management and red-team exercises to improve our response to DDoS and targeted attacks. Cybersecurity risks from suppliers are monitored and mitigation is initiated where needed. ING maintains a strong global cybercrime alliance within the financial industry and government institutions to monitor trends.\n\nING recognises the value of an effective regulatory framework and is in favour of cybersecurity requirements being responsive to actual cyberthreats. The adoption of threat-led penetration testing in the EU's Digital Operational Resilience Act, which also ensures continuity of business, is a good example. Testing critical systems on real-life threats helps entities to gain insights. Our staff awareness and training programme is regularly updated with the latest cybercrime trends and prevention measures.\n\nWe have a responsible disclosure procedure for security researchers that may find issues in our business applications or infrastructure. See also 'Non-financial risk'.\n\n## Identity and access management (IAM)\n\nIdentity and access management (IAM) is an important element in our control framework to prevent and mitigate the risk of unauthorised access to IT systems and the data processed and stored therein. ING has IAM global processes and controls in place which are periodically reviewed and tested. See also 'Nonfinancial risk'.\n\n## Fraud landscape\n\nTypes of fraud are also evolving. As the digital world continuously changes, fraudsters have become more international and their modus operandi more complex. Customers are being deceived in increasingly sophisticated ways. Online fraud has become a societal problem and in several countries, banks have collaborated with governments, law-enforcement entities, and other sectors to find innovative ways to prevent and detect fraud. ING continues to play an important role in preventing and detecting fraud in the digital world and wants to minimise the impact of fraud losses and the number of fraud victims.",

        "page_content": "- > How we are making the difference\n\nWe recognise this transformation in the fraud landscape with developments high on our agenda. We have improved our ability to monitor and react to fraud incidents and to adapt quickly to new fraud methods. By using innovative technology, data analytics and IT solutions, we're better able to identify suspicious activities. We are increasingly collaborating with peers and other relevant sectors, such as telecommunications companies.\n\nIn 2023, the Fraud organisation was made part of the Global KYC organisation. Joining the two allows us to draw on combined knowledge and experience, which can help keep ING and our customers safe and secure. Read more in 'Risk management'.\n\n## Data privacy, protection and ethics\n\nIn its capacity as a global financial institution, ING processes personal data belonging to our customers, employees, suppliers and business partners. They trust us with confidential and personal information, so it's important that we maintain that trust and keep this data safe from loss or misuse. This is part of our commitment to ensure safe and transparent banking practices, including in how we manage personal data in an environment that's increasingly open and interconnected. ING is bound by European and local dataprotection laws, which can differ from country to country. For more information on how ING has globally implemented its personal data protection measures, see 'Compliance risk'.\n\nAs ethical standards evolve over time, we closely monitor regulatory compliance and potential new requirements to gain an 'outside-in' view on data ethics. This includes legislation for new trends, like artificial intelligence.\n\nEverything we do is guided by ING's Orange Code, which describes the values and behaviours that underpin our way of working, and which puts integrity above all. Building on the Orange Code is ING's Global Code of Conduct. Its 10 core principles provide more detail on our main values. These help to give greater balance to ING's decision-making, as we weigh up different relevant factors. We've developed supporting methodologies for this purpose, like Orange Code decision-making, which allow us to arrive at decisions that are considerate and well informed. As such, ethics routinely plays a significant role in all our decisionmaking. Read more in 'Governance'.\n\nTo provide further protection, we actively encourage employees to speak up when they are confronted with unethical or illegal behaviour. Through a variety of reporting channels, like managers, persons of trust, or ING whistleblower reporting officers, concerns can be reported. ING also has external whistleblower channels. We take great care to protect the identity of those who report concerns, which they can do anonymously, as well the confidentiality of their reports to protect them against potential retaliation. We believe that trust, integrity and ethical behaviour are at the core of any reliable business. They go hand-inhand with satisfied customers. Read more in 'Compliance risk'.\n\n## Unlocking our people's full potential\n\n'Unlocking our people's full potential' is a key enabler of our strategy. We are making the difference through the skills, expertise and actions of our 60,000+ people worldwide. We attract, develop and retain the people and skills we need at all levels by offering the opportunity to make a global impact and to belong to a friendly, collaborative and inclusive company. Fostering such an environment is made possible through our Orange Culture, built on the values of honesty, prudence and responsibility. These values are aligned to the Orange Behaviours our people exhibit: 'you take it on and make it happen', 'you help others to be successful', and 'you are always a step ahead'. We see the effect of this throughout our business, but in particular in our levels of retention and in our Organisational Health Index (OHI), which is part of our continuous-listening approach.\n\nWe use the OHI to get an ongoing sense of how our people feel and we make sure to act on their feedback. We held two pulse OHI surveys in 2023. In May, we had more than 46,000 employees participating, and all our priorities saw improvements globally, particularly strategic clarity. The second pulse took place in October. We received feedback from 77 percent of employees, making this our highest-ever response rate. We sustained the gains from May, which indicates our focused efforts led to sustainable improvements across our OHI priorities.\n\nUsing these data points, together with external trend research and internal needs assessments, in 2023 we reviewed our people strategy and are focusing on three pillars to further unlock our people's full potential: 'talent & leadership', 'culture & organisation', and 'employee experience'.\n\n## Talent & leadership\n\nING has an abundance of internal talent and a strong culture of developing our people. We offer everyone the opportunity to develop their business, technical and leadership skills, and we're opening up new avenues for them to do so. For example, we have a wide range of academies that deliver specialist professional development. These are complemented by our leadership curriculum, as part of which we launched the leadership accelerator in 2023. As a result, our people are building the right skills to thrive in the future.\n\n## Culture & organisation\n\nOur culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging continues to improve. Since 2019, we have been guided by our 70 percent principle, in which we aim for no group or level to be comprised of more than 70 percent of the same age, nationality or gender. Our culture & organisation pillar takes this further, with the mission to make sure that ING is a place where everyone, regardless of background or identity, can thrive and realise their full potential. We do this by embedding inclusion and equity in all our people processes and by having specific gender-diversity targets for which the Executive Board and Management Board Banking are",

We look at indicators such as the number of women in senior management positions, which amounts to 31 percent at year-end 2023, up from 29 percent at year-end 2022.\n\nWe also continue to build a vitalised culture and organisation that foster healthy performance. We support our people by offering hybrid working so that they have the autonomy to better balance their professional and personal lives. Some 77 percent of our employees are working hybrid (one to four days in the office, based on self-reported data). We care about giving our people this flexibility, and it is highly valued by our employees, helping us attract and retain great talent. Alongside this flexibility, we offer a competitive total reward package, and strong learning and development opportunities. This is reflected in our people offer, which creates clarity on what we offer, and what we ask in return.\n\n## Employee experience\n\nWe want to free up people's time so they can focus on making the difference, which is why we aim to make our employee experience as easy, instant and relevant as our customer experience. In 2023, we made good progress, with more than 70 percent of our people now covered by our global people management systems, enabling them to process employee transactions on their mobile devices. We also started a broad crossfunctional initiative to reduce bureaucracy and make services easier to use for employees. For example, in the Netherlands, we reduced the number of notifications and approval steps on HR-related processes from more than 16,000 to 6,000 per month. In 2024, we plan to further automate HR documents in major countries such as the Netherlands, the Philippines and Germany.\n\nFor more on unlocking our people's full potential, see 'Social'.",

        "page_content": "- > Our performance\n\n## Our performance\n\n2023 was characterised by ongoing challenges, as economic sentiment weakened, geopolitical uncertainties persisted, and inflation remained elevated. In these circumstances, we delivered very strong results with net profit almost doubling to \u20ac7,287 million. Our interest income benefited from the positive rate environment and expense growth was limited, despite inflationary effects on staff expenses and continued\n\ninvestments in the growth of our business. Risk costs declined considerably and were well below the through-the-cycle average, reflecting the quality of our loan book and our prudent credit risk management. Strong capital generation resulted in a CET1 ratio of 14.7 percent at the end of 2023 (up from 14.5 percent at the end of 2022), while we returned \u20ac6.4 billion 1 to shareholders.\n\n## Business

        "page_content": "- > Our performance\n\nDuring 2023, customers continued to put their trust in us. This was evidenced by an increase in both customer lending and deposits, and by a growth of 750,000 in the number of primary customers, which provides us with further opportunities to deepen our client relationships.\n\nRetail Banking recorded strong results in 2023, with net result increasing 64% to \u20ac4,667 million. The result before tax increased 70% to \u20ac6,753 million from \u20ac3,964 million in 2022, as a 24% growth in income was coupled with only a limited increase in operating expenses, while risk costs slightly declined.\n\nNet interest income increased 28% to \u20ac11,459 million, mainly reflecting higher net interest income on liabilities following a rapid increase in interest rates. Furthermore, 2022 had included \u20ac-343 million impact from the impact of the Polish mortgage moratorium and \u20ac-123 million net TLTRO impact after the unwinding of our TLTRO-related derivative position.\n\nNet fee and commission income declined 1.6% to \u20ac2,337 million, as higher daily banking fees (thanks to an increase in payment package fees and new service fees) could not fully compensate for a decline in fees from investment products (due to subdued trading activity) and for lower fees from mortgage brokerage.\n\nTotal investment and other income increased by \u20ac442 million, mainly attributable to Treasury, which benefited from favourable market opportunities through money market and FX transactions; this increase was partly offset in net interest income, where the funding costs of these transactions were recorded. Other income in 2022 had included \u20ac-55 million of exceptional items, consisting of \u20ac-247 million to unwind a macro fair value hedge in Belgium, partly offset by \u20ac125 million income from the transfer of our investment business in France and a \u20ac67 million gain from a legacy entity in Belgium.\n\nIn 2023, total customer lending rose by \u20ac8.1 billion to \u20ac459.8 billion. Adjusted for currency impacts, Treasury and the run-off in Westland Utrecht Bank, Retail's lending book rose by \u20ac9.7 billion. The bulk of this growth (\u20ac8.0 billion) was in residential mortgages, mainly in the Netherlands, Australia and Germany. Total customer deposits increased to \u20ac585.5 billion from \u20ac566.2 billion in 2022. Excluding FX impacts and Treasury, deposits growth was \u20ac18.5 billion in 2023, primarily driven by Germany, Spain and Poland.\n\nExpenses excluding regulatory costs increased 5.2% to \u20ac6,938 million, as the impact of high inflation on staff expenses, reflected in CLA increases and indexation, was partly offset by savings from exiting the French and Philippine retail markets and by lower incidental item costs. Expenses in 2023 included \u20ac131 million of incidental items, largely related to restructuring provisions in Belgium, Poland and Germany. In 2022, incidental item costs had amounted to \u20ac233 million, primarily for restructuring (mainly in Belgium and France) and for compensation related to consumer credit products in the Netherlands. Regulatory costs declined by \u20ac185 million due to a lower contribution to the European Single Resolution Fund and because 2022 had included a \u20ac99 million contribution to the Institutional Protection Scheme in Poland. The cost/ income ratio improved to 51.2% in 2023 compared with 62.1% in 2022.\n\nNet additions to loan loss provisions for Retail Banking were \u20ac607 million in 2023 (compared with \u20ac639 million a year earlier) and with 13 basis points of average customer lending remained well below the through-the-cycle average. Risk costs in 2023 were mainly recorded in Belgium, Poland and Germany.\n\n## Retail Netherlands\n\nThe result before tax of Retail Netherlands increased 42% to \u20ac2,861 million from \u20ac2,014 million in 2022. This was mainly driven by a 19% increase in total income while operating expenses were broadly flat and risk costs were minimal.\n\nNet interest income was \u20ac3,096 million, or 7.2% higher than a year earlier, supported by a strong increase in liability margins. This was partly offset, however, by lower Treasury-related interest income (compensated in other income), reflecting activities to benefit from favourable market opportunities through money market and FX transactions.\n\nNet fee and commission income rose by \u20ac67 million, or 7.5%, supported by higher fees for payment packages and new service fees. Investment and other income increased by \u20ac528 million, driven by much higher Treasury-related income (that was partly offset by lower net interest income).\n\nNet core lending (which excludes Treasury products and a \u20ac0.4 billion decline in the WestlandUtrecht Bank run-off portfolio) grew by \u20ac2.3 billion, as \u20ac2.6 billion growth in the mortgage portfolio more than compensated for a \u20ac0.3 billion decrease in other lending. Customer deposits (excluding Treasury) declined by \u20ac1.6 billion, partially due to a shift from deposits to assets under management.\n\nOperating expenses amounted to \u20ac2,135 million compared with \u20ac2,115 million in 2022. Excluding \u20ac38 million lower regulatory costs and \u20ac75 million of incidental item costs in 2022 (related to consumer credit products), expenses rose by \u20ac133 million or 7.4%. This was primarily due to higher staff expenses, reflecting the impact of a new collective labour agreement in 2023, and restructuring provisions.\n\nThe net addition to loan loss provisions was very low at \u20ac5 million, down from \u20ac67 million in the prior year. Limited net additions in 2023 for the mortgage portfolio, including the impact of a methodology update, were almost fully offset by a net release for the business lending portfolio.\n\n## Retail Belgium\n\nThe result before tax for Retail Belgium (which includes ING's retail activities in Luxembourg) jumped to \u20ac661 million compared with \u20ac223 million in 2022. The strong increase was mainly due to growth in net interest income and the impact of one-off income items in the year before.",

        "page_content": "- > Our performance\n\nTotal income rose by \u20ac536 million, or 25%, to \u20ac2,683 million. Net interest income increased by \u20ac395 million, or 24%, as higher income from liabilities more than compensated for the impact of lower margins on mortgages due to higher funding costs.\n\nNet fee and commission income slipped 1.8% from a year earlier as higher fees on investment products, reflecting an increase in assets under management, were offset by lower daily banking fees due to higher fees paid to brokers. Investment and other income in 2022 had included an impact of \u20ac-247 million to unwind a macro fair value hedge and a \u20ac67 million gain from a legacy entity. Excluding the aforementioned two items, investment and other income declined by \u20ac31 million, mainly reflecting lower Treasury-related income.\n\nCustomer lending (excluding Treasury) rose by \u20ac1.4 billion, equally split over mortgages and other lending. Customer deposits (excluding Treasury) declined by \u20ac1.3 billion, mainly due to customers buying retail bonds issued by the Belgian government and a shift to assets under management.\n\nOperating expenses were \u20ac1,852 million, up 3.7% on the year before. This included \u20ac76 million of incidental item costs related to restructuring and a further optimisation of the branch network, while 2022 had \u20ac97 million of incidental item costs. Expenses excluding regulatory costs (which were \u20ac33 million lower year-onyear) and incidental items increased 8.4%. This was mainly due to the impact of automatic salary indexation on staff expenses.\n\nThe net addition to the provision for loan losses amounted to \u20ac169 million, or 18 basis points of average customer lending, up from \u20ac139 million in 2022. The increase year-on-year included the impact of model updates for the mortgage and consumer lending portfolios in 2023.\n\n## Retail Germany\n\nThe result before tax for Retail Germany almost doubled to \u20ac1,790 million compared with \u20ac901 million in 2022, mainly on the back of a 45% increase in total income. This was driven by a 72% growth in net interest income, supported by higher liability volumes at significantly improved margins, and by an increase in interest income from Treasury-related products and mortgages.\n\nNet fee and commission income declined 18% to \u20ac357 million. This reflected a decrease in fees from mortgages (due to lower brokerage volumes) and from investment products (due to a lower number of brokerage trades). Investment and other income decreased by \u20ac136 million, largely due to lower Treasuryrelated revenues.\n\nNet core lending growth (which excludes Treasury) was \u20ac1.7 billion, consisting of \u20ac1.4 billion growth in the residential mortgages portfolio and \u20ac0.3 billion growth in other lending. Customer deposits (excluding\n\nTreasury) increased by \u20ac8.5 billion following successful promotional campaigns to attract new savings and customers.\n\nOperating expenses rose 9.0% to \u20ac1,243 million. This included \u20ac96 million of regulatory costs (up \u20ac3 million from 2022) and \u20ac20 million of incidental items for restructuring costs and staff allowances (compared with \u20ac10 million in 2022). Excluding regulatory costs and incidental items, cost growth was 8.7% due to higher staff expenses related to annual salary increases, and higher marketing expenses and investments to support business growth.\n\nNet additions to loan loss provisions declined to \u20ac119 million (12 basis points of average customer lending) and were primarily related to consumer lending.\n\n## Retail Other\n\nRetail Other consists of the Other Challengers & Growth Markets. Following a change in governance, the Asian stakes (our investments in Bank of Beijing and TMBThanachart Bank) are reported in Corporate Line as of 2023 (with a profit before tax of \u20ac185 million), whereas previously they were reported in Retail Other. Comparable data have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nRetail Other's result before tax increased 75% to \u20ac1,441 million, from \u20ac825 million in 2022, mainly thanks to higher interest income and lower regulatory costs.\n\nTotal income rose 16% to \u20ac4,233 million. Net interest income was up 26% to \u20ac3,437 million, supported by improved margins on liabilities in a higher interest rate environment, and because 2022 had included a \u20ac-343 million impact from the introduction of the Polish mortgage moratorium. This more than compensated negative currency impacts and tighter lending margins.\n\nNet fee and commission income declined by \u20ac16 million, or 3.0%, mainly due to lower fees on investment products. This reflected subdued trading activity and the impact of ING's exit from the French retail market in 2022. Investment and other income in 2022 had included \u20ac125 million income from the transfer of our investment business in France to Boursorama (with another \u20ac14 million recorded in 2023 for the final settlement) and \u20ac38 million of proceeds from the sale of a non-performing loan portfolio in Spain. Excluding these specific income items, investment and other income increased by \u20ac49 million, mainly due to higher Treasury-related income.\n\nNet customer lending growth (adjusted for currency effects and Treasury) was \u20ac4.3 billion in 2023, with growth in all countries, but particularly in Australia. Net core deposits growth (also excluding currency impacts and Treasury) was \u20ac12.9 billion, primarily driven by net inflows in Spain and Poland.",

By comparison, 2022 had included \u20ac51 million of incidental item costs, mainly restructuring costs for France and the Philippines. Excluding these incidental items and much lower regulatory costs (as 2022 had included a \u20ac99 million contribution to the Institutional Protection Scheme in Poland), expenses increased by \u20ac102 million or 4.9%. This was mainly due to inflationary pressure on staff expenses, partly offset by savings following the discontinuation of our retail activities in France and the Philippines, and FX impacts in T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThe net addition to loan loss provisions amounted to \u20ac313 million, or 29 basis points of average customer lending, compared with \u20ac302 million in 2022. Risk costs in 2023 were primarily attributable to net additions in Poland and Spain, with Poland including \u20ac67 million for adjustments to the expected future cash flows of CHF-indexed mortgages.\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\n| in EUR million                                | 2023   | 2022   | Growth %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Income                                        |        |        |            |\n| - Net interest income                         | 4,028  | 4,260  | -5 %       |\n| - Net fee and commission income               | 1,259  | 1,217  | 3 %        |\n| - Total investment and other income           | 1,771  | 849    | 109 %      |\n| Total income                                  | 7,057  | 6,325  | 12 %       |\n| of which:                                     |        |        |            |\n| Lending                                       | 3,224  | 3,157  | 2 %        |\n| Daily Banking & Trade Finance                 | 2,153  | 1,662  | 30 %       |\n| Financial Markets                             | 1,280  | 1,226  | 4 %        |\n| Treasury & Other                              | 401    | 280    | 43 %       |\n| Total income                                  | 7,057  | 6,325  | 12 %       |\n| Expenses excl. regulatory costs               | 3,043  | 2,821  | 8 %        |\n| Regulatory costs                              | 271    | 293    | -8 %       |\n| Operating expenses                            | 3,313  | 3,114  | 6 %        |\n| Gross result                                  | 3,744  | 3,211  | 17 %       |\n| Addition to loan loss provisions              | -92    | 1,220  | -108 %     |\n| Result before taxation                        | 3,836  | 1,991  | 93 %       |\n| Taxation                                      | 900    | 581    | 55 %       |\n| Non-controlling interests                     | 61     | 52     | 17 %       |\n| Net result IFRS                               | 2,875  | 1,358  | 112 %      |\n| Key figures                                   |        |        |            |\n| Net core lending growth (in \u20ac billion)        | -1.2   | 2.4    |            |\n| Net core deposits growth (in \u20ac billion)       | -7.9   | 6.2    |            |\n| Risk costs in bps of average customer lending | -4.9   | 64.7   |            |\n\nIn 2023, Wholesale Banking recorded strong results as higher income and significantly lower risk costs led to a 93% increase in result before tax, to \u20ac3,836 million.

Average asset volumes decreased, reflecting the weaker economic climate and a continued reduction of our Russia-related exposure. This was more than compensated by slightly higher interest margins and a 5.3% growth in fees and commissions, lifting total income for Lending 2.1% to \u20ac3,224 million. Combined with a 7.0% reduction in risk-weighted assets, this led to a significant improvement in income over average risk-weighted assets.\n\nFinancial Markets' income increased by 4.4% to \u20ac1,280 million. They recorded strong trading results, especially in Rates and Credits, as these desks benefited the most from market volatility and good client flows. In addition, fee income was up by 55%, mainly reflecting higher Capital Markets issuance income.\n\nIncome from Treasury & Other increased by \u20ac121 million to \u20ac401 million, driven by higher income from Corporate Investments and Corporate Finance.

Excluding lower regulatory costs and \u20ac17 million of restructuring costs (versus \u20ac10 million of incidental items recorded in 2022), expense growth was 7.6%. This reflected the impact of collective labour agreements, higher performance-related payments and strategic investments for business expansion.\n\nIn 2023, a net release of \u20ac92 million from loan loss provisions was recorded compared to a net addition of \u20ac1,220 million in 2022. Risk costs in 2022 had been significantly impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which then led to a net addition of \u20ac533 million on our Russia-related exposure. In addition, 2022 had included an increase in Stage 3 individual risk costs, partly as a result of a more negative macroeconomic outlook. In 2023, \u20ac218 million of provisions for our Russia-related portfolio could be released, mainly due to a reduction of our exposure. Moreover, Stage 3 risk costs were limited in 2023 as additions for specific files in the real estate portfolio were largely offset by recoveries from previously provisioned files and secondary market sales.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment, social and governance overview\n\n## Environmental, social and governance overview\n\nIn anticipation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which applies as of January 2024, we are introducing a dedicated ESG chapter 1 in our Integrated Annual Report, for the first time. The first CSRD reporting will be due in 2025. 2\n\n## Preparation for CSRD\n\nING will have to report for the first time in accordance with the CSRD over financial year 2024, for reports published as of 2025. The CSRD is a legal framework that requires the issuance of a sustainability report. In July 2023, the European Commission adopted the delegated act of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which were published in the Official Journal of the EU in December 2023. For the banking sector, detailed rules on reporting are expected to follow. However, the EU reached a political agreement on postponing the deadline for the sector-specific standards by two years.\n\nWe will use these ESRS, developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), to report on our impacts, risks and opportunities. Up until this year, we have used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards to do so. We expect the interoperability between the GRI standards and the ESRS to assist us in our compliance. However, we also acknowledge some key differences, hence preparation work will be undertaken in 2024 to comply with CSRD disclosure requirements.\n\nOne of the notable differences with the introduction of the CSRD is on the materiality assessment. This year's materiality assessment is performed in alignment with GRI standards. Moving from GRI Materiality Assessment to Double Materiality, in line with the ESRS requirements, will be one of the first actions in 2024 as we determine which material topics and which ESRS to report on in the 2024 Annual Report.\n\nESG topics addressed in this chapter are divided into three sections: Environment, Social and Governance. Within the Environment chapter, we address areas including our approach to climate action, sustainable finance products, and our own carbon footprint. In Social, we address our responsibility towards the wellbeing of our employees, customers and society. In Governance, we focus on business ethics, our Orange Code and way of working. For more on Board composition, structure and oversight, see 'Our leadership and corporate governance'.\n\n## Collaboration and stakeholder engagement\n\nNo one sector, much less one bank, has the ability to solve the world's problems. We believe that an inclusive approach is the only way we can make any meaningful positive impact. As such, we seek to increase our impact through partnerships and coalition-building. ING also recognises the importance of regular and meaningful engagement and dialogue with its many and diverse stakeholders on societal issues.\n\n## Collaboration to increase impact\n\nContributing to climate standard-setting is an example of our approach to collaboration and stakeholder engagement. We work with peers, clients, other companies and experts to contribute to standardised frameworks that banks and clients use to measure and disclose progress towards net-zero targets.\n\nThis is important because it means companies in the same industry, and in the same sectors of banks' portfolios, can be compared in the same way. Banks get a shared understanding of how they can support the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors.\n\nFor example, in 2023, our collaborations with industry peers and other partners saw us make important new contributions to climate standard-setting. Building on our previous efforts to help develop methodologies that can be used by financial institutions and sector participants to benchmark their own alignment with net zero and other climate goals - like the Poseidon Principles for the shipping sector and the Sustainable STEEL Principles for the steel sector - we're now collaborating with RMI's Center for Climate Aligned Finance and three banking peers on a new methodology for the aluminium sector. This resulted in the launch of the Sustainable Aluminium Principles at COP28 in December 2023.\n\nWe also joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and aim to contribute to the improvement of PCAF methodologies by supporting ongoing and new working groups that are helping financial institutions understand the impacts of products that are not yet covered.",

We also participate in learning platforms and promote a shared language among banks, for example through the Shift Financial Institution Practitioners Circle and the Shift Business Learning Programme, to name a few.\n\n## Ongoing stakeholder dialogue\n\nAs regards our approach to stakeholder engagement, retail customers, business clients, employees, investors, NGOs, suppliers, supervisors and regulators are among our most important stakeholders. Rather than having one-off consultations around specific topics, we have an ongoing dialogue about our role in society, our products and services, our business performance and other issues.\n\nOur engagement approach is informed by the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and aims to adhere to the best practice provision of section 1.1.5 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. We engage in dialogue in a risk-based manner, also taking into account the outcomes of our saliency assessment. In all the stakeholder dialogues we engage in, ING is committed to adhering to its relevant legal obligations relating to confidentiality.\n\n## Our ESG governance approach\n\nWe have updated our ESG governance approach, integrating and aligning ESG governance with the existing business-as-usual governance of the bank. We want to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for our company, our customers, society and the environment. We do this through the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 We focus on climate action, leading by example by striving for net zero in our own operations. We play our part in the social and low-carbon transformation that's necessary to achieve a sustainable future, steering the most carbon-intensive parts of our portfolio towards reaching net zero by 2050.\n- \u00b7 We collaborate, working with clients to achieve their own sustainability goals, increasing our impact through partnerships and coalition-building.\n- \u00b7 We manage the most relevant environmental and social risks while fostering the protection of biodiversity and human rights across all of our relationships.\n- \u00b7 We work to advance financial health and inclusion for our customers and communities.\n- \u00b7 We empower our colleagues to contribute to our sustainability approach and climate action to make sure they are highly engaged with our strategy and all sustainability-related topics. For more on upskilling our workforce, see 'Social'.\n- \u00b7 We show climate leadership by stepping up advocacy on government guidance needed for the transition, by contributing to the development climate standards for the financial industry and by sharing our insights and learnings.\n\n## Board-level governance\n\nThe Supervisory Board's ESG Committee assists the Supervisory Board (SB) with matters relating to ESG, including, but not limited to, the development and integration of ESG across the company and its strategy. The ESG Committee also assists the SB by monitoring and advising on relevant ESG developments. To prevent an overlap between the ESG Committee and the other Supervisory Board committees, and to safeguard an aligned and common view on ESG, the ESG Committee consists of at least one member of each of the other committees.\n\nThe ESG Committee met four times in 2023. An overview of the variety of topics discussed and supported can be found in the Supervisory Board report, including how the board monitors and oversees progress against targets and performance. In addition to the regular meetings, in the first half of 2023 the ESG Committee participated in a full day of climate-focused training, which included deep-dives on climate change, biodiversity and sustainable finance. The outside-in view and external inspiration was provided by a prominent climate academic from a leading Dutch university and the head of the UN's Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). In the second half of 2023, the ESG Committee participated in a social and ESG regulations-focused training session, which included deep-dives on financial health and inclusion, human rights, Just Transition, ESG regulations and assurance.\n\nESG is a regular subject on the agenda of ING's Management Board Banking (MBB), which includes the members of the Executive Board (EB) in their capacity of day-to-day management of the business and longterm strategy.\n\nESG was a formal agenda point in MBB meetings 37 times in 2023. In addition, as we take steps to further integrate and embed climate action into the business, many of the other topics on the MBB's regular meeting agenda have a sustainability angle. This means that the MBB is discussing and taking decisions on sustainability- and climate-related topics on a frequent basis. The MBB also plays a role in the global ambition-setting and oversight of our Terra climate-alignment approach.\n\n## Senior management-level governance\n\n## ESG Change Board\n\nFor the integrated oversight of all ESG-related regulatory and change initiatives, and to verify consistency and efficiency of delivery in each of the involved domains, we've created an ESG Change Board. The ESG Change Board is comprised of representatives of all global ESG-related change and regulatory programmes alongside representatives from Data, Compliance and internal audit (CAS - Corporate Audit Services).",

The ESG Sounding Board, comprised of around 15 senior leaders from across the organisation, helps guide the development and implementation of our strategy related to ESG topics, as well as monitoring and reporting on our progress.\n\n## ESG Risk Committee\n\nThe ESG Risk Committee (ERC) is responsible for ensuring the execution and delivery of any ESG risk-related matter discussed by the Supervisory Board or its committees.\n\nMembers have practical insight into strategic and operational issues and are able to align between functional or business issues. Within its competences, the ERC serves as a technical (content-related) adviser to MBB and MBB delegated committees (Risk-led committees and the ING Group Disclosure committee). The ERC serves as a planning body for ESG risk priorities and advises on the approval of all material ESG riskrelated items.\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nThe Disclosure Committee (DisCom), which comprises various members of senior management and business and risk representatives, advises the Boards in fulfilling their responsibilities with respect to ING's periodic and ad-hoc disclosure obligations and activities. It aims to ensure that external presentations including sustainability information of ING are reviewed prior to public release.\n\n## Global Sustainability department\n\nThe Global Sustainability department is responsible for developing ING's overall sustainability approach. The department partners with the business lines on developing ING's policies, programmes and targets on sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and is involved in measuring progress towards these targets. We take a holistic approach to sustainability, which means that climate-change mitigation, climate adaptation, nature, human rights, financial health, business ethics and other ESG-related topics are all in scope and supported by dedicated experts. ING's global head of Sustainability reports directly to ING's CEO.\n\nStakeholder engagement is of crucial importance to ING, and we engage in dialogue with key external stakeholder groups, such as NGOs, governments, academics, sustainable research agencies, investors and international development organisations. Internal engagement is just as important, by developing global learning and upskilling programmes on ESG-related topics, also supporting further integration of sustainability into our business.\n\n## Business-level governance\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\nING has had a Wholesale Banking Sustainability Steering Committee since September 2022. The committee's main purpose is to assign clear ownership, accountability and resources within Wholesale Banking (WB) and relevant support functions to help set and implement WB's sustainability commitments.\n\nEach of the seven WB sector teams has a sector global sustainability lead. There are also two regional sustainability leads for Asia-Pacific and the Americas, two key regions in our WB network. These nine leads coordinate and implement WB's sustainability ambitions and related tasks at the sector/regional level, following a clear strategy and associated action plans.\n\nFor Wholesale Banking, responsibility for ING's sustainable finance business sits with the Sustainable Finance department, whose reporting line is via the head of Wholesale Banking Lending to ING's head of Wholesale Banking. This team operates as a centre of expertise for engaging and advising corporate clients, and supports the execution of sustainability-linked transactions.\n\n## Retail Banking\n\nFor Retail Banking - which from a governance and organisational perspective includes Business Banking the development of new and innovative sustainable products and the progress of lending portfolios towards climate goals are steered through the Retail Banking Sustainability Steering Committee, which cascades this responsibility to the relevant experts and country teams as needed. Sustainability/ESG leads in major countries have a functional line to the global head of Sustainability to create a stronger connection between global and local activities.\n\n## ESG risk governance\n\nESG risk, and in particular climate risk, is not identified as an independent risk category/ risk type. Rather, it is a set of drivers affecting the likelihood and severity of existing risk categories/ risk types, therefore the management of ESG risk is embedded within all risk types. The ESG risk framework outlines ING's approach to managing ESG risk as a driver of existing risk types.

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Environment\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges facing society. The financial sector has a role to play in acting on climate change, supporting the transition to a net-zero economy, protecting nature and enabling the circular economy. We take this role seriously and want to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future for our company, our customers, society and the environment.\n\n## Our approach to climate action\n\nWe have the ambition to empower our clients to reach net zero by 2050. To achieve this, we need to carefully manage the risks and potential impacts on our business, while making the most of the opportunities that come with supporting our customers in making their transitions. Our approach focuses on taking action at both portfolio level and client level, with the aim of making positive climate impact.\n\nWe've made sustainability an integral element of our business strategy. And while we believe our biggest impact comes from focusing on climate action, our climate action approach is closely interlinked with our approach to nature and to human rights and recognises the interdependencies. Climate change is accelerating biodiversity and nature loss and negatively impacting human rights. Taking measures to safeguard and foster nature supports climate mitigation, while taking an inclusive approach to the climate transition helps to protect human rights.\n\nTo be successful, and make the difference for people and the planet, we take a dynamic approach to climate action: we follow the latest climate science and actively seek guidance from governments and regulators in how to assess and manage climate risks while supporting a smooth and inclusive transition.\n\nWe work closely with reputable third parties to translate climate science into climate pathways, scenarios and frameworks that guide our actions, aimed at delivering near- and medium-term emissions reductions in our portfolios on the path to net zero by 2050.\n\nWe're taking action to achieve the ambitious targets we've set, yet the achievement of targets is also dependent on factors that are outside of ING's direct influence. If a particular sector is unable to align with\n\nnet zero by 2050 targets because of, for example, a lack of scalable alternative technologies or insufficient incentives to encourage the necessary changes in customer behaviour, then as a result we may struggle to steer our portfolios along the relevant net-zero pathways.\n\nIntegrity matters, and transparency drives accountability and accelerates action. ING is committed to sharing the progress on our targets and the actions we're taking in our efforts to meet them, and supports organisations and alliances that promote transparency, clarity and uniformity in reporting. We're eager to see further international alignment and harmonisation of reporting requirements, including those focused on climate impact measurement and target-setting, as well as public sector endorsement of science-based sectoral pathways. And we continue to call for more concrete guidance from governments and regulators on climate risk and climate adaptation. These improvements help to provide clarity to our clients, whose choices impact the real economy.\n\nOur climate action objectives are:\n\n- \u00b7 Aim to reach net zero in our own operations;\n- \u00b7 Manage climate and environmental risks.\n- \u00b7 Steer our portfolios and engage with clients for positive climate impact;\n\n## Aim to reach net zero in our own operations\n\nWe aim to play a role in the necessary transition to a net-zero society which begins with our own operations. This means bringing our buildings, data centres and business travel in line with the net-zero economy of the future. We measure and steer our progress towards this ambition through our environmental programme, which is steered by a committee chaired by our chief operations officer (COO) with the participation of colleagues from finance, real estate, IT and HR.\n\nIn 2023 our total operational footprint (scope 1, 2 and scope 3 business travel) was 29 kilotonnes (kt) of CO2e. This is a reduction of the CO2e emissions from our own operations of 131 tonnes compared to 2022. Our 2023 operational footprint represents a 72 percent reduction compared to our 2014 baseline (106kt). Since our 2023 result is already close to our 2025 ambition of 75 percent reduction compared to 2014, we aim to revisit our current ambition and baseline. Please refer to the 'ESG appendix' for more details about the progress on our environmental programme. Scope 1 covers our direct, controlled emissions from natural gas, fuel oil and diesel. Scope 2 covers our indirect emissions (market-based) from the generation of purchased energy (i.e., electricity and district heating). Scope 3 currently covers emissions in our value chain from business travel (air, car and train). For now, other operational scope 3 categories are not included. We continue to assess data availability and materiality related to the other scope 3 categories.\n\nIn 2023, we continued working collaboratively with four main pillars within our Environmental Programme governance, including buildings, procurement, tech & operations and conscious working.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Our path towards net-zero buildings\n\n## Conscious working\n\nOur ambition for our buildings worldwide, both owned and rented, is to reach net zero by 2035. To achieve this, we focus on improving energy efficiency, using space more efficiently, and moving towards lowercarbon heating systems. A good example of this is the ING Marnix building in Brussels, which is undergoing sustainable renovations - insulating the windows and frames, adding rooftop solar installations, and switching to heat pumps. Digitalisation of the way we work and the way we interact with clients and customers also supports a decrease in the footprint of our branches and offices. In 2023, the scope 1 and 2 emissions related to our buildings were 14 Kt CO2e (an 81 percent reduction compared to our 2014 baseline).\n\nWe also continue to improve our renewable electricity sourcing and reporting. In the Netherlands, for example, we have a virtual power purchase agreement (PPA) with Vattenfall for the majority of our energy from the 'Hollandse Kust Zuid' wind farm. We also continue to increase the amount of installed renewable electricity generation - this includes in the Netherlands, where installed rooftop solar became operational in four new locations in 2023, with an additional annual generating capacity of 176,000 kWh. It's our intention to move over time towards more onsite renewables and direct purchasing agreements from local renewable projects. Our own assessment shows that our electricity sourcing in 2023 was 98 percent aligned with RE100's technical criteria. We expect a review by RE100 of this figure during 2024.\n\n## Sustainability at the heart of procurement\n\nWe have a process in place that helps us screen our suppliers better (through our Know Your Supplier (KYS) approach), enabling us to assess whether they share our commitment in fighting climate change and protecting human rights. In 2023, we also launched a Sustainable Procurement Guideline that contains environmental and human rights criteria for the different procurement categories to inform the process of supplier selection.\n\n## Working towards sustainable tech & operations\n\nING's Tech teams are focusing on reducing CO2 emissions and the impacts of physical materials (e.g. hardware, cabling, packaging and other waste) related to our data centres, end-user devices and applications. As part of our data centre consolidation, which involves moving to more energy efficient data centres in the Netherlands, ING's data centres in Singapore and the United States were closed in 2023. We were also able to reduce the number of servers supporting our Workplace Services (WPS) environment by 90 percent or approximately 3,000 servers. They were moved to cloud-based servers which are more sustainable than physical servers in our data centre. In addition, we enhanced our CO2 footprint awareness in our workforce, leading to notable reductions in the use of inefficient IT applications. In 2023, we launched a pilot involving four markets to validate ING's approach to measuring the environmental impact of our banking operations processes. Building on this, we are further developing a framework to embed sustainable processes in our operations.\n\nWe promote work practices that encourage employees to be conscious of their impact on the climate. In particular, we focus on striving to reduce our business travel through the use of CO2 budgets, the continued use of video-conferencing tools, and policies designed to encourage the use of rail for travel under 500km. In addition to our efforts to reduce air travel, we also started working on data availability and developing a methodology to measure our employee commuting impact. In 2023, we continued to procure low-carbon fuel on a life cycle basis, known in the market and referred to in this report as 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' (SAF), from our partners at SkyNRG and Neste (producers). We also procured SAF certificates from Air France-KLM, Lufthansa Group and Singapore Airlines as measures to mitigate our environmental impact. Additionally, we entered into a partnership with Qantas as part of our SAF sourcing approach this year. In total, we procured 1465mt of SAF. Globally, we have an ambition to reach at least 90 percent electric vehicles (EVs) in our car fleet by 2030.\n\n## Steer our portfolios and engage with clients for positive climate impact\n\nING's largest impact on the environment and earth's climate is through our financing. We advocate for financing more sustainable activities, however we know that we still finance more that is not. Officially endorsing the Paris Agreement in 2015 and joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance in 2021 have set the precedent for the strategic direction of ING to steer our portfolio to net zero by 2050. We use our Terra climate alignment approach to address the most carbon-intensive parts of our overall lending portfolio and steer those to net zero by 2050 or sooner. At client level we use our sector expertise, international network and climate-action experience to accelerate our clients' transitions to a low-carbon economy.\n\nTo improve how we advise and finance clients in support of their transitions, we're increasingly incorporating sustainability and climate-related considerations into our decision-making processes. For example, as part of our Terra approach, we have devised transition plans for each sector in scope of Terra which help us drive portfolio-level alignment with net-zero-by-2050 pathways (see 'Sector transition plans for portfolio-level impact' in this chapter).\n\nWhen we finance our clients, different governance bodies are in place to assess the incorporation of sustainability and environment-related considerations in financing decisions.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Supporting the energy transition\n\nWe believe that the financial sector has a role in helping the world transition to a low-carbon economy. At ING, we take this role seriously, as we strive to be a banking leader in driving the energy transition. The systemic change required means no one can do it alone - governments, NGOs, businesses, financial institutions and individuals all have a part to play - and we can all make the difference for present and future generations if we work together towards the same goals.\n\nThe energy sector is under external scrutiny in the journey to decarbonisation and is the most critical to transition to net zero. It is also where ING is focused on driving change with ambitious targets. Our approach to financing the energy sector balances three main societal interests: the need to decarbonise to fight climate change, the need for energy to remain accessible and affordable for people and companies, and the need for security of the energy supply.\n\nUltimately, building enough new renewable and low-carbon sources of energy will reduce the need for fossil fuels and ING strongly supports the objective of this transition. The global economy's reliance on fossil fuels, in particular on coal for power generation, must reduce to significantly lower levels over the next 10 to 15 years, according to the energy transition pathway set out in the International Energy Agency's (IEA) NetZero Emissions by 2050 (NZE 2050) Scenario.\n\nIn recent years, ING has stepped up its support for the energy transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2015, ING decided to end the financing of new coal-fired power plants and thermal coal mines worldwide. In 2017, we set a goal to bring our financing down to close to zero by the end of 2025. We have decreased lending to individual coal-fired power plants since 2015 by 87 percent to \u20ac77 million. The current portfolio consists of a limited number of legacy loans and we are continuing our efforts to further reduce the outstanding to close to zero by end of 2025 in line with our strategy. Financing to thermal coal mining activities has decreased by 99 percent during the same period.\n\n## Fossil fuels and power generation\n\nING's energy sector coverage includes finance for oil and gas activities (upstream, mid- and downstream), together with finance for power (generation, transmission, and distribution). In addition, the Trade and Commodity Finance business provides short-term finance to traders of oil and gas.\n\n| Energy outstandings    |        |        |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in EUR billion         | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Upstream O&G           |    2.5 |    2.7 |\n| Mid-and downstream O&G |   14.6 |   15.1 |\n| Total Oil & Gas        |   17.1 |   17.8 |\n| Utilities & Power      |   24.3 |   23.5 |\n| of which renewables    |    9.7 |    8.5 |\n| Total Energy           |   41.4 |   41.3 |\n\nThe table above provides a breakdown of the outstanding amounts of ING's energy sector Oil & Gas- and Utilities & Power-related portfolios, which is part of ING's credit risk portfolio. In line with ING's credit risk portfolio, as disclosed in the Risk Management section, these portfolios are defined by industry codes (NAICS) for financial reporting which are based on the primary activity of our clients. The reduction in Total Oil & Gas is driven mainly by the continued reduction in the Upstream portfolio, while the growth in Power is driven by continued growth in Renewables. This is a consequence of the strategic direction announced in March 2022 to step up our efforts to commit to the financing of renewable energy and restrict financing of new oil and gas fields.\n\nThe management of ING's energy finance business is framed by our commitment to address one of the world's biggest challenges: climate change. With our Terra approach we aim to steer our oil & gas financing and power generation financing in line with the energy transition pathway set out in the Net Zero Emissions scenario of the IEA.\n\nThe Terra approach requires us to set interim and long-term targets based on the factors which are assessed to have the most positive impact on an efficient and orderly energy transition, considering the need to decarbonise, the need for energy affordability and the need for security of energy supply. For the energy sector, we have defined and set targets for upstream, mid- and downstream as well as power generation and we are to define and set targets for Trade and Commodity Finance as well, covering the full energy value chain.\n\nWe use the Paris Agreement Capital Assessment (PACTA) methodology, 'PACTA for Banks', which was codeveloped with the 2D Investing Initiative (2DII) and other global banks to define the portfolio scope (e.g. asset-level activities and technologies, loan amount outstanding and loan purpose) and metrics (absolute or intensity of emissions reduction) for net-zero alignment target-setting. As our impact on climate change from financing high greenhouse gas-emitting sectors like energy stems from our lending activities, mainly non-lending activities are excluded from our climate alignment approach. For this reason, the scopes and sizes of the oil & gas and power generation portfolios, set out in the Metrics and Targets chapter of ING's 2023 Climate Report, are different to our (full product exposure) disclosures as presented in this paragraph.",

In December 2023, following the COP 28 climate conference, ING announced two further strategic actions to support an accelerated energy transition: to phase out the financing of upstream oil & gas activities by 2040 and the aim to realise \u20ac7.5 billion of annual commitments in renewable energy finance by 2025. In 2023, ING committed \u20ac4.2 billion to the financing of renewables.\n\nPhasing out lending to coal (since 2017) and upstream oil & gas production (by 2040), and increasing our commitments to renewables and other low-carbon energy sources will significantly contribute to our strategic targets and net-zero commitments. In addition to mitigating and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, ING recognises that technology and new market developments are essential drivers of the energy transition. One important area is batteries, which are capable of addressing the inherent intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, like wind and solar, as well as providing much-needed grid stabilisation services. We are also looking at other energy storage mediums like hydrogen, which have additional applications such as alternative fuel for transport and for the energy-intensive industry. Finally, we are closely following the evolution of large-scale carbon-capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) which will be essential where fossil fuels are required in industrial processes that are needed for the global economy and for which there is currently no alternative .\n\n## Trade & Commodity Finance\n\nING considers energy trade flows to be an integral part of the energy value chain. In 2023, we therefore announced that we would work towards including our Trade & Commodity Finance business in the Terra approach. To date, a methodology for aligning the finance of oil & gas trade flows with energy transition pathways in climate scenarios does not exist. The short-term nature of commodity trade finance and fluctuating intra-year and year-on-year price and trade patterns present unique challenges. As we have done for other target-setting methodologies in the Terra approach, we are collaborating with external experts and peer banks to co-develop a net-zero alignment methodology. We will publish our methodology and set interim and long-term targets for Trade and Commodity Finance in the course of 2024.\n\n|                        |   Energy Trading outstandings and limits |        |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|\n| in EUR billion         |                                   2023   | 2022   |\n| Oil & Gas Limits       |                                     27.3 |   30   |\n| Oil & Gas Outstandings |                                     12.4 |   14.1 |\n\n## Terra approach\n\nWe use our Terra approach to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of our loan book towards net zero by 2050. We continue to refine and optimise Terra, dynamically incorporating developments in climate science, and have expanded our coverage to include the mid- and downstream parts of the oil & gas sector value chain, where previously only the upstream part of the value chain was in scope. We also cover our global commercial real estate portfolio, where previously we only covered the book for the Netherlands, and we are expanding Terra to cover Business Banking clients. In doing so, we are first focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands active in the agriculture (especially dairy farming) and transportation (especially inland shipping and road transportation) sectors. Please note that all progress reported in this paragraph relates to 2022, as emissions data is not available to update for 2023. Furthermore, this paragraph provides condensed information about our Terra approach. For more detail see our 2023 Climate Report published on our website, ing.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLooking at the progress of our climate alignment, we're currently on track to achieve our medium-term 2030 sector decarbonisation targets in seven of our nine Terra sectors (10 sub sectors). Power generation, upstream oil & gas and automotive have shown particularly strong performance and improvement. Aviation, now within one percent of the benchmark, has also significantly improved compared to the 2021 alignment score and is now within five percent of its alignment pathway. Shipping is on track, and steel and cement are also within five percent of their alignment pathways. This leaves our commercial real estate in the Netherlands, for which we set targets several years ago, and our residential real estate (mortgages) portfolios 'off track', compared to their respective sector alignment pathways. As we have just expanded our commercial real estate targets to also cover our wholesale banking book, and our oil & gas to mid- and downstream, we will present our progress against this target in upcoming reports. In these sectors, the achievement of milestones and targets is heavily dependent on external factors like the decarbonisation of national power grids, international alignment on energy performance certificates, and changes in client and customer behaviour. We once again make a strong call to governments and regulators to mandate and incentivise the changes necessary to accelerate the net zero transition in real estate and other sectors.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\nThe process for reporting on Terra consists of several steps. Internal data relating to our portfolio composition is made available soon after ING's year-end close. External data relating to climate performances is collected later (often between May and September) when this data becomes available. For this reason, our actual performance considering year-end financial information and climate-related information is only available well after the annual report is published and is shared in a separate climate publication. The overall reporting process includes checking the external data for consistency and matching it with internal data. A year-on-year portfolio comparison is made to analyse fluctuations at company or asset level for each sector. This helps us to understand the drivers behind any changes, which can usually be attributed to the climate performance of clients, the composition of sector portfolios and improvements in methodologies. When necessary, scenarios and targets are updated in line with scientific updates to the decarbonisation pathways aimed at keeping global temperature rises within the necessary limits for a sustainable future.\n\nOnce the process is complete, we draft a progress report, which is incorporated into our integrated climate report. In the report, we published our per-sector transition plans for the first time. These detail our current and intended actions in support of clients and customers, in collaboration with industry and the market, and in engagement with government and policy-makers. We make specific calls on sector level to governments and regulators to more firmly guide the transition with harmonised policies and incentives that accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy. The report, approved at Board level, was published in October 2023.\n\nWe utilise external data vendors for the sourcing of information related to all Terra sectors (with the exception of upstream oil & gas). Our data vendors have procedures and methodologies in place to perform checks and controls on their data. The data processes and models of our data vendors are not audited, which means that regardless of their checks and controls, data limitations may still exist. Although we perform our own reviews and sanity checks, our procedures cannot fully mitigate the risk of applying inaccurate, incorrect and/or incomplete data. For some sectors, like residential and commercial real estate and mid- and downstream oil & gas, we also make use of proxies and modelling assumptions in our measurements where the data is not available or partly available from our data vendors. Proxies are often sector-average emissions intensities published by governmental agencies. In some cases, the proxy data used for certain countries is based on public data sources from a specific district within that country. Furthermore, these sector-average emissions intensity proxies often may not coincide with the current reporting period, which could lead to over- or understating the portfolio emissions intensity.\n\n## Sector transition plans for portfolio-level impact\n\nTo clarify our sector strategies and approaches to net-zero targets, we have devised transition plans for each of the sectors in scope of Terra (sector transition plans). These help us to translate sector strategies and targets into tangible actions and drive portfolio-level alignment with net-zero-by-2050 pathways. Tailored plans to each sector take into account the specific conditions, opportunities and challenges of that industry. They are also consistent in that they all strive to create alignment, will drive action and make\n\nimpact at three levels: with clients, with the market/industry (and our peers active in the respective industries), and with governments and policy-makers - with a fourth element being the upskilling of our colleagues.\n\nTo be able to better assess the climate performance of our clients, and then use these insights to identify risks and opportunities for supporting clients in their transitions, we have developed a bespoke 'client transition plan' tool. This online platform is where we've started to centrally collect, assess and monitor publicly disclosed climate transition plans of our largest corporate clients, starting with those in scope of Terra. The transition plan data collected includes, where possible, historic emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3), commitments, targets, action and investment plans, governance and strategy (such as low-emission products and services). The data is sourced from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the Science-Based Targets initiative and public sustainability reports, and where possible including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, targets and investment plans of each client, starting with those in scope of Terra and eventually expanding to cover all Wholesale Banking clients. By aggregating this information, we can engage in data-driven discussions with our clients that should lead to greater impact. The tool will also help make our credit approval process more efficient.\n\n## Challenges facing our sector transition plans\n\nEach sector for which we have introduced specific transition plans faces unique challenges on its route to net zero. Our sector teams, together with ING's Economics department, have identified policy interventions that we believe are necessary for each sector to achieve its net-zero goals. In steering our own portfolio, we are dependent on these external actions to meet the 2030 and 2050 targets we have set.\n\n## Power generation\n\nThe sector is facing various hurdles, including increased costs, delays in issuing permits, availability of land, and wider supply-chain bottlenecks. Given that the actions described below typically have long lead-times, urgent government action is required.\n\nMaximise solar and wind energy: via permissions and funding incentives like contracts for difference (CfDs). Boost power storage technologies such as batteries and hydrogen via hydrogen infrastructure and, where necessary, provide subsidies.\n\nCO2 infrastructure: grant permits and build infrastructure for carbon capture and storage (CCS) on existing waste and biomass incineration plants to create negative emissions.\n\nPower grids: expand, strengthen and modernise (high voltage) power grids to prepare for increased electricity demand, rapid renewable capacity build-out and extreme weather conditions. This includes the use of batteries for grid support.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\nDynamic pricing: for corporates and for consumers, to better match the supply and demand of highly variable output from renewable power sources (solar and wind).\n\n## Oil & gas\n\nThe challenges we see in this sector include:\n\nReduce methane (CH4) emissions : This can include binding commitments and the implementation of norms and regulations, as well as bringing in additional countries to the Global Methane Pledge. Reducing methane leaks to the atmosphere is the single most important and cost-effective way to bring down these emissions. There are also opportunities in the elimination of routine flaring during crude oil extraction and integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into oil & gas production.\n\nMaximise carbon capture and storage (CCS) : The pace of decarbonisation of fossil fuels can be hastened by harnessing the potential for CCS. For this, both permissions and infrastructure are required - in the oil & gas industry, and also in 'hard to abate' energy-intensive sectors that remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels like the cement, steel and petrochemicals industry. Many net-zero and 'true greening technologies' still take years to scale-up before they have a sizable impact on emission reduction, and in the meantime, CCS is an important bridging technology.\n\nMaximise hydrogen (H2), biomethane and advanced biofuels : These present near-term opportunities to supply the energy system benefits of oil & gas without additional carbon emissions. According to the IEA, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for 13 percent of total energy supply by 2030 for the world to be on track for net-zero emissions by 2050. We are seeing increased support for hydrogen, for instance from the European Commission, which created the European Hydrogen Bank to 'guarantee' a price for H2 off take. However, member state and EU support mechanisms are not always aligned.\n\n## Cement\n\nAccording to the IEA Tracking Clean Energy Progress report, the global cement industry is not on track to meet its net-zero targets. The report shows that the direct CO2 emissions intensity of cement production has been broadly flat over the last five years. Major policy developments of the last year (such as the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Industrial Plan) hold promise for reducing emissions from the cement sector, but more cooperation between advanced and developing economies is needed to establish effective climate policies and prevent carbon leakage. Development and deployment of low-carbon technology innovation - such as low clinker cement, carbon capture and storage, and electric kilns - needs to be stimulated, together with emerging technologies in material efficiency and cement recycling.\n\n## Steel\n\nFor the steel sector to be able to reach its net-zero targets, clear regulation that incentivises and supports the substantial investments needed in new technology is essential. In addition, the transition the sector is going through requires green electricity and hydrogen infrastructure. Cooperation between developed countries on carbon pricing and border taxes will be required to avoid carbon leakage in the initial phase, after which the knowledge gained should be used to support other major markets like China and India in their transition.\n\n## Automotive\n\nGiven the global footprint of the automotive industry, the following steps should be undertaken swiftly and aligned across the major regional markets of China, Europe and the USA.\n\nElectrification : continue to stimulate the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), by setting norms and phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs), with the aim to gain scale in EV production, stimulate the development of product ranges, and reduce the relative total cost of ownership (TCO)/km of EVs.\n\nInfrastructure : invest in the accelerated roll-out of EV-related (charging) infrastructure, shift subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable power, establish localised battery value chains and promote circular practices to secure resources in the long term.\n\nDecarbonise EV value chain : enforce EV battery recycling and hold both manufacturers and mining companies accountable for decarbonising their production processes.\n\nBehavioural change : incentivise the replacement of existing ICEs and stimulate the production of energy efficient EVs by introducing CO2-related road-charging systems, as well as encouraging the use of public transport and car-sharing. Educate and inform car owners of the lower total cost of ownership of EVs versus ICEs.\n\n## Shipping\n\nIn steering our own portfolio we are dependent on these external actions to address challenges in the shipping sector, to meet the 2030 and 2050 targets we've set.\n\nEfficiency in fleet and voyages : significantly reduce carbon intensity of vessels and voyages through increased efficiency measures in the short term (such as energy-saving devices, 'slow steaming', use of shore-power in ports and voyage optimisation).",

    {
        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\nAvailability of alternative fuels : scale up availability of low(er) carbon fuels in ports, including drop-in fuels for existing vessels. Mandate alternative-fuel-capable new builds and retrofits for operating on low carbon fuels (produced through green pathways) including hydrogen-based e-fuels. Promote green shipping corridors to create demand for alternative fuels.\n\n## Aviation\n\nActions to engage with government and policy makers are needed to meet net-zero targets. For example, via IMPACT, there is a need to advocate for reporting standards for airlines and lessors to create more transparency and consistency. There is also a need for more research into policy, regulatory and market trends to monitor developments in pricing schemes and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).\n\n## Residential real estate\n\nReaching net-zero milestones in residential real estate is largely dependent on the national energy mix of the countries where the homes are located, and requires governments and institutions to accelerate the installation of new renewable electricity capacity and shift away from fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nGovernments also have a primary role to play in driving changes in consumer behaviour by mandating, incentivising, and supporting homeowners to make sustainability an integral consideration when constructing or renovating their homes. While the take-up of our sustainable housing products and services has shown the promise of change to come, we note that demand among customers is still not at the level required to drive the transition.\n\nWe continue to engage with government and regulators, like in Australia, where we participate in discussions with government and banking sector peers to advocate for improvements to the data and systems used to understand household energy use.\n\nIn both the Netherlands and Belgium, we participate in round-table discussions with government on how to finance improvements in energy efficiency, also participating in regional Belgian working groups aimed at accelerating sustainable home renovations.\n\nAt EU level we've contributed (as a member of the steering committee) to the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group and to the evolving Energy Performance Buildings Directive (EPBD), and generally seek opportunities to engage on energy efficiency policy.\n\n## Commercial real estate\n\nEU legislation on sustainability in real estate, including climate-related policies, is being developed (for example the 2021 revision of the EPBD, adopted in early 2023), however the requirements for the real estate sector from current legislation are still limited, and sometimes voluntary.\n\nWe therefore believe that it is necessary to urgently implement a blend of subsidies, regulations and norms that incentivise the deployment of decarbonisation measures (like insulation and heat pumps) and limit transition risks.\n\nWe also see the need for norms and regulation on data measurement and disclosure. Data measurement is a precondition for managing CO2 emissions. The real estate sector should be required to measure and disclose the CO2 emissions of buildings, and define strategies to fill in 'data gaps'. Sound data measurement is not only needed to reduce emissions, but is also a way to anticipate (future) legal reporting requirements. Data quality and disclosures should be ensured via central registration.\n\nCarbon pricing : introduce market-based mechanisms such as a global carbon pricing to incentivise the takeup of alternative fuels, bring about drastic reduction of emissions, and provide price parity for low-carbon fuels.\n\n## Nature\n\nNature is all around us. It's essential for our existence, good quality of life, and economic prosperity. Biodiversity, which is the variety of and interaction between all living things on earth, gives nature strength and resilience.\n\nOur nature approach builds on our Terra approach on climate. We aim to integrate nature in the structures we've already put in place for climate action, and in our sustainability approach in general. Climate change is one of the drivers of nature loss; with our updated approach we aim to address other main drivers as well. We've identified three objectives that support this, focusing on the impact we have through our loans to companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Managing risk and impacts;\n- \u00b7 Promoting 'nature-mainstreaming' internally and externally.\n- \u00b7 Steering our portfolio and engaging with clients;\n\nWith our approach on nature, we aim to take impactful steps to contribute to halting and ultimately reversing nature loss. See our Nature publication on ING.com for the updated approach, our ambitions, objectives, actions and methodologies in more detail.",

We use financed emissions and intensity metrics in a complementary way. Analysing financed emissions helps us to identity hotspots in our portfolios. For the relevant hotspots, where available data and methodologies allow, we select the most suitable methodology and metric to apply to each sector's activities as per our Terra toolbox approach.\n\nWe calculate our absolute financed emissions using the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, developed by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). Emissions data and financial data are input for our absolute financed emissions calculation. We gather emissions data from, among others, PCAF and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and financial data from internal databases and Standard & Poor (S&P) Capital IQ.\n\nThe following tables show ING's financed emissions per asset class and business line. The tables present our outstandings as of 31 December 2023 and how much of these outstandings we have been able to measure against climate data, and for which we were able to calculate the absolute financed emissions. For example, looking at Commercial Real Estate WB, we were able to calculate the absolute financed emissions for 73.1 percent of the portfolio. For the remaining 26.9 percent this was not possible due to the unavailability of data. Overall, we have calculated the absolute financed emissions for 97.1 percent of our portfolio.\n\n## Financed emissions 2023 based on NAICS codes\n\n| Asset Class                         |   Outstanding  in EUR billion |   Measured  in EUR billion | Outstanding  coverage   | Financed  emissions in kt  CO2e  1   |   PCAF data  quality score |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Residential Real Estate (Mortgages) |                         332.4 |                      332   | 99.9  %                 | 6,034                                |                        3.4 |\n| Commercial Real Estate WB           |                          22.7 |                       16.6 | 73.1  %                 | 421                                  |                        3.2 |\n| Commercial Real Estate BB           |                          23.7 |                       11.6 | 49.0  %                 | 272                                  |                        3   |\n| Business Loans - Wholesale banking  |                         191.4 |                      191   | 99.8  %                 | 39,772                               |                        3.7 |\n| Business Loans - Retail banking     |                          76.8 |                       76.8 | 100.0  %                | 10,789                               |                        5   |\n| Total Lending in scope              |                         647   |                      628.1 | 97.1 %                  | 57,288                               |                        3.7 |\n| Total Equity Investments            |                           3.6 |                        3.5 | 99.0  %                 | 78                                   |                        5   |\n| Total Corporate bonds               |                           1   |                        1   | 100.0  %                | 263                                  |                        5   |\n\n| Asset Class                                     |   Outstanding  in EUR billion | Measured in  EUR billion   | Outstanding  coverage   | Financed  emissions in  kt CO2e  1   |   PCAF data  quality score |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Residential Real Estate (Mortgages)             |                         326.9 | 326.9                      | 100%                    | 7,018                                |                        3.8 |\n| Commercial Real Estate (incl.

This year we included, in addition to the outstandings, the emissions associated with our Commercial Real Estate (CRE) portfolio. The CRE outstandings (WB and BB) for 2023 include secured loans for the entire CRE portfolio, whereas in 2022 this was partly reported in the Business Loans - Retail Banking portfolio. Due to data limitations, we did not publish emissions related to sovereign debt, however we plan to include this in our next reporting.\n\nThis year's calculations for ING resulted in an estimate of 57.3 million tons of CO2e, including our clients' scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. We plan to also disclose scope 3 emissions of our clients in line with PCAF, and EBA pillar 3 reports to be published in the third quarter of 2024. More than 99 percent of the emissions are associated with our lending book portfolio, while the remaining part is associated with our equity and corporate bonds book. In 2023, the financed emissions associated with ING's lending books decreased by almost 7 percent compared to 2022. These results are not easily comparable due to fluctuations caused by (i) changes in outstandings of our clients, (ii) changes in financial data (i.e. Enterprise Value (EVIC) and other balance sheet financial indicators), (iii) fluctuations in FX movements and (iv) other data quality improvements.\n\nThe outstanding amounts per asset class are based on our credit risk exposures which are also used for our risk management reporting as at year-end 2023. PCAF defines investments and financial instruments, which are the basis for financed emissions reporting. Applying these definitions, result in a revised scope and outstanding amounts than disclosed in other sections of this report, such as the Consolidated Financial Statement and the Risk Management section. For example, while the exposure to corporate guarantees are included in the risk management exposures, they are excluded in the financed emissions tables in accordance with PCAF. Please refer to the 'ESG appendix' for further details such as a breakdown per (economic) sector of our lending portfolio, applied methodologies and data limitations.",

An important part of this role is to work with clients and help them achieve their sustainability goals, and where possible in line with science-based trajectories.\n\nOur strategy builds on the following crucial pillars for our success:\n\n- \u00b7 Partnerships in the evolving sustainable finance markets, be it with regulators, other banks or corporations to set standards that increase transparency for the market. We cannot transition alone and therefore we deem partnerships with our peers and governments as one of the most important pillars.\n- \u00b7 Measure our own progress by continuously reporting on our main strategic objective: to increase volume mobilised to support the transition.\n- \u00b7 Tailoring our products to the needs of our clients. We recognise the diversity of our lending book where strong sector expertise is required to match our well-established and leading sustainable finance expertise. Therefore, we work together across teams to develop innovative new products that anticipate and meet the needs of our clients and support their sustainable actions.\n- \u00b7 Engaging with individual clients to understand their sustainability strategies and transition plans, support them to connect within their value chains, jointly working to meet global targets set in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals and adhere to ESG regulations.\n\nThrough our sustainable finance activities, we aim to deliver on our main ambition - reaching net zero by 2050 through the engagement we have with our clients. We recognise that green is not always black and white and that delivering on this commitment is not an easy task. As the world of sustainable finance is maturing, so are we and we are continuously adapting to new market standards, data availability and quality and the availability of sector-specific pathways that can accelerate our sustainable transition.\n\n## Developments in the sustainable finance market\n\n2023 was a year where sustainable finance markets around the world significantly evolved. From the Green Light Committee, to the Green Bond Standard by EU Member states, to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that requires asset managers to improve ESG fund disclosures. A global wave of regulatory proposals has impacted how we do our business. All these developments are aimed to increase transparency, establish market norms and above all, to prevent greenwashing in the sustainable finance market.\n\nSpecifically, product-based market standards have provided guidance on how we engage with our clients. ING welcomes the market-led standards from the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), the Loan Market Association (LMA) and the Loan Syndications and Trading Associations (LSTA) and the greenwashing\n\nguidance from supervisors like the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The additional guidance sets a market precedent and a minimum standard, which enables us to engage with our clients, but also other banks in a similar way.\n\nAn important development earlier in 2023 was the update to the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles, set up by a working group, including ING and led by the LMA. The update provides enhanced guidance on structuring a sustainability-linked loan. In addition, the LMA has helped standardisation efforts by providing legal language for loan agreements that all banks should use when describing SLL structures in loan documentation.\n\nWhat remains less specifically defined is the term 'sustainable' as well as 'transition finance', especially on what attributes are required for a particular asset or project to be classified as 'green', 'environmental', 'sustainable', 'social' or any similar label. A basis for the determination of such a definition has been established in the EU with the publication in the Official Journal of the EU on 22 June 2020 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 (the 'Sustainable Finance Taxonomy Regulation') on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy'). We follow such regulations closely and encourage our clients to do the same.\n\n## How we measure our contribution: sustainable volumes mobilised\n\nIn the absence of clear definitions on the terminology and use of the term 'sustainable', ING defined 'volume mobilised' as the internal and external measurement of progress. We are committed to supporting our clients in their sustainable transition through our product offering and set ourselves the target to mobilise \u20ac125 billion of volume by 2025. We differentiate between green and social products and sustainabilitylinked products. For green and social products, the proceeds are dedicated to finance assets that are in line with the Green or Social Loan/Bond Principles, hence, financing a specific sustainable economic activity. Sustainability-linked products are a client engagement product and designed to change the behaviour of a client and steer their transition. The Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles by the LMA are the main market guidance. Our product offering applies to our lending, as well as to our investment activities on capital markets. For more information on the detailed methodology, please see the 'ESG appendix'.\n\nIn 2023 we mobilised \u20ac115 billion of volumes for our clients that contributes to their transition. This is up from \u20ac101 billion in 2022. The total number of sustainability transactions we supported in 2023 was 792, up nearly 62 percent from 491 in 2022, where sustainability-linked loans and bonds, green loans and bonds are the four main categories that make up the vast majority of volume mobilised. Additional information on the scope, definition and methodology of volume mobilised is included in the ESG appendix and can be found on our website: www.ing.com/Sustainability/Performance-and-reporting.htm",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Supporting our clients through green and social financing structures\n\nWe believe that by financing dedicated proceeds to green and/or social investments, we can significantly accelerate a green economy.\n\nGreen financing solutions, such as green bonds and loans, form an integral part of our sustainable finance strategy as they are used to fund specific green or sustainable projects. To make sure the proceeds of the loans and bonds are allocated to activities which have a positive impact on our environment, we structure our Green Loans and Green Bonds according to the market-accepted practices, in particular the Green Loan/ Bond Principles, and align them where possible with the EU Taxonomy. These principles give guidance on eligible categories for green financing, as well as guidance on the allocation process for proceeds and how to report on the allocation.\n\nOur sustainability efforts are also directed towards the social aspects of helping customers and society stay a step ahead of the challenges they face. Social loans and bonds focus on providing funding for social projects which aim to address or mitigate a specific social issue. They can also seek to achieve positive social outcomes for specific demographic groups, such as access to healthcare in low-income countries. For this, we also use the Social Loan/Bond principles for guidance.\n\nOur sustainable finance experts work across sectors to harness innovation and disruptive technologies that have the potential to accelerate the transition of our clients and our portfolio to net zero. They collaborate with our global sector coverage colleagues to achieve this, complemented by teams and centres of expertise dedicated to particular emerging themes. For example, the Sustainable Value Chains team, created in May 2023, aims to investigate and capitalise on new business opportunities that cut across existing and new value chains.\n\n## Green bond framework funding green through ING's green bond framework\n\nTo support the growth of our green finance portfolio, and to meet green funding needs, ING issues green bonds, supported by our green bond framework. The framework aligns with the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (GBP). We intend to allocate the proceeds of our green bonds to an Eligible Green Loan Portfolio of new and existing loans including renewable energy projects and green buildings.\n\nUnder this framework, ING Group and its subsidiaries can issue any debt security (such as senior bonds, subordinated bonds, covered bonds, commercial papers and medium-term notes) to finance and refinance assets and projects which aim to contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and our own sustainability. ING established its sustainable debt strategy via the publication of the framework. Since then, we have continued to take steps to enhance our sustainable debt strategy and see it as an important tool in supporting the growth of our own sustainable finance portfolio.\n\nIn alignment with the ICMA's 2021 GBPs, the framework is presented through four pillars: use of proceeds, process for project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. The framework also follows the recommendations of the Green Bond Principles regarding external review.\n\n## Supporting our clients through sustainability-linked structures\n\nSustainability-linked loans/ bonds (SLLs) link interest margins to a company's sustainability performance through mutually agreed KPIs and pre-defined annual performance targets. This mechanism enables ING to support, motivate and reward or punish clients in their aim to become more sustainable. ING is the creator of the sustainability-linked loan, pioneering it in 2017 for Philips. The original loan was linked to the improvement of Philips's Sustainalytics ESG rating and later converted into a KPI-linked loan with KPIs aligned with Philips's sustainability goals for lives improved, lives improved in underserved communities, circular revenues, and operational carbon footprint.\n\nImproved market standards and guidelines support us in having more focused discussions with our clients regarding defining KPIs and address the most material ESG topics of our clients through meaningful and ambitious sustainability performance targets. We ask our clients to externally verify sustainability performance targets in line with the Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles by the Loan Market Association (LMA). We believe that through the annual check-in on targets and continuous client dialogue, we have the chance to support our clients' transitions from up close, thereby also delivering on our own strategy. As the originator of the sustainability-linked loan, we strive to keep standards for the use of sustainability-linked instruments high and welcome all initiatives to strengthen and protect the credibility of the sustainabilitylinked loan market. For more information on ING's stance towards sustainability-linked structures, please refer to our 2021 Position Paper: www.ingwb.com/binaries/content/assets/insights/themes/sustainablefinance/the\\_credibility\\_of\\_the\\_sustainability-linked\\_loan\\_and\\_bond\\_markets-position\\_paper\\_ingwb.pdf. In 2023, sustainability-linked loans accounted for nearly 41 percent of the financing volume mobilised by ING that contributes to our clients' transitions to more sustainable business models. For more information on the process of KPI selection for SLLs, please see our 2023 Climate Report on ing.com.\n\n## Supporting our clients through ESG advisory\n\nBesides financial support, we help clients navigate the rapidly changing regulatory landscape and advise on their net-zero strategy. Clients benefit from our deep and broad experience built up over the years helping other companies on ESG-related journeys. Some clients are ahead of the curve and for them we frequently act as a sounding board, alongside our financing-related role. Other clients are at the early stages of their sustainability journey. For them, we provide guidance based on our market experience and suggest areas where they can make impact to become aligned with climate pathways and their peers. The core services we offer through our ESG Advisory expertise are centered around ESG strategy advisory, ESG rating advisory, ESG reporting advisory and ESG product advisory.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Other ways to support our clients\n\nWe also look for other ways to support clients taking steps to achieve their sustainability ambitions and anticipate the future economy. Many of these ambitions are based on innovative technologies, business models or client propositions that have a higher risk profile and are not yet suitable for standard financing solutions. ING supports clients with their sustainability goals by providing risk-bearing capital, offering a wide range of tailor-made financial solutions, including equity (investments) and subordinated debt. In addition to this, we help drive the necessary net zero-supporting innovation by functioning as a laboratory for new sustainable technologies and business models in need of financing within the EMEA region, with a focus on circular economy, bio-chemicals, waste and water, and other sustainable development projects.\n\n## Product offerings for Retail Banking\n\nIn Retail Banking, we aim to help customers transition to a low-carbon environment. While we have provided sustainability products and services in Retail Banking since 2017, in the last two years we have introduced sustainable banking products across our markets, following a sustainable alternative products roadmap, to facilitate this transition. It is our aim to have sustainable alternatives for our main retail products in all markets by 2025.\n\n## Product offerings for Retail - Private Individuals\n\nSustainable housing is one of our main priorities in this area. Residential real estate represents one of the more carbon-intensive sectors that we lend to. Therefore, it is an opportunity for us to work together with our customers to reduce the CO2e intensity of their homes.\n\nWe aim to steer our work in this area as part of our Terra approach, towards delivery of ING's overall netzero commitment by 2050 - including intermediate 2030 ambitions. To reach net zero, homes in ING's mortgages portfolio should reach an average CO2e intensity of 16.8 kg CO2e/m2 in 2030 and 0.3 kg CO2e/ m2 in 2050. These milestones are informed by our convergence pathway, with the latest net zero pathways published by the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM V2.02). We aim to steer our mortgage portfolio in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Poland, Spain, and Australia, representing around 96 percent of our mortgages book (excluding WestlandUtrecht Bank) in terms of outstanding.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to work on this priority, covering how we finance customers to change, provide inspiration and information that helps them in this process, and finally how we engage with partners and governments to support ecosystem change. Such engagement with external stakeholders helps to inform the choices we make, particularly related to how we connect our customers with renovation service providers.\n\nTo limit negative consequences and empower our customers to realise the positive impacts of making their homes more sustainable, we offer sustainable mortgages that incentivise customers to choose energy-\n\nefficient homes in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Spain. In Poland, we continued to support customers in making sustainable decisions with a mortgage for energy-saving houses. In the Netherlands, we launched a new renovation mortgage, which, for example, allows customers to increase their loan-to-value to help cover the cost of renovations. We also continued to offer unsecured sustainable consumer loans that can be used for energy-efficiency renovations in Belgium, Luxembourg and Poland, extending this offer to Germany in 2023. In Romania, we provide incentives for the installation of solar panels.\n\nIn addition to our own financing, we contribute to efforts that connect homeowners to public financing - like our financing (through our Business Banking lending) of the Warmtefonds (National Heat Fund), which aims to have both a positive environmental and social impact by enabling low-income households in the Netherlands to make their homes more sustainable. In 2023, ING made a further \u20ac200 million in financing available to the National Heat Fund.\n\nWe also provide customers with a range of tools and platforms that can support them in their renovation efforts. This includes providing access to renovation platforms that help customers determine what renovation actions to take, link them to renovation contractors, and connect them to financing to pay for the necessary improvements. These platforms include homeQgo in the Netherlands, CFP in Belgium (through our mortgage advisers) and a renovation calculator built in partnership with KfW Bank in Germany .\n\nWe strive to raise awareness and educate customers, and have made increasing amounts of information available. In Belgium, for example, we have launched a Sustainable Buildings Guide, a free digital tool that helps customers identify which investments to make to improve the energy performance of their homes. We are also providing renovation-related insights to customers via email newsletters and our websites. In the Netherlands, our web pages on sustainable housing have been visited more than 200,000 times.\n\nWe also continue to build our customer advisory services, for example in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany where we provide training to mortgage advisers on eco-renovations so they can better advise customers interested in improving the sustainability of their homes. For more information on our sustainable housing approach, see our 2023 Climate Report on ing.com.\n\nWe monitor the effectiveness of each of these efforts at the country level, and collectively aim to steer on those through a Net Zero Housing Committee, which brings together representatives from our largest mortgage markets, and colleagues from ESG Risk, Retail Banking, and Sustainability. A key insight we have learned from all our efforts is that renovating homes to improve energy efficiency is a massive challenge for homeowners (particularly those most vulnerable) and housing renovation companies, and requires significant government intervention to regulate, incentivise, and support the process. Accordingly, ING is committed to increasing our engagement with government and other stakeholders to create more momentum towards such renovations in society.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Product offerings for Retail - Business Banking\n\nWe are helping Business Banking customers make their businesses future-proof, by offering loans and leasing solutions for sustainable purposes (e.g. transition to renewable energy, sustainable real estate, electric vehicles). Our ambition is to offer relevant sustainable financing alternatives in all countries and segments and grow our new production of sustainable financing from approximately \u20ac1 billion today to over \u20ac2 billion by 2025.\n\nTo offer relevant solutions for all customer segments, our product offering ranges from instant sustainable loans for the self-employed and micro companies, to tailor-made sustainable loans and lease solutions for SMEs and mid-corporates. Products such as sustainable loans, sustainable lease solutions and sustainability improvement loans are now offered in the Netherlands, Belgium, Romania, Poland, T\u00fcrkiye and Luxembourg. A key development in 2023 was a new agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) making \u20ac600 million available for new sustainable loans and leases, at favourable interest rates, to SMEs in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to boost sustainability.\n\nIn the Netherlands, we continue to build on our successful real estate platform that helps customers gain insights on their commercial real estate, provide actionable insights and advice to improve their energy performance while providing financing solutions. We have scaled this platform to Belgium and are exploring further ways to extend it to other markets and sectors.\n\nAnother notable development in 2023 was the launch of a carbon footprint calculator in Poland, which helps SMEs calculate their carbon footprint using their own data on energy consumption, raw materials, and resource use.\n\n## Manage climate and environmental risks\n\nManaging our climate (and other environmental) risks is a key element of our climate approach and ING's overall strategy. We have invested a significant amount of time and resources in developing our capabilities and expertise in this emerging and fast-developing area of risk, and strive for continuous improvement.\n\nING's integrated climate approach considers how we can mitigate climate change through our financing as well as how climate change may adversely impact our business. We're working to become more resilient to climate risk, and have the ambition to become an expert in managing and mitigating these risks as we are in managing credit and other forms of financial risk.\n\nClimate risk can impact the macro-economy, businesses, and individual households. Ultimately, physical and transition risks could impact our balance sheet and profitability. Our approach is focused on consistently embedding climate risk considerations across our global organisation, aiming to make it an integral part of how we do business.\n\nOver the near-term time horizon, we plan to continue refining our methodologies to evaluate climate risks and opportunities. We're working on putting into practice quantitative methodologies for climate and environmental (C&E) risk identification, materiality assessment and risk appetite setting. This is supported by the integration of C&E risk considerations in risk policies and procedures, our ESG Risk Framework.\n\nGoing forward we aim to further enhance our climate and environmental risk management by:\n\n- \u00b7 Continuing to address the expectations of the European Central Bank (ECB) Guide on climate-related and environmental risk;\n- \u00b7 Continuing to close the gaps on climate risk data;\n- \u00b7 Improving our understanding and assessment of the impact of other environmental factors such as biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 Identifying opportunities to support our customers who face transition or physical climate risks;\n- \u00b7 Building up capacity and upskilling colleagues to understand and deal with the impacts of climate and environmental risks.\n\nRead more on ESG risk structure and governance in 'Risk management'.\n\n## Meeting ECB expectations\n\nThe European Central Bank expects all banks to be aligned with the 13 expectations outlined in the ECB's guide on climate-related and environmental risk. We are currently addressing these, and aim to be aligned with the ECB's expectations by the end-of-2024 deadline.\n\n## Continuing to close data gaps\n\nClimate-related data is essential to fully understand and manage C&E risks and to report in line with current and upcoming regulations on ESG disclosures. To keep improving our assessment methods for both physical and transition risk, we need detailed data from our counterparties, including data on specific assets and regions, their vulnerability to risks, and the actions they are taking to mitigate these risks. We have partnered with various external data providers and have launched internal initiatives to source data directly from our clients and suppliers. Data quality poses a universal challenge for companies and financial institutions managing climate and environmental risk.\n\n## Understanding and assessing interlinkages and dependencies\n\nBiodiversity loss is inextricably linked to climate change, and our approach to ESG risk includes managing nature-related risks. We aim to introduce further granularity in our biodiversity hotspot analysis, and have been testing an approach for measuring biodiversity impact which we expect to give us more detailed insight into the sectors in our portfolio that are both most dependent on and most impacted by biodiversity.",

        "page_content": "- > Environment\n\n## Supporting customers\n\n## Sustainable investing services\n\nWe're currently developing an online platform to centrally collect, assess and monitor the publicly disclosed climate transition plans of our clients. This platform will rely on information sourced from the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the Science Based Targets initiative and clients' own public sustainability reports. By aggregating this information, we'll improve our insights into our clients' transition plans, and be better able to identify both risks and opportunities - enabling us to better support our clients in mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change.\n\n## Sustainability related disclosure requirements\n\n## Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the investment funds at ING, which are following the disclosures according to Article 8 or 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), accounted for 58 percent of total client assets (assets under management and/or custody) in funds distributed in EU markets. These funds were purchased by our customers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland and Italy.\n\nING is undertaking many efforts to create transparency and facilitate the transition of products using the SFDR framework. For example, during 2023 ING launched an Article 9, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Impact fund, aimed at investors who want to make a positive contribution to the sustainability factors of people, the environment and society with their investments. The fund is available in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany and is managed by the experts of ING's Investments Office. ING Impact funds joined our efforts during 2023 in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nWe disclose the ratio of client assets in SFDR Article 8 and 9 funds of total client assets in funds, to provide insights and transparency into our clients' portfolios. According to SFDR, Article 8 refers to a fund promoting, among other characteristics, environmental, social or a combination of those characteristics. Article 9, according to SFDR, refers to funds with sustainable investments, or a reduction in carbon emissions, as its objective. For funds managed by third-party asset managers, we rely on information provided by them, with no further review of the classification by ING.\n\nEssentially, SFDR is a disclosure regulation and does not yet reflect a level of sustainability of funds. Leveraging on extensive data points provided through SFDR as well as complementary analyses, ING continues to develop methodologies to present customers with an even more insightful and transparent view on their investments, while monitoring regulatory developments, including the supervisory authorities' guidance. Eventually, it is through collaboration with asset managers, distributors, regulators, and investee companies that we can achieve a transparent market standard for our retail customers.\n\nING is a signatory to the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment and as a provider of investor services to our Retail Banking customers, we are committed to incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decisions, policies and processes that underpin these services.\n\nWe have been reporting on sustainable investing services (SIS) for more than a decade. Over the past years, new regulations and definitions of sustainable investing have been introduced, such as the EU Taxonomy, the Sustainable Financial Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). We continue to enrich our SIS methodology, developed by ING using a diverse set of ESG criteria, leveraging regulation and integrating it in our SIS methodology.\n\nDuring 2023, ING's SIS applied to our biggest sustainable investment markets: the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany, with total sustainable investments valued at \u20ac16.0 billion, up from \u20ac14.7 billion in 2022. The increase was influenced by the overall market performance of equities and bonds, which increased by 12 percent on average.\n\nOur services cover all asset classes including dedicated portfolios, investment funds and structured products, available in brokerage, advisory and discretionary management propositions. Read more about our sustainable investment services on ing.com.\n\nAs regulations and market standards constantly evolve, ING is investigating various ways of categorising and reporting on SIS and we are monitoring regulatory developments. We believe that transparency, uniformity and collaboration are needed from all market participants, to create a meaningful reporting standard for customers, which can easily be benchmarked against other investments.\n\n## Integration of the EU Taxonomy regulation\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU Taxonomy) is a published regulation in the Official Journal (Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of 18 June 2020) of the European Commission (EC). This regulation is introducing a reporting obligation for corporates to disclose environmentally sustainable economic activities based on the six environmental goals set out by the EC. The EU Taxonomy is part of the EC's overarching Green Deal and serves as a common classification system for economic activities.\n\nNext to the overarching regulation, the two main concepts of the EU Taxonomy for corporates subject to reporting, eligibility and alignment, are introduced in Article 8, Delegated Act EU 2021/2178 (DA). An asset is deemed eligible when the activity is described in the DA, after which an assessment can be performed on whether the asset is also aligned. In order to be aligned, an eligible asset is assessed against the following criteria:",

Based on the capex KPI, this eligibility ratio is 44 percent. The detailed breakdown, which is included in the ESG appendix, shows how ING assesses balance sheet items through the lens of the EU Taxonomy. These EU Taxonomy aligned assets are used to calculate our Green Asset Ratio. This ratio shows the aligned assets as a percentage of the total assets in scope of the GAR. Our Green Asset Ratio (GAR) is 7 percent as per 31 December 2023.\n\nING's largest exposure is derived from private households. In line with 2022, our global residential mortgage portfolio is EU Taxonomy (EUT) eligible. The EUT-aligned assets predominantly consist of residential mortgages in the Netherlands and Germany. The alignment is mainly determined by energy labels (EPClabels) and where not available, is based on the top 15 percent of the most energy efficient buildings. In the Netherlands, the availability of energy labels is good compared to other countries, which has resulted in a relatively high percentage of mortgages with an A label. For the Dutch portfolio, we have also included the mortgages that are in the top 15 percent. In Germany the majority of the EUT-aligned mortgages are in the top 15 percent of the most energy efficient buildings in Germany.\n\nIt is important to recognise that our climate action objectives, amongst others, are steered by the Terra approach and our sustainable finance products and services differ in scope from the EU Taxonomy. The regulatory required templates for EU Taxonomy are included in the 'ESG appendix'.\n\n## Limitations\n\nRegulations and interpretation thereof regarding the EU Taxonomy are still evolving. This is demonstrated by the publication of the draft commission notice published by the European Commission on 21 December 2023.

We believe financially healthy people contribute to a healthy economy and drive social progress, which is why we aim to support customers in meeting their financial commitments now, while building their financial security for tomorrow. We believe every person deserves to be treated with dignity and have their interests considered equally.\n\nWe can help address social challenges as a financier, employer, service provider, and driver of progress and prosperity. We consider our social priorities to begin with our employees, including diversity, equity and inclusion, learning and development, engagement and well-being. The satisfaction and financial health of our customers is also central to our social contribution, as is our commitment in society to human rights and financial inclusion.\n\n## Unlocking our people's full potential\n\nING makes the difference through the activities and actions of our people. We unlock our people's full potential through our inclusive culture, where everyone has the opportunity to develop and have impact for our customers and society. In 2023, we focused on three pillars to deliver for our people: 'talent & leadership', 'culture & organisation', and 'employee experience'.\n\n## Talent & leadership\n\n## Skills and capabilities\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain people with the skills we need to deliver great performance. We upskill our workforce by providing our people with the learning and development they need to perform well and grow their careers. In 2023, we made learning solutions more accessible through a global learning offer, rolling out Udemy Business to 37 countries, which provides on-demand, relevant and engaging content in an accessible, digital way. We have had a successful uptake of more than 20,000 global users, earning a 4.2 out of 5 rating from learners.\n\nCompletion of learning courses increased by 5.7 percent and 1,189,829 hours of learning were undertaken. The positive trend for non-mandatory learning continued, making up 48 percent of all learning completed in 2023, up from 43 percent in 2022, with more people electing to learn new skills and build capabilities relevant to their job roles and function.\n\nIn the context of sustainability, we aim to make sure that our colleagues are highly engaged with our strategy and all sustainability-related topics, especially climate action. In support of this, we're developing a global sustainability learning programme. The first delivery - an e-learning covering the fundamentals of our sustainability approach - launched in April 2023. We have also created upskilling programmes aimed at developing more expertise, and the first modules on Climate & Environmental Risk were released in July 2023.\n\nWe provide role-based development via 10 global academies. These academies offer relevant, engaging and ING-specific training for the skills required now and in the future. For example, our technology academy rolled out a new ING-specific learning offering, which was developed in-house, in collaboration with internal engineers. More than 4,700 engineers have so far enrolled to this global offer and have taken the opportunity to upskill on topics like Public Cloud, Java and Oracle.\n\nAlso in 2023, our COO academy defined six core future skills for our more than 16,000 COO domain team members. These skills are being assessed across the organisation and learning journeys are being developed, as we want our Operations teams to be equipped for high performance now, and ready as their roles change due to increased efficiency, digitalisation and AI.\n\nWe also had the Wholesale Banking Business School launch the capital velocity programme in 2023 to support our strategic ambitions. Participants learned how to optimise the balance book in the face of challenging external conditions.\n\n## Building leaders for today and tomorrow\n\nING has an abundance of internal talent and a strong culture of developing our people. In 2023, we introduced a new approach that gives us a broader, deeper and more global visibility of our talent across ING. This includes emerging leaders and the functional and technical experts that drive the success of our business. As a result, we're able to accelerate the development of these leaders, aiming for a healthy leadership pipeline that reflects our global and diverse organisation, and retain our experts that are hard to find in the market.\n\nIn 2023, we delivered a successful pilot programme to train rising leaders who are preparing for leadership roles. A diverse global pool of participants (50 participants, coming from 10 countries, 54 percent of whom were women) graduated from this intensive leadership programme focused on strategically relevant topics such as sustainability, digitalisation and AI, combined with business challenges that allowed them to apply",

The programme achieved an above-average Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 73 and will be scaled up in 2024.\n\nWe also support the development of leaders at other key transition points. Our first-time leadership programme, Leadership Fundamentals, supported 315 people in 21 countries. Our programme for more experienced People Leaders was updated to include skills required to lead hybrid teams, with 463 participants in 2023.\n\nIn addition, we continue to attract and develop early-in-career talent through our global International Talent Programme (ITP). In 2023, we hired 119 graduates in 11 countries and nine different areas of expertise (Retail Banking, Business Banking, Wholesale Banking, Tech, Analytics, Risk, Operations, Finance and HR). These 119 new trainees will replace the 77 that started in 2021, concluded the programme in 2023, and are now in roles across the bank.\n\n## Attracting the talent we need\n\nIn 2023, we launched an employer branding campaign called 'Make it your job' to help us stand out in the market. Inspired by ING's more than 60,000 employees who put the bank's 'making the difference' strategy into practice, the campaign was built on ING's employee value proposition: jobs that can make an impact in a collaborative and inclusive working environment.\n\n## Culture & organisation\n\nOur vision is to unlock our people's full potential through our inclusive culture where everyone has the opportunity to develop and have impact for our customers and society. To achieve this vision, we follow an approach that is based on data and evidence to keep track of progress.\n\n## Gender pay gap analysis\n\nThe gender pay gap (i.e. the difference between the average remuneration of men and women) is one of the measurements we use for this purpose and something ING committed itself to in 2022. Companies calculate their gender pay gap to understand and tackle any structural barriers to gender equity.\n\nIn 2022, we conducted a global analysis of gender pay for the first time, to provide a basis to structurally address any gaps using data from 2021. We repeated this analysis in 2023 with data from 2022. We expect to complete a 2023 and 2024 analysis for the 2024 Annual Report.\n\nThe gender pay gap compares the pay of men and women overall, across the bank, across all levels. Getting a complete picture of this gender pay gap is complex because the data is influenced by many different elements, for instance the level and type of jobs that men and women have. This is why the analysis is divided into two parts: the unadjusted gender pay gap and the adjusted gender pay gap. Furthermore, we analysed equal pay for equal work. Our methodology has previously been assessed by Deloitte, which included reviewing the code and the principles of our analysis tools.\n\nSee the 'ESG appendix' for more information on average remuneration and significant locations.\n\n## Unadjusted gender pay gap\n\nING follows guidelines laid out by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which collects benchmarking data on the gender pay gap from banks under its supervision (including ING) over the financial year 2023. ING is ahead of this requirement, having begun collecting data on gender pay globally in 2022, and publishing its unadjusted and adjusted global gender pay gap.\n\nUsing the EBA's definition, the unadjusted gender pay gap represents the difference in the mean remuneration paid to men and women expressed as a percentage of the mean remuneration paid to men. Our calculations include annual fixed remuneration and actual variable pay. At the end of 2022, the unadjusted gender pay gap of ING globally was 32 percent, compared to year-end 2021 where it was 33 percent.\n\nAccording to our analysis, this gap is predominantly caused by the higher representation of more senior, higher-paying roles among men than among women.\n\nThe difference between the unadjusted gender pay gap of ING globally at year-end 2021 (33 percent) 3 and year-end 2022 (32 percent) can be mainly explained by career events, such as i) new joiners and leavers (including internal mobility), ii) compensation changes together with level changes, and iii) compensation changes while no other change happens.\n\nThis development of the unadjusted gender pay gap of ING globally reinforces our aim to increase the representation of women in senior roles. To address the unadjusted gap, a deeper analysis was needed to assess where and why these differences in pay between men and women occur. This is why we also calculated an adjusted gender pay gap to get better insights into the main drivers of the gender pay gap.",

        "page_content": "- > Social\n\n## Adjusted gender pay gap\n\nUnadjusted and adjusted gender pay gap per country/entity (based on headcount >250)\n\nOur adjusted gender pay gap analysis accounts for several factors to make the comparisons meaningful, including two main drivers: country differences and job classification. ING calculates its adjusted gender pay following the Blinder-Oaxaca method.\n\nThe adjusted gap analysis results show that the 32 percent global unadjusted gender pay gap:\n\n- 1. is driven by 13 percent country differences (in 2021: 13 percent). There are structural base salary differences between countries. This way the focus is on differences between country peers, which makes the comparison fairer;\n- 2. and 16 percent is explained predominantly by ING's job framework, Global Job Architecture (GJA), as the most significant variable in the model (in 2021: 17 percent). Certain job profiles in the global ING job catalogue are associated with higher pay than the reference group and there are proportionally more male than female employees in these job profiles.\n\nBy subtracting the effects of country differences and our GJA, the adjusted gender pay gap was 3 percent at year-end 2022 (2021: 3 percent). Therefore, we found that female employees are paid on average 97 percent of what male employees are paid.\n\nWhile we are encouraged by the fact that our adjusted gender pay gap is showing us that there are objective, explainable reasons for our unadjusted pay gap, we realise there is more to be done, especially about the under-representation of women in leadership positions and we remain fully committed to improving this.\n\nThis year, to increase transparency, ING has not only conducted the gender pay gap analysis on a global level but also on a country and entity level (with a headcount of at least 250 employees).\n\n| Country/Entity     | UGPG22   | UGPG21   | AGPG22   | AGPG21   |\n|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| ING Group          | 32%      | 33%      | 3%       | 3%       |\n| Netherlands        | 18%      | 20%      | 2%       | 2%       |\n| Poland Slaski      | 34%      | 34%      | 3%       | 4%       |\n| Belgium            | 16%      | 19%      | 1%       | 2%       |\n| Germany            | 17%      | 20%      | 1%       | 2%       |\n| Philippines Hub    | 22%      | 17%      | 1%       | -2%      |\n| T\u00fcrkiye            | 28%      | 35%      | 1%       | 2%       |\n| Poland Hubs        | 17%      | 15%      | 2%       | 2%       |\n| Romania Bank       | 22%      | 24%      | 1%       | 2%       |\n| Australia          | 24%      | 26%      | 2%       | 1%       |\n| Spain              | 17%      | 16%      | 3%       | 3%       |\n| Interhyp AG        | 16%      | 18%      | 2%       | 3%       |\n| Romania Hubs       | 14%      | 15%      | 3%       | 1%       |\n| Italy              | 17%      | 14%      | 2%       | 1%       |\n| Slovakia Hub       | 9%       | 12%      | 1%       | -1%      |\n| Luxembourg         | 15%      | 14%      | 1%       | 1%       |\n| United Kingdom     | 34%      | 37%      | 3%       | 3%       |\n| United States      | 22%      | 22%      | 2%       | 3%       |\n| Singapore          | 31%      | 35%      | -2%      | 0%       |\n| France             | 28%      | 26%      | 1%       | 1%       |\n| Switzerland        | 20%      | 23%      | 0%       | 4%       |\n| Russian Federation | 47%      | 35%      | -2%      | 1%       |\n\n- 1 Ordered by number of employees.\n\n## Equal pay for equal work\n\nEqual pay for equal work assesses whether female and male employees in the same job receive equal pay for equal work. We calculate this with our GJA, which allows us to compare like-for-like jobs. It categorises all 1,425 job profiles within ING in a standardised and simple way, using common language that makes it easier to compare and match accountabilities and capabilities across countries and business lines.\n\nIn 2023, ING performed an 'equal pay for equal work' assessment across all countries using data from 2022. The results have been shared with the countries we operate in for further analysis. There are circumstances when it is appropriate to pay employees differently, even if they are doing similar jobs, for example because of differences in skills or differences in performance. Where any unjustified differences are found, we make the necessary adjustments to ensure equal treatment.",

Our diversity and inclusion (D&I) policy commits us to:\n\n- \u00b7 Actively support diversity, equity, and inclusion, and embed a culture where everyone is valued and treated with dignity and respect;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that people leaders work in partnership with their teams to create and sustain an inclusive working environment where everyone's unique contribution is valued and where everyone feels a sense of belonging;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that decisions affecting employment, learning and development, promotion and career development are based on an individual's ability and reflect genuine requirements of the job;\n- \u00b7 Conduct annual analyses of our global gender pay gap and equal pay for equal work as part of our commitment to denounce discrimination and to promote equal remuneration for work of equal value for all employees;\n- \u00b7 Provide everyone with the appropriate information, and training, on diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace;\n- \u00b7 Make the necessary adjustments to meet the needs of people with disabilities where reasonable and practicable to do so;\n- \u00b7 Strive continually to provide people with a working environment that is free from discrimination and/or harassment of any kind;\n- \u00b7 Behave in accordance with the values and behaviours of our Orange Code, which applies to all ING business units in all countries worldwide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our stance on discrimination\n\nAt ING, we denounce all forms of discrimination. We are working together to create an inclusive workplace and, in turn, play our part in building an inclusive world. To support our ongoing efforts to create meaningful change, we have measures that aim to keep discrimination from happening within our company. Discrimination includes any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of age, sex, gender identity or expression, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, family responsibility (including pregnancy, maternity, paternity and adoption), partnership status, cultural background, religion, race, ethnicity, physical or mental disability, nationality, political opinion, social origin or any other status, that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equal opportunity or treatment in employment. Any distinction, exclusion or preference not based on the inherent requirements of the job is deemed as discrimination.\n\n## A renewed global diversity, inclusion and belonging (DIB) strategy\n\nTo achieve the commitments set out in our global D&I policy, ING's senior management endorsed our new global DIB strategy in November 2022, which builds on our previous 70 percent principle. It contains clear actions on increasing gender diversity and equity, while setting a strategic roadmap for structural and behavioural inclusion at ING, in the actions of our leadership, in our individual and collective behaviours, and in our structures and processes. This way, we can achieve sustained and measurable change.",

        "page_content": "- > Social\n\nWe are equipping our most senior leaders with practical skills on inclusion through targeted workshops, attended by 140 leaders across ING globally so far. In 2023, members of our Management Board became allies of our diversity and inclusion employee networks, of which there are over 35 globally relating to gender, LGBTQI+, culture, race and ethnicity, disability, and generations. Through structured dialogue with the leaders of our employee network across ING, the members of the Management Board are learning about the experiences of employees of diverse identities with the aim of addressing structural inequalities and driving inclusive behaviour. As well as fostering diversity, inclusion and belonging in these areas, the networks raise awareness around how workplace issues affect certain groups and provide employees with a sense of connection and belonging. To celebrate the diversity of our global workforce and encourage inclusive behaviour, we held our fifth consecutive Global DIB Day in 2023, with 22 countries hosting over 90 events with the active engagement of 4,000 employees.\n\nTo improve gender diversity in senior management, in 2023 we made it a requirement that external recruitment firms provide gender diverse candidate lists. We promote flexible working to enable all parents to succeed professionally while managing their family lives. We have seen how flexible working benefits the lives of employees - especially those with care-giving responsibilities - which is why we remain an advocate of it. In our largest market, the Netherlands, we introduced extended parental leave for new mothers in 2023. This new provision complements our existing parental leave, which is gender neutral and inclusive of diverse families.\n\nTo achieve greater equity, we have embedded 'bias interrupters' in our recruitment, performanceevaluation, and talent-assessment processes. We're also developing the capabilities of our people leaders and HR professionals to judge fairly and without bias.\n\nWe are committed to building a strong internal pipeline of talented women into senior leadership roles. Through our leadership accelerator programme, which has a 54 (female)/46 (male) percent gender split in the participant group, we provide content that addresses gender-specific barriers to progression. We also monitor the gender balance in our leadership pipelines. In 2023, we added a second bank-wide gender diversity target to increase the representation of women in our leadership pipeline, in addition to the existing gender diversity target for senior leadership. The variable pay of our Executive Board and Management Board Banking is linked to the delivery of these internal targets on gender diversity.\n\nMuch of our diversity data is based on demographic representation. Our gender diversity analysis continues to become more advanced, with combined dashboards of hiring, retention, and progression and forecasting tools. Furthermore, we are broadening the diversity demographics against which employees can selfdisclose, within legal and data protection parameters, to continually inform our strategies and meet increasing external reporting requirements. As we improve the quantity and quality of diversity demographics across ING, we will evolve our diversity target-setting where needed to address underrepresentation.\n\nTo better understand our employees' experiences of inclusion, we introduced an Inclusion Index in the fourth quarter of 2023 in our OHI survey. As part of this, we analysed different experiences of inclusion based on gender, age and organisational demographic, allowing us to take targeted action where required. The Inclusion Index will be measured annually.\n\nIn 2023, we rolled out a diversity, inclusion and belonging learning curriculum for all employees, people leaders and senior leaders to encourage inclusive behaviours at all levels. The curriculum provides everyone with training on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace.\n\n## External recognition of DIB efforts\n\nOne of the ways we create a more equitable and inclusive workplace is through external and independent review. ING was one of the 484 firms recognised in the 2023 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI), which offers public companies the opportunity to disclose information on how they promote gender equality across five separate areas: female leadership and talent pipeline, equal pay and gender pay parity, inclusive culture, sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brand. In 2023, ING scored 72.3 percent, an improvement on the 70.35 percent score from 2022. This is the eighth year that we've been included in the listing.\n\nWe are a founding partner of Workplace Pride, an organisation dedicated to improving the lives of LGBTQI+ people in workplaces worldwide. Its activities include the International Workplace Pride Global Benchmark, which assesses companies in eight areas and identifies best practices. In 2023, ING scored 82.07 percent in the benchmark, an improvement on the 78.8 percent score in 2022, earning us a recognition of Workplace Pride Ambassador for the fourth year running. ING is dedicated to having an LGBTQI+-inclusive culture and our Rainbow Lions networks across 10 locations have played an important role in shaping this.\n\n## Vitality\n\nOur people are our biggest asset and only by unlocking their full potential will we be able to make a difference for our customers, our society and our planet. Therefore, we need the right energy, which at ING we call vitality. We are aware that work-related stress is a reality for some, and this is monitored both locally and globally through a vitality section in our employee survey once a year, with the results used to shape and track our vitality initiatives.\n\nBuilding on the initiatives of 2022 to enhance our people's vitality by supporting them in developing the right working habits, in 2023 we created a global set of 'working habits for vitality' that will help our people make the right decisions to maintain and improve their vitality. We also give people insights into their working habits through technology, and offer practical tools to help them work in a sustainable way. These can be team agreements on working flexibly, or training on how to maintain a healthy work-life balance. We promote a flexible way of working among our employees through our International Remote Working programme, hybrid-work flexibility and various paid-time-off programmes.",

The training programme followed a phased roll-out approach until the end of 2023, and will continue in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWe continue to count on local initiatives to offer customised vitality solutions to our employees. Alongside the continuous vitality offerings that are available every year, there were a number of local initiatives in 2023 to support our vitality pillars:\n\n## Mental health\n\nIn Germany, we put a focus on mental health by discussing sensitive topics in interviews with experts and gave colleagues information and support via monthly newsletters and lunch-and-learns. And at our Poland Hubs, we marked Mental Health Week by giving employees access to related topics webinars, podcasts and activities.\n\n## Physical health\n\nAs part of our Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) in the Netherlands, more than 3,700 employees underwent a personal health check via an external partner. Based on their individual outcomes, we offered customised support to improve their vitality, such as online nutrition coaches, face-to-face vitality coaches and digital support tracks. Employees in Poland also received the same offer.\n\n## Social connection\n\nAustralia and Germany have either set up or expanded their mental health first aider peer-support networks. ING employees can opt in to be trained in mental-health first aid to signpost those struggling or in distress to the appropriate help.\n\n## Financial health\n\nIn countries such as the Netherlands, Romania, Poland, Spain, the Americas, Belgium, and Australia, we offer financial coaching for our employees to discuss how financially healthy they are.\n\n## Family and friends\n\nSpain's 'Plan Familia' is a programme intended to support employees who have a dependent child with a congenital or acquired disability of over 33 percent with a monthly allowance. Poland has a similar offering. Belgium rolled out the vitality boost programme, in which employees can follow an 8-10-week journey in the area of vitality they need most (on any of the pillars). This was a unique and multidimensional approach that has already led to positive employee experiences and impact.\n\n## Employee experience\n\nProviding a superior customer experience is a strategic priority. This matters just as much for employees, and we are therefore focused on continuing to improve our employee experience. We aim to provide personal, easy and efficient services that encourage our people to unlock their full potential and be the best they can be. In 2023, we continued to deploy our global HR system to more than 70 percent of our total employee population. We also made progress in digitising our employee journeys with more automation, such as in the area of expenses or employee document handling. Another priority has been the simplification of HR processes and the reduction of administrative tasks for managers. For instance, in the Netherlands, we reduced the number of notifications and approval steps on HR-related processes from 16,000 to 6,000 per month.",

We measure turnover on a monthly basis given the potential impact on our ability to operate effectively, and take action as needed. We also mitigate the turnover through the design of the three pillars of unlocking our people's full potential as described in this chapter.\n\nHeadcount is usually higher than reported FTEs as it counts all employees irrespective of hours worked or type of work contract. FTE is calculated according to actual hours worked by an individual compared to the default hours for a full-time employee per jurisdiction.\n\n## Customers\n\nPart of ING's purpose to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business means helping customers and society stay a step ahead of the challenges they're facing. One of the ways we can make a difference here is by aiming to advance financial health and inclusion for customers and communities.\n\n## Customer-centricity policy\n\nAs a global bank, we recognise the impact our activities can have on society and individuals. Therefore, our Orange Code promise is: 'Integrity above all, by balancing the rights and interests of all stakeholders'. In 2023, we solidified this promise by creating a global customer centricity policy. The introduction of this policy is one measure we have taken to prevent contributing to customers' financial distress. The policy is based on our customer golden rules (CGR).\n\nING's purpose is to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business. To help our potential and/or existing customers do this, ING offers a large variety of financial products to a large variety of customers. As a result, ING faces a multitude of risks and regulations. The CGR define high-level common principles to ensure ING handles these risks and regulations appropriately. Complying with the CGR will help to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure we protect, safeguard, and not violate the rights of customers;\n- \u00b7 Contribute to a sustainable society;\n- \u00b7 Ensure we put the customers' best interests, protection, and needs at the centre of all our activities;\n- \u00b7 Mitigate the risk of mis-selling and customer detriment.\n\n## The customer golden rules are:\n\n- \u00b7 We offer products and services suitable for the customers throughout the whole relationship lifecycle.\n- \u00b7 We communicate information on products and services in a clear and non-misleading manner.\n- \u00b7 We offer products and services at a fair price considering the market, costs and risks.\n\n- \u00b7 We provide services and trusted advice through professionals with the necessary knowledge and expertise.\n- \u00b7 We consider the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks and impact of our products and services.\n\nWhen we create and sell products, it is our policy to take into account the wider interests of society. This means we aim to provide products that add value to individual customers, work to offer sustainable products and avoid publishing information that amounts to greenwashing or ethics washing. We also aim to provide access to our services for all clients, including those with, for example, low levels of digital literacy or a disability. Finally, we aim to meet the needs of customers at risk of vulnerability or marginalisation.\n\n## Financial health and inclusion\n\nFinancially healthy people and businesses can contribute to a healthy economy and help drive social progress. At the same time, money is a leading cause of stress for people, with half of European households struggling to make ends meet. According to the group European Pensions, one third are unable to face unexpected financial expenses and close to 40 percent are not saving for retirement.\n\nING aims to empower people and businesses towards improved financial health, a state in which an individual, household, micro, small or medium-sized enterprise can manage their current financial needs and have confidence in their financial future. This includes managing day-to-day finances to meet shortterm needs, the capacity to absorb financial shocks (resilience), the capacity to reach future goals, and feeling secure and in control of finances (confidence).\n\nWe're working with the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative under the Principles for Responsible Banking to contribute to setting a measurement standard for financial health impact for our industry. As a founding signatory of the Commitment to Financial Health and Inclusion in December 2021, we've committed to setting ambitious targets supported by measures around products and services, processes, data analytics and/or partnerships, with the aim of promoting financial inclusion, and fostering a banking sector that supports financial health. For more on our Financial Health and Inclusion activities, please refer to the 2023 ING UNEP FI PRB assessment.\n\n## Advancing customers' financial health and inclusion\n\nING aims to contribute to a positive, measurable impact on our customers' financial health with a focus on those with whom we can have the biggest impact. We do this by focusing on a few specific impact areas. For each area, best practices are shared between business units with the goal of learning from each other.\n\nFinancial inclusion, the first area, is about accessibility. ING wants to be an accessible bank for everyone, including people living with disabilities, whether that means sight, hearing, physical disabilities or cognitive/",

We have taken various steps, such as installing voice-activated ATMs in certain countries that make it easier for people with a visual impairment to withdraw money and also issuing bank cards with a notch on top so they can insert them correctly. These cards are also useful for customers with limited hand functionality. In Australia, customers with speech or hearing difficulties can do their phone banking via the national relay service and there's a sign-language service in some of our bank branches in Poland. Also, in the Netherlands, customers with a visual impairment can use screen readers (software applications that read out information displayed on a screen) in compatibility with ING.nl and the banking app, Mijn ING.\n\nIt is also about making sure everyone can easily understand our terms and conditions, that the information on our websites is readily accessible and that customers can use our online banking channels and mobile apps, irrespective of their situation. We started a programme in 2022 to align digital channels in all our EU Retail Banking countries with the EU's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standard (WCAG 2.1). In the Netherlands, the Mijn ING app is accessible with a voice-over to transfer money or to get current account insights.\n\nThe second area is focused on building financial resilience. Everyday Round Up, for example, encourages customers in Poland, Australia, T\u00fcrkiye, Germany, Spain and Romania to build savings. ING in Spain's Money Up! money-management tool aims to help build healthy savings habits and optimise expenses. In the Netherlands and Belgium, forecasting tools like Kijk Vooruit help customers plan and control their expenses.\n\nFor businesses, we launched a similar self-evaluation tool for our Romanian customers in 2023, with a focus on financial indicators using the customer's own data, and a bank diagnosis feature that identifies potential financial-health vulnerability. Also in Poland, we introduced a financial-health platform for entrepreneurs, called Firmove. This provides guidance to entrepreneurs in improving their financial well-being through their business operations. Additionally, it offers valuable advice and assistance to foster business growth and enhance sustainability.\n\nAnother focus area is that of financial education. Financial illiteracy is one of the biggest threats to financial health, which we aim to address especially for our young customers. In Belgium, we do this via a financial check-up session offered to young clients. In countries such as Germany, Italy and Spain, we use communication and education programmes to help them develop healthy savings and spending habits.\n\nLastly, we see an important role of collaboration with external parties to support the energy transition of households. In an effort to have an inclusive transition, we are making steps to collaborate with parties such as banks, governments and others to provide financing means and access to energy education. Here we aim to focus our efforts on customers who could be struggling with financial health or with energy poverty. In the Netherlands, ING is a participant of a collaboration between banks, the national heat fund, local municipalities and energy coaches to help homeowners tackle energy poverty.\n\n## Supporting financial health in the community\n\nOur approach to community investment adapts to changing needs. Through a combination of global and local funding, we support programmes that contribute to inclusive economies in which everyone can participate. In 2023, ING, together with colleagues and clients, donated \u20ac18.7 million to a range of social programmes, \u20ac9.7 million of which was specifically focused on building financial health in communities, covering the areas of future-proof employment, financial capabilities and social enterprises.\n\nWe also donated to the humanitarian appeal to help communities affected by two devastating earthquakes in southern T\u00fcrkiye and northern Syria, in February 2023. Together with colleagues and clients, we donated more than \u20ac7.6 million to UNICEF's emergency response and other humanitarian and development organisations.\n\nUkraine has been another target of our community investment. An example is our support for the NGO 'For the good people', focused on financial health and financial capabilities with the specific aim to support people who have lost their jobs due to mental health disorders. ING also supports 'Convictus Ukraine' and its WINGs programme that helps improve the economic security of rural, vulnerable and marginalised women, especially those affected by the war.\n\nING's Global Community Investment Fund provided funding to 20 financial-health projects from 13 countries to help them amplify the impact created at country level.\n\nThe ING Netherlands Foundation works with 11 local partners for equal job opportunities. One example is the collaboration with VHTO, a programme supporting gender diversity in the technology sector. VHTO has reached more than 11,000 primary and secondary education students with different activities in the classroom, removing the obstacles that can prevent girls choosing to study IT and eventually selecting it as a profession. The ING Netherlands Foundation also invests in Young Digitals, an organisation that teaches young people with fewer opportunities the skills they need to become digital marketers.\n\nAs examples of supporting employment, in Germany we partnered with MentorMe, a mentoring programme that supports vulnerable women in the job market. In Italy, we partner with 'Fondazione Mondo Digitale' (Digital World Foundation) to train around 8,000 people per year, especially women, small entrepreneurs and young people not in education, with digital skills to better face the challenges of the labour market. In Belgium, we work with the King Baudouin Foundation managing four funds supporting (i) a more circular/inclusive economy, (ii) a more digitally inclusive economy, (iii) financial literacy and (iv) sustainable buildings.\n\nDuring 2023, ING also initiated projects that assist with financial capabilities In Spain, for example, we invest in the FARO Project, a public-private partnership between Madrid City Council, ING, and the Nantik Lum Foundation. The programme trains the social workers in financial education, so they can help and talk to the",

For example, in Bulgaria, we collaborated with the Reach for Change foundation in the development of the GROW incubator, part of the Open the Circle initiative, which provides tailored support for social enterprises that build skills and job readiness among young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. In Germany, together with Social Impact GmbH, we match innovative social start-ups with established charities, to exchange knowledge, expertise and experience. We also provided funding to other social enterprise projects in the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Ukraine and the United States.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe believe every person, everywhere, has the right to be treated with dignity and have their interests considered equally. ING and our clients have the potential to impact human rights through our operations and business relationships. Our impact is in the different roles we have: as an employer, a procurer of goods and services and a provider of financial services to corporate and individual customers.\n\nWe work to influence and support business partners to respect human rights in multiple ways. Our ESR framework includes an overarching policy on human rights to guide us when assessing clients and the transactions we finance. We also act on a variety of environmental, climate and social topics, as well as highlighting their interconnectivity.\n\nIn the beginning of 2024, we published our 2023 Human Rights Report where we assessed and identified our most severe potential human rights issues for our workforce, our Wholesale Banking and procurement activities. For our workforce we identified discrimination, harassment and work-related stress as key issues. In our Wholesale Banking activities, the identified issues are child labour, forced labour, communities' land and resource issues. Regarding our procurement activities, we identified forced labour and occupational health and safety. To read about the management of the identified issues, please see the Human Rights Report.\n\nThrough our financing activities we have the potential to contribute to or be linked to negative human-rights impacts and issues, such as child labour and forced labour in relation to workers in the value chain, and land and resource-related community impacts in relation to local communities. Negative land and resourcerelated community impacts may, for example, occur due to land acquisition and use of scarce or shared resources by clients we finance.\n\nTo mitigate these potential human-rights impacts, we have an Environmental and Social Risk (ESR) Policy Framework, which includes an overarching human-rights policy that applies to all sectors we finance. In addition, we have human-rights elements in dedicated sector policies. We also mitigate potential negative\n\nhuman rights impacts in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. We do this by understanding regional and portfolio risks, engaging with clients, using financial leverage when needed, and being cognisant of human-rights impacts when engaging with stakeholders.\n\nWe engage with different stakeholders (internally and externally) to identify common solutions to address human-rights issues. We consulted with human-rights consultants and civil-society organisations in drawing up our ESR policy review. We have been working on an integrated approach to stakeholder engagement at ING and invited clients to discuss challenges and issues that have been brought to our attention. We find it beneficial to have ongoing dialogue about our role in society, our products and services, our business performance and other issues. We also engage with other key stakeholder groups, including communities affected by projects in which we invest, government, regulators and national associations, as well as pressure groups and NGOs.\n\nThe transition out of fossil fuels and into a green economy may impact people, for example, potentially resulting in stranded assets and consequently affecting surrounding communities. It could also increase energy poverty for vulnerable people reliant on fossil fuels. We recognise that as the world transitions from a carbon-intensive economy into a green economy, we must collectively acknowledge the needs of people, especially the most vulnerable.\n\nThrough platforms that set standards on this topic, ING aims to be transparent about our progress in the hope that others will join us and strive to be a step ahead of broader expectations.

We are guided by our Orange Code, which sets our values and behaviours and ensures we work with integrity, transparency and high standards of business ethics. Strong management in our corporate leadership and board composition is also key to effective governance, ensuring the overall success of our ESG approach.\n\n## Business ethics and integrity\n\nOur culture, including our risk culture, informs the behaviours we share across the organisation, helping us to make responsible decisions - for ourselves and for our customers - now and in the future. We aim to act with integrity, whether in encouraging employees to speak up and report concerns, guarding against corruption and financial crime, or managing our taxation responsibly and transparently.\n\n## Orange Code and global Code of Conduct\n\nOur culture starts with the Orange Code, which is a declaration of who we are. It describes what we can expect from each other when we turn up to work each day. It is a set of standards that we collectively value, strive to live up to, and invite others to measure us by.\n\nThe Orange Code is the sum of two parts, the ING values and ING behaviours, with 'Integrity above all' being the overarching principle. The ING values (being honest, prudent and responsible) are non-negotiable promises we make to the world, principles we seek to stick to, no matter what. The ING behaviours (take it on and make it happen, help others to be successful, and always be a step ahead) represent our way to differentiate ourselves. The Orange Code is embedded in commitments we make to each other and the standards by which we measure each other's performance.\n\nThe ING Global Code of Conduct outlines the 10 core principles for conduct we expect from employees. These principles build on the values and behaviours of our Orange Code and are based on ING policies, minimum standards and guidelines we need to adhere to in our daily business. Having a global Code of\n\nConduct creates consistency in the way we do things and contributes to keeping ING safe, secure and compliant. Ultimately it helps to safeguard our customers, society and our role in the financial system.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nAt ING, we attach great importance to a sound risk culture, which is essential for performing our role in society responsibly and in keeping the bank safe and secure. We determine our risk culture as the way in which employees identify, understand, discuss and act on the many financial and non-financial risks we are confronted with every day.\n\nThe Orange Code and the global Code of Conduct are the foundation of ING's risk culture. The global Code of Conduct defines the most essential conduct principles expected from ING employees in their daily activities, to create additional risk awareness and better meet expectations stated in external rules and guidelines. When ING employees onboard, they are required to take an e-learning and sign-off on their adherence to the global Code of Conduct. Also, every year, all ING employees receive an updated (micro-)e-learning on (parts of) the global Code of Conduct. As of 2021, the global Code of Conduct is also embedded into our employees' performance management cycle with the aim to ensure continuous attention to the global Code of Conduct, and encourage the dialogue on how to apply it in our daily work practice.\n\nThe effectiveness of and compliance with the ING Global Code of Conduct is measured via annual employee acknowledgements and whistleblower data. Reporters can raise (suspicions of) breaches of the ING Global Code of Conduct to the ING whistleblower channels. All 10 principles and their underlying topics (such as market abuse, conflict of interest, etc.) of the ING Global Code of Conduct are considered in scope of the Whistleblower Policy.\n\n## Orange Code decision-making\n\nBalancing the rights and interests of all our stakeholders is one of the key Orange Code principles. To further enhance risk judgement, we continued to apply the Orange Code decision-making model to dilemmas. This four-step model supports well-balanced decision-making.",

Risk culture and behavioural risk is continuing to train experts in this area to support the organisation in properly applying the model in practice.\n\n## Behavioural risk\n\nBehavioural risk is an increasingly important risk area for ING and across the financial industry. It arises when behavioural patterns are at the root of financial and non-financial risks in the organisation.\n\nThe complexity of this type of risk is that it is less tangible compared to other risk areas because it focuses on behavioural patterns and their drivers. There are patterns in how decisions are made, how people communicate, and whether they can take ownership. Behaviour is driven by formal and informal mechanisms. Examples of formal drivers are the processes ING applies and how its governance is structured. Informal drivers are less tangible, such as group dynamics or underlying beliefs that influence behaviour.\n\n## Behavioural risk assessments\n\nBehavioural risk assessments identify and analyse undesired behaviours within ING and provide management with specific direction on how to change these behaviours. They focus on the effectiveness of groups rather than individuals, the role of leadership, and on less visible aspects such as team dynamics and unwritten social norms. The goal is to understand and systematically assess what drives undesired habits at ING. The behavioural risk management framework is used as a guide across ING to identify behavioural risks in the organisation which require deeper investigation.\n\nBased on the results of the executed behavioural risk assessments, interventions are taken to mitigate the behavioural risks in a focused manner. Effective mitigation requires a deep understanding of what drives undesired behaviours. Behavioural and organisational science theories and evidence-based techniques and tools play an important role in designing and facilitating interventions.\n\nIn 2023, interventions were focused on KYC. New interventions have been designed and developed in close cooperation with HR and Compliance to improve speak-up and escalation behaviour across the organisation.\n\n## Whistleblower\n\nEveryone at ING is expected to always act with integrity and uphold the values and behaviours of our Orange Code. We won't ignore, tolerate, or excuse behaviour that breaches our values or people's trust in ING. There are many ways for employees to speak up if they have a concern. Reporting is always confidential and, if preferred, also anonymous. It is our policy to follow up on reports, with an emphasis on protecting whistleblowers' identity.\n\nWe aim to protect those who report concerns, which is why we regularly look for ways to enhance and standardise the whistleblower process. This includes safeguarding identities and trying to proactively prevent retaliation. Across the organisation we're aligning channels, like our 'speak up' channels for undesirable behaviour, which we've brought together in our global Speak Up programme. Anyone who reports a concern can now choose the appropriate channel, so the reporter journey becomes more consistent with the same level of protection. Collecting insights across certain channels has allowed us to better manage anonymous concerns and track whether those that were found to be substantiated were followed up. We continue to share sanitised reports with the organisation to encourage employees to speak up.\n\n## Financial economic crime\n\nBy fulfilling the role of gatekeeper to the financial system, ING plays a role in the collective fight against financial crime while ensuring that ING remains safe, sound, and compliant - in accordance with applicable regulations such as the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) and the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act (Wwft), and with expectations of society at large.\n\n## Bribery and corruption\n\nBribery and corruption undermine business confidence and corporate integrity, hinder fair business competition, and harm international trade. ING takes these risks seriously. Bribery and corruption risks are part of our non-financial risk framework, and are in the design of our client and third-party due diligence,",

We have continued to strengthen our ability to respond to bribery and corruption risks in key areas, as part of our multi-year maturity programme. This supports our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, and meeting governance elements of our sustainability objectives.\n\nAll ING employees and third parties acting for and on behalf of ING at every level of the organisation are expected to always do business in accordance with the values and behaviours of ING's Orange Code. ING has a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption in all of its relationships and business dealings. This forms part of its commitment to conduct business in an honest, prudent, and responsible manner. ING does not, and will not, accept and pay bribes or offer improper inducements or anything that could be perceived as such. ING expects the same from its customers, business partners, and third parties that perform services or deliver business on its behalf. In support of its anti-corruption and bribery policies and procedures, ING has a sound governance structure in place.\n\nFailure to detect signals of money laundering related to human trafficking and modern slavery may result in the lives of customers and/or other people being substantially harmed.

If a customer is a victim of human trafficking, failure to detect signals of money laundering related to socioeconomic fraud and human trafficking may stand in the way of saving that customer from a harmful practice. On an annual basis, ING conducts a Systemic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA) for all its entities. SIRA is the baseline risk assessment for bribery and corruption. In 2023 the outcome of the assessment was that no location was perceived as having residual risks of concern.\n\n## Know Your Customer\n\nKnow Your Customer and financial crime compliance continue to play a major role in making sure we only engage and do business with people and entities that meet regulatory requirements. Knowing who we do business with is vital to keeping ING safe, secure and compliant. As part of our ongoing anti-money laundering efforts, we continuously assess relationships with customers, and monitor and screen transactions. It is our policy to review potentially unusual transactions and suspicious transactions and, where applicable, report these to the relevant authorities.\n\nGiven that we operate in many countries, and our position in the Dutch financial sector and broader society, ING is considered an important stakeholder in the financial sector in realising this priority, together with other gatekeepers in the financial system. These include the Dutch Banking Association, the Dutch Central Bank and other public partners, such as the Tax and Customs Administration, Financial Intelligence Unit, the Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD) and the Public Prosecutor's Office.\n\nING is focused on continuing to embed applicable requirements in our processes and procedures, including in our IT systems and data sources, in a robust and sustainable way, and driving a business environment\n\nthat is compliant by desire and design. The bank also executes ongoing training and awareness to develop its people to have the right knowledge and skills.\n\n## Transparency\n\nAs we strive to be a banking leader in building a sustainable future, we communicate transparently on our actions, we share our successes, but also our challenges. We're clear and open, sharing our progress towards our ESG targets. We also recognise how important it is to continuously interact with all stakeholders, cultivating relationships that drive positive change. Read more on how we engage with stakeholders in 'ESG overview'.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur tax policies and performance are key elements under the governance pillar of our ESG framework. We are mindful that every aspect of our business, including our approach to tax, has an impact on society. We have therefore chosen to formalise our approach to clarify our views on responsible tax behaviour and tax governance.\n\nOur tax principles, which are applicable worldwide, mirror ING's values of integrity, honesty, prudence and responsibility. These values are the main drivers for our relationship with tax authorities and for the adoption of tax transparency as standard practice.\n\n## Tax principles and governance\n\nWherever we operate, we seek to establish and maintain an open and constructive dialogue with local tax authorities and other government bodies, based on the disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances. In this dialogue we seek to provide clarity and establish certainty on all relevant local tax components in advance. We are transparent about our approach to tax and our tax position. In formulating this approach, we have taken account of the interests of our stakeholders, including (tax) authorities, non-governmental organisations, customers, shareholders and society in general.\n\nDisclosures are made in accordance with relevant domestic regulations, as well as applicable reporting requirements and standards such as the International Financial Reporting Standards. The ING annual report contains a country-by-country overview of the result (before tax) and the total corporate income tax charge paid and accrued per tax jurisdiction. ING also submits, annually, a similar type of overview to tax authorities which enhances their insight into our tax position.\n\nING joined the Dutch Tax Governance Code developed by the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (known as VNO-NCW). ING embraces the principles of the code and will work consciously to",

The financial information in the Tax Governance Code is recorded under notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report (see Note 31, Information on geographical areas and Note 34, Taxation).\n\nTax policies, procedures and a tax control framework have been implemented to support management in mitigating potential tax risks in a prudent manner. Internal monitoring, control and reporting of tax-related risks takes place on a continuous basis with annual reporting to the Management Board and Supervisory Board and various other stakeholders. For SOx 404 purposes (section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), an 'effectiveness of internal control statement' with respect to tax controls has been provided. Tax risk management is subject to Corporate Audit testing and evaluation. As part of the tax risk assessment, if applicable, the potential use of (tax) incentives and/or subsidies is considered acceptable to the extent explicitly intended by the authorities.\n\nIn all countries in which ING is present, it is ING's position to be cooperatively tax compliant. This implies being transparent about, and disclosing, relevant tax risks towards tax authorities.\n\nWe also believe in the principle that tax should follow business, so profits are allocated to the countries where business value is created. It is our policy to comply with domestic and international laws and regulations, taking account of both the letter and the spirit of the law, as well as standards such as the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, and we apply the arm's length principle.\n\n## Tax position of clients\n\nAs a global bank, we play a crucial role in fighting financial crime and protecting the financial system from harmful behaviour. This includes criminal activities such as tax evasion, but also aggressive tax avoidance, which although not illegal can be damaging to the communities in which we operate. We aim not to facilitate such activities.\n\nTax risks not only refer to ING's own tax position, but also our role as gatekeeper for the financial system as well as risks in relation to our customers. In this respect, we have integrated a tax-integrity assessment in our overall customer risk assessment process.\n\nIt is our policy not to advise clients on taxation matters. Clients remain responsible for their own tax position.",

Our Executive Board (EB) and Management Board Banking (MBB) are overseen by our Supervisory Board.\n\nWe aim for a balanced composition in our EB, MBB and Supervisory Board, consisting of a diverse selection of people with knowledge, skills and executive experience, preferably gained in the banking sector, in corporate governance of large stock-listed companies and in the political and social environment in which such companies operate.\n\nThere should also be a balance of experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the business of ING. The boards play a role in setting and promoting the culture, underlying values and behaviours and code of conduct that aim to run our business in a way that contributes to sustainable long-term value creation for our people, our customers, our shareholders and society.\n\nTo contribute to the above ING has a matrix structure combining hierarchical and functional lines that work together to achieve a common goal, with dedicated roles and responsibilities and mechanisms for delegation, decision making and escalation.\n\nING's risk governance safeguards the functioning of the matrix structure and is based on the three lines of defence model (3LoD), which has segregated duties and independent internal control functions. Each defence line has a specific role and defined responsibilities and they work closely together to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor risks. The first line of defence lies with the heads (or delegates) of ING's banking business, support functions, geographies and countries; the second line with the risk management and compliance functions; and the third line with the internal audit function.\n\nRead more on ING's risk governance and three lines of defence in 'Risk management'.",

The SB closely monitored those macroeconomic developments in 2023 and discussed the consequences for ING's operations, including higher income of liabilities and mitigating measures for risk costs and RWA. Specific updates were provided on the movement on the financial markets as a result of macroeconomic trends.\n\nDuring 2023, the Supervisory Board (SB), in its statutory and advisory capacity, focused on a number of operational elements, ranging from comprehensive risk management across a broad spectrum to climaterelated matters as defined by Terra. In addition, the SB has, during the year, focused on resilience of the organisation with respect to operational and technology platforms, and Human Resources, both in terms of succession and talent management/recruitment.\n\nThe SB has a number of committees which prepare discussion and decision items. The SB committees play a significant role in supporting the SB in its oversight and supervisory activities, allowing the SB to operate effectively. With respect to strategy, both strategic intent and execution are a normal part of the discourse between the SB and the CEO.\n\nThe SB has an active and continuous dialogue with the Executive Board (EB) and the Management Board Banking (MBB) where it challenges and advises on the strategic and enabling priorities. For more, see 'Our strategy'. The SB acknowledges the responsibility it has to consider and balances the interests of all stakeholders of ING. It makes sure to take this into account while delivery on the strategic priorities is being executed.\n\n## Highlights of 2023 Supervisory Board meetings\n\nDuring 2023, the SB discussed a wide range of topics. In its deliberations on the various topics, the SB considers the customers' and other stakeholders' interests in view of ING's role in society. The highlights of the SB meetings are outlined below.\n\n## Closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment\n\nThe year 2023 was marked by uncertain market conditions with high inflation and implications for ING's risk costs and RWA as a result of market volatility. The operating environment was marked by high inflation, increasing interest rates, tightening monetary conditions, geopolitical tensions and an energy crisis on the back of the Russia/Ukraine crisis, specific uncertainties in certain areas such as Poland and T\u00fcrkiye, and the\n\n## Scalability and resilience of ING's technology and operations\n\nTo put ING's strategy into practice, one of the key enablers is scalable technology and operations. Scalable technology and operations is driven by digitalisation and the capability of ING Hubs, leading to a superior customer experience and a reduction of the costs-to-serve. The SB closely monitored the targets for 2023 with regard to scalable technology and operations. The aim is to achieve scalable technology and operations that provide for a superior customer experience, while preventing technological failures, and if they occur, undertaking remediation activities and addressing root causes. The SB has a general and continuous focus on operational resilience. In addition to the updates on operational resilience, the SB regularly discussed the availability and reliability of ING's channels, including the remediation activities undertaken by (senior) management and root causes for set-backs in the availability and reliability of channels . Not only do scalable technology and operations require available and reliable channels, they also require systems that are safe for use for clients and employees. For that reason, cybersecurity has warranted further attention in 2023.\n\n## Succession matters, people development and diversity & inclusion\n\nIn addition to frequent reviews by the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and the SB of the MBB, EB and SB composition and succession planning, the SB regularly discusses broader people development and diversity & inclusion matters with the EB and MBB. This includes topics such as the organisational health within ING, focusing on the alignment within the organisation on common goals, strategy and culture, and in particular the work environment within ING. For 2023 some of the root causes for lower scores were discussed, including the impact of ongoing Collective Labour Agreement negotiations. A specific topic that was addressed last year was 'Unlocking people's full potential', which is a critical enabler for ING's 'Making the difference' strategy. It should ensure an inclusive culture where everyone has the opportunity to develop and have impact for ING's customers and the society. In discussions with HR and the EB and MBB, the focus is talent and leadership, culture and organisation, including the bank-wide diversity and inclusion approach, and on operational excellence. Plans to develop, attract and retain diverse talent have been part of those discussions, as well as the gender pay gap analysis and gender targets.\n\n## ESG-related matters, including sustainability, climate risk and the energy transition.\n\nAnother core pillar of ING's strategy is putting sustainability at the heart of everything we do. Management of climate and ESG risks is a priority for ING. The SB oversees these topics and challenges where necessary.",

Apart from the recurring topics, ESG-related matters, including sustainability and climate risk, are intertwined in many other discussions and topics the SB oversees. An example of this is the (strategic) updates on ING locations that are regularly discussed in the SB, of which ESG-related topics form an integral part. In addition to the regular agenda items, deep dives and training sessions were also organised. This included separate sessions on the E, the S and the G of ESG, but also sessions on stakeholder engagement and ESG within specific business lines. ESG topics that have an overlap with other committees were covered as joint sessions. For example, a joint session on the impact of climate risk on several parts of ING's residential mortgages portfolio was organised for the ESG Committee and Risk Committee, and a joint session on ESG (regulatory) reporting and disclosures took place with the ESG Committee and Audit Committee.\n\n## AML enhancement with embedded effective KYC processes\n\nIn 2023, the SB continued to be updated regularly on developments regarding KYC and relevant items were discussed in more detail to ensure sufficient progress was made to complete the KYC Enhancement Programme commitments as agreed with the DNB. Progress is monitored by and discussed between the SB, management and the relevant supervisors.\n\n## Continuous dialogue with stakeholders\n\nAt ING we seek out open dialogue and maintain continuous interaction with our stakeholders, responding to their views and concerns, driving increased collaboration. We aim to strike a balance between the interests of all stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, employees, regulators, supervisors and society at large. In 2023, the SB had periodic conversations with various stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, supervisors and the EB and MBB. A specific topic that ING actively engaged on with investors and other stakeholders, including regulators, was the update of the EB and SB remuneration policies. The proposed updated EB and SB remuneration policies will be presented for shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM. The SB exercised its oversight role, which aimed to ensure that actions resulting from these conversations were embedded in the organisation and were followed up effectively. Examples of topics covered in 2023 in this respect are cybersecurity, availability and reliability of ING's channels, climate risks, sustainability, ESG, remuneration and ING's KYC enhancement efforts.\n\nThe dialogue between ING and external supervisors and regulators was a regular agenda item for the SB throughout the year. This included several discussions between the SB and the EB on the results of and follow-up to the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), through which the ECB aims to promote a resilient banking system as a prerequisite for a sustainable and sound financing of the economy.\n\nThe SREP involves a comprehensive assessment of banks' strategies, processes and risks, and takes a forward-looking view to determine how much capital each bank needs to cover its risks.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nIn addition to the topics mentioned above, the SB discussed and monitored, among others things:\n\n- \u00b7 Progress of ING's performance in the various countries and business lines on key financial and nonfinancial metrics;\n- \u00b7 Ongoing supervisory developments, such as the European Central Bank's SREP and related matters such as the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP), the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) and (climate risk-related) stress testing;\n- \u00b7 The financing of ING Group in accordance with ING's capital and liquidity adequacy, ING's capital plan and ING's dividend and distribution policy, and additional distributions including cash dividend payments and share buyback programmes in line with such policy (see 'Our shares');\n- \u00b7 ING's financial, non-financial and compliance risks and in this respect, among other things, ING's gatekeeper role and ensuring the security and compliance of the bank through enhancing and maturing ING's KYC priorities, supported by structural solutions (see 'Strengthening ING's global AML/KYC capabilities' and 'Risk management' for further details on ING's AML/KYC measures), and ING's operational resilience;\n- \u00b7 The audit plans of the internal and external auditor and the external auditor rotation;\n- \u00b7 Various remuneration-related matters, such as the annual review of the reward and appointment framework, the ING Remuneration and Regulations Framework and the review of the SB and EB remuneration policies;\n- \u00b7 The functioning of the SB and its committees, EB and MBB, supported by annual collective selfevaluations, and the functioning of their individual members;\n- \u00b7 Several topical regulatory themes with a global ING scope, such as data strategy and management, IT, cybersecurity and ransomware, sourcing, geopolitical developments, compliance with sanctions, the KYC enhancement programme and leveraged transactions;\n- \u00b7 ESG-related matters in relation to strategy, including, among others, sustainability, climate risk and energy transition.\n\nThe EB and MBB were present at each regular SB meeting. For some parts of these meetings, depending on the nature of the topics discussed, only the chief executive officer (CEO) was present. The SB also had sessions without the EB and the MBB prior to its regular meetings when this was justified by the nature of the topics on the agenda. The purpose of these so-called pre-meetings and SB-only meetings is to allow the SB to reflect independently on and consider important matters in the absence of the EB and MBB.",

Furthermore, the chairperson of the Risk Committee and the chairperson of the Audit Committee continued their informal interaction with the chairpersons of local risk and audit committees of ING's five largest subsidiaries to enrich the SB dialogue. Also, SB members who do not chair committees were assigned specific focus areas that best fit their skills, knowledge and experience to further enhance SB decisionmaking.\n\nThe SB continued to monitor the execution of the strategy by regularly discussing the challenges and opportunities of the strategic priorities, countries and business with the EB and MBB.\n\nThe SB discusses and reconfirms all of its members' outside positions on an annual basis. In addition, it discusses any intended outside positions and assesses if such positions can be approved while safeguarding the level of engagement.\n\nIn addition to the information included in this SB report, information on the SB can be found in 'Our leadership', 'Corporate governance' and the 'Remuneration report'.\n\n## Permanent education including exchange with the business\n\nTo further strengthen their knowledge, continuous learning is organised for the SB. SB members participate in these permanent education sessions to exchange knowledge and information on a regular basis with ING's business. The latter is aimed at keeping the SB up to date on ING-relevant knowledge, skills and expertise and at increasing the SB's understanding of and engagement with ING's business operations and stakeholders.\n\nFor 2023, a balance was sought in the specific topics of the sessions organised for the SB. Subjects that were covered include ESG, operational resilience, cybersecurity, compliance, corporate governance and a range of strategic topics. The latter included in-depth sessions on (i) digital assets, (ii) cloud strategy, (iii) generative AI and, (iv) ING's Wholesale and Retail Banking business, including Business Banking, focused on ESG. A session to gain an outside-in view on investor perspectives was also organised. For the SB committees, these sessions included deep dives and thematic sessions. Deep dives are technical discussions on selected key topics that contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the matters at hand. Thematic sessions focus specifically on certain themes that need further attention and/or are looking forward at emerging risks and developments. Both these thematic and deep-dive sessions contributed to a more in-depth understanding of the matters discussed. Although the deep dives and thematic sessions are for the specific committees, all SB members have standing invitations.\n\nAs part of the annual business visit, the entire SB, together with the EB and MBB, visited the ING locations in the Philippines and Australia in September 2023. This visit allowed the SB to get a better understanding of local business challenges and the country-specific market opportunities.\n\nThe various educational sessions provided opportunities for SB members to interact with senior management and subject-matter experts. Interactions also took place through speed-meet sessions. The meetings were held both in person and virtually. Interactions contributed to a better mutual understanding and alignment on what matters most to ING and its stakeholders.\n\nFor more information on the education of the SB committees and their respective members, for instance on sustainability and digitisation, see 'Committee meetings'.\n\n## Financial and risk reporting\n\nThe EB prepared the financial statements and discussed these with the SB, including the SOx Act 404 Report in relation to the Annual Report on Form 20-F. The quarterly results, including the relevant auditor reports and press releases, were discussed and approved in February, May, August and November 2023. The fullyear 2023 financial results were discussed and approved in March 2024. In addition, elements relevant to the draft agenda for the Annual General Meeting 2024 were discussed and decided on. With the consent of the ECB, in March, May and November share buyback programmes were started in line with the long-term CET1 ratio ambition level and dividend and distribution policy. ING's Annual Report is presented in an integrated form for the ninth successive year. The financial statements will be submitted for adoption at the 2024 Annual General Meeting as part of the 2023 Annual Report. KPMG, in its role as ING's external auditor, audited ING's 2023 financial statements. As part of the standard procedures, KPMG declared itself independent from ING, in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Read more in 'Audit Committee' below.\n\nThe SB was also informed in detail throughout the year of potential financial, non-financial and compliance risks for ING, including: the continuing political and economic developments in various countries and regions; climate- and ESG-related risks; cybersecurity and ransomware; and updates on (upcoming) regulatory changes.\n\nThe SB discussed how these and other risks could best be mitigated, which included reviewing stress-test results performed by ING and programmes related to known and anticipated risks. In addition to internal stress tests and programmes related to known and anticipated risks, ING released its third integrated climate report in October 2023. This report explains how our financing impacts climate change, as well as how climate change impacts our business. It includes our progress on steering the nine most carbonintensive sectors in our loan portfolio towards global climate goals (our Terra approach), how we engage",

The SB evaluates and assesses the functioning and diversity of the EB and the MBB, including questions of succession and remuneration, at least annually, in an internal meeting 5 ;\n- \u00b7 The composition of the EB and MBB;\n- \u00b7 ING's broader talent and succession planning in view of bench strength, including the outcome of ING's annual talent review;\n- \u00b7 The composition of the SB, including its committee composition;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration-related matters, including, but not limited to (i) the remuneration report, (ii) the appointment/compensation/severance proposals of high earners and senior management in control functions, (iii) the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model (VRAM) process, and the review of the SB and EB remuneration policies;\n- \u00b7 The annual collective self-evaluation of the EB, the MBB and the SB;\n- \u00b7 The NYSE clawback policy.\n\n## Management Board Banking and Supervisory Board annual collective self-evaluation\n\nIn 2023 the MBB and SB conducted the annual collective self-evaluation. This was facilitated by an independent external party and with anonymous input from several executives and senior managers who regularly interact with the MBB and SB and attend their meetings. The self-evaluation addressed the 'what' (roles and responsibilities) and the 'how' (culture and behaviour) of the MBB and SB. In addition to the traditional themes, the self-evaluation over 2023 also reflected on ING's strategy, digital and data\n\ndevelopments, ESG, and geopolitical and macroeconomic events, including the accessing of outside-in views of stakeholders.\n\n## Approach 6\n\nDuring the October and November 2023 meetings, the MBB and SB discussed and approved the annual collective self-evaluation process and design for the year 2023. In December 2023, input was gathered from the MBB and SB members and a group of frequent attendees. This, together with the outcome of the 2023 mid-year review and of the bilateral interactions between the MBB members, the SB chairperson and each individual SB member in January 2024, formed the basis for the collective MBB and SB self-evaluation dialogue in January 2024. During this dialogue the MBB and SB determined their collective positive points to maintain and its 2024 priorities for further improvement. This forms part of the MBB's and SB's practice to regularly deliberate on its collective performance, i.e. towards year-end (to determine the next year's approach and potential specific themes to address), halfway through the year (to reflect on status and progress) and at the start of the year (to discuss the outcome of the previous year and agree on positive points to keep and points for further improvement).\n\n## Results Management Board Banking\n\nThe MBB's collective dialogue on 15 January 2024 centred around the following questions:\n\n- 1. Positive points: are the positive points previously identified still valid? Where has the EB/MBB further improved, taking into account the continued focus on ESG and ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic events?\n- 2. Priorities for further improvement: Did the MBB sufficiently progress in 2023 on the improvement areas previously defined? What are the priority areas to further improve in 2024?\n\nThe MBB's agreed priorities for 2023 included:\n\n- 1. Regarding the 'what': increasing focused time on strategy and external insights;\n- 2. Regarding the 'how': (i) further enhance the quality of board meetings through assessment of most material topics and content for the agenda, and (ii) maintain the effectiveness of the MBB throughout expected changes to its composition.",

        "page_content": "- > Supervisory Board report\n\nDuring 2023, the MBB addressed the above and, where applicable, embedded enhancements in its standard working practice: With regard to the 'what', this was addressed by spending significantly more time on bringing outside-in perspectives, particularly investor perspectives, which remains a priority for 2024, by the increased integration of ESG considerations into discussions and decisions and by proactively monitoring and responding to external geopolitical and market events.  With regard to the 'how', item (i) was addressed by clarity on priorities, open and constructive team dialogue on key topics (e.g. risk and compliance) and improved quality of board documents which will remain a focus of attention during 2024. Item (ii) was addressed by further improved board member alignment, enhanced by members making joint market visits and presentations.\n\nLooking back on 2023, the MBB has concluded that there are still several positive points that are valid:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'what', the following strengths were recognised: (i) effective fulfilment of overall responsibilities, management of meetings, support and information available, including external insights and education, (ii) MBB composition, including skills, experience, and diversity, (iii) understanding of key stakeholder groups, (iv), increased focus on ESG topics, and (v) organisation culture and ability to attract and develop talent.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'how', the following positives were recognised: (i) MBB interactions and quality of debate, and (ii) MBB effectiveness in making decisions, integrating key external considerations into discussions and decisions.\n\nLooking ahead, the MBB concluded that several priorities are still relevant. Consequently, the MBB will focus its attention on the following during 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'what': (i) strategy and performance: when discussing strategy and performance, continue to strengthen external insights and data, and (ii) people and talent: continue focus on attraction, development and retention of diverse talent to strengthen talent pipelines.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'how': (i) consider opportunities to further enhance strategic focus of meeting agendas, managing volume of operational reviews and updates, with deep dives on priority areas where needed, (ii) continue to focus on developing MBB interactions, and team dynamics, and (iii) continue to prioritise content of meeting agendas.\n\nThe MBB agreed to a number of specific actions for 2024 to contribute to its performance, such as:\n\n- 1. Strategy and performance: when discussing strategy and performance further enrich views with structured external insights and market data;\n- 2. Meeting agenda items: continue to enhance strategic focus of meeting agendas and quality of materials;\n- 3. On people-related matters, further focus on talent and diversity to strengthen talent pipelines;\n- 4. Continue to enhance MBB effectiveness by investing time in team building.\n\nThe MBB is of the opinion that the above contributes to ING delivering on its ambitions to keep transforming in line with the strategy.\n\n## Results Supervisory Board\n\nThe SB's collective dialogue on 31 January 2024 centred around the following questions:\n\n- 1. Positive points: are the positive points previously identified still valid? Where has the SB further improved, taking into account the continued focus on ESG and ongoing geopolitical & macroeconomic events?\n- 2. Priorities for further improvement: Did the SB sufficiently progress in 2023 on the improvement areas / previously defined? What are the priority areas to further improve in 2024?\n\nThe SB's agreed priorities for 2023 included:\n\n- 1. Regarding the 'what': (i) safeguarding balance in open, constructive dialogue with the EB and the MBB on strategy/business/market developments, including ESG, emerging risks, and time spent on shareholders' and other stakeholders' views on performance of the company, and (ii) continue to be provided with fitfor-purpose supporting materials for board meetings.\n- 2. Regarding the 'how': (i) managing the change in composition of the SB, and (ii) enhancing insight into people and talent processes.\n\nDuring 2023, the SB addressed all of the above and, where applicable, embedded enhancements in its standard working practice. With regard to the 'what', items (i) and (ii) form part of the regular meetings of the SB and its committees, with a view to the SB's role and responsibilities, supported by its comprehensive annual cycle of work. With regard to the 'how', item (i) was addressed by having regular formal and informal interactions e.g. during the annual business visit, which contributed to maintaining cohesive and harmonious collective dynamics within the newly composed SB, and item (ii) was addressed by spending more time on and establishing a greater focus on people and talent.\n\nLooking back on 2023, the SB has concluded that there are still several positive points that are valid:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'what', the following SB strengths were recognised: (i) its effectiveness at overseeing, supervising, challenging and advising the EB and MBB, (ii) effective decision making through its dialogues and interactions with the EB and MBB (iii) its composition and the interface/working balance between the committees and the SB, and (iv) its meeting management, timeliness of meeting materials, and the support available.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'how', the following positives were recognised: (i) taking into account the vies of key stakeholders, for example during the review of the SB and EB remuneration policies, and (ii) an increased focus on ESG.",

Consequently, the SB will focus its attention on the following during 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'what' it identified: (i) continue to improve the workings and effectiveness of the SB and its committees, and (ii) continue with the focus on business, market and (geo)political developments as well as stakeholder engagement.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the 'how' these attention points were identified: (i) continued attention to succession and composition of the SB, EB and MBB, and (ii) further enhance the SB's effectiveness in ING's people and talent management process including the talent pipeline.\n\nOverall, the SB agreed to a number of specific actions for 2024 to contribute to its performance, such as to:\n\n- 1. Ensure continued focus on key topics with specific attention for strategy, leadership & people, governance, (geo)political developments and digital & data;\n- 2. Enhance the effectiveness of operational oversight by reviewing the governance, structure, and remit of the SB committees: (i) evaluate the status of the ad-hoc ESG Committee and (ii) establish an SB Technology and Operations Committee;\n- 3. Further improvement of board meeting materials quality through more focused and concise materials.\n\nThe SB is of the opinion that the above contributes to overseeing and constructively challenging ING in its ambition to empower people to stay a step ahead in life and in business and making the difference for people and the planet in line with the strategy.\n\n## Committee meetings\n\nTo manage each of the committees' annual cycle of work and potential committee interdependencies, each committee has drawn up an annual work plan that is being kept up to date throughout the year for prioritysetting and forward-looking purposes. These plans all feed into the SB's annual meeting cycle.\n\nFor an overview of the composition of the committees on 31 December 2023, see the table under 'Overview of Supervisory Board committee members'.\n\n## Risk Committee\n\nThe Risk Committee met nine times in 2023, of which two meetings were combined with the Remuneration Committee to address remuneration-related proposals that include risk methodology elements, such as those relating to the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model (VRAM) (see also 'Remuneration Committee'). Eight out of the nine SB members are member of the Risk Committee, due to the continued importance of risk and how this is managed and supervised.\n\nThe committee assists and advises the SB with the performance of its duties in relation to overseeing: (i) the setting and monitoring of ING's risk appetite and risk strategy for all types of risk, including but not limited to financial, non-financial and compliance risk; (ii) the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems; and (iii) other related risk management topics. The Risk Committee pre-discusses such matters after which it provides its input together with its recommendation to the SB, after which the SB discusses and, where needed, decides on such matters.\n\nThe Risk Committee aims to ensure that integrity continues to come first for ING and that critical nonfinancial risk areas stay top of mind, as an integral part of ING's identity. Through risk management ING builds strong foundations, supported by structural solutions that continue to earn and maintain the trust of its stakeholders, including its customers and society at large.\n\nAt each quarterly Risk Committee meeting financial and model risks, non-financial risks and compliance risks were discussed. This included the status of ING's accompanying metrics, such as for risks in the areas of solvency, liquidity and funding, credit, country, market, IT, non-financial risk and compliance. The discussions were supported by different analyses conducted on the inflationary and geopolitical impact on ING's credit portfolio, capital and liquidity position, and updates on credit developments in certain countries and portfolios. The non-financial and compliance risk discussions were supported by (i) updates of the bankwide KYC enhancement and maturity efforts, (ii) a variety of topical dashboards such as on IT (risk), cybersecurity, sourcing, data quality and data privacy (including GDPR) and (iii) the status of implementation of related regulatory programmes.\n\nAs part of the annually recurring topics, the Risk Committee discussed, among other things, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual review of the Risk Appetite Framework and accompanying principles and risk appetite statements;\n- \u00b7 The annual update to the Recovery Plan;\n- \u00b7 The review of the scope of ING's key policies.\n- \u00b7 The impact of upcoming regulations, and credit developments in certain countries and portfolios;\n\nThe Risk Committee also regularly discussed the status of reported whistleblower concerns.",

Thematic sessions in 2023 encompassed: leveraged transactions framework and management, credit risk assessment system improvements setting and steering signals, the cyber evaluation, the internal capital adequacy assessment process (including economic capital and stress testing), climate risk stress testing with a focus on floods and sea-level rising and a data and model ethics session. All SB members had a standing invitation for these sessions and participated in several of these as deemed relevant to them.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the SB, with the SB approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\nRead more on how ING manages its risks in 'Risk management'.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee met seven times in 2023.\n\nThe committee assists and advises the SB with (i) the performance of its duties in relation to the integrity and quality of ING's financial reporting, (ii) the effectiveness of ING's internal risk management and control systems in relation to financial reporting and (iii) the preparation of the discussions within and the decisions of the SB on such matters.\n\nThe Audit Committee addressed, among other things, the following recurring topics:\n\n- \u00b7 The quarterly results and the related press releases, the interim accounts and the financial statements, the Annual Report, the 6-K and 20-F forms, and the SOx Act 404 Report;\n- \u00b7 Judgemental accounting topics;\n- \u00b7 Financial reporting, including the quarterly results;\n- \u00b7 Key audit matters, as included in the auditors' reports;\n- \u00b7 (The approval of) the external auditor's audit plan/engagement letter/independence and fees;\n- \u00b7 The overall internal control environment, the internal controls over financial reporting, the internal and external auditor reports;\n- \u00b7 The review of the internal audit function;\n- \u00b7 Matters related to the financing of the company, including the assessment of ING's capital and liquidity position;\n- \u00b7 The internal audit plan, including its support and progress monitoring;\n- \u00b7 Critical and high rated overdue issues, as reported by the internal audit function;\n\n- \u00b7 The updated internal audit charter;\n- \u00b7 ING's long-term CET1 ratio target level;\n- \u00b7 The update of ING's key policies;\n- \u00b7 ING's dividend and distribution policy;\n- \u00b7 Capital and liquidity management.\n- \u00b7 SOx Act framework;\n\nThe Audit Committee performed an assessment of the functioning of the external auditor, the scope and materiality of the audit plan and the principal risks identified in the audit plan. In 2023, the Audit Committee was involved in the selection procedure for the nomination for the legally required rotation of the auditor as of reporting year 2026.\n\nSpecific attention was paid to a variety of other related topics. These included, among other things, the following topics:\n\n- \u00b7 ICAAP governance;\n- \u00b7 IFRS 9, ESG-disclosures;\n- \u00b7 External audit quality indicators;\n- \u00b7 ING's additional capital distributions including cash dividend payments and share buy-back programmes.\n\nIn 2023, the thematic sessions for the Audit Committee encompassed: impact of market volatility on financial reporting (e.g. foreign currencies and rising interest rates), disclosure requirements (including ESG), and internal audit methodologies.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the SB, with the SB approving those items as required from a governance perspective. Directly following the Audit Committee meetings, the members of the Audit Committee met in a closed meeting with the internal and external auditors to seek confirmation that all relevant topics were discussed in the Audit Committee meetings.\n\nTo properly prepare for the regular Audit Committee meetings, the chairperson of the Audit Committee held separate sessions with the external auditor, the general manager of the internal audit department, the chief financial officer (CFO) and the Group Controller. The chairperson also met with various senior managers.\n\n## Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee met 11 times in 2023.\n\nThe committee assists the SB with the performance of its duties in relation to selection and nomination of, among others, the members of the SB, EB and MBB, talent management and the effectiveness of ING's governance arrangements.

The committee prepares the discussions with and decisions of the SB on such matters.\n\nWith regard to nomination-related matters, ING aims to ensure that all of its boards are, at all times, adequately composed to perform their duties. As its standard practice, the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee therefore discusses (i) the performance of the individual members of the EB and the MBB (also serving as input to the Remuneration Committee) and (ii) medium- to long-term succession planning for the EB, the MBB and the SB. A continuing conversation on EB and MBB succession planning is facilitated by the chief human resources officer as part of the regular Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee meetings in the form of deep dives by function and business line.\n\nWhen selecting suitable board succession candidates, various aspects are to be taken into account in view of board composition, such as regulatory requirements, suitability considerations, banking and other industry knowledge, outside positions, independence, no conflicts of interest and availability. Also, the minimum and optimal size of a board and diversity aspects such as how to arrive at an appropriate balance in its representation of regions, age, gender, knowledge and expertise are to be taken into account. The generic profiles of the EB and the SB aim to capture these elements. The profiles can be found on ing.com. Read more on the boards' composition in the 'Composition of the Executive Board, Management Board Banking and Supervisory Board' section that also includes a diversity and competence matrix.\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee also focuses on ING's broader talent and succession planning in view of bench strength and diversity at higher management levels, with selected key roles receiving dedicated attention. This is done by taking into account ING's diversity policy and by accelerating refreshment where possible without jeopardising business continuity. The diversity policy is published on ing.com. The committee also holds periodic conversations outside of its regular meetings with internal talented individuals who are considered to have the potential to assume more senior and complex roles in the organisation over time. The results of these conversations are fed into the individuals' coaching and development plans.\n\nWith regard to corporate governance, the committee discussed, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 The 2023 Annual Report and the accompanying booklets on ING's application of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Dutch Banking Code;\n- \u00b7 The approach and agenda for the 2023 AGM;\n- \u00b7 The suitability policy framework and its global implementation, thereby also taking into account regulatory developments;\n- \u00b7 The annual updates to the corporate board charters and the decision structure as well as any changes in board members' outside positions;\n- \u00b7 ING's Governance Framework;\n- \u00b7 The revision of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the implementation of the revised code throughout ING;\n- \u00b7 The annual review of ING's key policies list.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the SB, with the SB approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee met 10 times in 2023.\n\nThe committee assists the SB, with the performance of its duties in relation to remuneration, the remuneration policies and the application and compliance thereof and prepares the discussions within and decisions of the SB on such matters. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the adequacy of information provided to shareholders on remuneration policies and practices.\n\nAs part of the renewal of the EB and SB remuneration policies the Remuneration Committee undertook a detailed review to assess whether the policies, based on stakeholder feedback and market and regulatory developments, are still appropriate. The Remuneration Committee conducted a comprehensive stakeholder engagement process with regulators, our shareholders, customers, employees (Central Works Council) and society at large in order to take into account their views on the remuneration policies. For further information, see 'Herna Verhagen's letter on remuneration' in this Annual Report.\n\nAs an annual recurring topic, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration report by way of benchmarking with the purpose of further improving the remuneration report. For further information, see the 'Remuneration report' in this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, the Remuneration Committee discussed the progress and performance on the annual targets set for the EB and MBB. With regard to variable remuneration and the application of ING's accompanying Variable Remuneration Accrual Model (VRAM) (including last year's lessons learned), the committee received",

This served as input for a review of the predefined thresholds above which the pool for variable remuneration may be unlocked for those eligible as well as the accompanying individual variable remuneration proposals, including potential cases for holdback or clawback of deferred compensation by way of malus.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee in addition discussed, among other topics:\n\n- \u00b7 The EB and SB remuneration policies update;\n- \u00b7 The update of the gender diversity targets;\n- \u00b7 The progress and performance on the annual targets set for the EB and MBB;\n- \u00b7 Identified staff and high earner-related remuneration matters based on ING's remuneration governance structure;\n- \u00b7 The variable remuneration and the application of ING's accompanying VRAM (including last year's lessons learned);\n- \u00b7 The NYSE Clawback Policy and potential cases for holdback or clawback of deferred compensation by way of malus;\n- \u00b7 Updates to ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework;\n- \u00b7 The remuneration related supervision and/or regulatory letters and publications.\n- \u00b7 The actions necessary to narrow ING's gender pay gap;\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the SB, with the SB approving those items as required from a governance perspective\n\n## ESG Committee\n\nThe ESG Committee met four times in 2023.\n\nAn ad hoc ESG Committee was established in 2022 to monitor the development of ESG within ING. The ESG Committee has been established for an initial duration of two years. The SB is in the process of evaluating the functioning of the committee and whether the ad hoc character of the committee will be extended or made permanent.\n\nTo prevent an overlap between the ESG Committee and other SB committees and to safeguard an aligned and common view on ESG, the ESG Committee consists of at least one member of each of the other committees. The ESG Committee assists the SB with matters relating to the various areas of ESG (environmental, social and governance), including but not limited to, the development of ESG and the integration of ESG in the company and its strategy. In addition, the ESG Committee assists the SB by generally monitoring and advising on potential impediments as well as relevant trends and developments on 'environmental', 'social' and 'governance' topics and how to connect them with ING's response and actions on the basis of ING's ESG dashboard.\n\nWith regard to environmental, social and governance-related topics, the committee discussed, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 Key updates and relevant ESG-related matters, such as the 2023 ING Group Climate Report, sustainability targets, ESG dilemmas and greenwashing;\n- \u00b7 Any updates of key ESG policies and ESG-related supervisory/regulatory letters and publications;\n- \u00b7 Sustainable product definitions and controls.\n- \u00b7 Environmental Programme update, incl. real estate strategy & green travel budget;\n\nGiven the dynamic and continuously evolving nature of sustainability, deep dives were held to provide the ESG Committee members with in-depth knowledge and experience on, among others: ING's ESG Stakeholder engagement plan, Sustainability in connection with retail-, business- and wholesale Banking, human rights and financial health. There was a thematic session on climate risk stress testing with a focus on floods and sea level rising.\n\nIn June and September 2023 various external and internal experts organised a two day ESG Committee training to inform the ESGcom and continue the discussion on a variety of ESG related topics. The June sessions had a focus on ING's integrated climate approach and how we can empower our clients to reach net zero by 2050, climate change and the importance of biodiversity and the role of sustainable finance related to it. The September sessions focussed on ESG regulations and impact on the business, the ESG reporting landscape, human rights, ESG related risk management and financial health.\n\nAll relevant items discussed by the committee were reported to the SB, with the SB approving those items as required from a governance perspective.\n\n## Attendance of SB members\n\nThe SB met 11 times in 2023 for its regular meetings. On average, 97 percent of the SB members participated in the meetings. See the attendance matrix for the SB meetings and committee meetings for more details. The continued high attendance demonstrates that SB members are engaged with ING and are able to devote sufficient time and attention to overseeing its affairs.",

These proposals were approved.\n\nPinar Abay was appointed as head of Retail, Challengers & Growth and Market Leaders as of 15 May 2023. The combining of the roles is in line with ING's strategic priorities and was done to further simplify the management structure of ING Bank. This appointment formalised this new role at MBB level and was considered a logical step to further improve consistency, scalability and efficiency to the products and services that ING offers. Pinar took over the role of Aris Bogdaneris, who was the head of Retail and Challengers & Growth (and who stepped down from the MBB per 15 May 2023).\n\nRon van Kemenade left ING at the end of April 2023. With Ron's leadership ING has transformed into a bank with scalable technology and operations. G\u00f6rkem K\u00f6seo\u011flu was appointed as a member of the MBB and chief technology officer as of 1 September 2023. Unfortunately, after mutual discussions on different views",

Hans was appointed to the Supervisory Board in 2017, became its chairperson in 2018 and was reappointed for a second term in 2021. Hans became a member of the Risk Committee, Audit Committee, Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, Remuneration Committee and the ESG Committee. Karl Guha was appointed at the 2023 AGM as new SB chairperson, with effective date 1 July 2023.\n\nMariana Gheorghe retired from the SB effective per the 2023 General Meeting after more than seven years of dedicated service. Alexandra Reich was appointed as new SB member at the 2023 General Meeting. She became a member of the Risk Committee.\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee and the Supervisory Board will continue to strive for an adequate and balanced composition of the Supervisory Board when selecting and nominating new members for appointment, taking into account ING's diversity policy and other factors.\n\nRead more in 'Corporate governance' on the composition of the EB and the Supervisory Board.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members, with the exception of no more than one person, should qualify as independent as defined in the best practice provision 2.1.8 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.

On this basis, the Supervisory Board confirms that all members of the Supervisory Board are to be regarded as independent on 31 December 2023. On this date all members of the Supervisory Board were also to be regarded as independent within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards.

It provides information on ING Group's Supervisory Board and Executive Board, as well as on its General Meeting and capital structure.\n\n## ING's legal and management structure\n\n## Legal structure\n\nING Groep N.V. (ING Group) is a publicly listed company based in the Netherlands. ING Group is the parent of one main legal entity: ING Bank N.V. (ING Bank). ING Bank is the parent company of various Dutch and foreign banks, other subsidiaries, branches and representative offices globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management structure\n\nING Group has a two-tier board structure consisting of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. ING Bank also has a two-tier board structure, consisting of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board Banking.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Banking Code and Dutch Tax Governance Code\n\nAs ING Group is established and listed in the Netherlands, it must comply with Dutch laws and regulations and is subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (DCGC).\n\nThe DCGC provides guidance for ING's corporate governance structure and practices. ING supports the DCGC and its principles to ensure sound corporate governance within its organisation. ING's application of the DCGC is described in the booklet 'Application of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code by ING Groep N.V. (FY2023)' dated 7 March 2024, which is available on ing.com. The DCGC can be downloaded from the website of the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee (mccg.nl).\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code (the Banking Code) is only applicable to ING Bank, but ING Group voluntarily applies the principles of the Banking Code on remuneration for its Executive Board members and senior management. The Banking Code can be downloaded from the website of the Dutch Banking Association (nvb.nl).",

ING's application of the Dutch Tax Governance Code is described in the booklet 'Application of the Dutch Tax Governance Code by ING Groep N.V. (FY2023)' dated 7 March 2024, which is available on ing.com. The Dutch Tax Governance Code can be downloaded from the website of the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (vno-ncw.nl).\n\nThis section of the Annual Report, together with the above-mentioned booklets and other parts of this Annual Report to which reference is made in the booklets, comprise the corporate governance statement referred to in section 2a of the Dutch Decree on information in the management board report (Besluit inhoud bestuursverslag).\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board and oversees the activities of ING and the business connected with it. The responsibility for supervising and advising the Executive Board is vested in the members of the Supervisory Board collectively. The organisation, powers and modus operandi of the Supervisory Board are set out in the Charter of the Supervisory Board, available on ing.com.\n\nIn performing their duties, members of the Supervisory Board are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Be guided by the interests of ING and the business connected with it, thereby carefully balancing the interests of all stakeholders of ING and in this consideration give paramount importance to the customer's interest, as set out in the Dutch Banker's Oath;\n- \u00b7 Foster a culture focused on sustainable long-term value creation, financial and non-financial risk awareness, compliance with ING's risk appetite, responsible and ethical behaviour, and stimulate openness and accountability within ING and its subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 Act without mandate and independent of any interest in the business of ING;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the Supervisory Board functions effectively.\n\nThe Articles of Association, the Management Board Charter and the Supervisory Board Charter outline which resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association, ING Group indemnifies the members of the Supervisory Board as far as legally permitted against direct financial losses in connection with claims from third parties filed or threatened to be filed against them by virtue of their service as a member of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nING Group aims to have an adequate and balanced composition of its Supervisory Board, with a mix of persons with knowledge, skills and executive experience, preferably gained in the banking sector, experience in corporate governance of large stock-listed companies, and experience in the political and social environment in which such companies operate. In the selection of the members of the Supervisory Board, ING strives for a balance in nationality, gender, and educational and work background. In addition, there should be a balance of experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the business of ING. We believe that diverse leadership at the level of the Supervisory Board fosters a diversity of views and experiences and facilitates independent opinions and sound decision-making, which has a positive impact on ING's business. According to the Gender Diversity Act, ING is required to comply with a gender-diversity quota of one third male and one third female for its Supervisory Board. In 2023, the Supervisory Board consisted of two third male and one third female. We believe the Supervisory Board is also well balanced in terms of other relevant diversity aspects. Also, the Supervisory Board had an international composition in 2023, with five persons of Dutch nationality and four persons with other nationalities.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates for appointment or reappointment to the Supervisory Board, among others based on the Supervisory Board profile, which is available on ing.com. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses its composition.\n\nING believes that former members of the Executive Board can make a valuable contribution to the Supervisory Board. Therefore, also taking into account the size of the Supervisory Board and ING's wide range of activities, they may become members of the Supervisory Board of ING Group, but not in the position of chairperson or vice-chairperson. Former Executive Board members must wait at least one year before becoming eligible for appointment to the Supervisory Board.\n\nAfter a former member of the Executive Board has been appointed to the Supervisory Board, this member may also be appointed to one of the Supervisory Board's committees. Appointment to the Audit Committee is only possible if the individual in question resigned from the Executive Board at least three years prior to such appointment.\n\nFor more information on the composition of the Supervisory Board see 'Our leadership' and the 'Supervisory Board report'.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the General Meeting.\n\nFor the appointment of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board may draw up a binding list of candidates, which may be rendered non-binding by the General Meeting.

        "page_content": "- > Corporate governance\n\nMeeting to render this list non-binding, or to suspend or dismiss Supervisory Board members without this being proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires an absolute majority of the votes cast. Additionally, this majority must represent more than half of the issued share capital. The quorum requirement cannot be waived in a second general meeting. This ensures that such significant proposals of shareholders cannot be adopted in a general meeting with a low attendance rate and can only be adopted with substantial support of ING Group's shareholders.\n\nCandidates for appointment to the Supervisory Board are assessed by DNB and ECB for suitability and reliability and must continue to meet these criteria while in function.\n\n## Term of appointment of the Supervisory Board members\n\nAs a general rule, Supervisory Board members step down from the Supervisory Board after the fourth anniversary of their last appointment or reappointment. They are eligible for reappointment in the fourth year after their initial appointment and, with explanation, also in the eighth and tenth years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may deviate from this general rule under special circumstances and with explanation, for instance to maintain a balanced composition of the Supervisory Board and/or to preserve valuable expertise and experience. The retirement schedule is available on ing.com.\n\n## Relevant positions pursuant to CRD IV / conflicting interests\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board may hold other positions outside ING, including directorships, either paid or unpaid. CRD IV restricts the total number of supervisory board positions or non-executive directorships with predominantly commercial organisations that may be held by a Supervisory Board member to four, or to two, if the Supervisory Board member also has an executive board position. The ECB may, under special circumstances, permit a Supervisory Board member to fulfil an additional supervisory board position or nonexecutive directorship. Positions with, inter alia, subsidiaries or qualified holdings are not taken into account in the application of these restrictions. Such positions may not conflict with the interests of ING Group. It is the responsibility of the individual member of the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board collectively to ensure that the directorship duties are performed properly and are not affected by any other positions that the individual may hold outside ING Group.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are to report any conflict of interest (including potential conflicts of interest) to the chairperson of the Supervisory Board (or, in the case of the chairperson, to the vicechairperson) and to the other Supervisory Board members, and shall provide all relevant information. The Supervisory Board, excluding the member concerned, decides whether a conflict of interest exists.\n\nIn case of a conflict of interest, the relevant member of the Supervisory Board abstains from discussions and decision-making on the topic or the transaction in relation to which they a conflict of interest with ING Group.\n\n## Transactions involving actual or potential conflicts of interest\n\nThere were no transactions reported in 2023 in which there were conflicts of interest with Supervisory Board members that are of material significance to ING Group and/or to the relevant board members.\n\nIf a member of the Supervisory Board obtains financial products and services, other than loans, which are provided by ING Group subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business on terms that apply to employees, this is not considered to be a material conflicting interest. Banking and financial products in which the granting of credit is of a secondary nature, e.g. credit cards and overdrafts in current account are not considered a loan for this purpose and are therefore not disclosed in the 'Remuneration report'. For an overview of loans granted to members of the Supervisory Board, see the 'Remuneration report'.\n\n## Committees of the Supervisory Board\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the Supervisory Board had five committees: the Risk Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the ESG Committee (ad hoc).\n\nSeparate charters have been drawn up for the Risk Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee, and the Remuneration Committee. Terms of reference have been drawn up for the ESG Committee. These charters and terms of reference are available on ing.com.\n\nRead more about the composition and the duties of the committees in the 'Supervisory Board report' and on ing.com.\n\n## Remuneration and share ownership\n\nRemuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is determined by the General Meeting and does not depend on the results of ING Group.  Members of the Supervisory Board are permitted to hold shares in the share capital of ING Group for long-term investment purposes. Details are given in the 'Remuneration report'. Transactions by members of the Supervisory Board in these shares need to comply with the ING insider regulations, which are available on ing.com.",

This includes the day-to-day management of the business and the setting of the strategy of ING, which responsibility is vested in the members of the Executive Board collectively. The organisation, main roles and responsibilities of the Executive Board are set out in the Management Board Charter, which is available on ing.com.\n\nThe Executive Board performs its activities under the supervision of the Supervisory Board. The Articles of Association, the Management Board Charter and the Supervisory Board Charter, which are available on ing.com, outline which resolutions of the Executive Board are subject to approval by the Supervisory Board.\n\nING Group indemnifies the members of the Executive Board against direct financial losses in connection with claims from third parties filed, or threatened to be filed, against them by virtue of their service as a member of the Executive Board, as far as permitted by law, on the conditions laid down in the Articles of Association and their commission contract. ING Group has taken out liability insurance for the members of the Executive Board.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nING Group aims to have an adequate and balanced composition of its Executive Board, with a diverse selection of persons with knowledge, skills and executive experience, preferably gained in the banking sector, experience in corporate governance of large stock-listed companies and experience in the political and social environment in which such companies operate.

We believe that diverse leadership at the level of the Executive Board fosters a diversity of views and experiences and facilitates independent opinions and sound decision-making, which has a positive impact on ING's business. The Gender Diversity Act requires ING to set appropriate and ambitious targets for gender diversity in its Executive Board and senior management. In addition, there should be a balance of experience and affinity with the nature and culture of the business of ING. Factors such as nationality, gender, age and education are also taken into account for the composition of the Executive Board. ING applies a gender diversity target of at least 30 percent to the Executive Board, which was met over 2023. Also, the Executive Board had an international composition in 2023, with one board member of Dutch nationality and two board members with other nationalities.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for selecting and nominating candidates to be appointed or reappointed to the Executive Board by the General Meeting, among others based on the Executive Board profile, which is available on ing.com. The Supervisory Board regularly assesses the composition and functioning of the Executive Board.\n\nPart of this process are the following two topics:\n\n- 1. Bench strength and succession planning for Executive Board positions are continuous attention points. Potential internal candidates for such roles may be complemented with potential talent from outside ING.\n- 2. A long-term view is taken on the composition of the Executive Board, which, for example, means that steps are taken to improve the development path of women within ING and the appointment of women in senior positions throughout the organisation, in line with ING's D&I policy.\n\nSee more information on diversity, including on gender diversity in senior management, in the paragraphs on Unlocking our people's full potential in 'How we are making the difference'. For more information on the composition of the Executive Board, see 'Our leadership'.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers and proposed members of the Executive Board are appointed, suspended and dismissed by the General Meeting. Candidates for appointment to the Executive Board are assessed by the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) for suitability and integrity and must continue to meet these criteria while in function.\n\nFor the appointment of Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board may draw up a binding list of candidates, which may be rendered non-binding by the General Meeting. A resolution of the General Meeting to render this list non-binding, or to suspend or dismiss Executive Board members without this being proposed by the Supervisory Board, requires an absolute majority of the votes cast.

Only those holding shares on the record date may attend the general meeting and may participate, vote and exercise any other rights attached to their shares in the general meeting, regardless of any subsequent sale or purchase of shares. The record date is published in the notice for the general meeting. If a shortened notice period of 10 days is applicable (see 'Notice' above), the record date is two days after the convocation date.\n\nIn accordance with US requirements, the depositary sets a record date for the American depositary receipts (ADRs). This record date can differ from the record date set by ING Group for shareholders.\n\n## Attendance\n\nShareholders may attend a general meeting or may grant a proxy in writing to a third party to attend the meeting and to vote on their behalf. For logistical reasons, attending the general meeting is subject to the requirement that ING Group is notified by the shareholders in advance on how they will attend. Instructions for this are included in the notice for the general meeting.\n\nGeneral meetings are webcast on ing.com, so that shareholders who could not attend the general meeting in person, can follow the meeting online.\n\n## Voting rights on shares\n\nEach share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the general meeting. The Articles of Association do not restrict the voting rights on any class of shares. ING Group is not aware of any agreement that restricts voting rights on any class of its shares.\n\n## Proxy voting facilities\n\nING Group provides proxy voting facilities to its investors via ing.com and solicits proxies from its ADR holders in line with common practice in the US.\n\nING Group uses the 'Evote by ING' platform, an online facility through which shareholders can register for a meeting or appoint a proxy.\n\nAlso, proxy voting forms are made available on ing.com. By returning the form, shareholders give a proxy to an independent proxy holder (a public notary registered in the Netherlands) to vote on their behalf, in accordance with instructions expressly given on the proxy form. Submitting these forms is subject to additional conditions as specified on such forms.\n\nING Group will send an electronic confirmation of receipt of the votes to the person that casts the vote. In addition, on request made within three months from the date of the general meeting, ING Group will confirm to the shareholder or a third person designated by the shareholder that the shareholder's votes have been validly recorded and counted by ING Group, if this information is not already available to the shareholder directly.\n\n## Reporting\n\nResolutions adopted at a general meeting are generally published on ing.com within one week following the meeting. In accordance with the DCGC, the draft minutes of the general meeting are made available to shareholders on ing.com no later than three months after the meeting. Shareholders then have three months to react to the draft minutes. After that, the minutes are adopted by the chair of the meeting and by a shareholder appointed by that meeting and are made available on ing.com. As an alternative to minutes, a notarial record of the proceedings of the general meeting can be made.\n\n## 2023 AGM\n\nThe 2023 AGM was held on 24 April 2023 at Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in Amsterdam. In addition, the meeting was broadcast live on ing.com. ING strived and took measures in order to conduct the meeting in a manner that is orderly, thorough, meaningful and secure for all participants.\n\nThe notarial record of the proceedings of the 2023 AGM can be downloaded from ing.com.\n\n## Shares and shareholdings\n\n## Capital structure\n\nING Group's authorised share capital consists of ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares. ING Group's ordinary shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Brussels. ADRs are listed on NYSE and administered by depositary JP Morgan Chase.\n\nCurrently, only ordinary shares are issued and a call option to acquire cumulative preference shares has been granted to Stichting Continu\u00efteit ING (ING Continuity Foundation).",

New shares in excess of this amount can only be issued if the Articles of Association are amended.\n\n## Issuance of shares\n\nShares may be issued following a resolution by the General Meeting. The General Meeting may resolve to delegate this authority to another body for a period of time not exceeding five years. Each year, a proposal is made to the General Meeting to delegate authority to the Executive Board to issue new ordinary shares or to grant rights to subscribe to new ordinary shares, both with and without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders. On 24 April 2023 the General Meeting authorised the Executive Board to issue new ordinary shares (including the granting of rights to subscribe for ordinary shares, such as warrants or in connection with convertible debt instruments) for a period of 18 months, ending on 24 October 2024, subject to the following conditions and limits:\n\n- \u00b7 No more than 40% 7 of the issued share capital in connection with a rights issue, being a share offering to all shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings of ordinary shares. However, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board may exclude or restrict pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders if deemed necessary or practical.\n- \u00b7 No more than 10% of the issued share capital, with or without pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders.\n\nSpecific approval by the General Meeting is required for any share issuance exceeding these limits.\n\nThe purpose of this share issue authorisation is to delegate to the Executive Board the power to issue new ordinary shares, without first having to obtain the consent of the General Meeting. This authorisation gives ING Group flexibility in managing its capital resources, including regulatory capital, while taking into account shareholders' interests to prevent dilution of their shares. In particular, it enables ING Group to respond promptly to developments in the financial markets, should circumstances require. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board consider it in the best interest of ING Group to have the flexibility this authorisation provides.\n\nThis authorisation may be used for any purpose, including but not limited to strengthening capital, financing, mergers or acquisitions. However, the authorisation to issue ordinary shares by way of rights issue cannot be used for mergers or acquisitions on a share-for-share basis as this is incompatible with the concept of pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders.\n\nIn line with market practice, ING Group currently intends to include the following categories of shareholders in such a rights issue:\n\n- 1. Qualified and retail investors in the Netherlands and the US (SEC registered offering);\n- 2. Qualified investors in EU member states (and potentially the UK);\n- 3. Retail investors in EU member states (and potentially the UK) where ING has a significant retail investor base, provided that it is feasible to meet local requirements (in ING's 2009 rights offering, shares were offered to existing shareholders in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and the UK, where ING believed the vast majority of retail investors were located at that time);\n- 4. Qualified or institutional investors in Canada and Australia.\n\nRetail investors in Canada and Australia and investors in Japan will not be included in such a share offering.\n\nShareholders who are not allowed, do not elect, or are unable to subscribe to a rights offering, are entitled to sell their rights in the market or receive any net financial benefit upon completion of a rump offering after the exercise period has ended.\n\nThe share issue authorisation that will be proposed to the 2024 AGM will be similar to the currently applicable authorisation described above.\n\n## Transfer of shares and transfer restrictions\n\nShares not included in the Securities Giro Transfer system are transferred by means of a deed of transfer between the transferor and the transferee. To become effective, ING Group has to acknowledge the transfer, unless ING Group itself is a party to the transfer. The Articles of Association do not restrict the transfer of ordinary shares, whereas the transfer of cumulative preference shares is subject to prior approval of the Executive Board. ING Group is not aware of the existence of any agreement pursuant to which the transfer of ordinary shares or ADRs for such shares is restricted.\n\nShares that are included in the Securities Giro Transfer system are transferred in accordance with the Securities Giro Transfer Act (Wet Giraal Effectenverkeer). A shareholder, who wishes to transfer such shares, must instruct the securities intermediary where their shares are administered accordingly.",

Although the power to acquire shares is vested in the Executive Board and subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, prior authorisation from the General Meeting is required for these acquisitions if a consideration is payable. Each year, a proposal is made to the General Meeting to authorise the acquisition of shares by the Executive Board for a period of 18 months. On 24 April 2023, the General Meeting authorised the Executive Board to acquire ordinary shares in ING Group in the name of ING Group, upon approval of the Supervisory Board, for a period of 18 months, ending on 24 October 2024, subject to the following conditions and limits:\n\n- \u00b7 The nominal value of the ordinary shares in ING Group, which are acquired, held or pledged in favour of ING Group or are held by its subsidiaries for their own account, will not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of ING Group as at 24 April 2023;\n- \u00b7 The purchase price will not be lower than \u20ac0.01 per share and not higher than 110% of the opening price of ING Group's ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam on the day of the purchase or on the preceding day of stock market trading.\n\nFollowing this resolution, in May 2023, ING announced a share buyback programme for \u20ac1.5 billion and, in November 2023, ING announced a share buyback programme for \u20ac2.5 billion.\n\n## Cancellation of shares\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, the General Meeting adopted the proposal to reduce the issued share capital of ING Group by cancelling ordinary shares acquired by ING Group in its own share capital up to a maximum of 10 percent of the issued share capital of ING Group as at 24 April 2023. The number of shares to be cancelled under this resolution shall be determined by the Executive Board. The cancellation may be executed in one or more tranches. The capital reduction will take place with due observance of the applicable laws and regulations and ING Group's articles of association.\n\nFollowing this resolution, the Executive Board resolved to cancel the 121,317,501 ordinary shares that were acquired in the share buyback programme that was completed on 13 October 2023, and the Executive Board resolved to cancel the 194,812,543 ordinary shares that were acquired in the share buyback programme that was completed on 5 February 2024.\n\n## Special rights of control\n\nNo special rights of control referred to in Article 10 of the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on takeover bids (2004/25/EC) are attached to any share.\n\nPursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, shareholders and holders of ADRs of ING Group are required to provide an update on their holdings to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) once their capital interest or voting rights reaches, exceed or falls below the threshold levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% or 95%.\n\nA notification requirement also applies if a person's capital interest or voting rights reaches, exceeds or falls below the above-mentioned thresholds as a result of a change in ING's total issued share capital or voting rights. Such notification must be made no later than the fourth trading day after the AFM has published ING's notification of the change in its issued share capital. The notification will be recorded in a public register that is held by the AFM and published on afm.nl/en/.\n\nING Group is not aware of any investors (or potential shareholders) with an interest of three percent or more other than those shown in the ING shares chapter as at year-end 2023.\n\nIn addition, any person who acquires or disposes of a net short position relating to the issued share capital of ING Group, whether by a transaction in shares or ADRs, or by a transaction creating or relating to any financial instrument where the effect or one of the effects of the transaction is to confer a financial advantage on the person entering into that transaction in the event of a change in the price of such shares or ADRs, is required to notify the AFM if, as a result of such acquisition or disposal, the person's net short position reaches, exceeds or falls below 0.1 percent of the issued share capital of ING Group and each 0.1 percent above that. Each reported net short position equal to 0.5 percent of the issued share capital of ING Group and any subsequent increase of that position by 0.1 percent will be made public via the short selling register on afm.nl/en/.\n\n## Investor relations\n\nING's policy is to provide investors with information they need to make their own investment decisions. This policy has been established in accordance with best practice provision 4.2.2 of the DCGC. ING strives to provide clear, accurate and timely financial information that is in strict compliance with applicable rules and regulations, in particular those concerning selective disclosure, inside information and equal treatment.\n\nING publishes a comprehensive quarterly disclosure package on its corporate website that includes detailed financial figures. This information is discussed thoroughly on the day of the earnings release during media, analyst and investor conference calls. The publication dates of quarterly earnings releases are announced in advance on ing.com.\n\nING aims to maintain an open and constructive dialogue with existing and potential investors, industry analysts and rating agencies.

Information provided during such occasions or in any contacts with the press is limited to what is already publicly available. In the event that any inside information is inadvertently disclosed during any bilateral contacts, it is ING's policy, in accordance with applicable regulations, to publish such information as soon as possible.\n\nING Group may decide not to accommodate or accept certain requests or invitations to enter into a dialogue with potential investors, under specific conditions. It is ING's policy not to initiate bilateral contacts with investors or analysts or participate in conferences during the period immediately prior to publication of regular quarterly results.\n\nApproximately 25 analysts actively cover and generally issue reports on ING Group. A list of these analysts can be found under 'Analyst Coverage' in the Investor Relations section of ing.com. During 2023, ING Group did not provide any form of compensation to parties that are directly or indirectly involved in the production or publication of analysts' reports, with the exception of credit-rating agencies.\n\n## Differences between Dutch and US corporate governance practices\n\nING Group qualifies as a foreign private issuer under the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards. Under NYSE listing standards, foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home-country practices in some circumstances, in lieu of the US corporate governance rules. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC and NYSE, ING Group discloses any significant differences between its corporate governance practices and those applicable to US companies under NYSE listing standards in its Annual Report on Form 20-F, which is available on ing.com.\n\n## ING Continuity Foundation\n\nING Continuity Foundation is a foundation organised under the laws of the Netherlands and was founded on 22 January 1991. According to its articles of association, the statutory goal of ING Continuity Foundation is to protect and to safeguard the independence, continuity and identity of ING. If the Board of ING Continuity Foundation (the Board) believes the independence, continuity or the identity of ING is at risk, ING Continuity Foundation is entitled to acquire cumulative preference shares to be newly issued, provided that, following the issue, the number of cumulative preference shares issued may be no more than one third of the total number of shares issued. This entitlement is vested in the Articles of Association of ING Groep N.V.  On\n\nacquisition of cumulative preference shares, at least 25 percent of the nominal value must be paid on said shares.\n\nIn 2023, the Board held two meetings, on 15 May and 14 December. The composition of the Board is currently as follows: Sebastian Kortmann, chairperson, Rob van den Bergh, Allard Metzelaar and Pieter Witteveen. All Board members stated that they meet the conditions regarding independence as referred to in the Articles of Association of ING Continuity Foundation.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\n## Declaration of no objection\n\nA declaration of no objection from the ECB must be obtained by anyone wishing to acquire or hold a participating interest of at least 10 percent in ING Group and to exercise control attached to such a participating interest. Similarly, on the basis of indirect change of control statutes in the various jurisdictions where subsidiaries of ING Group are operating, permission from, or notification to, local regulatory authorities may be required for the acquisition of a substantial interest in ING Group.\n\n## Change of control clauses in material agreements\n\nING Group is not a party to any material agreement that becomes effective or is required to be amended or terminated in the event of a change of control of ING Group following a public bid. ING Group subsidiaries may have customary change of control arrangements included in agreements related to various business activities. Following a change of control of ING Group (as a result of a public bid or otherwise) such agreements may be amended or terminated, leading, for example, to an obligatory transfer of the interest in the joint venture, early repayment of amounts due, loss of credit facilities or reinsurance cover, and liquidation of outstanding futures and option trading positions.\n\n## Severance payments to members of the Executive Board\n\nThe contracts entered with the members of the Executive Board provide for severance payments that become due upon termination of the applicable member's contract, including if termination occurs in connection with a public bid as defined in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act. Severance payments to the members of the Executive Board are limited to a maximum of one year's fixed salary.",

The external auditor also attended the 2023 AGM and addressed the General Meeting, at which it was questioned on its audit opinion.\n\nAll services of the external auditor to ING Group and its subsidiaries are subject to approval by the Audit Committee, in line with the ING Group policy on External Auditor Independence.\n\nOn 5 February 2024 ING announced that at the 2024 AGM the Executive Board will propose to the General Meeting to appoint Deloitte Accountants BV (Deloitte), as the new external audit firm for ING Group for the audit of the annual accounts for the financial years 2026 through 2029. The proposal to appoint Deloitte was the result of a thorough tender process overseen by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and in accordance with ING Group's policy on the Auditors' Independence. The change in auditors is being made based on European and Dutch legislation. Accordingly the engagement of KPMG Accountants N.V. (KPMG), ING Group's current auditor, cannot be renewed in respect of financial year 2026.\n\nMore information on ING Group's policy on External Auditor Independence is available on ing.com.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nING's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to the listing of ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange, ING Group is required to comply with the SEC regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOx 404. These regulations require ING Group to report and certify on an annual basis the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The SOx 404 internal control activities are organised along the lines of the company's governance structure and involve the participation of senior management across ING.\n\nING's internal controls over financial reporting include those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ING;\n\n- \u00b7 Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisations of our management and directors; and\n- \u00b7 Provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have material effect on the financial statements.\n\nING has a process in place where, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is evaluated, based on the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Reporting (COSO) - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## Remuneration report\n\n## FOR INFORMATION ONLY AT 2024 ING GROEP N.V. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\nThe process entailed a comprehensive stakeholder engagement process with regulators, our shareholders, customers, employees (Central Works Council), and society at large to take their views on the remuneration policies into account. As always, we found engaging with our stakeholders to be very valuable and were grateful for the level of feedback and support we received.\n\nWhile 2023 was a challenging year in many ways, ING fared remarkably well, delivering stronger financial results and gaining more primary customers than ever before. This is all the more notable given the geopolitical and economic shocks and ongoing regional conflicts. Needless to say, this affects many of our clients and the societies in which we operate. Notwithstanding this adversity, we continued to successfully execute our strategy, deliver exceptional results, and make significant progress in various target areas.\n\n## Our view on remuneration\n\nING's remuneration approach is designed to enable us to attract, motivate and retain leaders with the ability, experience, skills, values and behaviours to fulfil our role as a global bank, sustainably executing our strategy while upholding our values and stakeholder interests. However, following the Dutch Banking Code, total direct compensation of the Executive Board is below the market median of a peer group of comparable companies.\n\nIn line with the remuneration principles that apply to all ING staff, the remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are designed to ensure that ING offers well-balanced remuneration within ING's risk appetite and in fulfilment of our statutory obligations.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe see stakeholder engagement as a key element in the formulation of our remuneration policies.\n\nAt our 2020 AGM, 94.4 percent were in favour of our current Executive Board policy and 98.6 percent were in favour of our current Supervisory Board policy. As part of the renewal process, the Supervisory Board conducted a detailed review of these policies in 2023 to assess their continuing suitability.\n\nNoting the strong support from shareholders for our current policies, and on that basis their support of the execution of our strategy within our regulatory framework, we are proposing that the fundamentals of the current policies remain in place. There will, however, be limited changes proposed to our peer group composition, enhanced transparency, and minor flexibility on items to execute. We will seek shareholder approval for the proposed updated Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies at the 2024 AGM. The main themes mentioned by most stakeholders during the Executive Board remuneration policy consultation and our responses were:\n\nOne of the key feedback items from stakeholders was the need for enhanced transparency around how environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters are integrated into the Executive Board remuneration policy, especially in the context of rapidly evolving developments for regulators and shareholders. ING's selection of ESG measures is designed to support the delivery of our ESG objectives and align them to regulatory expectations, both in terms of current and upcoming developments. We will continue to review and expand on our sustainability targets for scope 3 emissions. We will also take a more data-driven approach, where each year we will disclose retrospectively enhanced substantiation of non-financial performance on a quantitative and qualitative basis for the Executive Board members. In addition, we will continue to refine, adjust and enhance the robustness of our target-setting and performance assessment approach for the purposes of determining variable remuneration for members of the Executive Board.\n\nStakeholders have also suggested that ING should disclose more quantifiable non-financial metrics on an ex-ante, or at least, an ex-post basis. ING has both quantifiable and qualitative targets for non-financial measures, which support a balanced performance assessment against these measures. ING's objective is to continue to have more quantifiable non-financial performance targets, which are always disclosed for the Executive Board members in the relevant remuneration report on an ex-post basis. There are commercial sensitivities that prohibit ING from disclosing the targets on an ex-ante basis.\n\nPlease note that the Supervisory Board received feedback from various stakeholders who are increasingly concerned that, over the last few years, the actual total compensation of our Executive Board members has fallen behind our desired pay policy stance and positioning against our peer group. This is supported by the benchmark results for comparable roles in organisations that are similar in size, operating in similar geographies, and with whom we compete for talent. We will keep this issue of appropriate market pay positioning for our Executive Board members under review.",

        "page_content": "Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrategy and performance\n\nESG overview\n\n- > Remuneration report\n\nStakeholder feedback on the proposed policy changes for the Supervisory Board was positive, including on the introduction of an annual indexation mechanism for Supervisory Board fees to enable more regular adjustments in line with the wider workforce salary increase percentage. The Supervisory Board does not directly influence the annual indexation factor, in line with the feedback we received from stakeholders. The wider workforce salary increase percentage as an indexation factor aligns well with ING's profile of a leading European universal bank with global activities and will bring the fee levels more in line with peers and with those sufficient to attract and retain qualified (international) Supervisory Board members.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank our stakeholders for their engagement and feedback.\n\n## This report\n\nThis Remuneration report reflects the remuneration for the Supervisory Board and Executive Board members. In preparing this report, we took notice of the draft (non-binding) 'Guidelines on the standardised presentation of the remuneration report' from the European Commission (EC) as published in September 2022.\n\nWith respect to reporting on remuneration, our ambition is to continue to be at the forefront, providing more information than is mandatory. For example, under the 2023 Executive Board remuneration section of this report we have included the prescribed tables from the draft (non-binding) 'Guidelines on the standardised presentation of the remuneration report' from the EC. We describe the key stakeholder engagement process that we followed as part of the proposed updated Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies. We now have a new visual on the total direct compensation position in relation to the market median, as well as an improved visual for deferred shares.\n\nA further example of enhanced transparency is our 'gender pay gap analysis', which can be found in the 'Social' section of the ING Annual Report, part of our new ESG chapter. In 2022, we conducted a global analysis of gender pay for the first time, to provide a basis to structurally address any gaps using data from 2021. We repeated this analysis in 2023 with data from 2022, and expect to complete an analysis of 2023 and 2024, which will then be published in the 2024 Annual Report.\n\nIn addition to the broader benefits of a more gender-diverse senior management team - for our business, employees, and customers, increasing the representation of women in senior management is foundational to addressing our gender pay gap.\n\nING follows the guidelines laid out by the European Banking Authority, which collects benchmarking data on the gender pay gap (i.e. the difference between the average remuneration of men and women) from banks under its supervision, including ING, over the financial year 2023. ING already fulfils this requirement, having begun collecting data on the gender pay globally in 2022 and publishing its unadjusted and adjusted global\n\ngender pay gap in this report. As well as conducting a gender pay gap analysis globally, in 2023 ING also carried out an analysis on a country and entity level, with the aim of being even more transparent.\n\nI believe transparency on this subject is an important step in helping ING to advance diversity, inclusion and belonging. We do realise that there is more to be done, especially on the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. However, some of the steps we have taken include increasing our target to at least 35 percent women in senior management by 2028, and introducing an additional target of at least 30 percent women in the leadership pipeline by 2025. While these targets are not an end-goal in themselves, they are important milestones to achieving true gender equity at the top. Our bank-wide gender equity action plan, based on reliable data and proven solutions, is aimed at making sustainable and structural improvements.\n\n## Performance year 2023\n\nING has delivered strong results in 2023. We were able to continue to successfully execute our strategy by increasing the number of customers, working to provide them with a superior customer experience, further improving our digital offerings, and helping our clients in their sustainable transitions.\n\nOur full-year 2023 net result was \u20ac7,287 million (up from \u20ac3,674 million in 2022) with a full-year return on equity (ROE) of 14.8 percent (up from 7.2 percent in 2022). Both Retail and Wholesale Banking have contributed positively. This result was driven by higher net interest income and our continued low risk costs, reflecting our strong asset quality.\n\nRetail Banking has grown the customer base by 750,000 primary customers to reach a total of 15.3 million, with Germany, Spain and the Netherlands in particular contributing to this growth. It is clear our customers value our services, as evidenced by our number one position in net promoter score (NPS) in five of our 10 retail markets. Wholesale Banking achieved an all-time high NPS of 72, reflecting the high satisfaction of our clients across the globe.\n\nPutting sustainability at the heart of what we do is one of the two key pillars of our strategy. We are proud of the progress we are making, and how we are using our financing to contribute to the transition of our customers. We continue to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and support our clients in their transitions.\n\nIn October, we published our annual Climate Report, which explains how our financing impacts climate change, as well as how climate change impacts our business. It includes our progress on steering the 10 most carbon-intensive sectors in our loan portfolio towards global climate goals. As you know, our Terra approach is to engage with clients to help them make the transition, by helping them to assess climate risks and take action to mitigate them.",

However, our commercial real estate and residential real estate (mortgages) portfolios in the Netherlands are 'off track' compared to their respective sector alignment pathways. As we have just expanded our commercial real-estate targets to also cover our Wholesale Banking book, and our oil & gas to mid- and downstream, we will present our progress against this target in future reports.\n\nOur Terra approach is also reflected in the targets of the Executive Board Members for 2024, to support the transition of the most carbon-intensive sectors in Wholesale Banking, which are power generation, oil & gas, cement, steel, automotive, aviation, shipping and commercial real estate, towards a better carbon performance, in line with our 2030 decarbonisation targets. We have also reinforced our commitments to support the energy transition by stepping up our renewable energy financing efforts.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has agreed that the Executive Board's performance was satisfactory in 2023. Based on a thorough and balanced assessment of the performance of each Executive Board member against their objectives, ING's results, their behaviour, and risk and compliance matters, the Supervisory Board decided to award the following variable remuneration: 17 percent of the maximum 20 percent to the chief executive officer; 18 percent of the maximum 20 percent to the chief financial officer; and 17 percent of the maximum 20 percent to the chief risk officer.\n\nUnder the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board is annually required to consider base salary increases for members of the Executive Board, taking into account a range of factors. These include salary increases of other employees within ING, the increase of general price indices, and market competitiveness. In consideration of these factors, and given that no base salary increases were awarded to members of the Executive Board in the last three years, the Supervisory Board has determined that an increase is appropriate, awarding a salary increase of 4.0 percent to each of the Executive Board members.\n\nFor all other eligible staff, variable remuneration can be discretionary or collective and is awarded based on criteria for the overall group, business line, and individual performance. At least half of these targets must be non-financial. A considerable part of the variable remuneration is awarded based on collective agreements. In 2023, the total amount awarded was \u20ac514.9 million, reflecting an 11.6 percent increase against the total target variable remuneration pool.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank all ING employees for their continuing support and dedication to ING, our customers, and other stakeholders. It has not always been easy, yet they remain the power behind ING's purpose.\n\n## Herna Verhagen\n\nChairperson of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\n## About this report\n\nThis Remuneration report is based on the remuneration policies for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. This section of the report (p. 101 - p. 123) is the Remuneration report as referred to in the Dutch Act implementing the Shareholder Rights Directive II (SRD II). It will be presented to shareholders at the 2024 AGM for an advisory vote. An explanation of how the results of this vote are taken into account will be included in the 2024 Remuneration report.\n\nThis Remuneration report includes under section 2023 Executive Board remuneration, further alignment with prescribed tables from the draft (non-binding) 'Guidelines on the standardised presentation of the remuneration report' from the European Commission. In addition, we describe the process of key stakeholder engagement followed as part of the proposed updated Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies.\n\n## 2023 AGM\n\nThe 2022 Remuneration report was presented for an advisory vote at the AGM held on 24 April 2023 (hereafter called the 2023 AGM). The outcome was an advisory vote of 92.96 percent in favour. A number of shareholders made comments with regard to the remuneration of the CEO which was comparatively modest. In this year's report, feedback from the AGM is addressed by providing more transparency around\n\nING and EB target-setting, with more attention paid to areas such as customer satisfaction, sustainability, and social impact .\n\nWe recognise that remuneration is an important and sensitive topic and that viewpoints on the topic may vary for different stakeholder groups. The Supervisory Board is fully committed to ensuring that our approach to remuneration achieves a balance of interests across different stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement is a key element in the formulation of our remuneration policies. We have regular dialogues with our stakeholders and in 2023 we performed an extensive round of dialogues specifically in preparation for the renewal of our remuneration policies ahead of the 2024 AGM. The Supervisory Board will continue to foster a transparent dialogue on remuneration and future policy amendments.\n\n## Board changes and business events in 2023\n\nTanate Phutrakul was reappointed as a member of the Executive Board at the 2023 AGM for another fouryear term lasting until the end of the 2027 AGM.\n\nOn 2 February 2023, it was announced that Hans Wijers had expressed the intention to hand over his duties as chairperson and retire from the Supervisory Board for personal reasons. Prior to this, Mariana Gheorghe had also expressed her intention to retire from the Supervisory Board at the end of the 2023 AGM. During the 2023 AGM, shareholders approved the appointment of Karl Guha upon the departure of Hans Wijers as the new chairperson of the Supervisory Board, and Alexandra Reich as a new member to the Supervisory Board for a four-year term. In addition, shareholders approved the reappointment of Herna Verhagen and Mike Rees to the Supervisory Board for another four-year term.\n\n## Main decisions on the remuneration of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board for 2024\n\nThe following decisions were taken in relation to remuneration for 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 Updates to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies will be proposed;\n- \u00b7 Base salary of the Executive Board members from 1 January 2024 will be increased by 4.0 percent, see '2024 Executive Board remuneration';\n- \u00b7 The Supervisory Board fees will be indexed with an increase at 5.4 percent for 2024, subject to a positive binding vote by the AGM on 22 April 2024 on the proposed updated Supervisory Board remuneration policy, see '2024 Supervisory Board remuneration'.",

During 2023, there was no deviation from the procedure for the implementation of the Executive Board remuneration policy. In line with this policy, the remuneration of the Executive Board members is designed to attract, motivate and retain leaders. Retention is an important goal since this contributes to long-term performance. In addition, delivery of both financial and non-financial KPIs, including ESG performance targets, contributes towards sustainable long-term value creation for stakeholders.\n\nSRD II requires listed companies to submit their remuneration policies to the AGM at least once every four years. Should policy changes be proposed, our stakeholders need to be consulted first about the proposed changes. An updated version of the policy will then be submitted for adoption by the General Meeting.\n\nIn 2023, ING engaged with its various stakeholders in an open dialogue on changes to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policy, and for 2024, policy updates are proposed. In 2024, ING's Executive Board remuneration policy and Supervisory Board remuneration policy will be presented for shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM. For further information on the updated policies, we refer to the letter of the chairperson of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Committee.\n\nPlease note that the following paragraphs present a brief summary of the current applicable Executive Board remuneration policy.\n\n## Total direct compensation\n\nTotal direct compensation is the total of fixed and variable remuneration, excluding benefits such as pension and allowances.\n\nTotal direct compensation for the Executive Board members is determined and reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board. In line with the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Executive Board's total direct compensation for 2023 was compared to a peer group as formulated in the Executive Board remuneration policy. The peer group is based on five guiding principles, reflecting ING's current profile, and is explained in the Executive Board remuneration policy. In short, these principles are described in the next table.\n\n| Guiding  principle    | Short description                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Size                  | ING acknowledges the importance of including companies that are broadly comparable in terms  of size and complexity                       |\n| Governance  framework | ING is subject to the Dutch (financial services) regulatory framework and operates within a Dutch  stakeholder environment                |\n| Geography             | ING is a leading European universal bank with a global presence and is headquartered in the  Netherlands                                  |\n| Talent market         | ING is increasingly experiencing a cross-pollination of talent across sectors/industries, not limited  to traditional banking competitors |\n| Balancing             | ING acknowledges the importance of not losing sight of relevant peer companies that do not  match on the other criteria                   |\n\nIn line with the Dutch Banking Code, the 2023 peer group consists of both financial and non-financial companies, taking into account the relevant international context. In addition, the Supervisory Board decided to exclude the UK and Switzerland from our peer group, due to different pay structures in their financial sectors. Following an external and independent review in line with the Executive Board remuneration policy in 2023, the current peer group composition remains unchanged and comprises:\n\n| ABN AMRO   | Ahold Delhaize   | BBVA            | Deutsche Bank    |\n|------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Aegon      | ASML             | Banco Santander | Intesa Sanpaolo  |\n| NN Group   | Heineken         | BNP Paribas     | Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale |\n| Rabobank   | Philips          | Cr\u00e9dit Agricole | UniCredit        |\n\nIn line with the requirements laid out in the Dutch Banking Code, the actual earned total direct compensation of members of the Executive Board under the Executive Board remuneration policy should be below the market median of the peer group. The calculation of pay positioning of the Executive Board members against the peer group is performed on this basis (i.e. actual fixed salary plus actual variable remuneration). Based on the latest available survey data of actual total direct compensation earned, ING's Executive Board members were all paid below the market median.\n\nIn the next visual, the total direct compensation position of each Executive Board member in relation to the market median and market benchmarks is shown.",

The Remuneration Committee reviews the individual base salaries of the Executive Board members annually and proposes any changes to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has the discretion to increase the individual base salaries. The below factors are given consideration in determining their base salaries:\n\n- \u00b7 the individual's level of skill and performance;\n- \u00b7 remuneration level at the external peer group;\n- \u00b7 internal pay ratios and salary increases for other employees within ING;\n- \u00b7 public indexation reference points (e.g. consumer price index);\n- \u00b7 stakeholder views.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nVariable remuneration for Executive Board members is limited to a maximum of 20 percent of base salary in line with legislative requirements. The Executive Board remuneration policy provides for an at target variable remuneration of 16 percent of base salary. At least 50 percent of this is based on non-financial performance criteria. For the CRO, the non-financial performance criteria is 75 percent. If performance criteria are exceeded, the Supervisory Board can increase the variable component to the maximum of 20 percent of base salary. If performance is below target, the variable component will be decreased, potentially down to zero.\n\nThe applicable performance criteria are based on ING's strategy and priorities for the financial year, aiming to drive sustainable outcomes for ING, including financial returns that correspond to shareholder returns in the short- and longer term. The performance criteria therefore contribute to the long-term objectives of ING.\n\nAll variable remuneration is awarded fully in shares. There is a minimum holding period of five years from the award date plus an additional holding year as of the vesting date. This combination (i.e. all shares plus a long holding period) fosters alignment with shareholders and a focus on the long term.\n\nThe Supervisory Board predetermines the performance criteria for the Executive Board each year to ensure alignment between ING's strategy, performance objectives and long-term interest. For further details on the pay-out of variable remuneration, please see the Executive Board remuneration policy which is disclosed in full on ing.com under the section 'Remuneration'. Illustrated below is the pay-out scheme of variable remuneration for Executive Board members.",

This is the same as for all employees working in the Netherlands without a supplementary pension scheme. Executive Board members are compensated for the lack of pension accrual above this amount by means of an individual savings allowance (see 'Benefits'), to be determined annually, on the same terms that apply to other participants in the Collective Defined Contribution pension plan. The set-up of this compensation for the lack of pension accrual is in line with best practices in the Netherlands.\n\n## Benefits\n\nExecutive Board members are eligible for additional benefits, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 contributions individual savings plans;\n- \u00b7 travel and accident insurance;\n- \u00b7 individual savings allowance (as explained under 'Pension' above);\n- \u00b7 other benefits:\n- \u00b7 expatriate allowances (such as housing, school/tuition fees and international health insurances, if applicable);\n- \u00b7 banking and insurance benefits from ING (on the same terms as for other employees of ING in the Netherlands);\n- \u00b7 tax and financial planning services to ensure compliance with the relevant legislative requirements;\n- \u00b7 the use of either a company car or driver service.",

They may be reappointed by the General Meeting in line with ING's Articles of Association and applicable rules and regulation. Executive Board members have a commission contract for an indefinite period. ING has the option to terminate the contract if a member is not reappointed by the General Meeting, or if their membership of the Executive Board is terminated. There is a three-month notice period for individual board members and a six-month notice period for ING. During this time, the board member would, in principle, continue to work and remains eligible for all agreed remuneration components.\n\nIn the event of an involuntary exit, Executive Board members are eligible for an exit arrangement. If termination of the contract is based on mutual agreement, the Executive Board member is eligible for a severance payment. These arrangements are subject to specific requirements (e.g. limited to a maximum of one year of fixed base salary and under the condition that there should be no reward for failure). Should an Executive Board member depart voluntarily or in circumstances involving fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct or any activity detrimental to ING, no severance payment or award of variable remuneration over the performance year will be made and outstanding deferrals will lapse.\n\n## Annual review of the Executive Board remuneration\n\nIn accordance with the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board annually determines the actual remuneration for members of the Executive Board, based on advice from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's responsibilities include preparing the Supervisory Board for decisions regarding the individual remuneration of members of the Executive Board. In performing its tasks, the Remuneration Committee takes note of the views of individual Executive Board members with regard to the amount and structure of their own remuneration. Remuneration proposals for individual Executive Board members are drawn up in accordance with the Executive Board remuneration policy and cover the following aspects: remuneration structure, external benchmark results based on an annual review and validation of the Executive Board peer group, the amount of the fixed and variable remuneration components, the performance criteria used and, if and when considered appropriate, stakeholder engagement and the pay ratios within the company and its affiliated enterprises. In the performance of its tasks, the Remuneration Committee works together with the Risk Committee.\n\nThe Executive Board variable remuneration proposals were determined based on scenario analysis performed against different performance standards and payout levels including threshold, target and maximum and presented to the Supervisory Board for consideration. In conclusion, the proposed variable remuneration awards for the Executive Board members were considered fair and appropriate and in line with legislative requirements of maximum of 20 percent of base salary. The scenario analysis provided no\n\n## Special employment conditions\n\nIn line with the Executive Board remuneration policy, the Supervisory Board may decide to temporarily apply special employment conditions, for example to secure the recruitment of new Executive Board members in exceptional circumstances, when this is necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of ING as a whole, or to assure its viability. In 2023, there were no such special employment conditions granted.",

Using the CEO's total remuneration (i.e., the total of fixed and variable remuneration, including benefits such as pension and allowances) compared to the average remuneration for all ING staff, the ratio in 2023 was 1:24. The lower ratio for 2023 compared to 2022 is mainly caused by the fact that the remuneration of the CEO remained stable while the average remuneration of ING staff increased.\n\nTable 2 (on the next page) shows the development of directors' remuneration (Executive Board and Supervisory Board members), company performance and the average remuneration of an ING employee. This is carried out by showing the development of the remuneration for Executive Board and Supervisory Board members over the last five years presented in percentages.\n\n|   1. Internal ratio for CEO | All ING staff   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n|                        2023 | 1:24            |\n|                        2022 | 1:25            |\n|                        2021 | 1:28            |\n|                        2020 | 1:31            |\n|                        2019 | 1:27            |\n\nFurthermore, we also calculated the average ratio of total remuneration for the chief financial officer (CFO) and chief risk officer (CRO) compared to all ING staff. On that basis the average ratio in 2023 for the CFO and CRO was 1:18, which is comparable to that of 2022.\n\n## Remuneration versus company performance and average employee remuneration\n\nWith respect to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, it should be noted that there is no link to company performance in order to safeguard its independent role.\n\nThe relative performance of the company is presented on three different metrics over the last five years. The metrics consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail primary relationships.\n- \u00b7 Return on equity based on IFRS-EU equity.\n- \u00b7 Profit before tax for ING Group.\n\nFinally, we present the development of the remuneration on average (per employee).

The relative total compensation increase from 2018 to 2019 is fully attributable to the fact that no variable remuneration was awarded for performance year 2018.\n- 5 Fixed remuneration for Executive Board members is not linked to company performance but is predominantly based on a benchmark exercise. Total direct compensation of Executive Board members should stay below the median of the benchmark, in line with the Dutch Banking Code. This has a mitigating effect on the correlation with company performance.\n- 6 The relative total compensation increase from 2020 to 2021 is mainly caused by the fact that no variable remuneration was awarded for the performance year 2020.\n- 7 In 2021, the methodology to calculate the average employee remuneration has been updated. Comparative for 2020 has been updated accordingly.\n- 8 There is no correlation between Supervisory Board remuneration and company performance. Supervisory Board members do not receive any variable remuneration. Their remuneration is based on fixed fees related to their role and number of meetings. The high fluctuations are caused by role changes during the year and differences in the number of meetings.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## 2023 Executive Board performance assessment and reward process\n\nThe Executive Board performance assessment and reward process includes a number of key steps. This process serves as the foundation to determine the variable remuneration for Executive Board members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the start of the performance year, the Supervisory Board approves the financial, non-financial and risk performance targets applicable to the Executive Board members for that year:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial performance target areas including profit-based and return-based targets;\n- \u00b7 Non-financial performance target areas consisting of customer (except the CRO), risk & regulatory, strategy, environment & social.\n\nEach performance target area is weighted and when combined, all weightings total 100 percent. The Dutch Remuneration Policy for Financial Enterprises Act (Wet Beloningsbeleid Financi\u00eble Ondernemingen, Wbfo) specifies that at least 50 percent of variable remuneration metrics must be based on non-financial targets. The CEO is aligned fully to Group performance, while for the CFO, it is a mix of both Group and functional performance targets. The non-financial targets for the CRO are predominantly based on performance targets that are linked to the function and role.\n\nThe applicable performance targets are based on ING's strategy, with customers and sustainability as the core pillars. The performance targets for the Executive Board members reflect ING's priorities for the financial year, aiming to drive sustainable outcomes, including financial returns that drive shareholder returns in both the short and longer term. In addition, non-financial targets, including ESG-related targets, are also taken into account and contribute towards long-term sustainable value for both ING and society. ING's remuneration approach is strongly linked to a robust and transparent performance management process which aims to reward sustainable performance.\n\nThe target areas, targets and weightings are included in the performance target cards for each Executive Board member. The performance target card consists of both quantitative- and qualitative-based targets to\n\nachieve a balanced and holistic assessment. Quantitative-based targets are measured primarily on a formulaic basis where the expected target performance level must be achieved before the on-target payout can be earned. Qualitative targets are clearly defined with descriptors of levels of what is expected of the performance, such as speed of delivery, quality of delivery and ways of working. These are assessed using a standard three-point rating scale which aligns with ING's Step Up Performance rating approach. The overall outcome of the performance target card assessment described above is the starting point for determining the variable remuneration of the Executive Board members.\n\nThroughout the year, regular conversations take place between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board to review their performance. Progress against performance measures is formally tracked and discussed at least twice a year in the mid-year and year-end reviews. The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee takes an active role in assessing the performance of individual Executive Board members, and informs both the Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee provide input and assess the performance of Executive Board members to determine the variable remuneration to be awarded. They jointly advise the Supervisory Board on the recommendations to get final approval of the awards. This follows a multi-step and integrated process that closely aligns with the way variable remuneration is determined for the wider ING workforce. The process covers an assessment of their performance, based on individual performance target cards. It includes targets and ranges agreed to at the beginning of the performance year, along with risk assessments measured on an ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment basis (see also 'The comprehensive process around variable remuneration', under point 5).\n\nThe integrated performance assessment process for determining variable remuneration also takes into account financial and operational performance, risk and compliance, as well as behaviour and conduct of each Executive Board member. This is supported by a robust framework for considering risk and conduct, which is in line with regulations. It includes the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance hurdles - Executive Board members are only eligible for consideration of their variable remuneration if both of the performance hurdles are met. This is in line with all employees who are eligible for discretionary variable remuneration. See 'Performance hurdles' for further details.\n- \u00b7 Risk and regulatory adjustments - Performance against risk and regulatory targets within the core performance target cards are made, including an assessment of financial risk and non-financial risk targets measured on an ex-ante basis. The targets and ranges are set at the beginning of the financial year, taking into account ING's risk appetite statement framework. Performance against these risk and regulatory targets may lead to a downward or upward modification in variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Additional risk adjustments - Further downward risk adjustments may also be made to variable remuneration based on broader risk management performance not within risk appetite, including additional ex-ante risk performance that needs to be considered and/or ex-post risk events that may lead to a financial or reputational impact on ING. Finally, the Risk function assesses individual risk",

In the most serious of incidents, additional risk adjustments in the form of holdbacks or clawbacks 1 can also impact individual variable remuneration.\n\nThe CRO is responsible for recommending any risk adjustments to variable remuneration awards for the CEO and CFO. The Risk Committee is responsible for recommending this for the CRO. The final decision is made by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board, based on the advice of the Remuneration Committee and Risk Committee, decides on any risk adjustments (potentially to zero) to variable remuneration for Executive Board members. As a final step in the process, in exceptional circumstances the Supervisory Board may apply its discretion to adjust upwards or downwards the variable remuneration of Executive Board members.\n\n## 2023 Executive Board base salary\n\nThe base salary for all roles of the Executive Board remained unchanged for 2023 as disclosed in our 2022 Remuneration report.",

Net profit almost doubled, with strong contributions from both Retail and Wholesale Banking. This was driven by higher net interest income and our continued low risk costs, reflecting our strong asset quality. In Retail Banking, the number of primary customers increased by 750,000 over the course of the year to reach a total of 15.3 million. Wholesale Banking achieved an all-time high NPS score of 72 at year-end, driven by high satisfaction with our relationship managers' sector knowledge, pro-activity, clear communication and their understanding of their clients' needs. Financially, profit before tax rose to \u20ac10.5 billion, with the return on equity rising to 14.8 percent.\n\nLooking at the progress of our climate alignment, we're currently on track to achieve our medium-term 2030 sector decarbonisation targets in four of our 10 Terra (sub)sectors and close to the target (less than five percent deviation) for three (sub)sectors. We continue to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and support our clients in their transitions. In 2023, we mobilised \u20ac115 billion of financing for our clients that contributes to their transition versus \u20ac101 billion in 2022, and we closed 792 sustainability transactions.\n\nThe financial and capital results were well above the performance hurdles. Following this achievement, the Supervisory Board conducted a thorough and balanced performance assessment. Based on the outcomes of this and their overall achievements, the Supervisory Board concluded that the Executive Board members delivered strong results in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board considered whether any discretionary adjustment was required and determined that both the financial and non-financial results speak for themselves in the current environment. The Supervisory Board also considered the behaviour of the Executive Board members and saw no reason to apply any discretionary adjustments.\n\nIn the final step, the Supervisory Board took into consideration the feedback of the CRO and Risk Committee on risk and compliance matters. Here, there was no reason to apply any individual additional risk adjustments in accordance with ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework (IRRF). 2\n\nFollowing this performance assessment process the resulting variable remuneration award for Steven van Rijswijk is \u20ac299,565; for Tanate Phutrakul \u20ac224,104; and for Ljiljana \u010cortan \u20ac208,043. For the CEO, this equates to a variable remuneration award at 17 percent out of the maximum 20 percent cap. For the CFO, it\n\nrepresents 18 percent out of the maximum 20 percent cap, and for the CRO, it represents 17 percent out of the maximum 20 percent cap (see table 3. '2023 variable remuneration outcomes').\n\nAs recognised in the profit or loss statement of 2023, the expenses for each Executive Board member (active on 31 December 2023), relating to their role on the Executive Board, amount to \u20ac2.4 million for the CEO, \u20ac1.8 million for the CFO and \u20ac1.8 million for the CRO. These amounts include deferred elements from previous years, paid out in 2023.\n\nThe following paragraphs (i.e. total direct compensation, pension costs and benefits) show the remuneration awarded to individual Executive Board members with respect to the performance years 2023 and 2022. 3 All Executive Board remuneration is paid directly by ING.",

This is conditional on there being no holdback. The main condition for vesting is that these shares require continued employment through vesting date. The table below details all share-based remuneration for the Executive Board members. This new format is in line with the draft (non-binding) 'Guidelines on the standardised presentation of the remuneration report' from the European Commission. The main change is to provide more detail of share-based remuneration processed during 2023, including new award grants, vesting events, any adjustments made to awards in year and also details of awards that are subject to retention obligations post vesting during the year.\n\n|                            | 6.

In consideration of these factors and that no base salary increases were awarded to the Executive Board members in the last three years, the Supervisory Board has determined that an increase is appropriate. The Supervisory Board has awarded a salary increase of 4.0 percent to each of the Executive Board members. For 2024 the following target areas and percentage weightings will be taken into account for the Executive Board members:\n\n| 8. 2024 Target areas   |                            |

The level of fees and remuneration for the ING Supervisory Board has not changed since 2016. Since then the demands on the Supervisory Board members have increased significantly. The annual remuneration and committee fees of the Supervisory Board are significantly below the median of our peer group.\n\nAn amended Supervisory Board remuneration policy will be presented for adoption by shareholders at the 2024 Annual General Meeting. This new policy will include the possibility of an annual indexation of the fees of Supervisory Board members based on the salary increases for the wider workforce within ING. 4 In line with this, the annual remuneration and committee fees will be increased by 5.4 percent for the year 2024. This indexation is subject to adoption at the 2024 Annual General Meeting of the new Supervisory Board remuneration policy and would take effect retroactively from 1 January 2024. After the indexation increase, the Supervisory Board remuneration will remain well below the market median. This results in the following amounts:\n\n| 11.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)\n\nThe primary objective of ING's remuneration principles is to attract, motivate and retain qualified expert leaders as well as senior staff (including Executive Board members) and other highly qualified staff who have the desired Orange Code values and behaviours, skills and knowledge to deliver on ING's purpose in a sustainable way.\n\nThe remuneration principles are an integral part of ING's strategy and risk profile. They maintain a sustainable balance between short- and long-term value creation and build on ING's long-term responsibility towards its employees, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. Our approach to the remuneration principles did not change in 2023.\n\nOur remuneration principles apply to all staff and are embedded in ING's Remuneration Regulations Framework (IRRF) and our people offer (OPO). The OPO sets out ING's differentiating offer as an employer in the job market and states what we ask from our people in return. It gives guidance to our global people practices, while supporting our strategy. The IRRF and OPO comply with relevant international and local legislation and regulations.\n\n- In 'Social' under 'Unlocking our people's full potential', ING provides gender pay gap information.\n\n## Our remuneration principles\n\nOur remuneration principles apply to all employees and comprise the following:\n\n## Aligned with business strategy\n\nING's remuneration principles are aligned with the business strategy and company goals.\n\n## Creates long-term value\n\nING's remuneration principles contribute to long-term value creation and support a focus on the long-term interests of its stakeholders, including employees, customers and shareholders.\n\nResponsible and fair\n\nIn line with our Orange Code values and behaviours, ING acts responsibly and treats staff fairly across the globe.\n\nMitigates risk\n\nRisk management is an enabler of long-term value creation. ING ensures its remuneration principles are properly correlated with its risk profile and stakeholder interests.\n\nPerformance driven\n\nING operates a fair, objective and transparent performance management process linked to remuneration to steer and motivate all employees to deliver on its strategic goals, aiming to reward success and prevent rewarding for failure.\n\nGender-neutral\n\nAll staff members will be equally remunerated for equal work or work of equal value, irrespective of their gender.\n\n## Sustainable\n\nING supports the sustainable recruitment, engagement and retention of all employees.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## Performance management\n\nWe aim to reward for success and avoid rewarding for failure. That is why ING's remuneration approach is strongly linked to a robust and transparent performance management process. Outcomes of performance evaluations (including collective and individual risk assessments) provide input for remuneration.\n\nOur people are a crucial enabler of our 'Making the difference' strategy, and we need to support them in unlocking their full potential. An effective performance culture is necessary to help our people reach their potential.\n\nStep Up Performance Management is our global performance management approach applicable to almost all employees. It aims to improve people's individual performance, and thereby team performance and ultimately ING's performance. Step Up Performance Management is one of our people practices that helps to increase focus, alignment and transparency. We do this through continuous conversations between managers, employees and teams. To support these conversations, there are three formal moments to discuss performance during the year: target-setting, mid-year review and year-end evaluation.\n\nFor most countries, we evaluate performance according to two dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Job: the impact employees have in their daily work on an individual and team level, based on job targets and factors such as qualitative job description, dynamic planning and specific selected quantitative priorities.\n- \u00b7 Orange behaviours: we aim to boost productivity and steer personal development through the Orange Behaviours. We expect all employees to act in line with ING's Orange Code and the underlying behaviours to deliver on ING's purpose in a sustainable way.\n\nThere are some countries (Australia, Poland and the Netherlands) that also have Stretch Ambition as a performance dimension.\n\n- \u00b7 Stretch ambitions: we ask people to set ambitions, describing how to contribute beyond their day-to-day role, focusing on the main priorities and long-term success of ING.\n\nAll targets are agreed between the employee and their manager, as well as within management teams, to ensure consistency across the organisation. ING uses three ratings to evaluate performance: excellent, well done and improvement required.\n\nStep Up Performance Management does not prescribe the targets employees should set. However, the following regulatory requirements apply to specific groups:\n\n- \u00b7 For employees eligible for variable remuneration, a minimum of 50 percent non-financial priorities.\n\n- \u00b7 For all employees in control functions (Risk, Compliance and Audit), non-financial targets are predominantly applied.\n- \u00b7 For identified staff in risk-taking roles, risk mitigation measures may lead to a downwards adjustment of the performance outcome and negatively affect variable remuneration (a risk modifier can be applied).\n\nIn order to further increase the effectiveness of our Step Up Performance Management approach, we are currently refreshing the framework as we will mention under the section '2023 specifics'. From 2024, the following changes will be implemented:\n\n- \u00b7 We will make use of a five-point rating scale instead of a three-point scale to evaluate performance, as this will allow for more nuanced performance evaluations and better differentiation.\n- \u00b7 Performance will be evaluated based on Job and Orange Behaviours performance. The majority of the countries will implement this change. By removing the Stretch Ambition as a performance dimension, we will be able to focus more on fewer targets.\n\n## Total direct compensation\n\nING aims to provide a total direct compensation level for expected business and individual performance that is, on average, at the median of the markets in which ING operates. ING's main reference market against which we compare and benchmark our compensation levels consists of other European-headquartered banks and financial services organisations that are comparable in terms of size, business mix and scope. This reference market is reviewed annually so as to ensure our peer firms remain appropriate and our pay levels market competitive.\n\nThe approach taken in determining the reference market is to i.) ensure that the pay strategy of the firms in the peer group is comparable to ING's pay strategy, ii.) sound and defensible when explained to stakeholders, iii.) reflective of similar company attributes and core competencies for talent, iv.) consistent with business and financial scope characteristics, and v.) comprehensive enough to stand up over time to changes in the market (e.g. M&A, divestiture, etc.). In addition to the core peer group, consisting of European-headquartered banks and financial services organisations which applies to all countries in which ING operates, ING has not only identified additional local banks and financial services organisations in order to capture the local dynamics (including the local talent pool), but also technology firms that serve as a secondary reference point for benchmarking certain tech roles.\n\nFixed remuneration represents a sufficiently high proportion, in line with the level of expertise and skills, and allows a fully flexible variable remuneration award. Furthermore, the level of fixed remuneration allows variable remuneration to be reduced to zero. Variable remuneration is performance-driven, subject to regulatory caps, and prevents excessive risk-taking.",

        "page_content": "- > Remuneration report\n\n## The comprehensive process around variable remuneration\n\nThe awarding of variable remuneration, where applicable, is based on group, business line and individual performance criteria unless local legislation prescribes otherwise. The criteria used to measure performance is aligned with the business strategy, objectives, corporate culture, values and long-term interests of ING. In all ING countries, we adhere to the applicable variable remuneration caps.\n\nFor Identified Staff (i.e. staff considered to have a material impact on ING's risk profile), at least 40 percent of variable remuneration is deferred over a period of four or five years (depending on the level of seniority) with a tiered vesting schedule. Furthermore, at least 50 percent of variable remuneration is awarded in equity (or equity-linked instruments unless local legislation prescribes otherwise). The deferral scheme and instruments used to deliver variable remuneration awards align with ING's long-term performance and risk management framework.\n\nThe award of discretionary variable remuneration is based on a clear, transparent and robust mechanism for measuring performance and applying adjustments for ex-ante and ex-post risks (the Variable Remuneration Accrual Model or VRAM). The VRAM construct follows a five-step process, as outlined below, leading to risk-adjusted variable remuneration pools determined at a Group- and business-line level. The 2023 VRAM set-up was approved by the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\n- 1. Target VR Pool baseline ('starting point') which is the aggregate of individual target variable remuneration amounts for all eligible employees across ING.\n- 2.  Performance hurdles, which must be met in order to unlock the discretionary variable remuneration pools. These are:\n- \u00b7 The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio must be at or above the threshold established by applicable regulations;\n- \u00b7 The return on equity (reported RoE) 5 is equal to or higher than the percentage determined at the beginning of each performance year by the Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, where capital (CET1) is below risk appetite, a downward adjustment may be applied to reduce the variable remuneration down to zero.\n\n- 3. Financial and non-financial risk performance, which is an assessment against a balanced mix of performance targets. Financial measures (e.g. profit, return on equity) are used to drive long-term growth, financial strength and affordability. In addition, different types of non-financial performance measures (e.g. customer, risk and regulatory, strategy, environment and social) are also taken into consideration. Here, ING has a responsibility to society to take into account relevant environmental, social & governance\n\n(ESG) matters when determining our remuneration policies. ESG is a key area of focus in the VRAM scorecards where people, sustainability and regulatory commitments are used to provide a clear line of sight into ING's ESG strategy, ambitions and targets, and encourage broader responsibility to support real change from the wider workforce.\n\n- 4. CEO discretion can be exercised to adjust the proposed variable remuneration pools. The CEO considers several performance factors when making this decision. This discretion is checked by the Supervisory Board and requires its approval.\n- 5. Risk adjustments are the final and independent step in the process where there is an assessment made by the CRO to risk-adjust the variable remuneration pools. Here, the CRO may recommend risk adjustments to variable remuneration pools (and potentially down to zero) on a collective (e.g. at a group, business line, entity and country level) and individual basis across additional ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustment measures. All relevant financial and non-financial risks will be considered within this step, both on a current and future risk basis (i.e. ex-ante risk adjustments), to ensure the VRAM outcome is appropriate in the context of overall risk performance. In addition, ex-post risk adjustments, including collective or one-off risk events, are a key element in the process of determining variable remuneration pools. The ex-ante and/or ex-post risk adjustments require Supervisory Board approval, taking into account the input of the Risk function and the advice of the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe final risk-adjustment measure lies in the individual performance assessment itself. An employee's performance is extensively assessed before variable remuneration is awarded. Every manager carefully assesses the performance delivered by their individual team members on the basis of pre-agreed performance objectives and in line with the Step Up Performance Management framework. In addition, managers have discretion to lower the proposed variable remuneration if risk-taking is perceived as inappropriate. In this way, variable remuneration is aligned with any additional risks identified on an individual basis during the performance year.\n\nAdditional risk requirements apply to Identified Staff who are considered risk-takers in accordance with Capital Rights Directive (CRD). These risk requirements set the minimum standards to be met during the performance year. Deviation from these standards may lead to a downward adjustment of the variable remuneration, a so-called risk modifier. This process is run independently by the Risk function, and the CRO is ultimately responsible for providing a recommendation to the Supervisory Board for decision making.\n\nFinally, a post-award risk assessment can be applied. This assessment analyses whether any events or findings occurred that should lead to a downward adjustment of variable remuneration, including for previous years, by applying a holdback (i.e., in-year variable remuneration award reduction, forfeiture of up",

Under the Dutch WBFO (which sets various requirements on remuneration), financial institutions are permitted to set a variable remuneration cap higher than 100 percent (but not higher than 200 percent) of fixed remuneration for employees outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that the higher cap is approved by shareholders and does not conflict with ING's capital adequacy requirements.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, shareholders approved to apply an increased maximum percentage of up to 200 percent for employees outside the EEA for a period of five performance years until end-2026. For 2023, it was applied to 34 employees worldwide. This mandate is used on an exceptional basis by ING and in 2020, 2021 and 2022 also applied to a limited number of employees worldwide.\n\n## 2023 specifics\n\nFollowing a full review of Step Up Performance Management (including employee surveys, leadership interviews, market research, gap analysis), several changes were introduced in 2023 which will come into full effect for all of ING Group employees as from performance year 2024. We have also embarked on a project to improve the relationship between performance results and remuneration, focusing on more transparent pay structures in order to provide employees with more confidence in pay fairness.\n\nING awards variable remuneration across the global organisation in line with our remuneration principles, global and local legislation, regulations and market practices. The awarding of variable remuneration, where applicable, is based on group, business line and individual performance criteria, both financial, non-financial and risk-based, and comes in the form of both discretionary and collective variable remuneration.\n\nCollective variable remuneration is based on collective labour agreements that are driven by regulation, law and/or workers council agreements in various countries. Over the past years the total amount of collective variable remuneration has been relatively stable and typically accounts for around 20 percent of the total spend on variable remuneration.\n\nIn 2023, our capital base and liquidity remained strong. From a financial performance perspective, the 'underlying' financial results were also strong, among others due to higher liability NII, strong results in Financial Markets and Treasury as well as lower risk costs, partially countered by higher salary increases and higher bonus accruals. Non-financial performance (customer, ESG, strategic transformation programmes) was largely as planned. From a risk perspective, both financial risk management and non-financial risk\n\nperformance was good leading to positive adjustments across most business lines. Overall, this resulted in a risk-adjusted discretionary Group VR pool at \u20ac401.0 million, equating to an 8.8 percent increase against the target discretionary VR baseline ('starting point') and 23.5 percent increase versus the previous performance year.\n\nThe total actual amount of both discretionary and collective variable remuneration awarded to all eligible employees globally for 2023 was \u20ac514.9 million (\u20ac113.8 million in collective variable remuneration), compared to total staff expenses of \u20ac6,725 million. For 2022, the total amount was \u20ac426.6 million (\u20ac101.9 million in collective variable remuneration) on \u20ac6,152 million staff expenses.\n\nIn 2023, 19 employees, excluding members of the Management Board Banking, were awarded total annual remuneration (including employer pension contributions and excluding severance payments made) of \u20ac1 million or more.

It is designed to mitigate risks and provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;\n- \u00b7 Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies, and the ING Values as part of the Orange Code;\n- \u00b7 Reliability of financial and non-financial information;\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding of assets, identification and management of liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Strategic goals of ING Groep N.V.\n\nThe Risk management section as part of the Report of the EB elaborates on ING's identified financial and non-financial risks (including credit risk, solvency risk, market risk, operational risk, IT risk, model risk, compliance risk, funding and liquidity risk, environmental, social and governance risk and business risk) and how these risks are managed. Its chapters provide insight into the potential impact on the results of ING Groep N.V. that stem from these identified risks. The design and functioning of the internal risk management and control systems are based on the Risk Appetite Framework and the Non-Financial Risk Framework. Both frameworks, explained in detail in 'Risk management', combine various financial and nonfinancial risk disciplines into a single converged approach and provide the businesses with an overview on their risks and the way these are managed. This view allows the EB and senior management to form an opinion on the adequacy of internal risk management and control systems regarding the risks they face while pursuing ING's strategy.\n\nIn addition, ING has a process in place where, under the supervision and with the participation of the CEO and CFO, ING assesses the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, based on the criteria of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Reporting Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). The design and the operation of the internal risk management and control systems are discussed annually with the Risk Committee and the full Supervisory Board, whereas the design and the operation of internal control over financial reporting are discussed annually with the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. In discharging the responsibility for ING's internal risk\n\nmanagement and control systems, the EB has made an assessment of the effectiveness of the ING Groep N.V.'s internal control and risk management systems. Based on this assessment, the EB states that during the year under review:\n\n- \u00b7 The report of the EB in the ING Group Annual Report 2023 provides sufficient insights into the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems.\n- \u00b7 Those systems provide reasonable assurance that the ING Group Annual Report 2023 does not contain material inaccuracies.\n- \u00b7 Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the ING Group Annual Report 2023 is prepared on a going concern basis.\n- \u00b7 The report of the EB in the ING Group Annual Report 2023 states the material risks and the uncertainties, to the extent that they are relevant to the expectation of ING Groep N.V.'s continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report.\n\nIt should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide absolute assurance to ING as to the realisation of financial and strategic business objectives, or that internal risk management and control systems can prevent or detect all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud and non-compliances with legislation, rules and regulations. There are a number of risks in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations or under development, or where regulations may conflict with one another, or where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings. Despite our efforts to maintain effective compliance procedures and to comply with applicable laws and regulations we therefore cannot rule out the risk of non-compliance with applicable standards. We're committed to conducting our business with integrity, and regulatory compliance has remained the priority for 2024 and beyond.\n\nAmsterdam, 4 March 2024\n\nS.J.A.

        "page_content": "## Works councils\n\nING's works councils are elected by employees and represent the interests of both the employee and employer. They contribute ideas on economic and social issues, and in doing so play a part in the proper functioning of the company and ensuring alignment with ING's purpose and strategy. The Employee Council (the name given to the collective works councils in the Netherlands) consists of five works councils and the Central Works Council (CWC). The CWC consists of at least two delegates from each works council and is the overarching body that engages with management on topics that impact all Dutch employees. Council members are elected every three years. ING also has a cross-border European Works Council (EWC), which is consulted when decisions are made that affect employees in multiple countries.\n\n## Looking back on 2023\n\nFrom an employee-participation perspective, the year was dominated by challenging collective labour agreement negotiations in the Netherlands, a number of management changes in both the Management Board Banking (MBB) and the Dutch Executive Committee (ExCo), and an update of the strategy in the Netherlands in line with the global 'Making the difference' strategy.\n\nThis strategy confirms ING's attention to sustainability and strengthens our growth ambitions in several areas. It brought a noticeable and tangible new energy to the organisation, but many organisational adjustments too. It is important to take the history and sentiment of earlier adjustments into account when dealing with new ones.\n\nAs the Central Works Council, we also made significant strides in being a strategic discussion partner for management. We are particularly proud of the work we did to achieve jointly supported improvements in the interests of both ING and its employees, such as the new standby arrangement initiated by the Works Council Tech.\n\nBy December 2023, the Employee Council received 41 requests for advice, 22 requests for consent, 112 information memos, and had submitted one initiative. All reorganisations had a significant impact on the colleagues involved.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nFor the near future, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions are likely to remain challenging. ING has a responsibility to contribute to the financial well-being of its customers, employees, and society, within certain limits, something that employees also endorse and feel strongly about. From an employee perspective, we will continue to share our insights to help improve decision-making. And we expect that management will continue to pay close attention to the interests of employees and customers in all countries where ING is active.\n\n## Members of the Central Works Council (October 2023)\n\nEmmanuel Flick\n\nAnthony Kaper\n\nMichiel van Lagen (chairperson)\n\nLudy Limburg\n\nSofiane Maktouf\n\nLeo Mekenkamp (secretary)\n\nNataliya Nikitina\n\nViktoriya Petkova (deputy chairperson)\n\nDanielle Sharma\n\nHerman Sjoerds\n\nMarinus Stoffers\n\nJeroen van der Veer\n\nMohammed Zemouri\n\n## Members of the European Works Council (December 2023)\n\nBelgium\n\nEric Caufriez, Jean-Claude Van Den Abeele, Erwin Veestraeten\n\nBulgaria\n\nBiliana Petrova-Yaneva\n\nCzech Republic\n\nJan Gajdos\n\nFrance\n\nDamien Fortin\n\nGermany\n\nKarina Kienert (secretary), Maciej Mowinski, Ulrich Probst\n\nHungary\n\nG\u00e9za Bodor (chairperson)\n\nItaly\n\nClaudio Casazza, Sami Zambon\n\nLuxembourg\n\nFabrizio Parisi\n\nNetherlands\n\nJordy Leber, Sofiane Maktouf, Jo\u00e3o Roxo Lino, Jeroen van der Veer (deputy chairperson)\n\nPoland\n\nArtur Banasik, Rafal Bednarski, Mariusz Cieslik\n\nRomania\n\nAndra Dardala, Vlad Pop (deputy secretary)\n\nSlovakia\n\nKatarina Hrehova Hrejova\n\nSpain\n\nIsabel Correcher Tello, Jos\u00e9 Luis Garcia San Rom\u00e1n",

        "page_content": "- > Risk management\n\n## Risk management\n\nA series of tumultuous events this year impacted our operating environment. These include concerns around financial institution stability following the failure of some banks, and geopolitical uncertainties due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza conflict. These conflicts have brought further disruptions to supply chains and energy prices in an environment of already high inflation. This section explains ING's approach to monitoring, managing and controlling risks.\n\nAs a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering banking services, ING is exposed to a variety of risks. We manage these risks through a comprehensive risk management framework that integrates risk management into strategic planning and daily business activities. This aims to safeguard ING's financial strength and reputation by promoting the identification, measurement and management of risks at all levels of the organisation. Taking measured risks aligned with its risk appetite is core to ING's business.\n\nThe risk management function supports the EB in formulating the risk appetite, strategies, policies and limits. It provides adequate steering, oversight, challenge and controls throughout ING on risk-related items.\n\nThis section sets out how ING manages its risks on a day-to-day basis. It explains how the risk management function is embedded within the organisation based on the 'three lines of defence' model. It describes the key risks that arise from ING's business model and how these are managed by dedicated risk management departments, with various specific areas of expertise. The section provides qualitative and quantitative risk disclosures on solvency, credit, market, funding and liquidity, ESG, operational, IT, compliance, business and model risks.\n\n## Basis of disclosures (*)\n\nThe risk management section contains information relating to the nature and extent of the risks of financial instruments as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. These disclosures are an integral part of ING Group Consolidated financial statements and are indicated by the symbol (*). This is applicable for the chapters, paragraphs, graphs or tables within the risk management section that are indicated with this symbol in the respective headings or table header.\n\nThis risk management section includes additional disclosures beyond those required by IFRS standards, such as certain legal and regulatory disclosures. Not all information in this section can be reconciled back to the primary financial statements and corresponding notes, as it has been prepared using risk data that differs to the accounting basis of measurement. Disclosures in accordance with Part Eight of the CRR2 and CRD V, and as required by the supervisory authority, are published in our 'Additional Pillar III Report', which can be found on our corporate website ing.com.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nThe risks listed below are defined as existing and emerging risks that could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated. They may have a material impact on the reputation of the company, introduce volatility in future operating results or impact ING's medium- and long-term strategy, including the ability to pay dividends, maintain appropriate levels of capital or meet liquidity and funding targets. An emerging risk is defined as a new or unexpected risk that we don't have experience of managing, and so need to proactively identify and monitor. The impact on the organisation is therefore more difficult to assess than other risk factors. These risks are on top of other existing risks.\n\nThe topics have mainly emerged as part of the annual risk assessment that feeds into, among others, the annual review of the Stress Testing Framework and the Risk Appetite Framework. The sequence in which the risks are presented below is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their financial consequences.\n\nThe 2023 risk assessment confirmed our top and emerging risks. The top risks in 2023 relate to people risk, geopolitical risk, cybercrime, and inflation risk. Climate change risk remains an emerging risk, and reflects the impact that climate change may have on the financial position and/or reputation of ING.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk management\n\n## Geopolitical risk\n\nGeopolitical risk was of the greatest concern for the MBB in 2023, and dedicated meetings were held on this topic. ING developed a specific geopolitical risk assessment to complement the normal risk-assessment process. This risk persisted throughout the year, mainly due to tensions between the US and China, relating to Taiwan and deglobalisation. Other reasons were the ongoing war in Ukraine that persisted in 2023, and the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\n## China/Taiwan/US\n\nChina's increased military presence in the South China Sea, technological advancements, and ongoing trade tensions with the US have given rise to geopolitical tensions between these countries. Despite a common interest in a good relationship, particularly across trade and supply chain, the countries also have areas of conflict, like the Taiwan situation, and their relations have become more complex in recent years. China has threatened to sell US Treasury bonds, and the US has blacklisted some Chinese technology companies. There is growing concern that US-China trade tensions could escalate into further financial disconnection. Such a conflict would cause significant disruption to global financial markets and the economy.\n\n## Deglobalisation\n\nThe period of Western-based liberalisation and globalisation is being challenged by a global trend towards polarisation and more assertive political policies. The rise of nationalism, protectionism, populist movements and anti-global sentiments in recent years has created an environment of increasing uncertainty. This could potentially lead to a reversal or slowdown of globalisation.\n\n## The war in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine continued to pose a significant geopolitical risk in 2023. It has initiated a humanitarian crisis and given rise to greater risk exposures, causing disruption to business and economic activity in the region and worldwide. Following the invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK and EU initiated sanctions against Russia in 2022. In response, the Russian Central Bank enforced liquidity and currency controls. For sanctionsrelated developments, see 'Compliance risk'.\n\nWith the support by NATO membership countries for Ukraine in the form of financial and military aid, neither side seeming likely to produce a conclusive victory in the near term, and a ceasefire or settlement looking improbable, the uncertainty about the outcome of the war looks set to last in the longer term.\n\nRemaining at risk for ING in December 2023 is \u20ac0.4 billion (2022: \u20ac0.3 billion) local equity and \u20ac1.3 billion (2022: \u20ac2.5 billion) credit exposures booked outside of Russia. In Ukraine, our exposure was approximately \u20ac600 million (2022: \u20ac500 million), mainly with liquidity facilities and other lending. Early in March 2022, we announced a decision to not do new Russia-related business.\n\n## Israel-Gaza conflict\n\nThe Israel-Gaza conflict brings significant volatility to the region and disrupts broader efforts to enhance cooperation between Israel and the Arab states. As the conflict continues to unfold, it poses a real threat to stability in the wider Middle East, and could affect oil supplies and drive the price higher.\n\n## People risk\n\nPeople risk, which can be translated into management of labour, including among others talent attraction and retention, was the highest risk in the risk assessment in 2023. The main challenges were linked to the salary and compensation demands coming from a high-inflation environment and subsequent rising cost of living. This led to lengthy CLA negotiations in the Netherlands, creating employee uncertainty.\n\nThe other concern was the skill shortage in the labour market. The labour markets in general, and the financial industry more so, face an intensified challenge to attract and keep eligible talent. Competition not only comes from peers; new players like tech companies and start-ups entered the playing field and are looking for similar profiles. On how ING mitigates the risks related to skill shortage, see 'Unlocking our people's full potential' in 'ESG overview' under 'Social'.\n\n## Climate and environmental risk\n\nClimate-related and environmental risks are among the biggest threats the world is facing. They can impact both ING and the global economy in various ways.\n\nING is aware of the risks associated with climate change and how these can impact customers and their financial health. This includes physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk can be acute, such as floods and wildfires, or chronic, such as increased temperature and rising sea levels. Transition risk can be driven by policy, technological or market changes as we shift towards a low-carbon global economy, and potentially lead to stranded assets.\n\nFor more details and mitigation actions, see 'Environmental, social and governance risk'.\n\n## Cybercrime and fraud\n\nThe further digitalisation of existing banking services, the introduction of new products, and evolving threats against those services - combined with developing technology such as generative AI and deep fake - are continuously presenting fraud-management challenges, both in the short and medium term.\n\nCriminal actors are becoming more resourceful in targeting financial and sensitive (payment/personal) data, such as customer user credentials outside the traditional banking environment. Criminals can obtain sensitive (payment) or personal data via social forums such as WhatsApp, dark web shops, by screen",

In 2023, these challenges increased further with more sophisticated phishing attempts, improved social engineering fraud attempts, and high volumes of scams through so-called authorised push-payment frauds. The increase in scams is a big concern for financial institutions, with often devastating consequences for customers. While financial institutions have limited means to prevent such authorised transactions, it is a priority to help prevent this type of fraud.\n\nFor more details and mitigation actions, see  'Non-financial risk'.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nInflation rates remained exceptionally high across the globe in 2023, triggered by increases in labour costs and high food and energy prices. Rises in inflation prompted an adjustment of monetary policy stances by major central banks, leading to rising interest rates and tighter global financial conditions.\n\nThe mix of high inflation and rising interest rates led to the further deterioration of macro-financial conditions, aggravating pre-existing vulnerabilities for both businesses and households, and ultimately increasing banks' credit risk. As such, ING still had management adjustments to its loan loss provisions in place for this at year-end 2023.\n\nFor more details and mitigation actions, see 'Credit risk'.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nEffective risk management requires company-wide risk governance. ING's risk and control structure is based on the 'three-lines-of-defence' governance model. Each line has a specific role and defined responsibilities, with the execution of tasks being distinct from the control of these same tasks. The three lines work closely together to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor risks.\n\nThis governance framework is designed in such a way that risk is managed in line with the risk appetite approved by the MBB, the EB and the SB, and this approach is cascaded throughout ING.\n\nThe heads of ING's banking business and support functions and the heads of the country units, or their delegates, are the first line of defence. They have primary ownership, accountability and responsibility for identifying, assessing, controlling and mitigating all financial and non-financial risks affecting their businesses. They are also responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the financial statements and risk reports, with respect to their areas of responsibility. The CTO is responsible and accountable for proper security and controls of global applications and IT platforms servicing the bank, and implementing proper processes. The COO domain builds bridges within ING, linking to almost every part of the bank. Its purpose is to drive secure and efficient processes for customers and colleagues.\n\nThe second line of defence consists of oversight and specialised functions in risk management and compliance. They (i) have co-responsibility for risk management, through articulating and translating the risk appetite into methodologies and policies to support and monitor business management's control of risk; (ii) objectively challenge risk management execution and control processes, and coordinate the reporting of risks and controls by the first line of defence; (iii) advise on risk management and compliance, and have decision-making power in relation to business activities that are judged to present unacceptable risks to ING; and (iv) can set minimum requirements in terms of quality and quantity of global resourcing in the risk management and compliance functions.\n\nThe internal audit function forms the third line of defence. It provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee, the EB and the MBB on the quality and effectiveness of ING's internal control, risk management, governance and implemented systems and processes in both the first and second lines of defence. To protect its independent nature, decisions regarding the appointment, reappointment or dismissal from office as well as the remuneration package of the head of the internal audit function require SB approval.\n\n## Board-level risk oversight\n\nBoth the EB (for ING Group) and the MBB (for ING Bank) play an important role in managing and monitoring our risk management framework.\n\n- \u00b7 The SB is, for risk management purposes, advised mainly by the Risk Committee, which assists and advises in monitoring the risk profile and approving the overarching risk appetite of the company as well as the structure and effective operation of the internal risk management and control systems.\n- \u00b7 The EB is responsible for managing risks associated with all activities of ING Group, whereas the MBB is responsible for managing risks associated with all activities of ING Bank. The EB and MBB responsibilities include ensuring that internal risk management and control systems are effective and that ING Group and ING Bank comply with relevant legislation and regulations. On a regular basis, the EB and MBB report on these issues and discuss the internal risk management and control systems with the SB. On a quarterly basis, the EB and MBB report on ING's risk profile versus its risk appetite to the Risk Committee, explaining changes in the risk profile.\n\nAs a member of the EB and the MBB, the CRO is primarily responsible for: (i) supporting the Board in its engagement with and oversight of the development of the risk appetite and risk appetite statements and for translating the risk appetite into a risk limits structure, actively engaged in monitoring performance relative to risk-taking and risk limit adherence; (ii) setting up the risk management framework and overseeing the development and implementation of risk and compliance policies, processes, models, compatible methodologies, including both forward-looking and backward-looking tools, ongoing strengthening of risk management/people capabilities and reports, as necessary to ensure the effectiveness of robust internal control and risk systems to fully support its strategic objectives and all of its risk-taking activities; (iii) regularly providing comprehensive information on risks to the Management Board, the Risk Committee and other relevant functions; and (iv) advising about the current risk profile, current state of the",

The GCTP meets monthly. After the MBB and the GCTP, the Credit and Trading Risk Committee (CTRC) is the highest-level body authorised to discuss and approve policies, methodologies, and procedures related to credit and trading risk.\n- \u00b7 The Global Credit Committee - Transaction Approval (GCC(TA)) discusses and approves transactions that entail taking credit risk (including investment risk), country, legal, and environmental and social risk. The GCC(TA) meets twice a week.\n- \u00b7 The Asset and Liability Committee Bank (ALCO Bank) translates the strategy into a risk appetite and sets, monitors and reviews the asset and liability objectives and risk management framework. Adequate supervision and coordination of asset and liability management is essential for good risk management and to serve customer and community needs by continued sound banking business. The MBB has delegated this responsibility to the ALCO Bank.\n- \u00b7 The Non-Financial Risk Committee Bank (NFRC Bank) is accountable for the design and maintenance of the non-financial risk management framework, including operational risk management, compliance and legal policies, minimum standards, procedures and guidelines, development of tools, methods, and key parameters (including major changes) for risk identification, measurement, mitigating and monitoring/ reporting. NFRC Bank meetings are held at least quarterly.\n- \u00b7 The Model Risk Management Committee (MoRMC) discusses and steers, on a monthly basis, the overall model strategy. MoRMC discusses and approves policies and methodologies related to model risk management.\n- \u00b7 The Global Data Committee (GDC) oversees (identifies, measures, responds to change and monitors) the Global Data function and its contribution to wider society. The GDC meets every two months.\n\n## Regional and business unit level\n\nING's regional and/or business unit management have primary responsibility for the management of risks (credit, market, funding and liquidity, operational, IT, compliance and model) that arise in their daily operations. They are accountable for the implementation and execution of appropriate risk frameworks affecting their businesses in compliance with procedures and processes at the corporate level. Where necessary, the implementation is adapted to local requirements.\n\nThe regional and/or business unit (BU) head of risk are involved in these activities. The local (regional and BU) head of risk is responsible for the analysis, monitoring and management of risks across the whole value chain (from front to back office). The local risks are discussed in local risk committees that roll up to the key risk committees at executive level. Local Client Integrity Risk Committees (CIRCs) assess client integrity risk, and they have a final decision on client acceptance or client off-boarding, from a risk-based perspective, in the areas of financial crime, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), Common Reporting Standard (CRS), and ESR.\n\n## Organisational structure\n\nThe CRO function is organised along the lines of a matrix structure integrating (i) the Global Risk functions, (ii) the Regional/Country Risk functions at entity level, and (iii) the Risk Segments, with a uniform methodology and terminology, aimed at ensuring a holistic view of all risks. Global Risk functions, organised by risk types into risk domains (departments), are ultimately responsible and accountable for the functional steering of the respective risk type globally, ensuring a uniform taxonomy and methodology is used for the setting of the relevant risk appetite levels, further cascading risk appetite into detailed risk strategies and for the effective monitoring and reporting of risks, on an individual and consolidated basis.\n\nThe following organisation chart illustrates the reporting lines in 2023 for the risk management organisation. The fixed lines reflect hierarchical reporting lines, whereas the dotted lines are for the functional reporting lines:",

The goal of the governance framework of the local business units is to align with ING's framework and to meet local (regulatory) requirements. Senior management is responsible for the implementation of and adherence to policies, procedures and standards. Policies, procedures and standards are regularly reviewed and updated via the relevant risk committees to reflect changes in requirements, markets, products and practices.\n\n## Internal control framework\n\nIn its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, ING explains its approach to mitigating risk outside ING's risk appetite. The internal control framework (ICF) translates regulations and internal requirements into policies articulating specific risks and control objectives. These policies form the basis for translation into process control standards, which are used by the business to support and promote an effective risk and control environment. The ICF includes binding principles, definitions, process steps, and roles and responsibilities to create consistent bank-wide policies and control standards.\n\nGlobal policies and control standards are developed and maintained or updated within the ICF. These global documents are designed by head-office functions and are to be adhered to by all ING entities and support functions. In line with the ERM approach, ownership for policies will be with the second line of defence (2nd LoD), while control standards are to be owned by the first line of defence (1st LoD). Global policy and control standard documents are approved by relevant approval bodies (e.g. SB, EB, MBB and NFRC Bank).\n\nThe policies are based on the risk taxonomy, which is designed to prevent overlaps in policy control objectives. The control standard owners are responsible for defining the key controls that mitigate the critical and high inherent risks in the business processes.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nAt ING, we attach great importance to a sound risk culture, which is essential for performing our role in society responsibly and in keeping the bank safe and secure. We determine our risk culture as the way in which employees identify, understand, discuss and act on the many financial and non-financial risks we are confronted with every day. We cover risk culture, ING's global Code of Conduct and behavioural risk extensively in 'ESG overview, 'Governance'.\n\n## Learning\n\nIn 2023, we continued to expand and strengthen our required learning curriculum. This is foundational learning that is centrally created and rolled out to all staff across the bank. The topics covered in 2023 were financial crime, customer centricity, cybersecurity and data protection. We continue to update our formats for our learning to increase engagement and drive practical application of the knowledge gained by staff. The curriculum is tracked centrally to monitor timely completion.\n\nIn addition to all staff modules, we continue to expand our learning offering on a range of risk topics and for risk staff. Working with risk experts, the Risk Academy has built role-based learning plans for risk colleagues which provide a wide selection of learning to support their professional development. These take the form of a comprehensive offering of learning modules and learning channels that support employees in developing their knowledge, skills and behaviours.",

The Oath came into force in the Netherlands on 1 April 2015, as part of a joint approach from all banks, aimed at introducing social regulations, a revised Dutch Banking Code implementing an oath with associated rules of conduct and disciplinary law. This way, Dutch banks show society what they stand for and are accountable for, both as individual banks and as a sector. In 2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, ING in the Netherlands changed the live Banker's Oath ceremonies into virtual ceremonies, to allow new employees (around 400 a month) to still take the oath in time and in a meaningful ceremony. After 2021, this was continued and is now common practice at ING. Before taking the oath, an e-learning and a challenge (discussing dilemmas) are mandatory, to stress the content and the importance of the oath. It also show employees the dilemmas they may face in their daily work, and how to carefully balance the interests of all our stakeholders in the decisions they make.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nING aims to align its remuneration policy with its risk profile and the interests of all stakeholders. For more information on ING's compensation and benefits policies, and its relation to the risk taken, see the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) remuneration disclosure published on ing.com.\n\n## Risk cycle process\n\nING uses a step-by-step risk management approach to identify, manage and mitigate financial and nonfinancial risks. The approach consists of a cycle of five recurring activities: risk identification, risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring and risk reporting. The cycle is designed to determine what the risks are, assess which of these can really do harm, take mitigating measures to control these risks, monitor developments to see if the measures taken are effective, and report the findings to management at all relevant levels to enable them to take action when needed.\n\nThe cycle recurs in two ways. First, the identification, assessment, review and update of mitigating measures are repeated periodically. Second, this periodic monitoring exercise may indicate emerging risks, known risks that are changing, risk levels that are changing, or current control measures that are not effective enough. Further analyses of these findings may then result in renewed and more frequent risk identification, and/or assessment, and/or change of mitigating measures.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nRisk identification is a joint effort of the business and the risk management functions. Its goal is to detect potential new risks and determine changes in known risks. Regular risk identification is essential for effective risk management. Potential risks that are not identified will not be controlled and monitored, and may lead\n\nto surprises later. Known risks may have changed over time and, as a consequence, the existing mitigating measures and monitoring may be inadequate or obsolete.\n\nRisk identification is performed periodically. In case of material internal or external change, additional ad hoc risk identification can be performed.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nEach identified risk is assessed qualitatively or quantitatively to determine its importance. This enables ING to decide which of the identified risks need control measures and how strict or tolerant these measures should be. Known risks are reassessed to detect any change in the risk level.\n\nThe importance of a risk is based on both the likelihood that the risk materialises and the subsequent financial or reputational impact that may occur should the risk arise. Unlikely risks with a potentially high impact need to be controlled. A risk that is likely to happen regularly but expected to have a modest financial impact may not need to be mitigated if the consequences are accepted by management.\n\n## Risk control\n\nRisks can be controlled by mitigating measures that lower the likelihood the risk occurs, lower the impact when it occurs, or both. The ultimate measure to lower a risk is to stop the activity or service that causes the risk (risk avoidance). Risk control and mitigation measures are defined and maintained both bank-wide and at the local level.\n\n## Monitoring and reporting\n\nING monitors risk-control measures by checking if they are executed, complied with, and have the expected mitigating effects, and by following the development of the risks and their risk levels. Risk reporting provides senior and local management with the information they need to manage risks.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) is one of the key elements of the ERM framework. Its objective is to set an appropriate risk appetite at a consolidated level across different risk categories and to allocate the risk appetite throughout the organisation.\n\n## Policy\n\nThe RAF policy explains the setup of the overarching global risk appetite. Within the RAF, ING monitors a range of financial and non-financial risk metrics with an aim to keep our risk profile in line with our risk appetite while executing our strategy. ING's RAF, which is approved by the SB, defines the desired risk profile",

It is designed to be able to withstand market volatility and stress, while meeting regulatory requirements. The framework, including underlying metrics and assumptions, is regularly reviewed so that it remains relevant. The RAF combines various financial and non-financial risk appetite statements (RAS) into a single, coordinated approach, to provide the business with a clear overview of the relevant risks and the tools to manage them. This view allows the EB, the MBB, and senior management to form an opinion on the adequacy of internal risk management and control systems for the risks ING faces while pursuing its strategy.\n\n## Process\n\nThe RAF is focused on setting the risk appetite at the consolidated level and across the different risk categories, and provides the principles for cascading this risk appetite down into the organisation. The RAF and underlying limit allocation are reviewed on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, based on their monthly review in the MBB and quarterly review in the EB and the SB. It is therefore a top-down process, which bases itself on the ambition of the bank in terms of its risk profile, the regulatory environment and the economic context. Limits that require SB approval are called boundaries, and the underlying instruments supporting the boundaries require EB and MBB approval.\n\n## Step 1. Identify and assess ING's key risks\n\nThe outcome of the risk-identification and risk-assessment process is used as the starting point for the review of the RAF. Within this step, the risks ING faces when executing its strategy are identified in the context of the current economic, political, social, regulatory and technological environment. The assessment identifies whether the potential impact is material and if it is sufficiently controlled within ING's risk management function. It benchmarks the current risk framework against regulatory developments. Known risks are reassessed, either to confirm likelihood and risk levels or to take account of potential changes.\n\n## Step 2. Set risk appetite framework\n\nBased on ING's risk assessment and risk purpose, boundaries for the overarching risk frameworks are set. Once the overarching risk appetite thresholds have been set and approved by EB/MBB and subsequently by SB, the statements are translated into risk-type-specific statements and lower-level thresholds, which are set and approved by senior risk committees, like ALCO Bank, GCTP, MoRM and Bank NFRC. Cascading is done via several detailed risk appetite statements, which have been defined per risk type, the combination of which is aimed at ensuring compliance with the overarching solvency, (credit) concentration, and funding and liquidity RASs.\n\nExamples of risk categories and their underlying risk metrics include:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvency and profitability (e.g. CET1 ratio, MREL ratio and economic capital coverage ratio);\n- \u00b7 Funding and liquidity (e.g. liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR));.\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk (e.g. exposure at default (EAD) and risk weighted assets (RWA));\n- \u00b7 Market risk banking book (e.g. net interest income (NII) at risk and revaluation reserve at risk);\n- \u00b7 Market risk trading book (e.g. event risk and historical value at risk (HVaR));\n- \u00b7 Non-financial risk (e.g. capital-at-risk and management of audit issues);\n- \u00b7 Business risk (e.g. economic capital);\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk (e.g. key risk indicators on Financial Crime and Conduct);\n- \u00b7 Model risk (e.g. number of unvalidated or inadequate pillar 1 models).\n\nING has started including climate risk in its RAF by, among other things, introducing climate risk as one of the dimensions to determine sector concentration as part of the credit risk appetite statements. In the coming years, ING will extend the inclusion of climate risk impact on other risk types with the aim of ensuring that the potential risks stemming from, for example, transition risk and physical risk are properly captured in the RAF.\n\n## Step 3. Cascade into statements per risk type and business unit\n\nThe bank-wide risk appetite is translated per risk type, which is further cascaded into the organisation. Risk appetite statements are then translated into dedicated underlying risk limits that are used for the day-today monitoring and management of ING's risks. The risk appetite statements serve as input for the quarterly planning process as well as for the establishment of key performance indicators and targets for senior management.

Monitor and manage underlying risk limits\n\nTo verify that ING remains within the RAF, it reports the risk positions vis-\u00e0-vis their limits on a regular basis to senior management committees. A monthly report is submitted to the MBB reflecting the exposure of ING against the risk appetite. An extended report is submitted quarterly to the EB and the SB and its Risk Committee. Moreover, every quarter the financial plan is checked for potential limit excess within a one-year horizon, where in the strategic dialogue the MBB can take mitigating measures or make adjustments to the dynamic plan.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important risk management tool that provides input for strategic decisions and capital planning. The purpose of stress testing is to assess the impact of plausible but severe stress scenarios on ING's capital and liquidity position. Stress tests provide complementary and forward-looking insights into the vulnerabilities of certain portfolios, with regards to adverse macroeconomic circumstances, stressed financial markets, and changes in the political and geopolitical climate. In addition to assessing P&L, capital and liquidity positions of ING for a range of different scenarios, idiosyncratic risks are also included. The outcomes of these stress tests help management get insight into the potential impact, and define actions to mitigate this potential impact.\n\n## Types of stress tests\n\nWithin ING, we perform different types of stress tests. The most comprehensive type of stress tests are the\n\nfirm-wide scenario analyses, which involve setting scenario assumptions for all the relevant macroeconomic and financial market variables in all countries relevant to ING. These assumptions usually follow a qualitative narrative that provides a background to the scenario. In addition to firm-wide scenario analyses, ING executes scenario analyses for specific countries or portfolios. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are performed, which focus on stressing one or more risk drivers; usually without an underlying scenario narrative. Finally, ING performs reverse stress tests, which aim to determine scenarios that could lead to a predefined severe adverse outcome.\n\n## Process\n\nING's stress-testing process consists of several stages:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and risk assessment: It identifies and assesses the risks ING or the relevant entity is facing when executing its strategy based on the current and possible future economic, political, regulatory and technological environment. It provides a description of the main risks and risk drivers related to the nature of ING's business, activities and vulnerabilities.\n- \u00b7 Scenario definition and parameterisation: Based on the outcome of the previous step, a set of scenarios is determined with the relevant scope and set of risk drivers for each scenario, as well as its severity, the key assumptions and input parameters. The output of this phase includes a quantitative description of the stress scenarios to be analysed, the relevant output metrics and, when applicable, a narrative description.\n- \u00b7 Impact calculation and aggregation: Based on the quantitative description of the stress scenarios determined in the previous step, the impact is determined for the relevant scenario, scope and horizon. The impact calculation and aggregation can be part of a recurring process or part of a specific process set-up for one-off stress tests.\n- \u00b7 Scenario reporting: For each stress test, a report is prepared after each calculation, which describes the results of the scenario and gives a recap of the scenario with its main assumptions and parameters. The stress-test report is sent to the relevant risk committees and/or senior management. It is complemented, if needed, with advice for management action based on the stress-testing results.\n- \u00b7 Scenario control and management assessment: Depending on the outcomes of the stress test and the likelihood of the scenario, mitigating actions may be proposed. Mitigating actions may include, but are not limited to, sales or transfers of assets and reductions of risk limits.\n\n## Methodology\n\nDetailed and comprehensive models are used to calculate the impact of the scenarios. In these models, statistical analysis is combined with expert opinion to make sure that the results adequately reflect the scenario assumptions. The methodologies are granular and portfolio-specific, and use different macroeconomic and market variables as input variables. The calculations are in line with our financial and regulatory reporting frameworks. The stress-testing models are subject to review by Model Risk management.",

An insolvent bank is unable to pay its debts and will be forced into bankruptcy.\n\nThe level and quality of capital is crucial for the resilience of individual banks. Banks are expected to assess the risks they face and, in a forward-looking manner, ensure they identify and manage all material risks. They must also make sure these risks are sufficiently covered by loss-absorbing capital to provide continuity if unexpected risks materialise in times of stress. Given the interdependencies with other financial and nonfinancial risks, this balancing act of capital adequacy needs to be done within a sound and integrated management approach. It must coherently link and align all the moving parts of the bank with its long-term business strategy.\n\n## Governance\n\nING's solvency risk governance is based on the three-lines-of-defence structure setting a clear division of responsibilities as well as an independent risk-control challenge process.\n\nGroup Treasury (GT) Balance Sheet & Capital Management, as first line of defence, is responsible for maintaining the adequate capitalisation of ING Group and ING Bank entities, to manage the risk associated with ING's business activities. This involves not only managing, planning and allocating capital within ING Group, ING Bank and its various entities, but also helping to execute necessary capital market transactions, term (capital) funding and risk management transactions. ING takes an integrated approach to assess the adequacy of its capital position in relation to its risk profile and operating environment. This means GT's Balance Sheet & Capital Management takes into account both regulatory and internal, economic-based metrics and requirements, as well as the interests of key stakeholders, such as shareholders and rating agencies.\n\nIntegrated Risk acts as second line of defence and is therefore responsible for all the risk topics within the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) framework. This starts with the annual risk identification and risk-assessment process which functions as the starting point for the annual review of the related building blocks. Integrated risk coordinates the annual review of the risk appetite framework and as part of this proposes the solvency risk appetite. The output of the risk assessment is also used by Integrated Risk for the annual review of ICAAP stress-test scenarios and the economic capital framework. By doing so, Integrated Risk challenges the execution, management and control processes in relation to the business activities.\n\nAs the third line of defence, Corporate Audit Services provides an ongoing independent and objective assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls to mitigate risks embedded in ING's business processes, including risk management activities performed by both the first and second line of defence.\n\nThe SB remains ultimately responsible for overseeing ING's overall ICAAP framework whereas the EB and MBB are responsible for the functioning of the ICAAP processes by managing and executing them. Delegated decision power is mandated towards ALCO Bank. As a sub-committee of ALCO Bank, the ICLAAP Committee and Stress Test Council own delegated responsibilities concerning the ICAAP processes and brings together expertise and knowledge from different key departments involved. It functions as an oversight body, responsible for maintaining a sound and effective processes and ensuring that the different elements of the ICAAP fit coherently together as an integral part of the institution's overall management framework.\n\n## ICAAP framework\n\nING's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) framework aims to ensure that capital levels remain adequate both forward-looking and under adverse conditions, in terms of covering material risksto-capital from both a normative and an economic (internal) perspective. The assessment of ING's capital adequacy takes into account its business strategy and risk profile, market environment, and operating macro environment. This implies that views of various stakeholders, such as regulators, shareholders, investors, rating agencies, clients and customers play an important role.\n\nThe continued strength of ING's capital position, the adequacy of the financial position, and risk management effectiveness are essential to achieving the strategy. ING's capital and funding strategy determines the underlying ICAAP elements, and thereby contributes to ING's business continuity from different perspectives.\n\nManaging ING's capital entails finding the right balance between supply and demand, while taking into account market and macro circumstances. The process of balancing these strategic goals is captured in the ICAAP framework. It is enabled by six building blocks and underlying elements facilitating the ICAAP. The following building blocks have been defined in the ICAAP framework, which are applied for both the 'normative' and 'economic' perspective as defined in the ECB guide to ICAAP, published in November 2018:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and assessment;\n- \u00b7 Solvency stress testing;\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 Planning and forecasting;\n- \u00b7 Continuity.\n- \u00b7 Capital management;",

        "page_content": "- > Solvency risk\n\n## Risk identification and assessment\n\nING's capital management and solvency risk management starts with the risk-identification and riskassessment process. Its main purpose is to detect potential new risks and identify changes in the potential impact of known risks. On an annual basis, ING performs a thorough review of its solvency risks or risks to capital. Within this assessment, bottom-up assessments are combined with top-down assessments, including a questionnaire and interviews with senior management. The results of the risk assessment are discussed in ALCO Bank, which comprises of almost the full MBB. Once approved, the conclusions of the risk assessment feed into the annual review of the risk appetite framework, the stress-testing framework, and the economic capital framework. In addition to this annual process, ING also reassesses its risks as part of its capital adequacy statement, a quarterly process to assess ING's capital adequacy.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nAs explained in the RAF section in the previous chapter, ING has established overarching solvency risk boundaries. Boundaries are risk appetite statements that are essential for risk management activity, making it of paramount importance to keep these boundaries within the defined level. The SB is responsible for approving and monitoring the boundaries, which are complemented by a sequence of risk-type-specific instruments (risk appetite statements). These underlying risk appetite statements are cascaded down into the organisation, and dedicated risk thresholds are set that are used for the day-to-day monitoring and management of ING's risks. ING has solvency risk appetite statements in place for the following metrics: CET1 ratio, total capital ratio, leverage ratio, total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), and minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) based on RWA/leverage ratio and economic capital adequacy.\n\n## Solvency stress testing\n\nSolvency stress testing allows ING to examine the effect of plausible but severe stress scenarios on the solvency position. It also provides insight into which entities or portfolios are vulnerable to certain types of risks or scenarios. Solvency stress testing is an important tool in identifying, assessing, measuring, and controlling risks to capital, providing a complementary and forward-looking perspective to other solvency risk management tools. For solvency stress testing, ING follows the same steps described in the overall section on stress testing.\n\nING distinguishes the following three types of stress test analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis: Assess the impact of a predefined shock in one or more risk drivers. The main purpose of sensitivity analyses is to monitor the impact of this predefined (or standardised) shock over time to get an understanding of how the risk profile of the bank has developed. In contrast with scenario analyses, sensitivity analyses are built on a predefined set of shocks that don't necessarily relate to a qualitative story line.\n\n- \u00b7 Scenario analysis: Used to assess the impact of historical, statistical and/or hypothetical circumstances on the financial position of ING. These stress tests often build on a qualitative scenario narrative and reflect risk topics that are deemed relevant for ING given, for example, its business model or geographical presence. To execute such a stress test, scenarios need to be determined that are dynamic and forwardlooking, and incorporate the occurrence of a string of events through time.\n- \u00b7 Reverse stress testing: The purpose is to identify scenarios that could lead to a pre-defined outcome. This could, for example, be a CET1 ratio or MREL to define the point at which the bank is considered not viable anymore. The added value of reverse stress testing is to explore risk drivers and stress scenarios outside the existing range.\n\nThe outcomes of solvency stress test analyses are taken into account in capital planning, but also for setting risk appetite statements and the capital management buffer.\n\n## Planning and forecasting\n\nThe capital and funding plan is an integral part of the dynamic plan, ING's financial and business planning process. Its objective is to inform and advise the management on the capital development and need of ING Group and ING Bank, under base case and adverse scenarios. It describes how ING shall finance the expected capital constraints taking into consideration growth projections, capital and risk evolution, macro and market conditions, both under the normative and economic perspective. The capital and funding plan is discussed and approved by ALCO Bank and updated at least twice a year. Within these updates, ING takes account of recent market and risk developments, and aims to ensure that capital planning adheres to the solvency risk appetite set by the SB.\n\n## Capital management\n\nFormulation of the CET1 target is a key element in solvency risk management. The target ratio, based on the management buffer concept, enables ING's senior management to steer, benchmark and assess the bank's current and future capital levels much more efficiently. The target level clearly supports trustbuilding among ING's key stakeholders (e.g. regulators, investors, and customers).\n\nThe capital management buffer aims to protect the interests of key stakeholders and plays an important role in the overall capital adequacy governance. The rationale behind the buffer is that it provides an additional cushion on top of the (local) regulatory minimum requirements (e.g. supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) requirements) to withstand a certain level of stress and facilitate awareness and preparedness to take management actions. ING reviews its capital management buffer on a regular basis to determine its effectiveness and robustness, updating it as appropriate. See also Note 47 'Capital management'.",

As part of this, ING set up ongoing monitoring of relevant indicators with the aim of awareness and preparedness to act proactively to ensure continuity. The intervention measures, which can be activated when deemed necessary, consist of predefined RWA reduction measures, as well as direct capital-increasing measures. The escalation mechanisms are defined, governed and detailed in the contingency and recovery plans.\n\nBoth plans aim to restore ING's capital adequacy. Depending on the severity of the situation, the contingency plan can be activated at this warning phase, as well as triggering further mitigating action and formation of the contingency crisis teams. Further drops in capital levels trigger the alert phase for recovery monitoring and/or the activation of the recovery plan and corresponding crisis teams.\n\n## Assessing capital adequacy: Capital Adequacy Statement (CAS)\n\nThe CAS is ING Group's quarterly assessment of its capital adequacy and takes into account different elements with respect to its capital position. The degree to which ING's capital position is considered adequate depends on a variety of internal and external drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 Current supervisory requirements and (expected) requirements going forward;\n- \u00b7 Coherence of the available capital with the (realisation of) strategic plans;\n- \u00b7 Current internal requirements and (expected) requirements going forward (economic capital/view);\n- \u00b7 The ability to meet internal and external requirements in the case of stressed events or should a risk materialise.\n\nThe CAS assesses the adequacy of ING's capital position in relation to the above-mentioned drivers and states the extent to which the capital position consequently is considered as adequate. On a quarterly basis, the CAS document is prepared. Additionally each year, the EB/MBB signs and provides a comprehensive assessment of ING's capital adequacy, supported by the ICAAP outcomes, in the form of a capital adequacy statement.\n\n## Capital developments\n\nING's profit-generating capacity was strong in 2023, despite a challenging geopolitical environment. After dividend reserving in line with the distribution policy, we included \u20ac3.5 billion of profit to our capital base.\n\nING Group's capital ratios increased compared to 2022, primarily due to higher net profit after dividend reserving, coupled with lower risk-weighted assets. ING announced the distribution of an additional \u20ac 1.5 billion and \u20ac2.5 billion as next steps to converge the CET1 ratio towards ING's target of around 12.5% by 2025. In line with regulations, these additional distributions were fully reflected in ING's capital ratios at year-end. Risk-weighted assets were mainly impacted by volume reduction in Russia-related exposure, currency movements, improvement in book quality and model impacts. ING continues to maintain a strong and high-quality capital level.\n\nAt the end of December 2023, ING Group had a CET1 ratio of 14.7% versus an overall SREP requirement (including buffer requirements) of 10.98%. The Group's Tier 1 ratio increased to 16.9%. The total capital ratio increased from 19.4% to 19.8% compared to last year.\n\nThe leverage ratio was at 5.0% at the end of 2023, down from 5.1% at the end of 2022.\n\n## MREL and TLAC requirements\n\nThe minimum requirement for own fund and eligible liabilities (MREL) and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) apply to ING Group at the consolidate level of the resolution group. TLAC and MREL provide additional capacity to absorb losses and facilitate recapitalisation in the case of resolution. ING Group has a single point of entry resolution strategy.\n\nIntermediary MREL requirements were 27.79% on RWA and 5.97% on leverage exposure as of December 2023. ING meets these MREL requirements with an MREL ratio of 32.5% on RWA and 9.6% on leverage exposure at the end of December 2023.\n\nAs of  December 2023, TLAC requirements are 23.5% of RWA and 6.75% of leverage exposure. The available TLAC capacity consists of own funds and senior debt instruments issued by ING Group. With a TLAC ratio of 32.5% on RWA and 9.6% on leverage exposure, ING comfortably meets the TLAC requirements.",

Credit risks arise in ING's lending, financial markets and investment activities. The credit risk section provides information on how ING measures, monitors and manages credit risk and gives an insight into the portfolio from a credit risk perspective.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nING's credit risk strategy is to maintain an internationally diversified loan and bond portfolio, while avoiding large risk concentrations. The emphasis is on managing business developments within the defined credit and concentration risk appetite. The aim is to support relationship banking activities, while maintaining internal risk/reward guidelines and controls.\n\nThe Credit Risk department is responsible for setting the credit risk strategy for ING and aims to ensure credit risk and credit restructuring are managed from an overarching point of view rather than per business line. Furthermore, the Credit Risk Control Unit is responsible for the oversight and control of rating systems.\n\nWhile the Credit Risk department has oversight of the Group credit risk strategy and risk appetite across Retail Banking risk and Wholesale Banking risk, the head of Retail/Rest of World (RoW) Risk and head of Wholesale Banking Risk aim to ensure the management of the risk within these business lines. Also refer to the Risk governance and organisational structure in the introductory section of 'Risk management'.\n\nThe Credit Risk function encompasses the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Providing consistent credit risk policies, systems and tools to manage the credit lifecycle of all activities;\n- \u00b7 Measuring, monitoring and managing credit risks in the bank's portfolio, including evaluation of scenario and stress test results;\n- \u00b7 Challenging and approving new and modified transactions and borrower reviews, including involvement in the process of assigning risk ratings to indicate a clients's creditworthiness;\n- \u00b7 Managing the levels of provisioning and risk costs, and advising on impairments.\n\n## Credit risk categories (*)\n\nIn the following table the different types of credit risk categories are described and a reconciliation with the notes in the financial statements is also included:\n\n| Credit risk categories

It is derived from the concepts of boundaries and instruments as described in the ING Risk Appetite Framework (RAF).\n\nCredit risk appetite is the maximum level of credit risk ING is willing to accept for growth and value creation. The credit risk appetite is linked to the overall bank-wide RAF. The credit risk appetite is expressed in quantitative and qualitative measures. Having a credit risk appetite provides:\n\n- \u00b7 Clarity about the credit risks that ING is prepared to assume, target setting and prudent risk management. Credit risk appetite is used as an input for Lending guidances which are made by sector and/or location;\n- \u00b7 Consistent communication to different stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Alignment of business strategies and key performance indicators of business units with ING's credit risk appetite through dynamic planning.\n- \u00b7 Guidelines on how to align reporting and monitoring tools with the organisational structure and strategy;\n\nThe credit risk appetite is set at different levels and dimensions within ING. The credit risk appetite framework specifies the scope and focus of the credit risk which ING takes and the composition of the credit portfolio, including its concentration and diversification objectives in relation to business lines, locations, sectors and products. The credit risk appetite framework has also been extended to embed climate risk elements. The first steps towards introducing climate risk elements in the credit risk appetite framework were taken in 2022 and these have further evolved and matured in 2023. The climate risk elements within the credit risk appetite framework allow for more efficient steering of sector concentrations from a climate risk perspective.\n\nThe credit concentration risk framework is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 Country risk concentration: Country risk is the risk that arises due to events in a specific country (or group of countries). To manage the maximum country loss ING is willing to accept, boundaries are approved by the SB. The estimated level is correlated to the risk rating assigned to a given country. Actual country limits are set by means of country instruments, which are monitored monthly and updated, when needed. For countries with elevated levels of geopolitical or severe economic cycle risk, monitoring is performed on a more frequent basis with strict pipeline and exposure management.\n- \u00b7 Single name and secondary risk concentration: ING has an established credit concentration risk framework to identify, measure and monitor single name concentration including secondary risk. The same concept of boundaries and instruments is applicable.\n- \u00b7 Sector and product concentration risk are managed via the credit risk appetite framework.\n\n## Credit risk models (*)\n\nWithin ING, internal CRR-compliant models are used to determine probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD) for regulatory and economic capital purposes. These models also form the basis of ING's IFRS 9 loan loss provisioning (see 'IFRS 9 models' below). Bank-wide, ING has implemented approximately 100 credit risk models, for regulatory capital, economic capital and loan loss provisioning purposes.\n\nThere are two main types of PD, EAD and LGD models used throughout the bank:\n\n- \u00b7 Statistical models are created where a large set of default or detailed loss data is available. They are characterised by sufficient data points to facilitate meaningful statistical estimation of the model parameters. The model parameters are estimated with statistical techniques based on the data set available.\n- \u00b7 Hybrid models are statistical models supplemented with knowledge and experience of experts from risk management and front-office staff, literature from rating agencies, supervisors and academics. These models are only used for 'low default portfolios', where limited historical defaults exist.\n\n## Credit risk rating process (*)\n\nThe majority of risk ratings are based on a risk rating (PD) model that complies with the minimum requirements detailed in CRR/CRDIV, ECB Supervisory Rules and European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines. This concerns all borrower types and segments.\n\nING's PD rating models are based on a 1-22 internal risk rating scale (1 = highest rating; 22 = lowest rating) referred to as the 'master scale', which roughly corresponds to the rating grades that are assigned by external rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. For example, an ING rating of 1 corresponds to an S&P/Fitch rating of AAA and a Moody's rating of Aaa; an ING rating of 2 corresponds to an S&P/Fitch rating of AA+ and a Moody's rating of Aa1, and so on.\n\nThe 22 internal risk rating grades are composed of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Investment grade (risk rating 1-10);\n- \u00b7 Performing Restructuring (risk rating 18-19);\n- \u00b7 Non-investment grade (risk rating 11-17);\n- \u00b7 Non-performing (risk rating 20-22).\n\nThe first three categories (1-19) are risk ratings for performing loans. Ratings are calculated in IT systems with internally developed models, based on manually or automatically fed data, or for part of the nonperforming loans set by the global or regional credit restructuring department. Under certain conditions, the outcome of a manually fed model can be challenged through a rating appeal process. For securitisation portfolios, the external ratings of the tranche in which ING has invested are leading indicators.",

Some of these models are global in nature, such as those for large corporates, commercial banks, insurance companies, central governments, funds, fund managers, project finance and leveraged companies. Other models are more regional or country-specific: there are PD models for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland as well as residential mortgage and consumer loan models in the various retail markets.\n\nRating models for Retail clients are predominantly statistically driven and automated, such that ratings can be updated on a monthly basis. Rating models for large corporates, institutions and banks include both statistical characteristics and manual input, with the ratings being manually updated at least annually. More frequent reviews (e.g. quarterly) are performed where considered necessary, for example portfolios and clients most at risk of being impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and expected spillover effects.\n\nIn line with evolving regulatory expectations on models and emerging industry practices ING has embarked a multi-year redevelopment process of its credit risk models. This is also in line with ING's model governance to ensure continuous improvement of models.\n\n## Credit risk systems\n\n## Credit risk tools and data standards\n\nThe acceptance, maintenance, measurement, management and reporting of credit risks at all levels of ING are executed through single, common credit risk data standards using shared credit risk tools that support standardised and transparent credit risk practices. ING has chosen to develop credit risk tools centrally with the philosophy of using a single source of data in an integrated way. This includes applying a combination of the ING policy, the regulatory environment in which we operate and the daily processes that are active throughout the Group. Disciplined application in these three areas is essential for achieving high data quality standards.\n\nThe credit risk control unit (CRCU), which is part of the Credit Risk department, manages the CRCU control framework offering quality assurance on the regulatory areas of responsibility: the oversight and control of rating systems. This framework leans on control execution in other teams such as model development in Integrated Risk where the combination of these different teams is considered for the CRCU self-assessment.\n\n## Credit risk portfolio (*)\n\nING's credit exposure is mainly related to lending to individuals (also referred to as consumer lending, all Retail) and businesses (referred to as business lending, both in Retail and Wholesale) followed by investments in bonds and securitised assets, and money market (Wholesale). Loans to individuals are mainly mortgage loans secured by residential property. Loans (including guarantees issued) to businesses are often collateralised, but may be unsecured based on the internal analysis of the borrower's creditworthiness. Bonds in the investment portfolio are generally unsecured, but predominantly consist of bonds issued by central governments and EU and/or OECD-based financial institutions. Secured bonds, such as mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities are secured by the underlying diversified pool of assets (commercial or residential mortgages, car loans and/or other assets) held by the securities issuer. For money market, exposure is mainly deposits to central banks. The last major credit risk source involves presettlement exposures which arise from trading activities, including derivatives, repurchase transactions and securities lending/borrowing transactions. This is also commonly referred to as counterparty credit risk.",

activities.\n- 2 Based on the total amount of credit risk in the respective column using ING's internal credit risk measurement methodologies. Economic sectors (industry) below 2% are not shown separately but grouped in Other.\n- 3 Geographical areas are based on country of residence, except for private individuals for which the geographical areas are based on the primary country of risk.\n\n## Overall portfolio (*)\n\nDuring 2023, ING's portfolio size decreased by \u20ac6.5 billion (-0.69%) to \u20ac931.6 billion outstanding. Foreign exchange rate changes had a negative impact on the portfolio growth, mainly in WB, decreasing total outstanding by \u20ac4.6 billion, driven by the depreciation of the US dollar (-3.8%) against the euro, Australian dollar (-3.4%) and Turkish lira (-42.1%), partly compensated by the Polish zloty (+6.8%).\n\n## Rating distribution (*)\n\nOverall, the rating class distribution remained stable in 2023. The share of investment grade rating classes increased from 76.2% to 76.8%, while the share of non-investment grade decreased from 21.7% to 21.2%. Performing restructuring outstandings decreased from 0.8% to 0.7% of the total portfolio, whereas nonperforming loans increased from 1.2% to 1.3%.

The share of nonperforming loans for WB remained stable at 1.0%.\n\nThe non-investment grade portfolio of Retail Benelux increased from 28.9% to 30.3% of the portfolio, which is explained primarily by rating migration in mortgages in Belgium. Performing restructuring remained flat at 0.9% whereas NPL improved to 1.8% (from 1.9%) in 2023.\n\nIn Retail Challengers & Growth Markets, the distribution across rating classes remained stable in 2023.

|\n\n1 Geographical areas are based on country of residence, except for private individuals for which the geographical areas are based on the primary country of risk.\n\n## Portfolio analysis per geographical area (*)\n\nThe portfolio analysis per geographical area re-emphasises the international distribution of ING's credit portfolio. The share of the Netherlands in the overall portfolio (ex-Central Banks) reduced to 21.8% (2022: 22.0%).\n\nThe most noticeable trend in the Netherlands was the decrease in exposure with central banks (-\u20ac4.2 billion). Outstandings to private individuals are at 63.9% (2022: 62.5%) of total outstandings (excl. Central Banks). In Belgium, no substantial changes were observed in the portfolio.\n\nIn terms of rating distribution in individual countries, the total share of investment grade/non-investment grade remains substantial for the Netherlands at 98.6% (2022: 98.5%) and in Belgium 96.6% (2022: 96.3%).\n\nPerforming restructuring grade assets remained flat in the Netherlands at 0.7%, whereas Belgium decreased from 0.8% to 0.7%. The NPL share decreased in 2023, from 0.8% to 0.7% in the Netherlands, and from 2.8% to 2.7% in Belgium.\n\nIn Challengers & Growth Markets, ING has a sizeable residential mortgages portfolio in Germany, Australia, Spain and Poland.\n\nThe top five countries within Rest of Europe based on outstandings were: Italy (\u20ac18.7 billion), Romania (\u20ac11.5 billion), Switzerland (\u20ac11.2 billion), T\u00fcrkiye (\u20ac7.2 billion) and Ireland (\u20ac4.7 billion).",

The most noticeable changes in rating distribution were observed in Rest of Europe, where the development of the Russian portfolio caused a decrease into Performing Restructuring from 3.0% to 2.3%. Note the paragraph on Russian exposures in section 'Risk management at ING Group'. Apart from Russia, noticeable changes occurred in the UK, where NPL decreased from 1.2% to 0.6%.\n\nIn terms of rating distribution for the Americas region, an increase in NPL is observed to 1.5% (from 0.8%), whereas in Asia, NPL decreased from 2.7% to 2.0%. In Africa, NPL increased from 3.0% to 13.0%, driven by one well-covered file.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation (*)\n\nING uses various techniques and instruments to mitigate the credit risk associated with an exposure and to reduce the losses incurred subsequent to a default by a customer. The most common terminology used in ING for credit risk protection is 'cover'. While a cover may be an important mitigant of credit risk and an alternative source of repayment, generally it is ING's practice to lend on the basis of the customer's creditworthiness rather than exclusively relying on the value of the cover.\n\n## Cover forms (*)\n\nWithin ING, there are two distinct forms of covers. First, where the asset has been pledged to ING as collateral or security, ING has the right to liquidate it should the customer be unable to fulfil its financial obligation. As such, the proceeds can be applied towards full or partial compensation of the customer's outstanding exposure. This may be tangible (such as cash, securities, receivables, inventory, plant and machinery, and mortgages on real estate properties) or intangible (such as patents, trademarks, contract rights and licences). Second, where there is a third-party obligation, indemnification or undertaking (either by contract and/or by law), ING has the right to claim from that third party an amount if the customer fails on its obligations. The most common examples are guarantees, such as parent guarantees, export credit insurances or third-party pledged mortgages. Insurance or reinsurance covers, including comprehensive private risk insurance (CPRI) may be recognised as guarantees and effectively function in an equivalent manner. ING accepts credit risk insurance companies and export credit agencies (ECAs) as cover providers.\n\n## Cover valuation methodology (*)\n\nGeneral guidelines for cover valuation are established with the objective of ensuring consistent application within ING. These also require that the value of the cover is monitored on a regular basis. Covers are\n\nrevalued periodically and whenever there is reason to believe that the market is subject to significant changes in conditions. The frequency of monitoring and revaluation depends on the type of cover.\n\nThe valuation method also depends on the type of covers. For asset collateral, the valuation sources can be the customer's balance sheet (e.g. inventory, machinery and equipment), nominal value (e.g. cash and receivables), market value (e.g. securities and commodities), independent valuations (e.g. commercial real estate) and market indices (e.g. residential real estate). For third-party obligations, the valuation is based on the value that is attributed to the contract between ING and that third party.\n\nWhere collateral values are used in the calculation of stage 3 individual loan loss provisions, haircuts may be applied to the valuation in specific circumstances, to sufficiently include all relevant factors impacting future cash flows. ING applies haircuts to the collateral values of real estate, shipping and aviation assets that are used in the calculation of the loss-given-default in recovery scenarios. The haircut reflects the risks of adverse price developments between the moment of valuation of an asset and the actual settlement/cash receipt.\n\n## Cover values (*)\n\nThis section provides insight into the types of cover and the extent to which exposures benefit from collateral or guarantees. The disclosure differentiates between risk categories (lending, investment, money market and pre-settlement). The most relevant types of cover include mortgages, financial collateral (cash and securities) and guarantees. ING obtains cover that is eligible for credit risk mitigation under CRR/CRDIV, as well as cover that is not eligible. Collateral covering financial market transactions is valued on a daily basis, and as such not included in the following tables. To mitigate the credit risk arising from financial markets transactions, the bank enters into legal agreements governing the exchange of financial collateral (high-quality government bonds and cash).\n\nThe cover values are presented for the total portfolio of ING, both the performing and non-performing portfolio. Our definition of non-performing is explained in detail in 'Credit restructuring' (below).\n\nThe next table gives an overview of the collateralisation of the ING's total portfolio.",

Since investments traditionally do not require covers, the percentage for 'no covers' in this portfolio is above 95%. However, 99% of the investment outstanding is investment grade. Improved economic conditions in ING's main markets contributed to improved collateral valuations, observed in consumer lending.\n\n## Consumer lending portfolio (*)\n\nThe consumer lending portfolio accounts for 38.7% (2022: 37.7%) of ING's total outstanding, primarily consisting of residential mortgage loans and other consumer lending loans. As a result, most collateral consists of mortgages. Mortgage values are collected in an internal central database and in most cases external data is used to index the market value. A significant part of ING's residential mortgage portfolio is in the Netherlands (34.8%), Germany (28.0%), Belgium including Luxembourg (13.3%) and Australia (10.9%).\n\nNote that the large increase in Financial Collateral and decrease in Other covers is related to a reclassification of certain cover types.\n\n## Business lending portfolio (*)\n\nBusiness lending accounts for 39.1% (2022: 40.4%) of ING's total outstanding. Business lending presented in this section does not include pre-settlement, investment and money market exposures.",

This methodology is applicable to private individuals, as well as business lending. An obligation is considered 'past due' if a payment of interest or principal is more than one day late. ING aims to help its customers as soon as they are past due by reminding them of their payment obligations. In its contact with the customers, ING aims to solve the (potential) financial difficulties by offering a range of measures (e.g. payment arrangements, restructuring). If the issues cannot be cured, for example because the customer is unable or unwilling to pay, the contract is sent to the recovery unit. The facility is downgraded to risk rating 20 (non-performing) when the facility or obligor - depending on the level at which the non-performing status is applied - is more than 90 days past due and to risk rating 21 or 22 in case of an exit scenario.\n\nING has aligned the regulatory concept of non-performing with that of the definition of default. Hence, in WB, obligors are classified as non-performing when a default trigger occurs:\n\n- \u00b7 ING believes the borrower is unlikely to pay. The borrower has evidenced significant financial difficulty, to the extent that it will have a negative impact on the future cash flows of the financial asset. The following events could be seen as indicators of financial difficulty:\n- \u00b7 The borrower (or third party) has started insolvency proceedings;\n- \u00b7 Indication of fraud (affecting the company's ability to service its debt);\n- \u00b7 A group company/co-borrower has NPL status;\n- \u00b7 There is doubt as to the borrower's ability to generate stable and sufficient cash flows to service its debt;\n- \u00b7 Restructuring of debt.\n- \u00b7 ING has granted concessions relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, the effect of which is a reduction in expected future cash flows of the financial asset below current carrying amount.\n- \u00b7 The obligor has failed in the payment of principal, interest or fees, the total past due amount is above the materiality threshold and this remains the case for more than 90 consecutive days.\n\nFurther, WB has an individual name approach, using early warning indicators to signal possible future issues in debt service.",

The largest increase was observed in the Netherlands (+\u20ac47 million) and Germany (+\u20ac31 million) mainly in the 1-30-day bucket; the largest decrease was seen in Belgium (-\u20ac44 million) driven by the decrease in the 1-30 bucket.\n\n|                    | in \u20ac million                  | in \u20ac million                                    | in \u20ac million

GCR handles accounts or portfolios requiring an active approach, which may include renegotiation of terms and conditions and business or financial restructuring. The loans are managed by GCR or by units in the various regions and business units. ING uses three distinct statuses to categorise the management of clients with (perceived) deteriorating credit risk profiles, i.e. there is increasing doubt as to the performance and the collectability of the client's contractual obligations:\n\n- \u00b7 Watch list: Usually, a client is first classified as watch list when there are concerns of any potential or material deterioration in credit risk profile that may affect the ability of the client to adhere to its debt service obligations or to refinance its existing loans. Watch list status requires more than usual attention, increased monitoring and quarterly reviews. Some clients with a watch list status may develop into a restructuring status or even a recovery status.\n- \u00b7 Restructuring: A client is classified as restructuring when there are concerns about the client's financial stability, credit worthiness, and/or ability to repay, but where the situation does not require the termination or acceleration of facilities or the liquidation of collateral. ING's actions aim to maintain the going concern status of the client by:\n- \u00b7 restoring the client's financial stability;\n- \u00b7 restoring the balance between debt and equity; and\n- \u00b7 supporting the client's turnaround;\n- \u00b7 restructuring the debt to a sustainable situation.\n- \u00b7 Recovery: A client is classified as in recovery when ING and/or the client concludes that the client's financial situation cannot be restored and a decision is made to terminate the (credit) relationship or even to enter into bankruptcy. ING prefers an amicable exit, but will enforce and liquidate the collateral or claim under the guarantees if deemed necessary.\n\nWatch list, restructuring and recovery accounts are reviewed at least quarterly by the front office, GCR and the relevant credit risk management executives.\n\n## Forbearance (*)\n\nForbearance occurs when a client is unable to meet their financial commitments due to financial difficulties they face or are about to face and ING grants concessions towards them. Forborne assets are assets in respect of which forbearance measures have been granted.\n\nForbearance may enable clients experiencing financial difficulties to continue repaying their debt.\n\nFor business clients, ING mainly applies forbearance measures to support clients with fundamentally sound business models that are experiencing temporary difficulties with the aim of maximising the client's repayment ability and therewith avoiding a default situation or helping the client to return to a performing situation.\n\nFor ING retail units, clear criteria have been established to determine whether a client is eligible for the forbearance process. Specific approval mandates are in place to approve the measures, as well as procedures to manage, monitor and report the forbearance activities.\n\nING reviews the performance of forborne exposures at least quarterly, either on a case-by-case (business) or on a portfolio (retail) basis.\n\nAll exposures are eligible for forbearance measures, i.e. both performing (risk ratings 1-19) and nonperforming (risk ratings 20-22) exposures. ING uses specific criteria to move forborne exposures from nonperforming to performing or to remove the forbearance statuses that are consistent with the corresponding European Banking Authority (EBA) standards. An exposure is reported as forborne for a minimum of two years. An additional one-year probation period is applied to forborne exposures that move from nonperforming back to performing.\n\n## Summary Forborne portfolio (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million       | 2023         | 2023                  | 2023                       | 2023                   | 2022         | 2022                  | 2022                       | 2022                  |\n|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Business line      | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which:  non- performing | % of  total  portfolio | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which:  non- performing | % of total  portfolio |\n| Wholesale  Banking | 6,063        | 3,919                 | 2,144                      | 1.8  %                 | 8,359        | 5,880                 | 2,478                      | 2.7  %                |\n| Retail Banking     | 7,026        | 4,128                 | 2,898                      | 1.4  %                 | 8,080        | 4,973                 | 3,107                      | 1.6  %                |\n| Total              | 13,089       | 8,047                 | 5,042                      | 1.5 %                  | 16,438       | 10,853                | 5,585                      | 2.0 %                 |",

Decrease is mainly visible in the performing forborne assets (-\u20ac2.0 billion), mainly in the industries Transportation & Logistics, Real Estate and Services. The decrease was partial offset by an increase for Chemicals, Health and Pharmaceuticals, driven by a few large individual clients.\n\nWB's forborne assets are mainly concentrated in Real Estate, Food Beverages & Personal Care, Natural Resources, Chemicals, Health & Pharmaceuticals, and Utilities. These five economic sectors accounted for 67% of the total WB forborne outstandings.\n\n## Retail Banking (*)\n\nAs of the end of December 2023, Retail Banking forborne assets totalled \u20ac7.0 billion, which represented 1.4% of the total Retail Banking portfolio. The majority of forborne exposures were in private individuals with 50.5%.\n\n## Retail Banking: Forborne portfolio by geographical area (*)\n\n| in \u20ac million   |                | 2023         | 2023                  | 2023                      | 2022         | 2022                  | 2022                      |\n|----------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Region         |                | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which: non- performing | Outstandings | Of which:  performing | Of which: non- performing |\n|                | Netherlands    | 1,483        | 981                   | 502                       | 2,832        | 2,043                 | 789                       |\n|                | Belgium        | 2,153        | 838                   | 1,315                     | 2,644        | 1,331                 | 1,314                     |\n|                | Germany        | 1,309        | 1,064                 | 246                       | 804          | 610                   | 194                       |\n|                | Poland         | 852          | 522                   | 330                       | 588          | 309                   | 279                       |\n| Europe         | T\u00fcrkiye        | 25           | 15                    | 10                        | 64           | 31                    | 32                        |\n|                | Italy          | 123          | 51                    | 71                        | 131          | 52                    | 79                        |\n|                | Romania        | 135          | 49                    | 86                        | 124          | 53                    | 71                        |\n|                | Spain          | 138          | 118                   | 21                        | 35           | 15                    | 20                        |\n|                | Rest of Europe | 88           | 58                    | 30                        | 73           | 48                    | 25                        |\n| America        |                | 21           | 20                    |                           | 13           | 12                    |                           |\n| Asia           |                | 2            | 1                     | 1                         | 3            | 1                     | 1                         |\n| Australia      |                | 697          | 411                   | 286                       | 768          | 467                   | 302                       |\n| Africa         |                |              |                       |                           |              | 1                     |                           |\n| Total          |                | 7,026        | 4,128                 | 2,898                     | 8,080        | 4,973                 | 3,107                     |\n\nThe main concentration of forborne assets in a single country was in Belgium with 30.6% (2022: 32.7%) of total Retail Banking forborne assets and 45.4% (2022: 42.3%) of the non-performing forborne assets. Next to that, Netherlands had 21.1% (2022: 35.0%) of the total Retail forborne assets and Germany 18.6% (2022:10.0%). The increase in Germany is driven by mortgages, where clients that choose for a repayment percentage below a certain threshold, though contractually allowed, are conservatively considered forborn.\n\n## Non-performing loans (*)\n\nING's loan portfolio is under constant review. Loans to obligors that are considered more than 90 days past due and above applicable thresholds are reclassified as non-performing. For business lending portfolios, there generally are reasons for declaring a loan non-performing prior to the obligor being 90 days past due. These reasons include, but are not limited to, ING's assessment of the customer's perceived inability to meet its financial obligations, or the customer filing for bankruptcy or bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe table below represents the breakdown by industry of credit risk outstandings that have been classified as non-performing.\n\n## Non-performing Loans: outstandings by economic sector and business lines (*) 1\n\n| in \u20ac million                        | Wholesale Banking   | Wholesale Banking   | Retail Benelux   | Retail Benelux   | Retail Challengers &  Growth Markets   | Retail Challengers &  Growth Markets   |        | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Industry                            | 2023                | 2022                | 2023             | 2022             | 2023                                   | 2022                                   | 2023   | 2022    |\n| Private Individuals                 | 4                   |                     | 2,210            | 2,174            | 2,206                                  | 1,954                                  | 4,419  | 4,129   |\n| Natural Resources                   | 669                 | 1,369               | 60               | 34               | 25                                     | 17                                     | 754    | 1,421   |\n| Food, Beverages & Personal  Care    | 565                 | 672                 | 363              | 438              | 157                                    | 122                                    | 1,085  | 1,233   |\n| Transportation & Logistics          | 437                 | 367                 | 69               | 165              | 65                                     | 51                                     | 572    | 583     |\n| Services                            | 101                 | 119                 | 415              | 448              | 66                                     | 61                                     | 582    | 628     |\n| Real Estate                         | 592                 | 172                 | 398              | 486              | 64                                     | 54                                     | 1,053  | 712     |\n| General Industries                  | 111                 | 114                 | 270              | 268              | 115                                    | 100                                    | 497    | 482     |\n| Builders & Contractors              | 124                 | 139                 | 291              | 244              | 162                                    | 110                                    | 577    | 493     |\n| Retail                              | 207                 | 98                  | 121              | 107              | 67                                     | 39                                     | 395    | 244     |\n| Utilities                           | 331                 | 387                 | 12               | 7                | 6                                      | 7                                      | 348    | 401     |\n| Chemicals, Health & Pharmaceuticals | 101                 | 175                 | 97               | 115              | 35                                     | 20                                     | 233    | 310     |\n| Telecom                             | 378                 | 288                 | 9                | 12               | 3                                      | 3                                      | 390    | 303     |\n| Other                               | 412                 | 440                 | 270              | 260              | 66                                     | 52                                     | 748    | 753     |\n| Total                               | 4,034               | 4,340               | 4,583            | 4,759            | 3,036                                  | 2,592                                  | 11,653 | 11,691  |\n\n1 Based on lending and investment outstandings.",

        "page_content": "Contents Introduction Strategy and performance ESG overview Our leadership and corporate governance\n\n- > Credit risk\n\nIn 2023, the NPL portfolio stayed relatively flat at \u20ac11.7 billion. An increase in Challengers & Growth retail (+ \u20ac0.4 billion) was offset by decreases in Wholesale Banking (-\u20ac0.3 billion) and Retail Benelux (-\u20ac0.2 billion). The increase in Challengers & Growth Markets was mainly witnessed in private individuals. In Wholesale Banking, the decrease in the Natural Resources sector was partially compensated by an increase in Real Estate sector, especially in the Americas. The top three countries by NPL outstanding are Belgium, the Netherlands and the Americas.\n\n## Loan loss provisioning (*)\n\nING recognises loss allowances based on the expected credit loss (ECL) model of IFRS 9, which is designed to be forward-looking. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to on-balance sheet financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), such as loans, debt securities and lease receivables, as well as off-balance-sheet items such as undrawn loan commitments, financial- and non-financial guarantees issued.\n\nING distinguishes between two types of calculation methods for credit loss allowances:\n\n- \u00b7 Collective 12-month ECL (Stage 1) and collective lifetime ECL (Stage 2) for portfolios of financial instruments, as well as collective lifetime ECL for credit-impaired exposures (Stage 3) below \u20ac1 million;\n- \u00b7 Individual lifetime ECL for credit-impaired (Stage 3) financial instruments with exposures above \u20ac1 million.\n\n## IFRS 9 models (*)\n\nING's IFRS 9 models leverage on the internal rating-based (IRB) models (PD, LGD, EAD), which include certain required conservatism. To include IFRS 9 requirements, such regulatory conservatism is removed from the ECL parameters (PD, LGD and EAD). The IFRS 9 models apply two other types of adjustments to the IRB ECL parameters: (i) to the economic outlook and (ii) for Stage 2 and Stage 3 assets only, to the lifetime horizon. The IFRS 9 model parameters are estimated based on statistical techniques and supported by expert judgement.\n\nING has aligned the definition of default for regulatory purposes with the definition of 'credit-impaired' financial assets under IFRS 9 (Stage 3). ING has also aligned its definition of default between IFRS9 and the regulatory technical standards (RTS) and EBA guidelines. More information can be found in section 1.5.6 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Climate and environmental risks in IFRS 9 models (*)\n\nClimate risk drivers (physical and transition risks) can reduce the ability of businesses and households to fulfil their obligations due on existing lending contracts. These may also lead to depreciation/ erosion of collateral values which would translate into higher credit losses and loan-to-value ratios in the lending portfolio of ING.\n\nAt this point in time it is not yet possible to incorporate climate risk separately into IFRS 9 ECL models given the lack of sufficient empirical historical data and data limitations in the risk assessments on client level.\n\nWhere climate and environmental factors have impacted the economy in the recent past or present, these impacts will currently be implicitly embedded in ING's IFRS9 ECL models through the projected macroeconomic indicators (e.g. indirectly via GDP growth and unemployment rates). We note however that our ECL models are primarily sensitive to the short-term economic outlook as we use a three-year time horizon for macroeconomic outlook, after which a mean reversion approach is applied.\n\nWith regard to our evaluation of climate-related matters, where such events have already occurred (e.g. floods, stranded assets etc.), the impact of such events is individually assessed in the calculation of Stage 3 Individual provisions or management adjustments to ECL models. For example, we consider whether affected assets have suffered from a significant increase in credit risk (or are credit impaired) and whether the ECL is appropriate.\n\nOver the near-term time horizon, ING plans to continue to refine its methodologies to evaluate climate risks. ING is working on putting into practice quantitative methodologies for climate and environmental (C&E) risk identification, materiality assessment and risk appetite setting. Refer to ESG risk paragraph for further details on ESG risk management. Going forward, ING aims to continue to close the gaps on climate risk data, which will enable us to embed climate risks eventually into the IFRS 9 ECL models.",

No expected credit loss is calculated for cash, ondemand bank positions, reverse repurchase transactions, cash collateral received in respect of derivatives and other. Therefore these amounts are not included in the total gross carrying amount (IFRS 9 eligible). Other includes value adjustments on hedged items, deferred acquisition costs on residential mortgages and a receivable which is offset against a liquidity facility.\n\nING Group changed its accounting policy for non-financial guarantees that are subject to contractual indemnification rights (such as performance and other non-financial guarantees as well as letters of credit) from IAS 37 principles to loan commitment accounting under IFRS 9. The re-scoping was triggered by the introduction of IFRS 17 insurance contracts and results in reliable and more relevant information. The offbalance-sheet IFRS 9 eligible guarantees and irrevocable facilities of 31 December 2022 have not been restated to conform to current year presentation.\n\n## Portfolio quality (*)\n\nThe table below describes the portfolio composition over the different IFRS 9 stages and rating classes. The Stage 1 portfolio represents 91.5% (2022: 91.5%) of the total gross carrying amounts, mainly composed of investment grade, while Stage 2 makes up 7.4% (2022: 7.3%) and Stage 3 makes up 1.2% (2022: 1.2%) of the total gross carrying amounts, respectively.",

The transfers of financial instruments represent the impact of stage transfers upon the gross carrying/nominal amount and associated allowance for ECL. This includes the net-remeasurement of ECL arising from stage transfers, for example, moving from a 12-month (Stage 1) to a lifetime (Stage 2) ECL measurement basis.\n\nThe net-remeasurement line represents the changes in provisions for facilities that remain in the same stage.\n\nPlease note the following comments with respect to the movements observed in the table below:\n\n- \u00b7 The opening balance is impacted by a change in accounting policy following the adoption of IFRS 17, more specifically for loans with death waivers that no longer meet the 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) criterion (\u20ac-55 million loan loss provisions impact) which are no longer recorded at amortised cost, and a change in policy for non-financial guarantees that are subject to contractual indemnification rights which led to a reclassification of the existing IAS 37 provision (\u20ac109 million loan loss provisions impact) and a remeasurement of these non-financial guarantees (\u20ac42 million loan loss provisions impact). Reference is made to Note 1 'Basis of preparation and significant changes in the current reporting period'.\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 gross carrying amount increased slightly to  \u20ac12.0 billion as at 31 December 2023, as new inflow into NPL (credit impaired) in 2023 was only partly offset by repayments, derecognitions and write-offs. Stage 3 provisions remained more or less flat at \u20ac3.9 billion.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 gross carrying amount increased by \u20ac0.1 billion from \u20ac75.4 billion (after changes in accounting policies) as at 31 December 2022 to \u20ac75.5 billion as at 31 December 2023. An increase of Stage 2 exposure, driven by the implementation of an updated methodology for interest-only mortgages in the Netherlands, was offset by outflow due to improved macro economic outlook, decrease of exposure due to sales and repayments (including Russian exposure), forborne customers returning to Stage 1 after the probation period has ended and other improved risk drivers. As a result, Stage 2 provisions also decreased by \u20ac0.3 billion to \u20ac1.4 billion as of 31 December 2023.",

We continue to follow this methodology in generating our probability-weighted ECL, with consideration of alternative scenarios and management adjustments supplementing this ECL where, in management's opinion, the consensus forecast does not fully capture the extent of recent credit or economic events. The macroeconomic scenarios are applicable to the whole ING portfolio in the scope of IFRS 9 ECLs.\n\nThe IFRS 9 standard, with its inherent complexities and potential impact on the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities, represents a key source of estimation uncertainty. In particular, ING's reportable ECL numbers are sensitive to the forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts used as model inputs, the probability-weights applied to each of the three scenarios, and the criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk. As such, these crucial components require consultation and management judgement, and are subject to extensive governance.\n\n## Baseline scenario (*)\n\nAs a baseline for IFRS 9, ING has adopted a market-neutral view combining consensus forecasts for economic variables (GDP, unemployment) with market forwards (for interest rates, exchange rates and oil prices). Input from a leading third-party service provider is used to complement the consensus with consistent projections for variables for which there are no consensus estimates available (most notably house prices and - for some countries - unemployment), to generate alternative scenarios, to convert annual consensus information to a quarterly frequency and to ensure general consistency of the scenarios. As the baseline scenario is consistent with the consensus view it can be considered as free from any bias.\n\nThe relevance and selection of macroeconomic variables is defined by the ECL models under credit risk model governance. The scenarios are reviewed and challenged by two panels of ING experts. The first panel consists of (economic) experts from Global Markets Research, risk and modelling, while the second panel consists of relevant senior managers in ING.\n\n## Alternative scenarios and probability weights (*)\n\nTwo alternative scenarios are taken into account: an upside and a downside scenario. The alternative scenarios have statistical characteristics as they are based on the forecast deviations of the leading thirdparty service provider.\n\nTo understand the baseline level of uncertainty around any forecast, the leading third-party service provider keeps track of all its deviations (so called forecast errors) of the past 20 years. The distribution of forecast errors for GDP, unemployment, house prices and share prices is applied to the baseline forecast creating a broad range of alternative outcomes. In addition, to understand the balance of risks facing the economy in an unbiased way, the leading third-party service provider runs a survey with respondents from around the world and across a broad range of industries. In this survey respondents put forward their views of key risks. Following the survey results, the distribution of forecast errors (that is being used for determining the scenarios) may be skewed.\n\nFor the downside scenario, ING has chosen for the 90th percentile of that distribution because this corresponds with the way risk management earnings-at-risk is defined within the Group. The upside scenario is represented by the 10th percentile of the distribution. The applicable percentiles of the distribution imply a 20 percent probability for each alternative scenario. Consequently, the baseline scenario has a 60 percent probability weighting. Please note that, given their technical nature, the downside and upside scenarios are not based on an explicit specific narrative.",

Inflation has been coming down as energy prices have moderated, demand has weakened and pandemic-related supply problems have eased. Higher interest rates play their part in slowing demand. Although central banks could well be done with hiking interest rates - as inflation continues to fall - the lagged impact of past monetary tightening is still feeding through to the real economy. This is expected to cause GDP growth to come in even weaker in 2024, but pickup thereafter as the negative effects from tight monetary policy and high inflation fade. The high-interest rate environment is currently causing corrections in house prices, especially in markets where prices surged during the pandemic. Housing market corrections are assumed to gradually decrease in strength.\n\nThe December 2023 consensus expects global output (as measured by the weighted average GDP growth rate of ING's 25 main markets) to slow from 2.6 percent in 2022, to 2.4 percent in 2023 and 1.8 percent in 2024. For 2025-2026, economic growth is expected to pick up again to 2.3 percent and 2.4 percent.\n\nThe US economy outperformed expectations in 2023, driven by strong consumer spending and fiscal support. Still, headwinds have been building up, in part driven by the much higher interest rates currently experienced. While an outright recession is not expected, the consensus does foresee a marked slowdown in economic activity in the US in 2024. After this, the US economy is expected to gather strength again in 2025. The consensus expects the growth rate of the US economy to fall from 2.2 percent in 2023 to 0.9 percent in 2024 and to recover to 2 percent on average in 2025-2026.\n\nThe eurozone economy is facing broad stagnation as it deals with the impact of the war in Ukraine, energy crisis, and higher interest rates. While inflation is coming down, the impact of last year's purchasing power shock is still being felt. Monetary tightening works with a lag, which will still affect economic activity next year. Overall, the eurozone economy is forecasted to have grown by just 0.5 percent in 2023, but Germany has gone through recession reflecting its large (energy-intensive) manufacturing sector, and exposure to a disappointing Chinese economy. For next year, the recovery is expected to be very modest as consensus expects the eurozone to grow by only 0.8 percent in 2024, before recovering to 1.4 percent on average in 2025-2026.\n\nElsewhere in Europe, the outlook is mixed. In Poland, after an expected 0.4 percent growth in 2023, the economy is expected to recover by 2.5 percent in 2024 led by household consumption growth. Wage growth is set to remain strong while inflation has subsided substantially. The consensus expectation for T\u00fcrkiye is to see growth slow substantially in 2024 with unemployment remaining around 10 percent for the foreseeable future. The consensus sees economic growth in T\u00fcrkiye slowing from 3.5 percent in 2023, to 2.1\n\npercent in 2024 and increasing again to 3.3 percent on average in 2025-2026. The Russian economy has started to recover from the 2022 recession, but growth is set to moderate after 1.7 percent in 2023 to 1.2 percent on average in 2024-2026.\n\n2023 was supposed to be the year of a strong reopening for China, but growth did not meet expectations. Weak global demand for goods has resulted in a weaker than expected industrial performance and the real estate sector continues to be a source of concern. For the 2024-2026 period, economic growth is expected to come in at only 4.2 percent despite increased stimulus.\n\nThe global economic slowdown and tighter monetary policy continue to weigh on economic growth in Australia. After growing by 1.7 percent in 2023, the outlook sees a growth rate of 1.3 percent for 2024 and some pick-up to 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent for 2025-2026. Unemployment is expected to run up a little more, from 4.1 percent in 2023 to 4.4 percent, but decrease again thereafter.\n\nWhen compared to the December 2022 consensus forecast, used for the 2022 Annual Report, the December 2023 forecast assumes somewhat better economic circumstances in 2023 but weaker for 2024. The forecast assumes to have Global GDP increased by 2.4 percent in 2023 (compared to 1.3 percent assumed before) and is expected to grow by 1.8 percent in 2024 (2.4 percent assumed before). The upgrade for 2023 reflects the better than expected economic performance of the US and eurozone as a recession on the back of the energy crisis was avoided, while the downgrade for 2024 reflects the impact of substantial monetary tightening.\n\n## Alternative scenarios and risks (*)\n\nBecause of the possible consequences of geopolitical risks, uncertainty surrounding the forecasts was higher in 2022. During 2023, the uncertainty level around the forecasts gradually decreased. To take this into account, ING applies normal levels of dispersion in the alternative scenarios used for year-end 2023 provisioning. For year-end 2022 half-widened dispersion levels were used, by which the near-term dispersion of the forward-looking distributions (from which the alternative scenarios are derived) was larger than in normal times.\n\nThe baseline scenario assumes a further easing of inflation in 2024 and relatively resilient labour markets. However, a longer period of weakness, due to even more concerning geopolitical tensions, persistent elevated inflation and a slowdown in China could lead to a more protracted and deeper economic slowdown. As such, the balance of risks to the baseline outlook is negative and the alternative scenarios have a downward skew in line with the outcomes of the Global Risk Survey from a leading third-party service provider. The downward skew remained stable compared to what has been applied for year-end 2022, continuing to reflect risks related to possible escalation of geopolitical tensions, a prolonged surge in inflation and tightening monetary policy.",

        "page_content": "- > Credit risk\n\nThe downside scenario, though technical in nature, sees for most countries a recession in 2024. Unemployment increases strongly in this scenario and house prices in most countries show outright falls. The downside scenario captures a possible escalation of geopolitical tensions, a prolonged surge in inflation and further slowing in China.\n\nThe upside scenario - while equally technical in nature - reflects the possibility of a better economic outturn if consumers spend more of their excess savings, geopolitical risks subside and China stimulus works out more strongly than expected.\n\n## Management adjustments applied this year (*)\n\nIn times of volatility and uncertainty where portfolio quality and the economic environment are changing rapidly, models alone may not be able to accurately predict losses. In these cases, management adjustments can be applied to appropriately reflect ECL. Management adjustments can also be applied where the impact of the updated macroeconomic scenarios is over- or under-estimated by the IFRS 9 models.\n\nING has internal governance frameworks and controls in place to assess the appropriateness of all management adjustments, involving first- and second lines of defence.\n\n| Management adjustments to ECL models (*) in \u20ac million                   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Economic sector based adjustments                                       |     36 |     71 |\n| Inflation and interest rate increases / second-order impact adjustments |    351 |    334 |\n| Mortgage portfolio adjustments                                          |    126 |    105 |\n| Other post model adjustments                                            |     64 |    -57 |\n| Total management adjustments                                            |    577 |    453 |\n\nThe economic sector-based adjustments of \u20ac36 million as of 31 December 2023 (\u20ac71 million as at 31 December 2022) fully relates to Business Banking clients that have benefited from Covid-19-related government support programmes in the Netherlands. In line with 2022, it became clearer during 2023 that the Covid-19 pandemic had less impact than expected on the number of defaults in related sectors with relatively high tax debt to be repaid; the economic sector-based management adjustment has therefore been partially released. The remaining management adjustment is related to sectors with relatively high tax debt to be repaid  and is expected to materialise with delayed effect. The \u20ac10 million adjustment on the livestock farming sector in the Netherlands that was also included in December 2022, related to nitrogen reduction targets has been fully released following improved risk metrics.\n\nING has performed further assessment for both WB and Retail Banking on the impact of second-order effects. The second-order adjustments as at December 2022 captured a wider range of indirect effects such as supply chain issues, staffing shortages and high energy prices. In 2023, the risks from high inflation and rapidly increasing interest rates became more apparent compared to other indirect effects, causing a shift in focus of this adjustment. This resulted in an overall adjustment for inflation and interest rate increases of \u20ac351 million in total as at 31 December 2023, of which \u20ac138 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac164 million) relates to Retail Banking segments and \u20ac213 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac170 million) to the Wholesale Banking segment.\n\nAs the credit risk models in Retail Banking generally assume that inflation and interest rate increases risks materialise via other risk drivers such as GDP and unemployment rates with a delay, an overlay approach was determined. The methodology considers debt-to-income ratios and the percentage of loans that are expected to reprice within one year to timely estimate the expected credit losses related to reduced repayment capacity and affordability for private individuals and business clients in the Retail Banking segment.\n\nIn Wholesale Banking, the IFRS 9 credit risk models mostly leverage on GDP growth as a generic macroeconomic variable. High inflation and rapidly increasing interest rates however trigger economic heterogeneity (i.e. some businesses benefit, while others suffer), as such the current circumstances are expected to cause more defaults than normally predicted using GDP growth. A sector-based heatmap approach was used to adjust the probability of default for clients in sectors that are expected to be significantly impacted by high inflation and increased interest rates, including refinancing risk. The adjustment is predominantly visible in the commercial real estate sector and reflected in Stage 1 and Stage 2.\n\nThe overall mortgage portfolio adjustment as at 31 December 2023 increased to \u20ac126 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac105 million), as an adjustment of \u20ac115 million has been recognised in 2023 following new insights from a risk segmentation model that captures affordability, repayment and refinancing risk on performing mortgage customers with a bullet loan in the Netherlands.\n\nThe mortgage portfolio adjustment that relates to significant increase of house prices was reduced to \u20ac11 million as at 31 December 2023, coming from \u20ac105 million as at December 2022. This decrease is reflecting the decline in house prices in various countries, subsequent materialisation into increased model-based ECL as well as an improved market outlook on the recovery value of residential real estate. ING still recognises a management adjustment related to house prices in Stage 2 and Stage 3 on the mortgage portfolios in Germany to maintain an appropriate level of ECL. The management adjustments are determined by calculating the impact of lower house prices on loan-to-value (LTV) and loss given default (LGD).\n\nOther post-model adjustments (PMAs) mainly relate to the impact of model redevelopment or recalibration and periodic model assessment procedures that have not been incorporated in the ECL models yet; the",

These can result from both regular model maintenance and ING's multi-year programme to update ECL models for the definition of default. These adjustments will be removed once updates to the specific models have been implemented. The change in balance compared to the previous reporting date is due to i) released PMAs because of model updates that have been implemented, and ii) new PMAs recognised for new redevelopments and recalibrations.\n\n## Analysis on sensitivity (*)\n\nThe table below presents the analysis on the sensitivity of key forward-looking macroeconomic inputs used in the ECL collective-assessment modelling process and the probability weights applied to each of the three scenarios. The countries included in the analysis are the most significant geographic regions in ING and for Wholesale Banking the US is the most significant in terms of both gross contribution to reportable ECL, and sensitivity of ECL to forward-looking macroeconomics. Accordingly, ING considers these portfolios to present the most significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of financial assets within the next financial year. ING also observes that, in general, the WB business is more sensitive to the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to enable the reader to understand the extent of the impact from the upside and downside scenario on model-based reportable ECL.\n\nIn the table below, the real GDP is presented in percentage year-on-year change, the unemployment in percentage of total labour force and the house price index (HPI) in percentage year-on-year change.",

        "page_content": "- > Credit risk\n\nWhen compared to the sensitivity analysis of 2022, the macroeconomic inputs for 2023 are somewhat more favourable and for 2024 less favourable as the lagged impact of monetary tightening is still feeding through to the real economy. The sensitivities for 2022 contain half-widened dispersion around the upside and downside scenarios, whereas half-widened dispersion was removed for these scenarios for the 2023 sensitivity analysis following a continued decrease in forecast uncertainty.\n\nOn a total ING level, the unweighted model ECL for all collective provisioned clients in the upside scenario was \u20ac2,510 million, in the baseline scenario \u20ac2,802 million, and in the downside scenario \u20ac3,668 million. This reconciles as follows to the reported ECLs:\n\n| Reconciliation of reportable collective ECL to total ECL (*)   |       |       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| in \u20ac million                                                   | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Total reportable collective provisions                         | 2,856 | 3,209 |\n| ECL from individually assessed impairments                     | 2,406 | 2,439 |\n| ECL from management adjustments                                | 577   | 453   |\n| Total ECL                                                      | 5,839 | 6,101 |\n\n## Criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) (*)\n\nAll assets and off-balance-sheet items that are in scope of IFRS 9 impairment and which are subject to collective ECL assessment are allocated a 12-month ECL if deemed to belong in Stage 1, or a lifetime ECL if deemed to belong in Stages 2 or 3. An asset belongs in Stage 2 if it is considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial origination or purchase. ING considers the credit risk of an asset to have significantly increased when either a threshold for absolute change in lifetime probability of default (PD) or a relative change in lifetime PD is reached.\n\nIt should be noted that the lifetime PD thresholds are not the only drivers of stage allocation. An asset can also change stages as a result of other triggers, such as having over 30 days arrears, being on a watch list or being forborne. Refer to section 1.5.6 of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies' for an exhaustive list. Furthermore, this analysis is rudimentary in the sense that other parameters would change when an asset changes stages.\n\n## Absolute lifetime PD threshold\n\nThe absolute threshold is a fixed value calibrated per portfolio/segment and provides a fixed threshold that, if exceeded by the difference between lifetime PD at reporting date and lifetime PD at origination, triggers Stage 2 classification. The expert-based thresholds for the absolute change in lifetime PD vary between 75bps for Retail portfolios, 100bps for WB and 250bps for SMEs, based on the characteristics of the specific portfolio. ING is in the process of refining the thresholds on a portfolio level. These have already been\n\nimplemented for part of the portfolio, resulting in calibrated instead of expert-based absolute lifetime PD thresholds.\n\n## Relative lifetime PD threshold\n\nThe relative threshold defines a relative increase of the lifetime PD beyond which a given facility is classified in Stage 2 because of significant increase in credit risk. The relative threshold is dependent on the individual PD assigned to each facility at the moment of origination and a scaling factor calibrated in the model development phase that is optimised depending on the observed default rates and overall average riskiness of the portfolio. While the scaling factor is associated with a whole portfolio/segment, the PD at origination is facility-specific and, in this sense, the relative threshold may differ facility by facility.\n\nUltimately the relative threshold provides a criterion to assess whether the ratio (i.e. increase) between lifetime PD at reporting date and lifetime PD at origination date is deemed a significant increase in credit risk. If the threshold is breached, SICR is identified and Stage 2 is assigned to the given facility.\n\nThe threshold for the relative change in lifetime PD is inversely correlated with the PD at origination; the higher the PD at origination, the lower the threshold. The logic behind this is to allow facilities originated in very favourable ratings to downgrade for longer without the need of a Stage 2 classification. In fact, it is likely that such facilities will still be in favourable ratings even after a downgrade of a few notches. On the contrary, facilities originated in already unfavourable ratings grades are riskier and even a single-notch downgrade might represent a significant increase in credit risk and thus a tighter threshold will be in place. Still, the relative threshold is relatively sensitive for investment grade assets while the absolute threshold primarily affects non-investment grade assets.\n\n## Average threshold ratio\n\nIn the table below the average increase in PD at origination needed to be classified in Stage 2 is reported, taking into account the PD at origination of the facilities included in each combination of asset class and rating quality. In terms of rating quality, assets are divided into 'investment grade' and 'non-investment grade' facilities. Rating 18 and 19 are not included in the table since facilities are not originated in these ratings and they constitute a staging trigger of their own (i.e. if a facility is ever to reach rating 18 or 19 at reporting date, it is classified in Stage 2). In the table, values are weighted by IFRS 9 exposure and shown for both year-end 2022 and year-end 2023.\n\nTo represent the thresholds as a ratio (i.e. how much should the PD at origination increase in relative terms to trigger Stage 2 classification) the absolute threshold is recalculated as a relative threshold for disclosure purposes. Since breaching only relative or absolute threshold triggers Stage 2 classification, the minimum between the relative and recalculated absolute threshold is taken as value of reference for each facility.",

On Group level, the total model ECL on performing assets, which is the ECL collectiveassessment without taking management adjustments into account, is \u20ac1,412 million. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to these PD thresholds bands, hypothetically solely applying the upside scenario would result in total model ECL on performing assets of \u20ac1,054 million and a decrease in the Stage 2 ratio by -0.5 percentage point, while solely applying the downside scenario in our models would result in total model ECL on performing assets of \u20ac2,290 million and an increase in the Stage 2 ratio by 3.8 percentage-point.",

Market risk either arises through positions in banking books or trading books. The banking book positions are intended to be held for the long term (or until maturity) or for the purpose of hedging other banking book positions. The trading book positions are typically held with the intention of short-term trading or to hedge other positions in the trading book. This means that financial instruments in the trading books should be free of trade restrictions. Policies and processes are in place to monitor the inclusion of positions in either the trading or banking book as well as to monitor the transfer of risk between the trading and banking books.\n\nING recognises the importance of sound market risk management and bases its market risk management framework on the need to identify, assess, control and manage market risks. The approach consists of five recurring activities: risk identification, risk assessment, risk control, risk monitoring and risk reporting.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nA governance framework has been established defining specific roles and responsibilities of business management units, market risk management units, and internal approval bodies per activity.\n\nSupervision of market risk falls under the responsibility of the EB/MBB and is delegated to the ALCO function, where ALCO Bank is the highest approval authority and sets the market risk appetite. ALCO Bank monitors ING's adherence to the risk appetite for market risk and sets additional limits where appropriate. These limits are cascaded through the organisation through lower level ALCOs. This ALCO structure facilitates top-down risk management, limit setting, limit monitoring and control of market risk.\n\nFR maintains a limit framework in line with ING's Risk Appetite Framework. The businesses are responsible for adhering to the limits which are reviewed on an annual basis and are ultimately approved by the ALCO Bank. Limit excesses are reported to senior management in line with the ALM Risk Appetite Statement Setting procedure and Market Risk in the Trading Book Framework, upon which the business needs to act accordingly. To adhere to the established limit framework, ING implements hedging and risk mitigation strategies that range from the use of traditional market instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to more sophisticated hedging strategies.\n\nThe organisational structure facilitates top-down risk management by recognising that risk taking and risk management occur to a large extent at the regional/local level. Bottom-up reporting from regional/local\n\nunits to head office units allows each management level to assess the market risks relevant at the respective levels.\n\nSeveral committees govern communication between the parties involved in market risk management:\n\n- \u00b7 The Market Risk Model Committee (MRMC), is the dedicated authority for the approval of all funding & liquidity risk, market risk (includes banking and trading risk), counterparty credit risk and business risk models and parameters for ING Bank within its mandate delegated by ALCO Bank.\n- \u00b7 The Valuation Model Committee approves pricing models for trading and banking books.\n\nFinancial Risk provides risk reporting to the EB and MBB, the ALCO Bank and the senior executive management of related business functions.\n\nThe following sections elaborate on the various elements of the risk management framework for:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk economic capital;\n- \u00b7 Market risk in trading books.\n- \u00b7 Market risk in banking books;\n\n## Market risk economic capital\n\nMarket Risk Economic Capital (MREC) measures the capital ING must hold to protect itself against losses due to market risks. MREC covers the entire balance sheet of ING Group, and includes market risk sub-types such as: interest rate and basis risk, credit spread risk, customer behaviour risk, FX risk, equity risk and commodity risk.\n\nMREC is calculated as the 99.9 percent worst value loss that can be incurred from one-year shocks to the underlying risk drivers. While aggregating the different economic capital market risk figures for the different portfolios, diversification benefits are taken into account as it is not expected that all extreme market movements will appear at the same moment.\n\n## Market risk in banking books (*)\n\nING makes a distinction between the trading and banking (non-trading) books. Positions in banking books originate from the market risks inherent in commercial products that are sold to clients, Group Treasury exposures, and from the investment of our own funds (core capital). Both the commercial products and the products used to hedge related market risk exposures are intended to be held until maturity, or at least for the long term.",

In this process the interest rate, FX, funding and liquidity risks are transferred from the commercial books through matched funding or replication to Group Treasury, where centrally managed. The scheme below presents the transfer and management process of market risks in the banking books.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk measurement (*)\n\nThe main concepts and metrics used for measuring market risk in the banking book are described below per risk type.\n\n## Interest rate risk in banking book (*)\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is defined as the exposure of a bank's earnings, capital, and market value to adverse movements in interest rates originated from positions in the banking book.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nThe management of interest rate risk follows the Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) framework as approved by ALCO Bank. This framework describes roles, responsibilities, risk metrics, and the policies and procedures related to interest rate risk management. Furthermore, ALCO Bank reviews and sets the risk appetite for interest rate risk on an annual basis. The risk appetite is translated into limits for the interest rate risk metrics.\n\nAs a result of this framework, ING centralises interest rate risk management from commercial books (that capture the products sold to clients) to globally managed interest rate risk books. This enables a clear demarcation between commercial business results and results based on unhedged interest rate positions.\n\nING distinguishes between three types of activities that generate interest rate risk in the banking book:\n\n- \u00b7 Investment of own funds;\n- \u00b7 Group Treasury exposures including strategic interest rate positions.\n- \u00b7 Commercial business;\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for managing the investment of own funds (core capital). Capital is invested for longer periods to contribute to stable earnings within the risk appetite boundaries set by ALCO Bank. The main objective is to maximise the economic value of the capital investment book while having stable earnings.\n\nCommercial activities can result in linear interest rate risk, for example, tenors and duration of new production and re-pricing of assets differ from those of liabilities. Also, interest rate risk can arise from customer behaviour and/or convexity risk, depending on the nature of the underlying product characteristics.\n\nCustomer behaviour risk is defined as the potential future (value) loss due to deviations in the actual behaviour of clients versus the modelled behaviour with respect to the embedded options in commercial products. General sources of customer behaviour risk, among other things, include the state of the",

The contractual nature of investments (assets) implies that the adjustment to market rates (repricing of assets) is not immediate, therefore the interest rate risk can arise with either positive or negative impact on the income. Interest rate risk is modelled based on the stability of deposits and the pass-through rate. This takes account of different elements, such as pricing strategies, volume developments and the level and shape of the yield curve. Savings volumes are typically assumed to be relatively stable and less sensitive to rate changes.\n\nInterest rate risk for mortgages arises due to prepayment or other embedded optionalities. In modelling this risk, both interest-rate-dependent pre-payments and constant prepayments, are considered. Next to a dependence on interest rates, modelled prepayments may include other effects such as loan-to-value, seasonality and the reset date of the loan. In addition, the interest sensitivity of embedded offered rate options may be considered.\n\nWholesale Banking loans typically do not experience interest-rate-dependent prepayment behaviour. These portfolios are match-funded taking the constant prepayment model into account and typically do not contain significant convexity risk. Wholesale Banking loans can have an all-in rate floor or a floor on a reference rate.\n\nCustomer behaviour in relation to mortgages, loans, savings and demand deposits is modelled, based on extensive research. However, the substantial change in the interest rate environment makes extensive research more challenging than before and may increase model risk. Models are backtested and updated when deemed necessary in an annual procedure. Model parameters and the resulting risk measures are approved by (local) ALCO and are closely monitored on a monthly basis.\n\nLinear risk transfers take place from commercial business books to the treasury book (Group Treasury), if necessary, by using estimations of customer behaviour. The originating commercial business is ultimately responsible for estimating customer behaviour, leaving convexity risk and (unexpected) customer behaviour risk with the commercial business. Risk measurement and the risk transfer process take place at least monthly. However, if deemed necessary, additional risk transfers can take place.\n\nThe commercial business manages the convexity risk that is the result of products that contain embedded options, like mortgages. Here the convexity risk is defined as the optionality effects in the value due to\n\ninterest rate changes, excluding the first-order effects. In some cases, convexity risk is transferred from the commercial books to treasury books using cap/floor contracts and swaptions.\n\nIn the following sections, the interest rate risk exposures in the banking books are presented. ING quantifies risk measures from both earnings and value perspectives. Net interest income (NII)-at-Risk is used to provide the earnings perspective and the net present value (NPV)-at-Risk figures provide the value perspective. Please note that the interest rate risk that stems from the commercial business is assumed to be linearly hedged but no additional corrective management actions are taken into account in the NPV-at-Risk measure. In the NII-at-Risk measure, a more dynamic hedging process is taken into account.\n\nDuring 2023, the following activities related to the risk measurement for IRRBB were performed:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual review of the risk appetite for market risks in the banking book including further enhancements;\n- \u00b7 Further assessment and development of sub-risk types, such as tenor basis risk, vega optionality risk and client behaviour risk;\n- \u00b7 Set up of standardised risk measurement related to global crisis risk;\n- \u00b7 Annual savings/current account model updates;\n- \u00b7 Annual review of the interest rates scenarios used for calculating NII-at-Risk and NPV-at-Risk;\n- \u00b7 Annual update of parameters of prepayment models for market developments;\n- \u00b7 Further enhancement of the IRRBB framework in relation to upcoming regulatory requirements (e.g. anticipation on implementation and measurement of the upcoming regulatory metric NII SOT, development of additional requirements coming forward from latest EBA guidelines);\n- \u00b7 Further strengthening of customer behaviour risk and model risk frameworks\n\n## Net interest income (NII) at Risk (*)\n\nThe NII-at-Risk measures the impact of changing interest rates on the forecasted net interest income (before tax) of the banking book, excluding the impacts of credit spread sensitivity, fees and fair value impact. Future projected balance sheet developments are included in this risk metric. NII-at-Risk is a metric that helps provide insight as to what extent ING's NII under alternative interest rates developments deviates from what was assumed in our dynamic plan projections.\n\nIn its risk management, ING monitors the NII-at-Risk under a three-year timeframe. Interest rates are stressed during the first year versus the prevailing curve, taking gradual changes over the first year. The rate changes considered comprise both upward and downward scenarios, as well as parallel (equal movements across the yield curve) and non-parallel scenarios.\n\nThe impact of changing interest rates on ING's NII is predominantly caused by the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Change in returns of (re-)investments of client deposits;\n- \u00b7 Change in client deposit rates (mainly savings), (partially) tracking changes in market interest rates;",

The model is calibrated under a range of interest rate scenarios. Per scenario the actual change in client deposit rates may deviate from this calibrated model. The actual NII development of customer deposits may, indeed, differ from the provided scenarios, depending on, amongst others, actual interest rate and savings client rate evolution, as well as changes to ING's balance sheet composition such as net deposit growth and relative share of savings deposits and non-remunerated current accounts.\n\nThe NII-at-Risk figures in the table below reflect a parallel, linear interest rate movement during a year ('ramped') under the assumption of balance sheet developments in line with the ING's dynamic plan with a time horizon of one year. The majority of the risk comes from fixed-rate positions, most notably nonremunerated current accounts and variable-rate savings accounts .\n\nThe NII-at-Risk is primarily driven by the difference in sensitivity of client liabilities, mainly savings, versus the sensitivity of client assets and investments to rate changes. The investment of own funds only impacts the earnings sensitivity marginally, as only a relatively small part has to be (re)invested within the one-year horizon.\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 2023 Ramped, unfloored   | 2023 Ramped, unfloored   | 2022 Ramped, unfloored   | 2022 Ramped, unfloored   |\n|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                | parallel  \u25bc              | parallel  \u25b2              | parallel  \u25bc              | parallel  \u25b2              |\n| By currency    |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Euro           | -165                     | 155                      | -119                     | 114                      |\n| US dollar      | -12                      | 12                       | -1                       | 2                        |\n| Other          | -62                      | 69                       | -23                      | 27                       |\n| Total          | -239                     | 236                      | -142                     | 142                      |\n\nEUR ramped (unfloored) is at +/- 110bps in 1 year (2022: +/-100bps)\n\nUSD ramped (unfloored) is at +/- 110bps in 1 year (2022: +/-120bps)\n\nThe change in NII under a declining and upward interest rate scenarios may not be equal. This is due to different expected reactions in prepayment behaviour of mortgages and different pricing developments of\n\ncommercial loans and deposits products (mainly savings). This is caused by embedded options, explicit or implicit pricing floors and other (assumed) pricing factors.\n\n## Year-on-year variance analysis (*)\n\nIn our customer deposit composition current accounts decreased and term deposits increased. Over 2023 the one-year asset repricing versus liability repricing increased, leading to a higher NII-at-Risk.\n\nIn 2023 central banks tightened monetary conditions, a continuation of a trend started in 2022 to counter high inflation. The interest rates, however, stabilised in the second half of the year as inflation started to ease. ING applied a dynamic hedging process, by which interest rate risk was transferred from the business to Group Treasury and subsequently hedged in the markets. This process mitigates interest rate risk resulting in a lower sensitivity for rate changes of ING's NII. However, the main drivers of a potential change of NII sensitivity are balance sheet developments, specifically relating to mortgages, loans and savings. In the eurozone, mortgage production was impacted by an increase in interest rates. Next to the impact on new production, the prepayment incentive generally decreased due to the increase in interest rates. The funds entrusted volume did not change significantly. The impact of explicit and implicit floors on both rates of client assets and savings phased out in the course of the year on the back of the interest rate increases. Pre-existing hedges, as executed by Group Treasury, were also adjusted continuously throughout the year to hedge any interest rate risk coming from higher interest rates. Furthermore, ING's investment of own funds took place against a lower duration reducing sensitivity. Excluding Model Risk, the total NII-at-Risk remains relatively limited in comparison to ING's total interest income.\n\n## Net Present Value (NPV) at Risk (*)\n\nNPV-at-Risk measures the impact of changing interest rates on the value of the positions in the banking book. The NPV-at-Risk is defined as the outcome of an instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates from applying currency-specific scenarios. The NPV-at-Risk asymmetry between the downward and upward shock is mainly caused by convexity risk in the mortgage and savings portfolio.\n\nThe full value impact cannot be directly linked to the financial position or profit or loss account, as fair value movements in banking books are not necessarily reported through the profit or loss account or through other comprehensive income (OCI). The changes in value are expected to materialise over time in the profit and loss account if interest rates develop according to forward rates throughout the remaining maturity of the portfolio. The majority of the risk comes from the investments of own funds and from positions exhibiting negative convexity due to embedded optionality (most notably variable rate savings rate and fixed rate mortgages).",

The worst case scenario, parallel up, remained relatively unchanged. Most of the year-to-year move is coming from mortgages, partly offset by savings and derivatives from hedging activities.\n\n## IBOR transition (*)\n\nIn line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board, a fundamental review of important interest rates benchmarks has been undertaken. Some interest benchmarks have been reformed, while others have or will be replaced by risk-free rates (RFR) and discontinued. USD LIBOR in its current form ceased on 30 June 2023, whereas the cessation of GBP, CHF, JPY, and EUR LIBOR rates occurred on 31 December 2021.\n\nTo support these changes, the financial sector has issued several guidance papers and other initiatives to help phase the transition.\n\nTo facilitate the transition away from USD LIBOR, for new USD contracts, ING started using the recommended alternative rates based on SOFR in 2022. Also, during 2022 and 2023, ING sought to ensure that existing loan and derivative contracts were either transitioned to alternative rates or transition arrangements agreed, such as taking steps to ensure a large portion of the derivative portfolio was covered by ISDA fallbacks. Despite extensive and timely communication on the desirability of fully agreeing transition arrangements before 30 June 2023, some clients have agreed to complete the required work before the first interest reset date after cessation. A limited number of clients in restructuring or those subject to sanctions need to rely on existing fallback language or synthetic LIBOR.\n\nDue to the discontinuation of this important rate, ING, its customers, and the financial services industry have\n\nfaced and continue to face a number of risks. These risks include legal, financial, operational, reputational and conduct risk. Legal risks are related to any required changes to existing transactions. Financial risks may arise due to declining liquidity and may impact a contract directly or the ability to hedge the risks in that contract. Operational risks arise due to the requirement to adapt IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes. Conduct risk also plays a role, as renegotiation of loan contracts requires active engagement from all parties to a contract and may lead to negotiations concentrated in a period close to actual cessation. ING continues to work with the very limited number of clients that are yet to complete the USD LIBOR transition.\n\nThe progress of the IBOR transitioning between 2018 and 2023 was tracked in the global ING IBOR programme, governed by business line steering committees, which reported to a central IBOR steering committee. The programme coordinated the actions necessary to manage the required changes to internal processes and systems, including pricing, risk management, legal documentation, hedge arrangements, as well as the impact on customers. The limited amount of remaining USD LIBOR contracts continues to be monitored within the commercial business lines following the closure of the bank-wide IBOR programme in November 2023. The ING Benchmark Committee continues to monitor market developments and reform plans for other rates, to anticipate the impact on any related risks.\n\nOne such development concerns the plans published by the Polish National Working Group, which advises the market to be ready for a cessation of WIBOR and WIBID reference rates at the end of 2027 (originally expected in 2025, but in the last quarter of 2023 the cessation date was postponed to the end of 2027) with the offering of financial products using the new benchmark (Warsaw Interest Rate Overnight or WIRON) to progress gradually and no new products using WIBOR and WIBID beyond 1 July 2024. The WIBOR rates are used in several of our lending and derivative products, and hence a project team has been established to manage the transition. WIBOR transition is especially important for our Polish subsidiary ING Bank Slaski S.A. with a significant amount of Polish zloty-denominated assets and liabilities including derivatives that are continuously rebalanced to hedge the risk exposures.\n\nThe tables below summarise the approximate gross exposures of ING that have yet to transition related to USD LIBOR and WIBOR. For WIBOR, as of 31 December 2023, they exclude exposures expiring before the transition date 31 December 2027 and of 31 December 2022 they exclude exposures expiring before the previously expected transition date 1 January 2025. Therefore, WIBOR exposures are not directly comparable between 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 as a consequence of the recent developments in the Polish National Working Group.",

The majority of the non-derivative financial assets exposure on 31 December 2023 are related to contracts using synthetic USD LIBOR up until the transition to SOFR is complete during 2024. In addition, ING reduced its committed undrawn credit facilities linked to USD LIBOR from \u20ac7,644 million on 31 December 2022 to \u20ac9 million on 31 December 2023. The total of nonderivative financial liabilities linked to USD LIBOR is reduced from \u20ac1,637 million on 31 December 2022 to \u20ac16 million on 31 December 2023. The remaining non-derivative financial instruments linked to USD LIBOR are expected to transition before the next interest rate reset date. Therefore, the remaining exposure to USD LIBOR is expected to reduce further during the first half of 2024.\n\n| Derivative financial instruments to transition to alternative benchmarks (*) in \u20ac million   | 31 December 2023 Nominal value   | 31 December 2022 Nominal value   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| By benchmark rate 1                                                                         |                                  |                                  |\n| USD LIBOR                                                                                   | 151                              | 495,318                          |\n| WIBOR                                                                                       | 77,238                           | 136,318                          |\n| Total                                                                                       | 77,388                           | 631,636                          |\n\n1 For cross-currency swaps all legs of the swap are included that are linked to a main IBOR that is significant to ING.\n\nIn addition to the amounts in the table above, ING transitioned the interest rate swaptions that referred to the USD LIBOR ICE swap rate (nominal value on 31 December 2022: \u20ac10,810 million). The transition of these contracts was in general governed by a specific ISDA protocol.\n\nDerivative financial instruments linked to USD LIBOR were reduced from \u20ac495,318 million on 31 December 2022 to only \u20ac151 million on 31 December 2023. The majority of derivatives linked to USD LIBOR rates were transacted with clearing houses and transitioned through a standardised exercise during the second quarter of 2023. For non-centrally cleared derivatives, the main transition occurred using the ISDA IBOR fallback arrangements. The majority of the remaining derivative financial instruments linked to USD LIBOR are related to contracts using synthetic USD LIBOR and linked to non-derivative financial assets that are expected to transition before the next interest rate reset date during 2024. Therefore, a steady reduction of these last few USD LIBOR contracts is expected during the first half of 2024.\n\nGiven that IBOR reform may have various accounting implications, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has undertaken a two-phase project:\n\n\u00b7 Phase 1 addresses those issues that affect financial reporting before the replacement of an existing benchmark. This allows ING to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from the reform. Under these temporary exceptions, interbank offered rates are assumed to continue unaltered for the purposes of hedge accounting until such time as the uncertainty is resolved.\n\n\u00b7 Phase 2 focuses on issues that may affect financial reporting when the existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced. Phase 2 amendments to IFRS relate mainly to accounting for changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities due to the IBOR reform and impact on hedge accounting when an existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced with an alternative risk-free rate.\n\nSpecifically, Phase 2 amendments require that the effective interest rate on debt financial instruments is adjusted, and hedge accounting continues on transition to risk free rates, but only to the extent that the modifications made to financial instruments are those necessary to implement the IBOR reform and that the new basis for calculating cash flows is 'economically equivalent' to the previous basis. By applying these mandatory amendments, ING Group avoids recognising modification gains and losses on debt instruments that would otherwise be required in the absence of Phase 2 amendments (changes to debt instruments resulting from IBOR reform are treated as a reset to the instrument's variable interest rate). In addition, ING Group avoids hedge accounting discontinuations when modifying both hedged items and hedging instruments (and related hedge documentation) as a consequence of IBOR reform that would otherwise be required in the absence of Phase 2 amendments.",

Phase 1 reliefs cease to apply when uncertainty arising from IBOR reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and amount of the IBOR-based cash flows of the relevant instruments. It is ING Group's policy to cease to apply Phase 1 reliefs when the applicable contract (either hedging instrument or hedged item) is actually modified. As a result, for these hedge accounting relationships the applicable Phase 1 reliefs ceased to apply and Phase 2 became applicable. Refer to section 1.5.4 of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and material accounting policy information' for more information on the Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments.\n\nFurthermore, hedging relationships are being amended to incorporate the new benchmark rates. During 2023, ING focused on USD LIBOR contracts and all hedging relationships have been amended to incorporate the new benchmark rates and do no longer reference USD LIBOR rates.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, Phase 1 reliefs are applicable to WIBOR indexed fair value and cash flow hedge accounting relationships as there is uncertainty arising from the WIBOR reform with respect to the timing and the amount of the underlying cash flows that the Group is exposed to. Therefore, for WIBOR financial instruments designated in hedge accounting the applicable Phase 1 reliefs will continue to apply until the relevant contract is modified. At that point in time, Phase 2 reliefs will become applicable. For these affected fair value and cash flow hedge relationships ING assumes that the WIBOR based cash flows from the hedging instrument and hedged item will remain unaffected.\n\nThe same assumption is used to assess the likelihood of occurrence of the forecast transactions that are subject to cash flow hedges. The hedged cash flows in cash flow hedges directly impacted by the WIBOR reform still meet the highly probable requirement, assuming the WIBOR benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n\nThe total gross notional amounts of hedging instruments that are used in the ING's hedge accounting relationships for which the Phase 1 amendments to IAS39 were applied are:\n\n## Notional amounts of Hedging instruments (*)\n\n|                   | 31 December 2023   | 31 December 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| in \u20ac million      | Nominal value      | Nominal value      |\n| By benchmark rate |                    |                    |\n| USD LIBOR         |                    | 28,316             |\n| WIBOR             | 89,338             | 57,774             |\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, all USD LIBOR hedging relationships have been amended to incorporate the new benchmark rates and do no longer reference USD LIBOR rates. At 31 December 2022 approximately 89% of\n\nthe notional amounts for USD LIBOR had a maturity date beyond the transition date 30 June 2023. Approximately 29% of the notional amounts for WIBOR have a maturity date beyond the new transition date 31 December 2027. At 31 December 2022, approximately 71% of the notional amounts for WIBOR had a maturity date beyond the previously expected transition date of 1 January 2025. The WIBOR amounts are not directly comparable between 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 as a consequence of the recent postponement of the cessation of WIBOR by the Polish National Working Group.\n\nThe notional amounts of the derivative hedging instruments provide a close approximation of the extent of the risk exposure ING manages through these hedging relationships.\n\n## Credit spread risk in banking books (*)\n\nCredit spread risk is defined as risk driven by the changes of the market price for credit risk, for liquidity and potentially other characteristics of credit-risky instruments, which is not captured by another existing prudential framework such as IRRBB or by expected credit/(jump-to-) default risk.\n\n## EBA guidelines\n\nThe updated guidelines on credit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) became effective on 31 December 2023. Following the EBA guidelines, the scope in terms of positions and metrics has been reviewed and updated during 2023. Metrics used are NPV-at-Risk, NII-at-Risk and Market Value Changes-at Risk and view the positions across different accounting treatments.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe management of credit spread risk follows the CSRBB framework as approved by ALCO Bank. This framework describes roles, responsibilities, risk metrics, and the policies and procedures related to credit spread risk management. Furthermore, ALCO Bank reviews and sets the risk appetite for credit spread risk on an annual basis. The risk appetite is translated into limits for the risk metrics.\n\n## Foreign exchange (FX) risk in banking books (*)\n\nFX exposures in banking books result from core banking business activities (business units doing business in currencies other than their base currency), foreign currency investments in subsidiaries (including realised net profit and loss), and strategic equity stakes in foreign currencies. The policy regarding these exposures is briefly explained below.",

Consequently, assets and liabilities are matched in terms of currency, within certain friction limits.\n\n## Governance - FX translation result (*)\n\nING's strategy is to protect the CET1 ratio against adverse impact from FX rate fluctuations, while limiting the volatility in the profit and loss account due to this CET1 hedging and limiting the RWA impact under the regulatory framework. Hedge accounting is applied to the largest extent possible. Taking this into account, the CET1 ratio hedge can be achieved by deliberately taking foreign currency positions equal to certain target positions, such that the CET1 capital and risk-weighted assets are equally sensitive in relative terms to changing FX rates.\n\n## Risk profile - FX translation result (*)\n\nThe following table presents the currency exposures in the banking books for the most important currencies for the FX translation result. Positive figures indicate long positions in the respective currency. As a result of the strategy to hedge the CET1 ratio an open structural FX exposure exists.\n\nTo measure the volatility of the CET1 ratio from FX rate fluctuations, different metrics are used including the CET1 Ratio-at-Risk. The impact is controlled via the Solvency and Market Risk Banking Book RAS.\n\n## EBA Structural FX guidelines\n\nIn line with the EBA guidelines on Structural FX, upon permission from the competent authorities, certain currency positions are being excluded from the calculation of net open currency positions under CRR article 352(2).

Local offices are responsible for the management of the equity investment positions. Financial Risk is responsible for monitoring the regulatory capital for equity investments on a monthly basis and acts independently from ING/local management when monitoring these positions.\n\n## Risk profile (*)\n\nEquity price risk arises from the possibility that an equity security's price will fluctuate, affecting the values of the equity security itself as well as other instruments whose values react similarly to the particular security, a defined basket of securities, or a securities index. ING's equity exposure mainly consists of the investments in associates and joint ventures of \u20ac1,509 million (2022: \u20ac1,500 million) and equity securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) of \u20ac1,885 million (2022: \u20ac1,887 million). The value of equity securities held at FVOCI is directly linked to equity security prices with increases/decreases being recognised in the revaluation reserve. Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured in accordance with the equity method of accounting and the balance sheet value is therefore not directly linked to equity security prices. The equity sensitivity is expressed as the equity position.",

These positions are often a result of transactions with clients and may benefit from short-term price movements. In 2023, ING continued its strategy of undertaking trading activities to develop its client-driven franchise and deliver a differentiating experience by offering multiple market and trading products.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nThe Financial Markets Risk Committee (FMRC) is the market risk committee that, within the risk appetite set by the ALCO Bank, sets the market risk limits both on an aggregated level and on a desk level. The FMRC has delegated authority from ALCO Bank for the management of market risk related to all trading and banking book activities within Financial Markets (FM). Financial Risk/ Trading Risk Management (FR/ TRM) advises both FMRC and ALCO Bank on the market risk appetite of the trading activities.\n\nWith respect to the trading portfolios, TRM focuses on the management of market risks of Wholesale Banking (mainly Financial Markets) as this is the only business line within ING where trading activities take place. Trading activities include facilitation of client business and market making. TRM is responsible for the development and implementation of trading risk policies and risk measurement methodologies, and for reporting and monitoring risk exposures against approved trading limits. TRM also reviews trading mandates and global limits, and performs the gatekeeper role in the product review process (PARP).\n\n## Risk measurement (*)\n\nING uses a comprehensive set of methodologies and techniques to measure market risk in trading books: Value at Risk (VaR) and Stressed Value at Risk (SVaR), Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), and stress testing. Systematic validation processes are in place to validate the accuracy and internal consistency of data and parameters used for the internal models and modelling processes.\n\n## Value at Risk (*)\n\nTRM uses the historical simulation VaR methodology (HVaR) as its primary risk measure. The HVaR for market risk quantifies, with a one-sided confidence level of 99 percent, the maximum overnight loss that could occur in the trading portfolio of ING due to changes in risk factors (e.g. interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, implied volatilities) considering the positions remains unchanged for a time period of one day.\n\nNext to general market movements in these risk factors, HVaR also takes into account market data movements for specific moves in, for example, the underlying issuer or securities. A single model which diversifies general and specific risk is used. In general, a full revaluation approach is applied, while for a limited number of linear trading positions and risk factors in commodity and equity risk classes a sensitivitybased approach is applied. The potential impact of historical market movements on today's portfolio is estimated, based on equally weighted observed market movements of the previous year (260 business days). When simulating potential movements in risk factors, depending on the risk factor type, either an absolute or a relative shift is used.\n\nThe data used in the computations is updated daily. ING uses HVaR with a one-day horizon for internal risk measurement, management control, and backtesting, and HVaR with a 10-day horizon for determining regulatory capital. To compute HVaR with a 10-day horizon, the one-day risk factor shifts are scaled by the square root of 10 and then used as an input for the revaluation. The same model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Limitations (*)\n\nHVaR has some limitations: HVaR uses historical data to forecast future price behaviour, but future price behaviour could differ substantially from past behaviour. Moreover, the use of a one-day holding period (or 10 days for regulatory capital calculations) assumes that all positions in the portfolio can be liquidated or hedged in one day. In periods of illiquidity or market events, this assumption may not hold. Also, the use of a 99 percent confidence level means that HVaR does not take into account any losses that occur beyond this confidence level.\n\n## Backtesting (*)\n\nBacktesting is a technique for the ongoing monitoring of the plausibility of the HVaR model in use. Although HVaR models estimate potential future trading results, estimates are based on historical market data. In a backtest, the actual daily trading result (excluding fees and commissions) is compared with the one-day HVaR.\n\nIn addition to using actual results for backtesting, ING also uses hypothetical results, which exclude the effects of intraday trading, fees, and commissions. When an actual or a hypothetical loss exceeds the HVaR,",

Based on ING's one-sided confidence level of 99 percent, an outlier is expected once in every 100 business days.\n\nOn an overall level in 2023, there was one outlier for hypothetical P&L and zero outliers for actual P&L. The hypothetical outliers occurred during the past year concentrated in the first quarter of 2023, mainly due to the increased market volatility arising from major American banks being collapsed.\n\n## Stressed HVaR (*)\n\nThe stressed HVaR (SVaR) is intended to replicate the HVaR calculation that would be generated on the bank's current portfolio with inputs calibrated to the historical data from a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to the bank's portfolio.\n\nTo calculate SVaR, ING uses the same model that is used for 1DHVaR, with a 10-day horizon. The data for the historical stress period used currently includes the height of the credit crisis around the fall of Lehman Brothers (2008-2009), and this choice is reviewed regularly. The historical data period is chosen so that it gives the worst scenario loss estimates for the current portfolio. The same SVaR model is used for management purposes and for regulatory purposes. The same SVaR model is used for all legal entities within ING with market risk exposure in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Incremental risk charge (*)\n\nThe incremental risk charge (IRC) for ING is an estimate of the default and migration risks for credit products (excluding securitisations) in the trading book, over a one-year capital horizon, with a 99.9% confidence level. Trading positions (excluding securitisations) of ING, which are subject to specific interest rate risk included in the internal model approach for market risk regulatory capital, are in scope of the IRC model. By model choice, equity is excluded from the model. For the calculation of IRC, ING performs a Monte Carlo simulation based on a multi-factor t-copula. In the multi-factor IRC model the supervisory asset correlations are no longer applicable and the calibration of the correlations is based on historical market data. The rating change is simulated for all issuers over the different liquidity horizons (i.e. time required to liquidate the position or hedge all significant risks) within one year. Movements across different rating categories and probabilities of default are governed by a credit-rating transition matrix. An internal transition matrix along with internal LGDs is used, to comply with the consistency requirement. The financial impact is then determined for the simulated migration to default, or for the simulated migration to a different rating category, based on LGD or credit spread changes, respectively.\n\nThe liquidity horizon has been set to the regulatory minimum of three months for all positions in scope. ING reviews the liquidity horizons on a yearly basis, based on a structured assessment of the time it takes to liquidate the positions in the trading portfolio.\n\n## Stress testing and event risk (*)\n\nStress testing is a valuable risk management tool. In addition to the bank-wide stress test framework as described in the stress-testing section, Trading Risk Management performs stress tests specific to the trading book with various frequencies. ING went live with a new Trading Book Stress Testing model in 2023, replacing the previously used Event Risk model. With the new model, the trading book stress tests evaluate the impact on the bank's trading book under severe but plausible stress scenarios, using full revaluation approach. The framework is based on historical as well as hypothetical scenarios. The stress result is an estimate of the profit and loss caused by a potential event and its worldwide impact for ING. The results of the stress tests are used for decision-making aimed at maintaining a financially healthy going-concern institution after a severe event occurs.\n\nIn stress scenarios, shocks are applied to prices (credit spreads, interest rates, equity, commodities, and FX rates) and volatilities. Depending on the type of the stress test, additional scenario assumptions can be made, for example on correlations, dividends, or recovery rates. The structural scenarios are defined to cover market moves in various directions and capture different asset class correlations. Scenarios are calculated using full revaluation approach. The worst scenarios are determined for each product line, business line and super business line, and compared against limits .\n\n## Other trading controls\n\nHVaR and event risk limits are the most important limits to control the trading portfolios. Additionally, limits have been set on SVaR and IRC, and ING uses a variety of other controls to supplement these limits. Position and sensitivity limits are used to prevent large concentrations in specific issuers, sectors, or countries. Moreover, other risk limits are set with respect to the activities in complex derivatives trading. The market risk of these products is controlled by product-specific limits and constraints.\n\n## Risk profile\n\nThe following chart shows the development of the overnight HVaR under a 99 percent confidence level and a one-day horizon versus actual and hypothetical daily trading profits and losses. In calculation of the hypothetical daily profit and loss, the trading position is kept constant and only the market movement is taken into account. The overnight HVaR is presented for the ING trading portfolio for 2023.",

The capital increase is driven by an increase in market volatility following the US bank collapse from March 2023.

This mainly reflects higher interest rate positions during 2023.\n\n## EU MR2-A: market risk under internal model approach\n\n| in \u20ac million   | in \u20ac million                                                                 | 2023   | 2023                           | 2023   | 2022                           |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|\n|                |                                                                              | RWA    | Total own  funds  requirements | RWA    | Total own  funds  requirements |\n| 1              | VaR (higher of values a and b)                                               | 2,508  | 201                            | 2,732  | 219                            |\n| (a)            | Previous day's VaR (VaRt-1)                                                  |        | 26                             |        | 49                             |\n| (b)            | Multiplication factor (mc)  x average of previous 60 working  days (VaRavg)  |        | 201                            |        | 219                            |\n| 2              | SVaR (higher of values a and b)                                              | 4,385  | 351                            | 3,427  | 274                            |\n| (a)            | Latest available SVaR (SVaRt-1))                                             |        | 75                             |        | 70                             |\n| (b)            | Multiplication factor (ms)  x average of previous 60 working  days (sVaRavg) |        | 351                            |        | 274                            |\n| 3              | IRC (higher of values a and b)                                               | 1,746  | 140                            | 1,934  | 155                            |\n| (a)            | Most recent IRC measure                                                      |        | 108                            |        | 76                             |\n| (b)            | 12 weeks average IRC measure                                                 |        | 140                            |        | 155                            |\n| 4              | Comprehensive risk measure (higher of values a, b and c)                     |        |                                |        |                                |\n| (a)            | Most recent risk measure of comprehensive risk measure                       |        |                                |        |                                |\n| (b)            | 12 weeks average of comprehensive risk measure                               |        |                                |        |                                |\n| (c)            | Comprehensive risk measure - Floor                                           |        |                                |        |                                |\n| 5              | Other                                                                        | 810    | 65                             | 516    | 41                             |\n| 6              | Total                                                                        | 9,449  | 756                            | 8,609  | 689                            |\n\n## Sensitivities (*)\n\nAs part of the risk monitoring framework, TRM actively monitors the sensitivities of the trading portfolios. Sensitivities measure the impact of movements in individual market risk factors (foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads, equity and commodity prices) on profit and loss results of the trading positions and portfolios.\n\nThe following tables show the five largest trading positions in terms of sensitivities to foreign exchange, interest rate and credit spread risk factor movements. These largest exposures also reflect concentrations of risk in FX risk per currency, interest rate risk per currency, and credit spread risk per country, rating and sector. Due to the nature of the trading portfolios, positions in the portfolios can change significantly from day to day, and sensitivities of the portfolios can change daily accordingly.",

ING incorporates funding and liquidity risk management in its business strategy, and has established a funding and liquidity risk framework to manage these risks within predefined boundaries.\n\nA high-level overview of the F&L framework is provided in the next figure.\n\n## Governance (*)\n\nFunding and liquidity risk management within ING falls under the supervision of the ALCO Bank function, which approves the funding and liquidity risk appetite and subsequently cascades it throughout the organisation. ALCO Bank has delegated the responsibilities of the Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ICLAAP) and documents, as per the ICLAAP framework of ING, to the ICLAAP Committee. The ICLAAP Committee therefore focuses on technical liquidity documents and oversees business processes and deliverables concerning the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The EB, MBB, and staff departments from the CRO and CFO domains, as well as Group Treasury, have oversight of, and are responsible for, managing funding and liquidity risks.\n\nING's funding and liquidity risk governance is based on the three-lines-of-defence structure. This sets a clear division of responsibilities as well as an independent risk control challenge process. Group Treasury and the business lines have the first-line-of-defence functions, which include management of ING's (regulatory) liquidity and funding position, maintaining access to the professional funding markets, and managing the liquidity buffer. Financial Risk, as the second line of defence, is responsible for developing and maintaining ING's policies, standards and guidelines on F&L risk management, as well as for setting the F&L risk appetite through stress testing and other risk measurement activities. The Finance function is responsible for management information and regulatory reporting related to funding and liquidity risk management. As the third line of defence, Corporate Audit Services is responsible for independently assessing the design, effectiveness, and implementation of the Funding & Liquidity framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Funding and liquidity management strategy and objectives (*)\n\nThe main objective of ING's funding and liquidity risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund the commercial activities of ING, both under normal and stressed market circumstances across various locations, currencies, and tenors.\n\nING's funding consists mainly of retail and corporate deposits contributing around 50 percent and 25 percent of total funding, respectively. These funding sources provide a relatively stable funding base. The remainder of the required funding is attracted primarily through a combination of long-term and short-term",

Taking into consideration the identified risk drivers, ING regularly assesses its current and future liquidity adequacy and, if deemed necessary, takes action to further improve ING's liquidity position and maintain sufficient counterbalancing capacity. A liquidity adequacy statement is formulated on a quarterly basis to substantiate and reflect the management view on the current funding and liquidity position as well as the potential future challenges. The quarterly liquidity adequacy statement is an important part of ING's ILAAP process.\n\nAdditionally, ING completes ad-hoc funding and liquidity assessments if deemed necessary. Following the banking turmoil in March 2023, ING completed a lessons-learned deep-dive. This deep-dive included peer and internal analysis of deposit structures and liquidity buffers, and a review of the influence of mobile banking apps and social media on financial institutions. The F&L risk appetite subsequently incorporated elements of this analysis, as well as the impacts of quantitative tightening, TLTRO III redemptions, increased competition for savings in the higher-interest-rate-environment and potentially higher deposit outflows in certain countries, in the 2023 review.\n\nING assesses its F&L adequacy through three lenses - stress, economic and normative:\n\n- \u00b7 Through the stress lens, ING evaluates its ability to withstand periods of prolonged F&L stress for both normative and economic requirements or limits under idiosyncratic, market-related, a combination of idiosyncratic and market-related and climate risk scenarios, which lead to customer deposit outflows, deterioration of access to funding markets, and lower liquidity value of counterbalancing capacity.\n- \u00b7 Through the economic lens, ING assesses the extent to which its customers, professional counterparties and investors are comfortable to provide deposits and funding in the tenors, currencies, and instruments necessary to sustainably fund the business (intraday, short-term and long-term) in a going-concern situation.\n- \u00b7 Through the normative lens, ING ascertains that the bank is in the position to meet current and future home and host regulatory requirements.\n\nFor each lens, ING has established a related set of risk appetite statements, which define ING's risk appetite commensurate with the principles of liquidity adequacy. These risk appetite statements are summarised in the following illustration:",

        "page_content": "- > Funding and liquidity risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe F&L risk appetite statements are translated into a number of metrics with appropriate boundaries and instruments, which are used to regularly measure and manage ING's funding and liquidity risk. The risk appetite with respect to the stress lens aims to have sufficient counterbalancing capacity under various internally defined stress scenarios. Regarding the economic perspective, an internally defined stable funding to loans (SFtL) ratio and stable funding surplus metric (supplemented by other metrics) is used to stimulate a diversified funding base and to prevent overreliance on professional funding. Finally, the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) regulatory metrics are monitored in terms of both ING's risk appetite and normative requirements.\n\nThe macroeconomic and market environment are also important considerations in ING's funding and liquidity framework. The macroeconomic environment comprises various exogenous factors over which ING has no control, but which may have a material impact on ING's F&L position. The main macroeconomic factors analysed on a regular basis include:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance of global and local economic performance e.g. shifts in GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and public deficit/surplus;\n- \u00b7 Developments and risks arising from geopolitical tensions and related trends;\n- \u00b7 Monetary policy with a focus on the alternative monetary measures employed by central banks in recent years as a result of the global energy crisis and the recent period of high inflation;\n- \u00b7 Regulatory requirements; e.g. understanding the changing regulatory landscape as well as the impact of ING's actions on existing regulatory boundaries.\n\nThe strategic ambitions of ING, together with the design and execution of the funding plan, are assessed under both current and projected market conditions. An emphasis is placed on understanding overall market trends and developments, credit rating changes, and peer comparisons.\n\n## Liquidity stress-testing (*)\n\nFunding and liquidity stress-testing forms part of the overall F&L framework. It allows ING to examine the effects of exceptional but plausible future events on ING's funding and liquidity position. It also provides insight into which entities, business lines or portfolios are vulnerable to which types of risk drivers or scenarios.\n\nThe stress-testing framework encompasses the funding and liquidity risks of the consolidated balance sheet of ING Group, including all entities, business lines as well as on-, and off-balance-sheet positions. The net liquidity position (NLP) is the main stress-testing measure and is measured at different time buckets.\n\nThe stress-testing framework considers idiosyncratic, market-wide, combined (idiosyncratic and marketwide), and climate and environmental stress scenarios. The design of the framework is based on empirical evidence supplemented by expert judgement. The framework can be extended to additional ad-hoc scenarios. For example, it can be used as input for firm-wide stress testing and reverse stress testing.\n\nOutcomes of the stress tests are considered in the key aspects of ING's F&L risk framework and F&L risk management, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite Framework (through risk appetite statements);\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of the liquidity and funding position;\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and assessment;\n- \u00b7 Business actions (if needed);\n- \u00b7 Contingency funding plan;",

The results of all internal stress scenarios are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. In addition, ad-hoc scenarios based on current economic and market developments are run to determine their potential impacts on the funding and liquidity position of ING. In 2023, this included stress test scenarios dedicated to the impact of rapid deposit outflows on the bank, as well as a shutdown of short and long-term funding markets. The internal stress scenarios also serve as input in the decision on additional contingency measures.\n\nContingent F&L risks are addressed in the contingency capital and funding plan with a focus on earlywarning indicators as well as organisation and planning of liquidity management in times of stress. The contingency funding measures are developed in conjunction with the ING recovery plan and are reviewed and tested on a regular basis.",

Rather, it is a set of drivers affecting the likelihood and severity of existing risk categories/ risk types. ESG risk is an overarching set of risk drivers affecting:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risks: solvency risk, credit risk, market risk, funding & liquidity risk;\n- \u00b7 Other overarching risks: model risk and business risk.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial risks: operational risk, IT risk, reputational/litigation risk, compliance risk;\n\nESG risk is defined as any negative financial and/or non-financial impact on ING due to the present or future impacts from ESG factors on and stemming from ING's own operations - as well as its business activities as a company, its counterparties, and any sourced processes. The ESG risk definition considers:\n\n- \u00b7 ESG risk with regards to own operations: The risk of any negative financial and/or non-financial impact due to an ESG factor causing damage to ING's infrastructure, or due to an adverse reputational impact resulting from non-compliance with ING's commitments and ESG-related laws, regulations and disclosures.\n- \u00b7 ESG risk with regards to business activities: The risk of any negative financial and/or non-financial impact due to an ESG factor causing damage to ING's business activities (for example from lending to counterparties, investment exposures, funding activities and sourcing processes).\n\nESG factors are defined as environmental, social or governance matters that may have a positive or negative impact on the financial performance or solvency of an entity, sovereign or individuals.\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental factors are related to the quality and functioning of the natural environment and of natural systems, and include factors such as climate change, biodiversity and ecosystems, water and marine resources, resource use and circular economy, and pollution. Environmental factors are defined as environmental matters that may have a positive or negative impact on the financial performance or solvency of an entity, sovereign or individual.\n- \u00b7 Social factors are related to the rights, well-being and interests of people and communities, and include factors such as (in)equality, health, employee empowerment, diversity and inclusion, employee and customer health, safety and protection, inclusiveness, labour relations, human rights, workplace health and safety, human capital and communities.\n- \u00b7 Governance factors cover corporate governance practices, including executive leadership, executive compensation, audits, internal controls, sound tax practices, board independence, shareholder rights, ethical considerations, anti-corruption and bribery, sound risk management structures, organisation and functioning of the management body, transparency with regards to disclosures of information rules and\n\npractices and also the way in which companies or entities include environmental and social factors in their policies and procedures.\n\nWithin environmental risks a further distinction is made between physical and transition risk.\n\n- \u00b7 Physical risks refer to any negative financial and/or non-financial impact due to the physical effects of environmental factors. Such physical effects include:\n- \u00b7 Acute physical effects, which arise from:\n- \u00b7 Other environmental hazards related to biodiversity and ecosystems, water and marine resources, resource use and circular economy and pollution, that may damage production facilities and disrupt value chains.\n- \u00b7 Climate-related (weather-related) hazards such as storms, floods, fires or heatwaves.\n- \u00b7 Chronic physical effects, which arise from longer-term trends (progressive shifts), such as temperature changes, rising sea levels, reduced water availability, biodiversity loss and changes in land and soil productivity.\n- \u00b7 Transition risks refer to any negative financial and/or non-financial impact due to the effect of the transition to a net-zero and more environmentally sustainable economy. The transition includes:\n- \u00b7 Climate and environment related policy changes;\n- \u00b7 Market sentiment and demand changes.\n- \u00b7 Technological changes;\n\n## Governance\n\nThe ad hoc ESG committee is responsible for supervising ING's ESG direction, endorsing and monitoring progress, and advising the MBB on dilemmas. The ESG Sounding Board, comprised of senior leaders, guides the development and implementation of ESG topics as well as reporting on progress. Further details on ESG risk governance are provided in the section below.\n\n## ESG Risk Committee (ERC)\n\nThe ERC is a standing committee at ING involved in matters related to ESG risk. It is the primary oversight committee for ESG risk matters such as ESG risk methodologies, ESG risk internal and external reporting, the ESG risk framework, and the manner in which we address regulatory requirements related to ESG risk. The ERC oversees the management of ESG risk for ING. The committee also facilitates cross-functional alignment and decision-making on material operational issues (for risk types on which ESG risk has a material impact). The ERC is established as a technical board, and is serving MBB and/or MBB delegated committees (depending on the topic) as support in decision-making, and ensures that ESG risk related matters discussed at the SB are executed and delivered on.",

The degree of the ESR team engagement in transactions is dependent upon (i) the risk profile of the client, project or business engagement, (ii) ING's exposure, and (iii) the risks screened. In some locations, an ESR delegated adviser may be appointed if mutually agreed by the head of ESR and regional head. Such a role would support the senior credit officer (SCO), who would be responsible for ESR in the region.\n\nThe ESR function encompasses the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Create and maintain policies for sensitive industry sectors;\n- \u00b7 Monitor high-risk clients to assess compliance with sustainability criteria;\n- \u00b7 Assess transactions for environmental and social risk;\n- \u00b7 Spread ESR awareness throughout ING;\n- \u00b7 Participate in European and global advisory groups (e.g. OECD advisory group, steering committee to the Equator Principles, Thun Group of Banks) to help bring all banks to the same high standard.\n\n## Managing ESG risk\n\nThe ESG risk framework assists in managing ESG risk effectively through the application of the risk management process at varying levels of the organisation. The risk management cycle describes the processes by which ING can identify, assess, measure, mitigate and monitor ESG risk integrated within the existing risk types.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESG factors (the drivers of ESG risk) can lead to a negative financial and/or non-financial impact through a variety of transmission channels.

The methodologies take into account qualitative and quantitative criteria and different time horizons (short, medium and long-term). The definitions for short, medium and long-term depend on the climate risk (physical or transition risk), the existing risk type (credit, market, operational, compliance and liquidity) and the portfolio under consideration.\n\nQuantification approaches for our Business Banking and Wholesale Banking portfolios include:\n\n- \u00b7 Exposures towards companies excluded from EU Paris-aligned benchmarks;\n- \u00b7 Exposures to the top-20 most carbon-intensive firms.\n\nQuantification approaches for our immovable property portfolio include:\n\n- \u00b7 Mapping of collateral values to physical risk hazards;\n- \u00b7 Transition risk given the EPC label distribution of the portfolio.\n\nUsing various quantification approaches ING is able to identify and assess our material Environmental risks. Different quantification approaches have been developed for the different business segments\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nThe mitigation of the identified risks can be performed through several risk mitigating strategies, such as reducing risk levels, avoiding risk, accepting risk or transferring the risk. The measures are embedded as part of the updates of the existing policies and procedures in the different risk categories / risk types to mitigate material ESG risk. Mitigation activities can be performed at a portfolio, client or transaction level and include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Engaging with high ESG risk counterparties to understand and support their mitigation plans. For instance, the conditions that apply to loans based on the ESR outcome can play an important role in helping clients improve their environmental and social performance, as well as ensuring their continued compliance with our ESR policy;\n- \u00b7 Setting the risk appetite statement (RAS) to limit the level of acceptable risks with consequence management attached;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring appropriate business continuity plans and insurance are in place to reduce the impact of more frequent and severe weather events for both ING's own operations and business activities, thus reducing the inherent risk.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nWe used the outcomes of the C&E risk heatmap exercise to introduce climate risk elements in the credit risk appetite from 2022 onwards. In 2023, we continued with the monitoring mechanism which was established\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk identification\n\nManaging ESG risks covers both physical risks (e.g. extreme weather events, soil degradation) and transition risks (e.g. policy changes, shifts in market sentiment and consumer demand). The potential impacts that physical and transition risks could have on households, businesses as well as on the macroeconomy can translate into a range of financial risks for ING. The ESG risks can materialise through defaults of businesses and households, increased volatility in equity and commodity markets, disruptions to banks' and customers' operations, and litigation procedures. ING has identified the physical and transition risk transmission channels for credit risk (for our Wholesale Banking, Business Banking, and mortgages portfolios separately), market risk, operational risk, underwriting risk, compliance risk and liquidity risk.\n\nFurthermore, the outcome of ING's bank-wide risk identification and assessment process indicates that climate risk is an emerging risk considering both its likelihood and impact. That means it has the potential to significantly affect our performance but its impact on the organisation is more difficult to assess than other risk drivers.",

In July 2022, this mechanism became binding for WB sectors. For Business Banking (BB) sectors, a similar approach was used and the BB credit risk appetite has been in a monitoring period since 2022. In addition, climate risk has been incorporated into the 2023 market risk banking book risk appetite, with the introduction of sensitivity metrics per climate risk category.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nING's climate stress-testing model leverages upon data gathered and models developed for the ECB Climate Risk Stress Test, enhanced with internal climate risk stress test analysis. The risk coverage of the internal climate risk stress test is the full credit portfolio reflecting both flood and transition risk. For transition risk, a data-driven approach is developed to reflect the increase in the carbon price and therefore energy costs. The analysis focuses on (i) energy performance certificate (EPC) level for mortgages and corporates secured by real estate and (ii) NACE sector level for corporates not secured by real estate. For market risk, both the banking and trading book are included. Other risks are covered as well, among others non-financial risk, issuance risk, business risk, and model risk. The climate stress test shows a manageable impact on ING from a financial perspective in the short-term as sufficient contingency measures are available to mitigate the impact. The contractual maturity of ING's financial assets including loans to business customers (Wholesale Banking and Business Banking) is mostly short-term, except for loans to customers covered by immovable property (Retail Banking residential mortgages). We have not analysed the potential impact for the medium and long-term on ING's capital position in ING's climate stress test.\n\nIn addition, ING has developed the climate risk stress testing global procedure for ICAAP purposes to formally integrate climate risk stress testing within the ING Group ICAAP stress-testing framework. Within this document, guidance is provided on the minimum standards that need to be applied when climate risk stress tests are developed, implemented, and executed. With these minimum standards, the ING Group stress test framework has been extended with explicit requirements for ESG risk analyses. The document currently focuses on physical risk and transition risk as these can be properly quantified within stress testing. We aim to include other ESG risks later, and the same applies for the reflection of regulatory requirements as this topic is still evolving\n\n## Risk monitoring\n\nESG risk information is reported on a periodic (at minimum annual) basis, to measure and monitor risk exposure against the risk appetite and tolerance. Climate risk appetite is distributed on a monthly basis to the MBB and senior management and reported quarterly via the management report to the GCTP. Physical and transition risk results are reported semi-annually in ING Group's additional pillar III report. The ESG risk dashboard is reported to the MBB semi-annually.\n\n## Managing ESG risk in practice\n\nING's ESR framework helps us make informed choices about how, where and who we do business with. In 2023, the ESR framework was updated to reflect several (minor) amendments following the last comprehensive review that took place in June 2021. Among the updates are a clarification on the selfdeclaration approach used for Business Banking and a new restriction on dedicated upstream oil and gas financing. The next comprehensive review of the ESR framework will take place in 2024. For more information about ESR at ING, please refer to our corporate website.\n\nThe ESR framework includes standards and best practice guidance for ESR-sensitive sectors. It includes explicit restrictions on activities not in line with ING's values and harmful to people and/or the environment, which we do not want to finance.\n\nThe way the ESR framework is applied in practice differs per product type and segment. The most significant potential environmental and social impacts come from large corporates within our Wholesale Banking segment. However, mid-corporate clients and small and medium sized companies (referred to as the Business Banking segment) undergo a (basic) screening process too. Lastly, the ESR framework minimum requirements are also included in ING's procurement policy and apply to the screening of suppliers of ING's global procurement activities.\n\nThe ESR framework is incorporated in ING's KYC policy framework, meaning that the ESR client assessment is part of the regular client on-boarding and review process. Next to that, the ESR framework prescribes a dedicated ESR transaction assessment for corporate clients that helps us identify the level of risk. The combination of the ESR client and ESR transactional assessments provide us with the total ESR outcome. If the total ESR outcome is high risk, the transaction requires an ESR assessment and advice from the dedicated ESR team.\n\nWhile we have a robust ESR framework and made progress in enhancing the automation of the checks and controls in the ESR assessment processes, we acknowledge that we need to improve our processes around the ESR Framework and its implementation. We see room for improvement to further ensure adequacy and completeness of data necessary to steer, manage, evidence, and monitor these risks at the level of granularity needed.\n\nOf all WB engagements in scope of the ESR framework in 2023, 84 percent were considered ESR low-risk (2022: 84 percent), 6 percent ESR medium-risk (2022: 7 percent) and 10 percent ESR high-risk (2022: 9 percent). ESR high-risk cases require specialized advice from the global ESR team. Beyond these high-risk cases, the ESR-team is also consulted on other types of engagements, such as trade-related requests, medium-risk transactions and inquiries from the KYC department about the ESR client assessment. Depending on the nature of the request, the ESR-team provides an advice on these cases too. The ESR advice assesses the specific product offered and environmental and social impacts associated with it, the sector, operating context and geography of the engagement and other relevant factors. Based on this in-",

The ESR advice is binding (on its conditions or its negative conclusion) to the relevant approval mandate holder for the underlying credit risk. If the applicable mandate holder disagrees with the ESR advice, it can be escalated to the Global Credit Committee (GCC) for a final decision. The GCC is the only body that can overrule the ESR advice. Of the 371 ESR advices given in 2023, 50 percent were positive, 34 percent positive subject to conditions and 16 percent negative. Conditions included in an ESR advice could play an important role in helping clients improve their environmental and social performance and transitioning and ensuring their continued compliance with our ESR policy.\n\nThe ESR team mainly focuses on Wholesale Banking transaction advice, including (support for) engagement around ESR with clients, in some specific cases. In 2023, ESR visited several projects around the world as part of the due diligence and engagement process. In addition, the team works on a continuous improvement of the ESR framework, to cater for developments in the environmental and social space. ESR acts as a sparring and training partner for multiple internal teams, such as risk, front-office, KYC, and other teams, so that ESR knowledge is improved and spread.",

        "page_content": "- > Non-financial risk\n\n## Non-financial risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nNon-financial risk (NFR) is defined as the risk of financial loss, legal or regulatory sanctions, or reputational damage due to inadequate or failing internal processes, people and systems, a failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, or external events.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe global head of NFR is responsible for developing the framework of NFR policies and standards within ING, and for monitoring the quality of non-financial risk management in the ING entities. In addition to the global steering provided through the framework, the bank's Non-Financial Risk Committee (NFRC), chaired by the Group chief risk officer, is the highest level of the non-financial risk committees within ING, and is mandated by the MBB to opine on and approve non-financial risk matters, to monitor or verify whether appropriate action is taken by responsible management, and endorse the non-financial risk appetite.\n\n## Non-financial risk management\n\n## Risk categories\n\nING categorises non-financial risks in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliance risk is the risk of ING's integrity being impaired, which can result in reputational damage, legal or regulatory sanctions, or financial loss, due to a failure (or perceived failure) to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards. See more in 'Compliance risk'.\n- \u00b7 Information (technology) risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to breaches of confidentiality, integrity or availability of information or a lack of information quality within business processes and/or the supporting IT systems.\n- \u00b7 Continuity risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to business disruptions (loss of people, processes, systems, data, premises).\n- \u00b7 Control risk is the risks of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to ineffective organisational structures and governance procedures (including unclear roles and responsibilities and inadequate reporting structure).\n- \u00b7 Processing risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to failed (transaction) processing (input, execution, output) or failing process management.\n- \u00b7 Unauthorised activity risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to employees performing outside the normal course of their business, intentionally giving unauthorised approvals or overstepping their authority.\n\n- \u00b7 Personal and physical security risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to criminal and environmental threats that might endanger the security or safety of ING personnel at work, people in ING locations, ING assets or assets entrusted to ING, people at ING event locations, or might have an impact on ING organisation's confidentiality, integrity or availability.\n- \u00b7 Employment practice risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions or reputational damage due to acts that are inconsistent with employment, health and/or safety laws, regulations or agreements, from payment of personal injury claims, or from diversity/discrimination events.\n- \u00b7 Sourcing risk is the risk of financial loss, regulatory sanctions and/or reputational damage resulting from sourced activities (both IT and non-IT, including intra-group sourcing) not staying within ING's risk appetite and not being executed as agreed (with captives or partners), including non-compliance with internal or external regulations.\n- \u00b7 Fraud is the deliberate abuse of procedures, systems, assets, data, products and/or services of ING by those who intend to deceitfully or unlawfully benefit themselves and/or others. This definition of fraud is specified in the following two categories of fraud:\n\nInternal fraud: acts of fraud that involve at least one internal party performed by or in collusion with an ING employee or agent with the consequence of financial loss, regulatory fines, litigation loss, business disruption and/or reputational damage for ING.\n\nExternal fraud: acts of fraud or scams by individuals and/or parties excluding ING staff (including contractors), with the consequence of financial loss, regulatory fines, litigation loss, business disruption and/ or reputational damage for ING.\n\n## Measurement approach\n\nING uses an internal model in line with the advanced measurement approach (AMA) to determine the regulatory and economic capital amounts necessary to cover potential losses resulting from non-financial risks. This model calculates the non-financial risk exposure by combining a forward-looking and a backwardlooking view on non-financial risk events. ING reports the outcome of its AMA model quarterly. The CRR3 regulation (relating to new EU banking rules from the European Commission),  set to come into force in January 2025, will usher in the Standardized Approach, replacing the current AMA model. As it prepares to implement this non-model-based formula to calculate regulatory operational risk capital, ING is redesigning the internal model it uses for economic capital and stress testing purposes (Pillar II).",

Yet the impact of the war on ING's non-financial risk profile and on operational event losses continues to be limited, thanks to an extensive set of mitigating measures ING has taken since the start of the war.\n\nIn T\u00fcrkiye, the earthquake in February 2023 had a major impact on the nearly 600 ING employees and their families working and living in the affected area, especially in and around Kahramanmara\u015f. Tragically, five employees lost their lives in the disaster and four were injured. One local branch was destroyed and three seriously damaged. The operational centre was spared, and has served as a shelter for those employees and their families left homeless. The swift and coordinated response by local staff and our head office in Istanbul focused primarily on supplying aid for the local ING community, but also on retrieving assets from the affected branches. Despite serious disruption to local processes due to damaged infrastructure, the impact to the non-financial risk profile remained limited.\n\nPolitical and social developments in many societies around the globe have led to further polarisation and protests against governmental and public institutions, impacting the security risk profile of ING Bank and its employees. Various environmental activist groups, e.g. Extinction Rebellion, have protested at ING Bank head office buildings and local branches in the Netherlands, calling on ING to stop financing the fossil-fuel sector. To keep employees and clients safe, and ensure the continuation of business processes, security controls at ING locations around the world are frequently assessed.\n\n## Cybercrime and fraud\n\nThe further digitalisation of banking services, increasing electronic exchange of information via different consumer channels, use of and dependency on third-party vendors for services, and the implementation of PSD2 present ongoing cybercrime resilience, fraud management, and IT-security challenges for companies in general, and financial institutions in particular. Both the frequency and the intensity of attacks continue to increase on a global scale. They are becoming more sophisticated too, with the use of artificial intelligence, and the implications of ransomware attacks are a concern in the threat landscape.\n\nThe continuous enhancement of the control environment to protect from, and detect and respond to, ebanking fraud, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), targeted attacks, and more specific ransomware attacks is of ING's highest priority. Based on regular scenario analysis done in ING's first line of defence, additional tools and controls continue to be embedded in the organisation, as part of the overall internal control framework, and we are continuously reassessing these against existing and new threats, as well as the changing modus operandi.\n\nThe introduction of new products and evolving threats against those services, combined with developing technologies such as generative AI and deep fake, are continuously presenting short- and medium term fraud management challenges. Cybercriminals are becoming more resourceful in targeting financial and sensitive (payment/personal) data, such as customer user credentials outside the traditional banking environment. For example, criminals can obtain sensitive payment or personal data via social forums such as WhatsApp, dark web shops, by screen scraping user credentials, or through third-party data breaches.\n\nIn 2023, these challenges increased, with more sophisticated phishing attempts, improved socialengineering fraud attempts, and high volumes of scams through so-called authorised push-payment frauds. This increase in scams is a major concern for financial institutions, with often devastating consequences for customers. While financial institutions have limited means to prevent such authorised transactions, it is a priority to help prevent this type of fraud.\n\nWith legislation such as EBA PSD2, which requires payment service providers to establish a framework with appropriate mitigation measures and control mechanisms, and the continuing emphasis on duty of care, financial institutions are becoming increasingly responsible for losses incurred by clients. Institutions are also taking on more of the burden of reclaiming these losses. Developments as seen in the UK by regulatory changes as well as the upcoming PSD3 requirements, which amends and modernises PSD2, will impact banks more significantly in this area, dramatically increasing banks' exposure.\n\nIn addition, economic pressures in many of ING's operating countries could be a factor in pushing customers into fraudulent activity. We notice attempts, impact, and ING's increasing fraud losses in credit facilities, often carried out with forged documentation. ING continues to strengthen its fraud resilience by partnering with peers in the financial industry, as well as law-enforcement authorities and governments. We believe a collaborative approach with other industries is the only way to tackle fraud effectively. ING's global fraud management team brings together skilled fraud-management experts from various domains, and is responsible for making sure that ING's business and fraud strategy remains aligned on fraud threats, market best practices, applicable law and legislation, risk appetite and operational targets.\n\n## Data risk management\n\nData, whether customer, financial, risk or other business - is core to ING's purpose. Data leads to insights and insights empower people to stay a step ahead in life, and in business. In 2023, ING's Data Management team worked to speed up how quickly we execute our data strategy, to ensure data quality, keep data safe and secure, improve our data literacy, and simplify our data functions. This should enable and support steering to right actions regarding data, including personal data protection, data security, data quality and data ethics. Addressing emerging risks such as AI, most specifically generative AI, and societal concerns around the ethical handling of customer data, are top priorities for ING.",

It's an important element in our control framework for preventing and mitigating the risk of unauthorised access to IT systems, and the data processed and stored in these systems. This is done by enforcing IAM global processes and controls, which are periodically reviewed and tested. These processes and controls are supported by technologies, tooling, and practices managed by a dedicated IAM team in the Chief Information Security Office (CISO). The team focuses on identifying improvements to address developments both inside and outside ING. In 2023, ING continued the activities to improve in this area, with specific attention given to the further implementation of supporting tooling, the standardisation and harmonisation of processes and workflows, and automation of IAM controls. In 2023, ING identified areas for improvements, with specific attention given to the further implementation of supporting tooling, the standardisation and harmonisation of processes and workflows, and automation of IAM controls.\n\n## Operational resilience\n\nProviding safe, secure and seamless services is at the heart of ING's strategy. Preventing disruptions and ensuring a quick recovery from disruptions is an important element of that. In 2023, ING made further progress with implementing its operational resilience framework. As part of this implementation, we are mapping processes underlying our most critical business services. This includes the facilities, people, thirdand intragroup parties, data and technology that support those processes. These processes are then tested against severe but plausible scenarios in an effort to identify weaknesses. This helps ING identify opportunities to enhance its operational resilience. In addition, ING has started with the implementation of the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which aims to further strengthen the digital operational resilience of financial institutions.",

        "page_content": "- > Compliance risk\n\n## Compliance risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nCompliance risk is defined as a threat posed to ING's standing resulting from failure to act in line with applicable laws and regulations, internal rules (including ING's Orange Code and global Code of Conduct), and/or societal expectations that apply to the bank's services and activities. A failure to adequately mitigate compliance risk may lead to damage to ING's reputation and/or legal/regulatory sanctions and/or financial loss.\n\nThe mission of Compliance is to support ING in conducting its business activities in line with applicable laws and regulations, taking into account ING's internal code of conduct and societal expectations. Compliance wants to drive compliance risk management by desire and design throughout the organisation, unleashing the power of our data, risk expertise, and ING's workforce to keep the bank safe and sound, and help drive new and sustainable ways of doing business.\n\nWithin ING, compliance risks are defined as those risks that are within the scope of the ING Compliance Risk Catalogue. The following risk categories apply:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial crime risk refers to the risks of the bank's products and services being abused for illicit purpose generating or disguising financial and/or economic crimes (FEC).\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk refers to the compliance risks arising from potential or perceived misconduct by ING or its employees towards its customers, market integrity, business partners, employees, and other stakeholders including society at large.\n- \u00b7 Organisational risk refers to the compliance risks arising from actual, potential or perceived flaws in the way that ING is organised and structured including its regulatory and reporting framework.\n- \u00b7 Data protection (personal data protection, data retention) risk refers to the personal data protection risk of financial loss, (regulatory fines, reputational damage) due to not protecting the personal data rights of individuals as required, and as to data retention risk, to having the records being destroyed too soon or retained too long.\n\nESG-related compliance risks have been added as a new risk driver in the compliance risk catalogue. This is taking place in close collaboration with internal stakeholders to make sure that roles and responsibilities with regard to identifying, assessing, managing, and overseeing these risks are in line with ING's organisation globally.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Compliance organisation is part of ING's second line of defence, where Group Compliance sets the methodologies and minimum standards for the bank. Compliance for the business lines Wholesale Banking,\n\nand Retail Banking / Rest of World together with Compliance in the Market Leaders countries and functional lines in the countries along with relevant stakeholders from the first line of defence are responsible for the execution of these standards, within the risk appetite set.\n\nCompliance is tasked with instructing, advising, challenging and overseeing the first line of defence in how they manage risks that are within the scope of the ING Compliance Risk Catalogue. Compliance also has an active role in raising awareness (via training and communication), influencing and stimulating a sound compliance risk culture. The risks in scope of the Compliance Risk Catalogue are outlined in the ING Compliance Charter.\n\nCompliance is headed by the chief compliance officer (CCO), who reports directly to the CRO. The CCO has direct access to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. The CCO and the chairperson of the Risk Committee had regular bilateral consultations in 2023.\n\n## OneCompliance strategy\n\nAs a global bank in a fast-changing world we want to do the right thing to be safe, secure and compliant for our customers and for society. We achieve this by living up to our OneCompliance strategy.\n\nThe OneCompliance strategy is a multi-year, global compliance strategy based on the Compliance Risk Management Cycle, a framework that aims to help ING manage compliance risks consistently across the organisation. In 2023, we further strengthened the operations of the Compliance Risk Management Cycle. This resulted in improved processes around risk coverage and controls. At the same time in intuitive, actionable and insightful management information with a global dashboard in place to take smart decisions and keep oversight on both steering within risk appetite and on our global direction. As we operate in a dynamic and challenging environment, we are continuously learning and improving while reaching a more sustainable and mature level within the Compliance function.\n\n## Know your customer (KYC)\n\nKnow your customer and financial crime compliance continue to play a major role in making sure we only engage and do business with people and entities that meet regulatory requirements. Knowing who we do business with is vital to keeping ING safe, secure, and compliant. As part of our ongoing anti-money laundering efforts, we continuously assess relationships with customers, and monitor and screen transactions. It is our policy to review potentially unusual transactions and suspicious transactions and, where applicable, report these to the relevant authorities.\n\nWe are continuously working to further strengthen the KYC processes across the bank as and where required. This includes enhancing customer due diligence files and making structural improvements in frameworks, processes, and systems.",

In 2023, we continued substituting local technology with global technologies, completing the migration of transaction monitoring to the Global Transaction Monitoring tooling and taking further steps in enhancing use of the global screening application. We made further progress in migrating or moving KYC-related activities from local processing units to our dedicated operational hubs, which offer dedicated expertise and processing capabilities. In 2023, we further defined and refined the global way of working for the Customer Due Diligence (CDD), which enhances effectiveness and efficiency, and aim to implement this in all processing hubs and other ING locations.\n\n## KYC policy framework\n\nThe KYC policy and related control standards (the KYC policy framework) set the minimum requirements and control objectives for all ING entities to guard against involvement in financial crime activity. The framework reflects relevant national and international laws, regulations, guidance documents, and guidelines from national, European and international authorities, (supra)national risk assessments, and industry standards. The framework is updated regularly with subsequent implementations at global scale.\n\n## Knowledge and behaviour\n\nWe believe all our people play a role in protecting our customers, the bank, and society against financial crime and fraud. A sound risk culture requires us to act with integrity above all. We want to empower our workforce with the skills and knowledge they need to fight financial crime, and encourage them to speak up if they have concerns around managing financial crime risk.\n\nAs in previous years, we ran our (mandatory) training programme for KYC staff. This included continuing our partnership with the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS), to develop and provide tailored, certified training. The ACAMS training portfolio focuses on learning paths that provide professional foundational skills or advanced expertise in a range of topics, including customer due diligence, screening, transaction monitoring, and sanctions. New joiners at ING KYC departments complete a combination of ACAMS and ING internal courses aimed at ensuring their knowledge and skills are up to scratch. We updated our internal training programme following a yearly learning need analysis. In 2023, we included product-specific courses on top of the training focusing on strengthening the risk-management mindset.\n\nFor more on behavioural risk see 'Governance'.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\nFinancial crime risk management aims to ensure that new and relevant financial crime trends and insights as well as regulatory requirements are identified, tracked and actioned in a timely manner. In terms of\n\ngovernance, the bank's NFRC, chaired by ING's CRO, is the principal risk management forum where among others, financial crime risks are discussed. This committee reviews and escalates, where appropriate, key financial crime topics, threats and risks across ING to the Executive Board and Management Board Banking. On KYC, the Global KYC Committee, chaired by ING's COO, is mandated by the MBB to steer, prioritise and approve KYC-related topics undertaken across ING, and to oversee compliance with the relevant laws and regulations and internal rules related to KYC. The day-to-day responsibility for the oversight of ING's compliance with our legal and regulatory obligations, in relation to financial crime risks, sits with the global head of Financial Crime Compliance. This global head reports to ING's chief compliance officer, with oversight by the CRO.\n\nWe believe all our people have a key role to play in the fight against financial crime. Having a robust and sound risk culture embedded in our day-to-day way of working is a foundational element of our financial crime risk control environment. We define the accountabilities and responsibilities of our workforce in accordance with the three-lines-of-defence model, considering our business, geographical and functional structure.\n\nAs an organisation, we're committed to meeting our legal and regulatory requirements and the standards we also expect from ourselves. ING remains subject to (regulatory) investigations and scrutiny in certain jurisdictions, and we're committed to executing and implementing the identified enhancements required in our wider Enhancement Programme (EP) and our financial crime risk framework in a sustainable way for the longer-term.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nING strives to play its part in contributing to the safeguarding of the financial system against illicit financial activity, in the context of heightened and changing regulatory expectations, and as financial crime risks continue to evolve. To live up to our role as a global financial institution in combatting financial crime, we believe it is essential to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws and regulations, establish a reasonable and risk-based control framework to mitigate financial crime risk, and to seek to provide useful information to relevant government agencies. We also believe it is important to respond swiftly and proactively to new financial crime threats and techniques as well as relevant media reporting.\n\nTo mitigate financial crime risks, we apply a framework of preventative and detective systems and controls, underpinned by policy, procedures and related control standards across our global business in all locations where we operate. In 2023, we remained focused on maturing our Financial Economic Crime Controls in the context of the Enhancement Programme (EP) by continuing to strengthen our financial crime risk management framework and supporting sustainable remediation of known issues. At the same time, we acknowledged that the continuous maturing of the financial crime risk management framework, as well as other developments such as regulatory and legislative changes, continued to require our attention and",

Through robust oversight and challenge as the second line of defence, it is our goal to ensure that OE is demonstrably sustainable.\n\nIn line with ING's ambition to have a more data-driven, dynamic, and forward-looking systematic integrity risk analysis (SIRA), in 2023 the SIRA introduced enhancements to the existing process and piloted a proposed methodology. This will contribute to further enhanced insights into the financial crime integrity risks ING may be exposed to. These developments improve the risk identification, reporting quality, and management of these risks in accordance with our risk appetite across our global footprint.\n\n## Bribery and corruption\n\nBribery and corruption undermine business confidence and corporate integrity, hinders fair business competition, and harms international trade. ING takes these risks seriously: bribery and corruption risks are part of our non-financial risk framework and are in the design of our client and third-party due diligence, and monitoring measures in our financial crime risk management framework. We have continued to strengthen our ability to respond to bribery and corruption risks in key areas as part of our multi-year maturity programme. This supports our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, meeting the governance elements of our sustainability objectives.\n\n## Customer tax compliance\n\nCompliance with customer tax-related regulations and reporting, obligations, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), and Mandatory Disclosure Rules, aims to ensure that ING is not involved in facilitating tax-related financial crime, such as tax evasion or aggressive tax-avoidance schemes, on behalf of its customers. These obligations and customer tax integrity are of utmost importance to ING. In 2023, we continued to mature its control framework and to improve the quality of our reporting to tax authorities. We also remain proactive to legislative developments and aim at timely preparation for new reporting obligations, such as those introduced by the 2024 Central Electronic System of Payment Information (CESOP) regulation.\n\n## Sanctions\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 fundamentally changed the global political landscape. It sparked a worldwide response, with significant sanctions packages imposed against Russia and Belarus. In 2023, global sanctions regimes have been increasingly active, creating a complex regulatory and legislative environment. And an intensive focus on sanctions worldwide is expected to continue in coming years. This has also led to an increasing focus of the EU, US, and other governments on the potential circumvention of sanctions against Russia, and the roles of third countries and companies in facilitating any circumvention or undermining the sanctions' measures. Within the EU, there has been particular focus on the risk that some EU-based businesses may be seeking to circumvent sanctions by exporting illicit goods, such as computer products and electronics, to Russia via third countries. This has prompted a concerted effort by governments\n\nto impose pressure on companies operating in these jurisdictions, and to stop the sanctions measures from being sidestepped by targeted Russian parties.\n\nThe proliferation of sanctions has contributed to increased efforts in ensuring ING's control framework remains robust to mitigate against the bank's sanctions risks. This has included applying greater scrutiny to transactions alerted for heightened risk of non-compliance with applicable sanctions, as well as efforts aimed at ensuring employees and customers are aware of the sanctions and potential circumvention risks. Leveraging intelligence and internal data, work has also been completed to better understand the risks associated with the export of illicit goods from the EU to Russia via third countries, and ING's potential exposure to the threat scenario.\n\nING's policy generally prohibits relationships or transactions involving sanctioned persons and entities or comprehensively sanctioned countries, territories and their governments. It sometimes also means that ING's risk appetite may be stricter than legal obligations, and we may choose not to support certain customer relationships, business activities and transactions even if permitted by law. As a result of frequent evaluation of the business from economic, strategic and risk-based perspectives, ING, with limited exception, does not engage in business involving certain countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and the Crimea region. ING has a policy not to enter into new relationships with clients from these countries and processes are in place to discontinue existing relationships involving these countries.\n\n## Evolving financial crime landscape\n\nFinancial crime continues to evolve, whether through technology, new and sophisticated techniques used by serious and organised criminals, or the results of geopolitical events. The pandemic and associated social changes drove the unprecedented expansion of online and digital services. This in turn has prompted a surge in technological developments and cyber-enabled financial crime. This widespread digitalisation of the economy and artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to a reshaping of previously fixed ideas about methods used to launder and finance terrorism. Criminal groups have been quick to adopt and misuse new technologies, and are already harnessing the power of machine learning, AI, and anonymity-enhancing technologies, such as virtual currencies and mixers, to commit criminal activities. Such developments also enable criminal networks to become more agile, geographically interconnected and cohesive, using the new tools and techniques to circumvent enhanced AML frameworks.\n\nING takes these threats seriously and believes in responding proactively to such developments. We invest in new and innovative technological capabilities, and continue to enhance our cooperation with lawenforcement agencies, industry bodies and regulators, and to develop intelligence and data-led collaborative solutions to detect and disrupt financial crime. In this context, this may at times include sharing information within ING to manage our financial crime risk exposure, in line with General Data Protection Regulation requirements and local privacy laws and regulations.",

        "page_content": "- > Compliance risk\n\n## Crimes against society\n\nSociety's expectations with regard to financial institutions' accountability for safeguarding the integrity of the financial system have also created an increasingly demanding environment. ING recognises that financial crimes have an adverse impact on individuals, communities, and the environment where they occur. We are committed to conducting our global activities with integrity, and in line with our ethical and social responsibilities. Geopolitical events and economic instability have contributed to rising inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, leaving individuals and businesses vulnerable to criminal exploitation, such as trafficking and corruption.\n\nLabour and sexual exploitation remain the most common forms of human trafficking globally, and recent geopolitical events will also have an impact on the nature and scale of the human trafficking threat. The humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine has led to increased numbers of women with children being trafficked. Mostly refugees, they are at higher risk of exploitation. Looking ahead, it is possible that existing and future global events will lead to the migration of even more people. In 2023, knowledge on the financial crime risks posed to financial institutions by illegal migration and adult sexual exploitation were shared across ING through the KYC Academy's online learning channel. ING is also participating in the human trafficking working group being run by Europol's Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership.\n\nEnvironmental crime is among the most profitable criminal enterprises and covers a wide range of unlawful activities, including the illegal wildlife trade, the illegal extraction and trade of forestry and natural resources, illegal waste and illegal fisheries crime. As well as interface with other crime types, including corruption, trade-based fraud and human trafficking, there is also a convergence between environmental crime and ESG. In 2023, ING continued with our membership of the United for Wildlife Financial Taskforce, and with the United Nations working group on forestry crime, working with private, public and third sector partners to detect illegal crimes in the wildlife and forestry trade.\n\n## EU AML/CFT legislative package\n\nIn mid-2021, the European Commission (EC) adopted a package of legislative proposals aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules. Although the proposals are yet to be finalised, ING welcomes this harmonisation, which removes a degree of regulatory complexity. ING has actively participated in workstreams and analyses prepared by banking associations such as the Dutch Banking Association (NVB) and the European Banking Federations to assist us in assessing the potential impact of the AML legislative package on the bank.\n\nIn September 2022, the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) published its report 'From Recovery to Balance' on the use of risk-based approaches. Since then, ING has actively participated in roundtable workshops organised by the NVB, which resulted in the creation of multiple 'Industry Baselines' on topics such as enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures for European Commission (EC) high-risk third countries, and ongoing due diligence on certain customer types. ING is in favour of these new baselines. They are a necessary step towards\n\nfighting financial crime through the enhanced application of a risk-based approach (RBA): focusing efforts on higher risks, while remaining within the boundaries of the applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Public-private partnerships\n\nTo continue to be more effective in our effort to counter financial economic crime, we work closely with our peers, regulators and law enforcement. This collaboration is of importance to ING. It is most visible through our involvement in public private partnerships (PPPs) in our major markets, but also at an international level - through our Group-level participation in networks such as Europol's Financial Intelligence Public Private Partnership. We recognise that our controls and risk management frameworks benefit from having a direct dialogue with public partners as well as complementing our understanding of relevant and evolving financial crime threats and risks. Sharing and applying these insights across the organisation helps us move beyond technical compliance and enhances our ability to meet regulatory obligations and protect our customers.\n\nIn 2023, ING in the Netherlands continued working with the Financial Expertise Center and Fintell Alliance, consisting of Dutch government agencies and three peer banks. Focused on priorities set there, we also continued our involvement in Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL), where a consortium of Dutch banks work on developing combined transaction monitoring. Both initiatives increase our understanding of potential criminal modus operandi and money flows. Based on these insights, we can work more efficiently and enhance our control framework. ING continues to be a part of the Anti-Financial Crime Alliance in Germany.\n\n## Conduct compliance and ethics\n\nConduct compliance is the compliance risk that covers risks arising from potential or perceived misconduct by ING or its employees towards its customers, market integrity, business partners, employees, and other stakeholders. It includes customer protection and transparency (treating customers fairly), market conduct (including market manipulation), anti-competitive conduct, conflicts of interest and ethics. Ethics risk includes the Orange Code, Global Code of Conduct, as well as our whistleblower framework.\n\n## Treating customers fairly\n\nAs part of a further movement to align the global management of unfair customer treatment risk - already aligned for the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) products and based on local implementation for other products - we have launched an important enhancement by creating the customer centricity policy (CCP), which was approved in July 2023. By setting globally aligned standards based on the ING-aligned view on customer centricity, keeping the Orange Code and Global Code of Conduct in mind, we now have standard global norms and risk management across all jurisdictions, client segments and products. The level of customer protection is determined on the level of client sophistication and related risks, with the highest level of protection for retail customers.",

        "page_content": "- > Compliance risk\n\nWe aim to implement in 2024, when the global standards are tested against local legal requirements. We anticipate, despite the standardisation, significant local differences in implementation due to the absence of EU-wide aligned standards for some products, such as retail mortgages, while there will be more alignment in others, like financial instruments due to the MiFID. The changes also allow further simplification of governance with the client protection and product approval committee (CPAC) now expanding its responsibilities across all aspects of investments services, including advice/suitability.\n\nAlongside the internally focused changes, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) has been fully implemented. Further preparation is being done for activities relating to the EU retail investment strategy as proposed by the EC, through which feedback is being shared to both industry and regulatory bodies on, in our view, the best way to achieve the aim of the EC: an increased use of the EU Capital Markets by its inhabitants. In addition, the implementation of the changes to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) refit are ongoing.\n\nAn important area of focus is the management of compliance-related ESG risks. Greenwashing is a significant risk, related to different aspects and potential root causes - ranging from outings, strategic choices, or individual transactions. With the introduction of greenwashing prevention guidelines, based on ING standards, external events, as well as regulatory guidance, the organisation is enhancing the incorporation of greenwashing risk considerations in the way of doing business. Given that the greenwashing definitions and risk management practices, as well as the regulatory framework, is still in development we do expect significant changes going forward until market and society expectations are set. In addition, further effort is made to mature the role of Compliance alongside the other risk domains in relation to ESG risk management.\n\n## Market conduct\n\nMarket conduct risk stems from behaviour that can impact market integrity. As part of our work in 2022 to strengthen our market conduct framework, global procedures on maintaining information barriers, insider lists and communicating inside information were further improved across ING. In 2023, additional steps have been made towards automating, standardising, and centralising our approach to personal account dealing rules across the group. Furthermore, this year two new e-learnings have been designed on inside information and detecting suspicious orders and transactions, with one already rolled out to targeted employees.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nING, being a large financial institution, is prone to multiple conflicts of interest, due to overlapping interests of different stakeholders as businesses, employees, customers, shareholders, and society. ING has a policy that aims to help to identify, assess, manage and mitigate or prevent (potential) conflicts of interest. It maintains a global register of structural conflicts of interest with respective risk assessment and mitigating measures in place.\n\n## Anti-competitive conduct\n\nCompetition law impacts all areas of ING's business. It is ING's policy to adhere to laws and regulations that promote the functioning of markets and fair competition. In 2023, we revised the competition policy, including related framework documents. It is aligned with the EBA guidelines on internal governance, setting out principles on acceptable and unacceptable behaviours linked, in particular, to anti-trust practices. The updated policy will come into effect in 2024.\n\n## Whistleblower\n\nFurther enhancements and standardisation to the whistleblower process are being made with the aim of protecting the reporters of concerns, either through protection of identity, and/or by trying to prevent any form of retaliation taking place. A global speak up programme is in place to harmonise the speak up channels for undesirable behaviour. It aims to support reporters in choosing the appropriate channel, ensuring a consistent reporter journey with the same levels of protection. Insights collection across certain channels started to provide management anonymised oversight on the concerns raised, as well as measuring follow-up on concerns that are found to be substantiated. If required, we continue to share sanitised reports with the organisation to promote employees to speak up.\n\n## Data protection\n\nING is bound by European level and local data protection laws, which can differ from country to country. We have a group-wide personal data protection policy, which aims to enable a consistent approach to our way of processing personal data. This policy is implemented globally by all ING business entities and support functions. In addition, we have implemented binding corporate rules within ING Group with the aim of ensuring appropriate safeguards for our internal data transfers. Our approach can be summarised as 'the right people use the right data for the right purpose'.\n\n## Personal data\n\nIn line with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection requirements, we aim to process personal data for a specified business purpose in a fair and lawful manner, observing the rights and liberties of data subjects in scope of our activities. We aim to perform data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) and regular internal audits on the personal data processing that we do for clients and employees, including ING's technologies. Our staff is regularly trained on data protection, both globally and locally, through training and awareness initiatives, for both general and targeted audiences.\n\nWe strive to be transparent about what we do with the personal data of customers, employees, suppliers and business partners, who we share personal data with and why. Our business entities, support functions, as well as third parties that we engage with, must ensure that the data subject is granted a level of",

More information can be found in the privacy statement on our website (https://www.ing.com/Privacy-Statement.htm).\n\n## Data Protection Compliance department\n\nIn 2023, we established a new Data Protection Compliance department (DPC) within Group Compliance. This combined second-line-of defence data protection responsibilities - previously split between Legal and Compliance departments - into one team, leading to a solidified and empowered function. The Bank DPO leads this team, reports to the CCO and has direct management board access. The DPC model is replicated in ING's local entities. The DPC team advises, challenges, and monitors that ING fulfils its GDPR and other relevant obligations towards customers, employees, suppliers, and business partners with the aim of keeping and processing (personal) data in a safe, compliant, and ethical manner. In the first line of defence, a data protection executive is appointed who is accountable for data protection risk as well as the execution of our data protection policy and standards. This executive has ultimate responsibility for the processing of personal data in its ING entity and is supported by a data protection executive office.\n\n## Education\n\nIn 2023, to keep our staff informed and to increase awareness on compliance risks, we provided ING staff worldwide with mandatory trainings on financial crime, including tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance, culture and ethics and data protection.",

        "page_content": "- > Model risk\n\n## Model risk\n\n## Introduction\n\nModel risk is the risk that the financial or reputational position of ING is negatively impacted as a consequence of the use of models. Model risk can arise from errors in the development, implementation, use or interpretation of models, or from incomplete or wrong data etc., leading to inaccurate, noncompliant or misinterpreted model outputs.\n\nA model is defined as a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial or mathematical theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates or whose inputs are partially or wholly qualitative or based on expert judgement.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe head of Model Risk Management (MoRM) reports to the ING Group chief risk officer. The Model Risk Management Committee (MoRMC) is the dedicated authority within ING for model risk management. It is a committee designated by the MBB and is chaired by the ING Group chief risk officer and vice-chaired by the head of MoRM.\n\n## Model lines of defence\n\nING's model risk and control structure is based on the three-model-lines-of-defence (MLoD) approach. This approach aims to provide a sound governance framework for model risk management by defining and implementing three different management layers with distinct roles and oversight responsibilities.\n\nThe composition and main activities within the three model lines of defence (MLoD):\n\n- \u00b7 The first MLoD is composed of the model owners, model users, data management and model development, and is accountable for the implementation of model risk controls which encompass model development, implementation, and use of the models as well as monitoring of models' performance.\n- \u00b7 The second MLoD is composed of model validation and model risk oversight, which owns the model risk management framework, proposes the model risk appetite, provides challenge to model risk identification, and assessment and provides an independent validation of models used within ING.\n- \u00b7 The third MLoD is the internal audit, reviewing the quality of model risk management execution in all lines of defence and providing assurance over the first and second-line model risk management activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Model risk appetite (model RAS)\n\nThe model risk appetite is designed to determine the level of model risk ING is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives. Current model RAS metrics are focused on the most important models for ING: credit risk and other models with elevated supervisory attention. These metrics are reported to the MBB monthly.",

        "page_content": "- > Model risk\n\n## Model risk management (MoRM)\n\nThe MoRM policy framework comprises the total set of measures and tools put in place to manage model risk. To enable setting model risk management standards that are proportionate to a model's importance, ING classifies models based on their materiality and reputational risk. The classification determines the depth and extent of the applied model risk management activities, including model validation. Next to the generic MoRM policy framework, dedicated model validation procedures are in place. These set the validation standards for the key model types such as credit, market, liquidity, operational risk, IRRBB, KYC, and other model categories. These procedures are continuously being enhanced to keep up to date with regulatory, technical developments and industry trends.\n\nOn an aggregated level, model risk is monitored via analysis of data from the global model inventory, collected across the bank to manage ING model's landscape. Insights are reported to the MoRMC and MBB, so senior management can take well-informed decisions on acceptance or further mitigation of model risk.\n\n## Model lifecycle\n\nThe next figure provides a schematic overview of the model lifecycle, where orange represents the activities of the first MLoD, grey represents the second MLoD and light grey is the third MLoD. The objectives of the different processes are outlined below.\n\nInitiation or change : The initiation of the development of a new model or change in an existing model can be triggered by internal or external factors, such as business needs, regulation changes, new technologies, and/or model validation findings.\n\nData collection is the process of defining and collecting data that meets the requirements for model development. The process includes the definition of the data needed and assessment of data availability and data quality.\n\nModel development is a structured process that leads to a model that is consistent with the model owner requirements, bank policy and relevant regulation where applicable.\n\nPre-approval validation is an independent assessment to determine whether a newly developed or materially changed model is valid for its intended use. The approach to model validation is proportional to the model risk and potential model risk as reflected in the ING model risk classification.\n\nThe objective of the model approval stage is to ensure models are formally approved by the designated approval authority prior to deployment.\n\nDuring the implementation stage, the model is deployed in a production environment, after completion of required model testing and corresponding approval.\n\nIn the model use stage, the model is applied by the users for the specific purpose for which it was designed. The model may only be used after formal approval.\n\nThe objective of model monitoring is to determine if the model is performing as expected by regularly assessing model accuracy and/or predictive ability, considering internal or external developments that may influence model performance. Model performance monitoring begins when a model is deployed for use, and continues until the model has officially been decommissioned.\n\nPeriodic validation independently assesses, on a regular basis, whether a model is still valid for its intended use, taking into consideration any internal or external changes since the last validation. The frequency of periodic validation depends on the model risk, model type and applicable regulation.\n\nA model that is/will no longer be used must be decommissioned .\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is the risk inherent to strategy decisions, internal efficiency and the business environment. Business risk economic capital is calculated via the variancecovariance methodology for these risks. This covers the risk that volume/margins, net fee and commission income, operating expenses, and regulatory expenses/costs will deviate from the expected expenses and incomes over the horizon of the relevant activities.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nING applies an explicit risk appetite statement regarding business risk, focusing on earnings stability and diversification of the business mix. Diversification reduces the risk that volumes and/or margins will suddenly drop due to unexpected changes in the business environment for certain markets and products. In addition, the underlying risk types (expense risk, volume-margin risk, net fee and commission income risk, and regulatory costs) are mitigated and managed differently. Expense risk is monitored and managed via the financial performance of the bank and the local units. Through this process, the reported expense numbers are compared quarterly with the projected cost/income ratio. Deviations from this ambition are monitored as part of the financial projections discussed continuously within different parts of the organisation.",

(Naamloze vennootschap) is a company domiciled in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Commercial Register of Amsterdam, number 33231073. These Consolidated financial statements, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, comprise ING Groep N.V. (the Parent company) and its subsidiaries, together referred to as ING Group. ING Group is a global financial institution with a strong European base, offering a wide range of retail and wholesale banking services to customers in over 40 countries.\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2023, were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Executive Board on 4 March 2024. The Executive Board has the power to amend the financial statements as long as these are not adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The General Meeting of the Shareholders may decide not to adopt the financial statements, but may not amend these.\n\n## 1.2   Basis of preparation of the Consolidated financial statements\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the relevant articles of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nIFRS as adopted by the EU are IFRS Standards and IFRS Interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) with some limited modifications such as the temporary 'carve-out' from IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' (herein, referred to as IFRS).\n\nUnder the EU carve-out, ING Group applies fair value hedge accounting to portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging). For further information, reference is made to paragraph 1.5.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' of this note and to Note 36   Derivatives and hedge accounting.\n\nThe ING Group Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and there are no significant doubts about the ability of ING Group to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and rounded to the nearest million, unless stated otherwise. Amounts may not add up due to rounding.\n\n## 1.2.1   Presentation of Risk management disclosures\n\nTo improve transparency, reduce duplication and present related information in one place, certain disclosures of the nature and extent of risks related to financial instruments required by IFRS 7 'Financial instruments: Disclosures' are included in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report.\n\nThese disclosures are an integral part of ING Group Consolidated financial statements and are indicated in the 'Risk management' section by the symbol (*). Chapters, paragraphs, graphs or tables within the 'Risk management' section that are indicated with this symbol in the respective headings or table header are considered to be an integral part of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.3   Changes to accounting policies and presentation\n\nING Group has consistently applied its accounting policies to all periods presented in these Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2023, ING Group updated the presentation in Note 13 'Customer deposits' to improve consistency and comparability. Comparative figures for 2022 have been updated accordingly.",

        "page_content": "- > 1   Basis of preparation and material accounting policy information\n\n## 1.3.1   Changes in IFRS effective in 2023\n\nING Group had the following changes in accounting policies in the current reporting period:\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17, a new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements, became effective on 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts', which allowed diversity in accounting practices for insurance contracts. IFRS 17 includes an optional scope exclusion for loans with death waivers.\n\nING Group does not have an insurance business, but on a limited basis sells insurance products as a broker where it does not run the insurance risk, hence such contracts are not in scope of IFRS 17. However, ING Group has a portfolio of loans with death waivers in the Netherlands with a net carrying amount of EUR 743 million at 1 January 2023. While IFRS 4 allowed separation of such contracts into two components in the past (a loan in scope of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' measured at amortised cost and an insurance contract for the death waiver feature in scope of IFRS 4), IFRS 17 no longer allows such separation and requires such instruments to be accounted for in their entirety using either IFRS 9 or IFRS 17.\n\nING Group chooses to apply IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' to such loans with death waivers. As a result, this portfolio no longer meets the 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI) criterion. This causes the portfolio to be measured at fair value through profit or loss instead of amortised cost from 1 January 2023. This reclassification led to EUR -13 million impact on the opening total equity at 1 January 2023. Therefore, the financial impact of IFRS 17 on ING Group is limited.\n\n## Accounting treatment of non-financial guarantees\n\nING Group changed its accounting policy for non-financial guarantees that are subject to contractual indemnification rights (such as performance and other non-financial guarantees as well as letters of credit) from IAS 37 principles to loan commitment accounting under IFRS 9. The re-scoping was triggered by the introduction of IFRS 17 Insurance contracts and results in reliable and more relevant information, particularly when credit risk is elevated as IFRS 9 expected credit losses model captures that risk earlier than IAS 37. This voluntary policy change had a limited impact on ING's opening total equity of EUR -33 million.\n\n## Other changes in IFRS effective in 2023 (endorsed by the EU):\n\nThe following amendments to IFRS became effective in the current reporting period with no significant impact for ING:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements': Disclosure of Accounting Policies (issued in February 2021).\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors': Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued in February 2021).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes': Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising From a Single Transaction (issued in May 2021).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes': International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules. These amendments allow ING Group to scope out Pillar Two model rules from the deferred tax recognition and related disclosure requirements. More information on ING Group's exposure to Pillar Two model rules is included in Note 31 'Information on geographical areas'.\n\n## 1.3.2   Upcoming changes in IFRS after 2023\n\nThe following published amendments are not mandatory for 2023 and have not been early adopted by ING Group. The implementation of these amendments is expected to have no significant impact on ING Group's Consolidated financial statements when they become effective.\n\n## Effective in 2024 (endorsed by the EU):\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases': Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (issued in September 2022).\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements': Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (issued in January 2020).\n\n## Effective in 2024 (not yet endorsed by the EU):\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 7 'Statement of Cash flows' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures': Supplier Finance Arrangements (issued in May 2023).\n\n## Effective in 2025 (not yet endorsed by the EU):\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 21 'The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates': Lack of Exchangeability (issued in August 2023).\n\n## 1.4   Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements in the process of applying its accounting policies and to use estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and the amounts of the contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the balance sheet date, as well as reported income and expenses for the",

The actual outcome may differ from these estimates. The process of setting assumptions is subject to internal control procedures and approvals.\n\nING Group has identified areas that require management to make significant judgements and use critical accounting estimates and assumptions based on the information and financial data that may or may not change in future periods. These areas are:\n\n- \u00b7 Loan loss provisions (financial assets) (refer to Note 1.5.6 'Impairment of financial assets');\n- \u00b7 The determination of the fair values of financial assets and liabilities (refer to Note 1.5.3 for 'Fair values of financial assets and liabilities');\n- \u00b7 Investment in associate - assessment of additional impairment losses or reversal of previous impairment losses (refer to Note 1.10 'Investments in associates and joint ventures);\n- \u00b7 Provisions (refer to Note 1.15 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'); and\n- \u00b7 Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) (refer to Note 1.5.8 'Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)').\n\n## 1.5   Financial instruments\n\nING Group applies IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and the impairment of financial assets. ING Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' for hedge accounting purposes.\n\n## 1.5.1   Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments\n\n## Recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognised in the balance sheet when ING Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. For a regular way purchase or sale of a financial asset, trade date and settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where ING Group has transferred the rights to receive the cash flows from the financial asset or assumed an obligation to pass on the cash flows and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. If ING Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, it derecognises the financial asset if it no longer has control over the asset. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial asset that has been derecognised and the consideration received is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Recognition of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognised on the date that the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.5.2   Classification and measurement of financial instruments Financial assets\n\nING Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI, or through profit or loss); and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost (AC).\n\nAt initial recognition, ING Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets - Debt instruments\n\nThe classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows at initial recognition.\n\n## Business models\n\nBusiness models are classified as Hold to Collect (HtC), Hold to Collect and Sell (HtC&S) or Other depending on how a portfolio of financial instruments as a whole is managed. ING Group's business models are based on the existing management structure of the bank, and refined based on an analysis of how businesses are evaluated and reported, how their specific business risks are managed and on historic and expected future sales. Sales are permissible in a HtC business model when these are due to an increase in credit risk, take place close to the maturity date (where the proceeds from the sales approximate the collection of the remaining contractual cash flows), are insignificant in value (both individually and in aggregate) or are infrequent.\n\n## Contractual cash flows Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI)\n\nThe contractual cash flows of a financial asset are assessed to determine whether they represent SPPI.",

In addition, interest can include a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are SPPI.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, ING Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.\n\nBased on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows, there are three measurement categories into which ING Group classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised Cost (AC):\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows under a HtC business model where those cash flows represent SPPI are measured at AC. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n- \u00b7 FVOCI:\n\nDebt instruments that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets under a HtC&S business model, where the assets' cash flows represent SPPI, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are recognised in OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and presented in Investment income or Other net income, based on the specific characteristics of the business model. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the EIR method. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n- \u00b7 FVPL:\n\nDebt instruments that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. This includes debt instruments that are held-for-trading (presented separately as Trading assets) and all other debt instruments that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI (presented separately as Mandatorily at FVPL). ING Group may in some cases, on initial recognition, irrevocably designate a financial asset as classified and measured at FVPL. This is the case where doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting\n\nmismatch that would otherwise arise on assets measured at AC or FVOCI. Fair value movements on trading securities, trading loans and deposits (mainly reverse repo's) are presented fully within valuation result and net trading income, this also includes interest. The interest arising on financial assets designated as at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Interest income or Interest expense in the period in which it arises. The interest arising on a debt instrument that is part of a hedge relationship, but not subject to hedge accounting, is recognised in profit or loss and presented within Interest income or Interest expense in the period in which it arises.\n\nING Group reclassifies debt instruments if, and only if, its business model for managing those financial assets changes. Such changes in business models are expected to be very infrequent. There have been no reclassifications during the reporting period.\n\n## Financial assets - Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments are measured at fair value. ING Group applies the fair value through OCI option to investments which are considered strategic, consisting of investments that add value to ING Group's core banking activities.\n\nThere is no subsequent recycling of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of investments if elected to be classified and measured as FVOCI. However, the cumulative gain or loss is transferred within equity to retained earnings on derecognition of such equity instruments. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as Investment income when ING Group's right to receive payments is established. Impairment requirements are not applicable to equity investments classified and measured as FVOCI.\n\nOther remaining equity investments are measured at FVPL. All changes in the fair value are recognised in Valuation result and Net trading income in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at AC, except for financial guarantee contracts, derivatives and liabilities designated at FVPL. Financial liabilities classified and measured at FVPL are presented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in own credit risk of the liability designated at FVPL is presented in OCI. Upon derecognition this Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) impact does not recycle from OCI to profit or loss;",

Interest on financial liabilities at FVPL is also recognised in the valuation result, except for items voluntarily designated as FVPL for which interest is presented within 'Interest income (expense).\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires ING Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Such a contract is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently measured at the higher of (a) the amount determined in accordance with impairment provisions of IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' (see section 'Impairment of financial assets') and (b) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition principle of IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers'.\n\n## Repurchase transactions and reverse repurchase transactions\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos), securities lending and similar agreements continue to be recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The counterparty liability is measured at FVPL (designated) and included in Other financial liabilities at FVPL if the asset is measured at FVPL. Otherwise, the counterparty liability is included in Deposits from banks, Customer deposits, or Trading, as appropriate.\n\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), securities borrowings and similar agreements are not recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position. The consideration paid to purchase securities is recognised as Loans and advances to customers, Loans and advances to banks, Other financial assets at FVPL or Trading assets, as appropriate. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and amortised over the life of the agreement using the effective interest method for instruments that are not measured at FVPL.\n\n## 1.5.3   Fair values of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a material difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs, the entire day one difference (a 'Day One Profit or Loss') is deferred. ING Group defers the Day One Profit or Loss relating to financial instruments classified as Level 3 and financial instruments with material unobservable inputs into CVA which are not necessarily classified as Level 3. The deferred Day One Profit or Loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the life of the transaction until the transaction\n\nmatures, or until the significant unobservable inputs become observable, or until the significant unobservable inputs become non-significant. In all other cases, ING Group recognises the difference as a gain or loss at inception.\n\nSubsequently, except for financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, all the other financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It assumes that market participants would use and take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability when pricing the asset or liability. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on unadjusted quoted market prices where available. Such quoted market prices are primarily obtained from exchange prices for listed financial instruments. Where an exchange price is not available, quoted prices in an active market may be obtained from independent market vendors, brokers, or market makers. In general, positions are valued at the bid price for a long position and at the offer price for a short position or are valued at the price within the bidoffer spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. In some cases where positions are marked at mid-market prices, a fair value adjustment is calculated.\n\nFor certain financial assets and liabilities, quoted market prices are not available. For such instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. These range from discounting of cash flows to various valuation models, where relevant pricing factors including the market price of underlying reference instruments, market parameters (volatilities, correlations and credit ratings), and customer behaviour are taken into account. ING Group maximises the use of market observable inputs and minimises the use of unobservable inputs in determining the fair value. It can be subjective dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. All valuation techniques used are subject to internal review and approval. Most data used in these valuation techniques are validated on a daily basis when possible.\n\nWhen a group of financial assets and liabilities are managed on the basis of their net risk exposures, the fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities are measured on a net portfolio level.\n\nTo include credit risk in fair value, ING Group applies both Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVA, DVA, also known as Bilateral Valuation Adjustments or BVA). Own issued debt and structured notes that are designated at FVPL are adjusted for ING Group's own credit risk by means of a DVA. To include the funding risk, ING Group applies an additional 'Funding Valuation Adjustment' (FVA) to the uncollateralised derivatives based on the market price of funding liquidity.ING Group also applies to certain positions other valuation adjustments to arrive at the fair value: Bid-Offer adjustments, Model Risk Adjustments and Collateral Valuation Adjustments (CollVA).",

Selecting the most appropriate price requires judgement and could result in different estimates of fair value.\n- \u00b7 Valuation techniques are subjective in nature and significant judgement is involved in establishing fair values for certain financial assets and liabilities. Valuation techniques involve various assumptions regarding pricing factors. The use of different valuation techniques and assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of fair value.\n- \u00b7 Price testing is performed to assess whether the process of valuation has led to an appropriate fair value of the position and to minimise the potential risks of economic losses due to incorrect or misused models.\n- \u00b7 Assessing whether a market is active, and whether an input is observable and significant, requires judgement. ING Group categorises its financial instruments that are either measured in the statement of financial position at fair value or of which the fair value is disclosed, into a three-level hierarchy based on the observability and significance of the valuation inputs. The use of different approaches to assess whether a market is active, whether an input is observable, and whether an unobservable input is significant could produce different classification within the fair value hierarchy as well as potentially different deferral of the Day One Profit or Loss.\n- \u00b7 Reference is made to Note 35 'Fair value of assets and liabilities ' and to the 'Market risk' paragraph in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report for the basis of the determination of the fair value of financial instruments and related sensitivities.\n\n## 1.5.4   Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nIFRS 9 includes an accounting policy choice to defer the adoption of IFRS 9 hedge accounting and to continue with hedge accounting under IAS 39. ING Group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt IFRS 9 hedge accounting as of 1 January 2018. Furthermore, ING Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro fair value hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including market transactions and valuation techniques (such as discounted cash flow models and option pricing models), as appropriate. All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Fair value movements on derivatives are presented in\n\nprofit or loss in Valuation result and net trading income, except for derivatives in either a formal hedge relationship and so-called economic hedges that are not in a formal hedge accounting relationship where a component is presented separately in interest result in line with ING Group's risk management strategy.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from financial liabilities and other non-financial contracts and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if:\n\n- 1. the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract;\n- 2. a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and\n- 3. the combined instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in profit or loss.\n\nIf an embedded derivative is separated, the host contract is accounted for as a similar free-standing contract.\n\nThe method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. ING Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge), or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting is used for derivatives designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.\n\nAt the inception of the transaction, ING Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, its risk management objective, together with the methods selected to assess hedge effectiveness. ING Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, together with fair value adjustments to the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is, in the case of interest bearing instruments, amortised through the statement of profit or loss over the remaining term of the original hedge or recognised directly when the",

For non-interest bearing instruments, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is recognised in the statement of profit or loss only when the hedged item is derecognised.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in the Other Comprehensive Income are recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods in which the hedged item affects net result. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the Other Comprehensive Income at that time remains in the Other Comprehensive Income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in the Other Comprehensive Income is transferred immediately to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income and the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in the Other Comprehensive Income are included in the statement of profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed.\n\nIBOR Transition - specific policies for hedges directly affected by IBOR reform As explained in the 'IBOR Transition' paragraph of the 'Risk management' section, a fundamental review of important interest rates benchmarks has been carried out, and it is still in process for some of them (for instance, WIBOR).\n\nGiven that IBOR reform may have various accounting implications, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has undertaken a two-phase project. Phase 1 addresses those issues that affect financial reporting before the replacement of an existing benchmark. Phase 1 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2019. Phase 2 focuses on issues that may affect financial reporting when the existing benchmark rate is reformed or replaced. Phase 2 amendments to IFRS were issued by the IASB in 2020.\n\nPhase 1 amendments to IFRS allow ING Group to apply a set of temporary exceptions to continue hedge accounting even when there is uncertainty about contractual cash flows arising from the reform. Under\n\nthese temporary exceptions, interbank offered rates are assumed to continue unaltered for the purposes of hedge accounting until such time as the uncertainty is resolved.\n\nMore specifically, the following temporary reliefs are part of the Phase 1 amendments:\n\n- \u00b7 Highly probable requirement for cash flow hedges When determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n- \u00b7 Prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness When performing the prospective assessment it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of the reform.\n- \u00b7 Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness When performing the retrospective assessment hedges are allowed to pass the assessment even if actual results are outside the 80-125% range, during the period of uncertainty arising from the IBOR reform.\n\n\u00b7\n\nDesignation of a component of an item as a hedged item\n\nFor hedges of the benchmark component of interest rate risk affected by the reform, the separately\n\nidentifiable requirement only needs to be demonstrated at the inception of such hedging relationships\n\n(including macro hedges).\n\nThe amendments are relevant given that ING Group hedges and applies hedge accounting to benchmark interest rate exposure part of IBOR reform. ING Group hedges are being progressively amended, where necessary, to incorporate the new benchmark rates. Temporary exceptions under Phase 1 continued to be relevant for ING Group as at 31 December 2023 (mainly for WIBOR hedges).\n\nING Group will completely cease to apply the amendments when this uncertainty is no longer present or when the hedging relationship is discontinued. Refer to note 'Risk management/ IBOR Transition' for the disclosures relating to the application of the amendments as part of Phase 1 and for more information regarding the end of Phase 1 reliefs for ING Group's hedging relationships.\n\nPhase 2 amendments require that hedge accounting continues on transition to risk free rates provided that the modifications made to financial instruments are those necessary to implement the IBOR Reform and that the new basis for calculating cash flows is 'economically equivalent' to the previous basis. Particularly, Phase 2 amendments allow the continuation of hedging relationships, subject to amending their documentation to reflect changes in hedged instruments, hedging instruments, hedged risk, and/or the method for measuring effectiveness during the transition to the new benchmark rates. During 2023, Phase 2",

The changes can be in form of designating an alternative benchmark rate as a hedged risk, the description of the hedging instrument, the description of the hedged item, or the method to measure the effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 When the hedged item is amended as a consequence of the IBOR reform (or if the hedge has previously been discontinued), amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve are deemed to be based on the Risk-Free Rate (RFR). This results in the release of the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss in the same period or periods in which the hedged cash flows that are now based on the RFR affect profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 When the items within a designated group of hedged items are amended as a consequence of the IBOR reform, the hedging strategy remains and is not discontinued. As items within the hedged group transition at different times from IBORs to RFRs, they are transferred to sub-groups of instruments that reference RFRs as the hedged risk. The existing IBORs remain designated as the hedged risk for the other sub-group of hedged items, until they are also updated to reference the new RFR. The usual hedge accounting requirements are applied to the hedge relationship in its entirety.\n- \u00b7 For the assessment of retrospective hedge effectiveness, the cumulative fair value changes may be reset to zero when the exception to the retrospective assessment of the Phase 1 reliefs ends. This election is made separately for each hedging relationship (i.e., on a hedge-by-hedge basis).\n- \u00b7 Temporary relief from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement: a RFR is considered a separately identifiable risk component if it is reasonably expected to meet the separately identifiable requirement within 24 months from the date it is first designated as a non-contractually specified risk component (i.e. when the entity first designates the RFR as a non-contractually specified risk component). This relief applies to each RFR on a rate-by-rate basis.\n\n## Non-trading derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nDerivative instruments that are used by ING Group as part of its risk management strategies, but which do not qualify for hedge accounting under ING Group's accounting policies, are presented as non-trading derivatives. Non-trading derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in the fair value taken to the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 1.5.5   Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when ING Group has a current legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Offsetting is applied to certain derivatives for which the services of a central clearing house or broker are used.\n\n## 1.5.6   Impairment of financial assets\n\nAn Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model is applied to financial assets accounted for at AC or FVOCI such as loans, debt securities and lease receivables, as well as off-balance sheet items such as undrawn loan commitments, certain financial guarantees issued, and undrawn committed revolving credit facilities. Under the ECL model, ING Group calculates the expected credit losses (ECL) by considering on a discounted basis the cash shortfall it would incur in case of a default and multiplying the shortfall by the probability of a default occurring. The ECL is the sum of the probability-weighted outcomes. The ECL estimates are unbiased and include reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. ING Group's approach leverages the Advanced Internal Ratings Based (AIRB) models that are used for regulatory purposes. Adjustments are applied to make these models suitable for determining ECL. ECL is recognised on the balance sheet as loan loss provisions (LLP).\n\n## Three-stage approach\n\nFinancial assets are classified in one of the below three stages at each reporting date. A financial asset can move between stages during its lifetime. The stages are based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition and defined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1\n\nFinancial assets that have not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition (i.e. no Stage 2 or 3 triggers apply). Assets are classified as Stage 1 upon initial recognition (with the exception of purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets) and ECL is determined by the probability that a default occurs in the next 12 months (12 months ECL);\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 Financial assets showing a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. For assets in Stage 2 ECL reflects an estimate on the credit losses over the remaining maturity of the asset (lifetime ECL); or\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 Financial assets that are credit-impaired. Also for these assets ECL is determined over the remaining maturity of the asset.",

This is used to determine the appropriate ECL Stage for each financial asset.\n\nThe main determinate of SICR is a quantitative test, whereby the lifetime Probability of Default (PD) of an asset at each reporting date is compared against its lifetime PD determined at the date of initial recognition. If the delta is above pre-defined absolute or relative thresholds the item is considered to have experienced a SICR. Furthermore, any facility which shows an increase of 200% between the PD at the date of initial recognition and the lifetime PD at the reporting date (i.e. threefold increase in PD) must be classified as Stage 2. This is considered a backstop within the quantitative assessment of SICR. Refer to 'Criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk' in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report for more details on relative and absolute PD thresholds, including quantitative disclosures on those thresholds.\n\nConsequently, if the above quantitative SICR thresholds are exceeded, the item moves from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (unless the item is credit-impaired). In these instances, items are no longer assigned a 12-month ECL and instead are assigned a lifetime ECL. Items can return to Stage 1 if there is sufficient evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nING Group also relies on a number of qualitative indicators to identify and assess SICR. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Forbearance status;\n- \u00b7 Intensive care management;\n- \u00b7 Watch List status;\n- \u00b7 Collective SICR assessment;\n- \u00b7 Arrears status (including 30 days past due used as a backstop).\n- \u00b7 Substandard Internal rating; and\n\nAn asset that is in Stage 2 will move back to Stage 1 when none of the above criteria are in place anymore. However, if the asset was moved to Stage 2 based on the forbearance status, then the asset stays in Stage 2 for at least 24 months. If the asset was classified as Stage 2 due to 30 days past due trigger, then the asset is moved back to Stage 1 only after three months from when the trigger no longer applies.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets (Stage 3)\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for credit-impairment at each reporting date and more frequently when circumstances warrant further assessment. Evidence of credit-impairment includes arrears of over 90 days\n\non any material credit obligation, indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, a breach of contract, bankruptcy or distressed restructuring. The definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 (Stage 3) is aligned with the definition of default used by ING Group for internal risk management purposes, which is also the definition used for regulatory purposes.\n\nAn asset (other than a POCI asset) that is in Stage 3 will move back to Stage 2 when, as at the reporting date, it is no longer considered to be credit-impaired subject to certain probation periods. The asset will migrate back to Stage 1 when its credit risk at the reporting date is no longer considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios\n\nING Group has established a quarterly process whereby forward-looking macroeconomics scenarios and probability weightings are developed for the purpose of ECL. ING Group applies data predominantly from a leading service provider enriched with the internal ING Group view. A baseline, up-scenario and a downscenario are determined to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted ECL amount. As a baseline scenario, ING Group applies the market-neutral view combining consensus forecasts for economic variables such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, house prices, commodity prices, and short-term interest rates. Applying market consensus in the baseline scenario ensures unbiased estimates of the expected credit losses.\n\nThe alternative scenarios are based on observed forecast errors in the past, adjusted for the risks affecting the economy today and the forecast horizon. The probabilities assigned are based on the likelihoods of observing the three scenarios and are derived from confidence intervals on a probability distribution. The forecasts for the economic variables are adjusted on a quarterly basis.\n\n## The probability weights applied to each of the three scenarios\n\nING Group uses three macroeconomic scenarios when determining IFRS 9 ECL (baseline, upside and downside). Management approach used to determine the weights of each scenario and in selecting the parts of the distribution of forecast errors from which the weights are derived and disclosed in the 'Alternative scenarios and probability weights' and the sensitivity analysis in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nING Group applies a collective assessment method to measure ECL for Stage 1, Stage 2, and certain Stage 3 assets. Other credit-impaired assets subject to ECL measurement apply the individual assessment method.",

ECL is determined by, expressed simplistically, multiplying the probability of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), adjusted for the time value of money. Assets that are collectively assessed are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics, taking into account loan type, industry, geographic location, collateral type, past due status and other relevant factors. These characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being indicative of the debtors' ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated and the loss in case the debtor is not able to pay all amounts due.\n\nFor Stage 3 assets the PD equals 100% and the LGD and EAD represent a lifetime view of the losses based on characteristics of defaulted facilities.\n\nFor the purpose of ECL, ING Group's expected credit loss models (PD, LGD, EAD) used for regulatory purposes have been adjusted. These adjustments include removing embedded prudential conservatism (such as floors) and converted through-the-cycle estimates to point-in-time estimates. The models assess ECL on the basis of forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts and other inputs. For most financial assets, the expected life is limited to the remaining maturity. For overdrafts and certain revolving credit facilities, such as credit cards, the maturity is estimated based on historical data as these do not have a fixed term or repayment schedule.\n\n## Individually assessed assets (Stage 3)\n\nING Group estimates ECL for individually significant credit-impaired financial assets within Stage 3 on an individual basis. ECL for these Individually assessed assets are determined using the discounted expected future cash flow method. To determine expected future cash flows, one or more scenarios are used. Each scenario is analysed based on the probability of occurrence and includes forward looking information.\n\nIn determining the scenarios, all relevant factors impacting the future cash flows are taken into account. These include expected developments in credit quality, business and economic forecasts, and estimates of if/when recoveries will occur taking into account ING Group's restructuring/recovery strategy.\n\nThe best estimate of ECL is calculated as the weighted-average of the shortfall (gross carrying amount minus discounted expected future cash flow using the original EIR) per scenario, based on best estimates of expected future cash flows. Recoveries can arise from, among others, repayment of the loan, collateral recovery and the sale of the asset. Cash flows from collateral and other credit enhancements are included in the measurement of ECL of the related financial asset when it is part of or integral to the contractual terms of the financial asset and the credit enhancement is not recognised separately. For the individual\n\nassessment, with granular (company or asset-specific) scenarios, specific factors can have a larger impact on the future cash flows than macroeconomic factors.\n\nWhen a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest is no longer recognised based on the accrual income based on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Rather, interest income is calculated by applying the original EIR to the AC of the asset, which is the gross carrying amount less the related loan loss provision.\n\n## Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) assets\n\nPOCI assets are financial assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. Impairment on a POCI asset is determined based on lifetime ECL from initial recognition. POCI assets are recognised initially at an amount net of ECL and are measured at AC using a credit-adjusted effective interest rate. In subsequent periods any changes to the estimated lifetime ECL are recognised in profit or loss. Favourable changes are recognised as an impairment gain even if the lifetime ECL at the reporting date is lower than the estimated lifetime ECL at origination.\n\n## Write-off and debt forgiveness\n\nLoans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and/or collectability of amounts due. The following events can lead to a write-off:\n\n- \u00b7 After a restructuring has been completed and there is a high improbability of recovery of part of the remaining loan exposure (including partial debt forgiveness);\n- \u00b7 In a bankruptcy liquidation scenario;\n- \u00b7 Specific fraud cases with no recourse options.\n- \u00b7 After divestment or sale of a credit facility at a discount; and\n\nWhen a loan is uncollectable, it is written off against the related loan loss provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in 'Addition to loan loss provisions' in the Consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\nDebt forgiveness (or debt settlement) involves write-off but additionally involves the forgiveness of a legal obligation, in whole or in part. This means that ING Group forfeits the legal right to recover the debt. As a result, the financial asset needs to be derecognised.\n\n## Presentation of ECL\n\nECL for financial assets measured at AC are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt instruments at FVOCI, the ECL is recognised in OCI, instead of deducted the carrying amount of the asset. ECL also reflects any credit losses related to the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to",

The ECL on issued financial guarantee contracts, in scope of IFRS 9 and not measured at FVPL, are recognised as liabilities and presented in Other provisions. ECL are presented in profit or loss in Addition to loan loss provision.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nThe calculation of ECL requires a number of judgements and estimates. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 ING Group makes various assumptions about the risk of default, the credit loss rates in case of a default and expected future cash flows . For collective provisions, ING Group applies significant judgement when estimating modelled parameters such as PD, LGD and EAD, including the selection and calibration of relevant models. For Stage 3 individual provisioning, the determination and probabilities of restructuring and recovery scenarios as well as the amount and timing of expected future cash flows may be particularly subjective.\n- \u00b7 Forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios used in impairment assessments are uncertain in nature. The use of alternate forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios can produce significantly different estimates of ECL. This is demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report, where the un-weighted ECL under each of the three scenarios for some significant portfolios is disclosed.\n- \u00b7 When determining whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly (criteria for identifying a significant increase in credit risk) , ING Group considers reasonable and supportable information to compare the risk of default occurring at reporting date with the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition of the financial asset. Whilst judgement is required in applying a PD rating to each financial asset, there is significant judgement used in determining the Stage allocation PD banding thresholds. The process of comparing a financial asset's PD with the PD banding thresholds determines its ECL Stage. Assets in Stage 1 are allocated a 12-month ECL, and those in Stage 2 are allocated a lifetime ECL, and the difference is often significant. As such, the judgement made in assigning financial asset PDs and the PD banding thresholds constitute a significant judgement. Analysis of the sensitivity associated with the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is presented in the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Judgement is exercised in management's evaluation of whether there is objective evidence that exposures are credit-impaired .\n\n- \u00b7 To reflect the risks that are not properly captured by the ECL models, a number of management adjustments to the model-based ECL were necessary as at 31 December 2023, which required significant judgement. Reference is made to the 'Management adjustments applied this year' paragraph in the 'Risk management' section of the Annual Report.\n\n## 1.5.7   Modification of financial instruments\n\nIn certain circumstances ING Group grants borrowers postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments on a temporary period of time to maximise collection opportunities, and if possible, avoid default, foreclosure, or repossession. When such postponement, reduction of loan principal and/or interest payments is executed based on credit concerns it is also referred to as forbearance (refer to the 'Risk Management' section of the Annual Report for more details) and requires analysis on whether the contractual terms have been substantially modified or not. A similar assessment is needed when contractual terms are modified for other reasons than forbearance.\n\nING Group determines whether there has been a substantial modification using both quantitative and qualitative factors. If the modification results in a substantial modification of the terms of the loan, the original loan is derecognised and a new loan is recognised at fair value at the modification date. In case of a non-substantial modification, a modification gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.5.8   Accounting for Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)\n\nING Group participates in Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO III). ING Group considers TLTRO funding provided by the ECB to banks to be on market terms on the basis that the ECB has established a separate market with TLTRO programmes. They have specific terms which are different from other sources of funding available to banks, including those provided by the ECB. Consequently, the rate under TLTRO is considered to be a market conforming rate and TLTRO funding is recognised fully as a financial liability.\n\nING Group interprets the whole rate set by the ECB under TLTRO as a floating rate on the financial liability, being the market rate for each specific period in time. This results in discrete rates for discrete interest periods over the life of TLTRO. The change in the applicable rate between interest periods is seen as a change in the floating rate and is accounted for prospectively. Similarly, if the ECB announces changes in the rate for the amounts already drawn under the existing TLTRO, then such changes also represent a change in a floating rate. Following this, such changes lead to the recognition of an increased/decreased interest in the relevant period of life of the exposure, rather than by the recognition of an immediate",

If the change relates to the periods already passed, the impact for those past periods is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\nFurthermore, the change in the TLTRO rate driven by changes in expectations of meeting the targets impacts interest income. As a result, interest income which relates to the period that already passed until the moment when the change in expectations occurs, is recognised as a catch up adjustment in Consolidated statement of profit or loss. This change occurs only when ING Group has a reasonable expectation that the lending targets will be met.\n\nING Group views 'reasonable expectation' in case of TLTRO funding as a high hurdle. This is the moment when it becomes highly probable, i.e. the probability of meeting the lending targets is substantially greater than the probability that it will not. As a result, if interest income is recognised during the period based on the expectation of meeting the targets, there should only be a limited possibility that the interest may need to be reversed in future reporting periods. Reference is made to note 12 'Deposits from banks' and to note 20 'Net interest income' for the presentation of ING Group's participation in TLTRO programmes.\n\n## Significant judgements:\n\nSignificant management judgement is exercised in determining the accounting treatment of TLTRO transactions. In particular, ING Group applied judgement in:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing and concluding that in ING Group's view the rate under TLTRO is considered to be a market conforming rate and, hence, accounting for TLTRO in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 selecting accounting policies regarding the calculation of the effective interest rate under TLTRO.\n\n## 1.6   Consolidation\n\nING Group comprises ING Groep N.V. (the Parent Company), ING Bank N.V. and all other subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by ING Groep N.V. Control exists if ING Groep N.V. is exposed to or has rights to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through the power over the subsidiary.\n\nFor interests in structured entities, the existence of control requires judgement as these entities are designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. This judgement includes, for example, the involvement in the design of the structured entity, contractual arrangements that give rights to direct the structured entities relevant activities and commitment to ensure that the structured entity operates as designed.\n\nTransactions between ING Groep N.V. and its subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation. Reference is made to Note 44 'Principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures' for a list of principal subsidiaries and their statutory place of incorporation and a description of ING's activities involving structured entities is included in Note 45 'Structured entities'.\n\nA list containing the information referred to in Section 379 (1), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code has been filed with the office of the Commercial Register of Amsterdam, in accordance with Section 379 (5), Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nING Groep N.V. and its Dutch group companies are subject to legal restrictions regarding the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. The Dutch Civil Code contains the restriction that dividends can only be paid up to an amount equal to the excess of the company's own funds over the sum of the paid-up capital and reserves required by law. Certain Group companies are also subject to other restrictions in certain countries, in addition to the restrictions on the amount of funds that may be transferred in the form of dividends, or otherwise, to the parent company.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the restrictions in respect of minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries operate, other limitations exist in certain countries.\n\n## 1.7   Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a distinguishable component of ING Group, engaged in providing products or services, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Board of ING Group and the Management Board Banking (together the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM)) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance. A geographical area is a distinguishable component of ING Group engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that is subject to risks and returns that differ from those of segments operating in other economic environments.\n\nThe CODM reviews and assesses ING Group's performance primarily by line of business. As a result, ING identified five operating segments which are also disclosed as reportable segments. Additionally, the CODM receives information by geographical area based on the location of the office from which transactions are originated.",

As ING Group has a subsidiary in T\u00fcrkiye, ING Group has applied IAS 29 'Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies' to its operations since 2022 as if the economy in T\u00fcrkiye had always been hyperinflationary. Given that ING Group presents its results in EUR, comparatives do not get restated. As a result, 2021 comparatives were not impacted by IAS 29, while 2022 comparatives show the impact of the first-time application of IAS 29, as well as the effect for 2022. IAS 29 continued to be relevant for ING's operations in T\u00fcrkiye in 2023. Under IAS 29, the results of the operations in T\u00fcrkiye should be stated in terms of the current purchasing power at the reporting date. For that, the consumer price index (CPI) as determined by the Turkish Statistical Institute was used. The CPI for T\u00fcrkiye (2003=100) at 31 December 2023 was 1,859.38 and at 31 December 2022 was 1,128.45 (movement 2023: 64.77%; movement 2022: 64.27%). The effect of such restatement for inflation in the current period of the statement of comprehensive income and the balance sheet has been recognised in the statement of profit or loss within 'Other net income' as a 'Net monetary gain or loss'. The net monetary loss for the period represents the loss of purchasing power by the net monetary position (monetary assets exceeding monetary liabilities) of ING T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nAfter the application of the above restatement procedures in Turkish Lira under IAS 29, the financial position and the results for the period of ING T\u00fcrkiye are translated and presented in EUR at the exchange rate on 31 December 2023. For the statement of comprehensive income this is in contrast with the usual translation procedures where items of comprehensive income are translated at the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Furthermore, ING Group selected to present both the restatement effect resulting from restating ING Group's interest in the equity of ING T\u00fcrkiye as required by IAS 29, and the translation effect from translating at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate, in the Currency translation reserve.\n\n## 1.9   Foreign currency translation\n\nFunctional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of ING Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is ING Group's presentation currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Exchange rate differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as part of qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nExchange rate differences on non-monetary items, measured at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are retranslated at the date the fair value is determined. Exchange rate differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in other comprehensive income and get accumulated in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nExchange rate differences in the statement of profit or loss are generally included in 'Valuation results and net trading income'. Reference is made to Note 22 'Valuation results and net trading income', which discloses the amounts included in the statement of profit or loss. Exchange rate differences relating to the disposal of debt and FVPL equity securities are considered to be an inherent part of the capital gains and losses recognised in Investment income. As mentioned below, in Group companies relating to the disposals of group companies, any exchange rate difference deferred in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 'Result on disposal of group companies'. Reference is also made to Note 19 'Equity', which discloses the amounts included in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe results and financial positions of all group companies that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the statement of financial position;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). However, under hyperinflation accounting, income and expenses of ING T\u00fcrkiye are translated at the closing rate; and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange rate differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange rate differences arising from the translation of a monetary item that forms part of the net investment in a foreign operation, and of borrowings and other instruments designated as",

When a foreign operation is sold, the corresponding exchange rate differences are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 1.10   Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are all entities over which ING Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence is the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee. It generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or through situations including, but not limited to one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Representation on the board of directors;\n- \u00b7 Interchange of managerial personnel.\n- \u00b7 Participation in the policymaking process; and\n\nJoint ventures are entities over which ING Group has joint control.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\nING Group's investment in associates and joint ventures (net of any accumulated impairment loss) includes goodwill identified on acquisition. ING Group's share of its associates and joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition changes in reserves is recognised in equity. The cumulative post-acquisition changes are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When ING Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any long-term interests in the associate like uncollateralised loans that are neither planned nor likely to be settled in the foreseeable future, ING Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nUnrealised gains on transactions between ING Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of ING Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless they provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates\n\nand joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by ING Group.\n\nThe recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use, of the investment in associate and joint venture is determined when there is an indication of potential (reversal of) impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in associates and joint ventures is not tested separately for impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment. An impairment loss is subsequently reversed if there is indication of a reversal and there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount, but cannot exceed the original impairment loss.\n\nThe reporting dates of certain associates and joint ventures can differ from the reporting date of the Group, but by no more than three months.\n\n## Significant judgements and critical accounting estimates and assumptions:\n\nIdentification of impairment indicators as well as indicators of potential reversal of previous impairments of ING Group's investment in TMBThanachart Bank Public Company Limited (hereafter: TTB), an associate, requires significant judgement. When there is objective evidence of impairment or indicators that prior period impairment losses no longer exist or may have decreased, value in use (VIU) needs to be determined. Estimation of VIU involves significant estimates and management assumptions. Please refer to note 8 'Investments in associates and joint ventures'.\n\n## 1.11   Property and equipment\n\nProperty in own use\n\nLand and buildings held for own use are stated at fair value at the balance sheet date. Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life (in general 20-50 years). On disposal, the related revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings.\n\n## Equipment\n\nEquipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost of the assets is depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are generally as follows: for data processing equipment two to five years, and four to ten years for fixtures and fittings.",

Each lease payment is allocated between the repayment of the liability and finance cost. The finance costs are charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straightline basis.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs and restoration costs.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is included in the statement of financial position line-item 'Property and equipment', the lease liability is included in the statement of financial position line-item 'Other liabilities'. Refer to Note 9 'Property and equipment' and to Note 16 'Other liabilities'.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the right-of-use asset amortises using a straight-line method to the income statement over the life of the lease. The lease liability increases for the accrual of interest and decrease when payments are made. Any remeasurement of the lease liability due to a lease modification or other reassessment results in a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\n\n## 1.12   ING Group as lessor\n\nWhen ING Group acts as a lessor, a distinction should be made between finance leases and operating leases. For ING Group as a lessor these are mainly finance leases and are therefore not included in 'Property and equipment'. Instead, the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a receivable under Loans and advances to customers or Loans and advances to banks. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is unearned finance lease income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax), which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.\n\n## 1.13   Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nImpairment of goodwill and other non-financial assets\n\nING Group assesses at each reporting period, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. Irrespective of whether there is an indication of impairment, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill acquired in a business combination, and intangible assets not yet available for use, are tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) for the purpose of impairment testing. These groups of CGUs represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the group of CGUs to the recoverable amount of that group of CGUs. Impairment of goodwill, if applicable, is included in the statement of profit or loss in Other operating expenses and is not subsequently reversed.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software that has been purchased or generated internally for own use is stated at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over its useful life which generally does not exceed five years. Amortisation is included in Other operating expenses.\n\n## 1.14   Taxation\n\nIncome tax on the result for the year consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the",

Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided for temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by ING Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The tax effects of income tax losses available for carry forward are recognised as an asset where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nFair value remeasurements of debt and equity instruments measured at FVOCI and cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity. Deferred tax related to this fair value remeasurement is also recognised directly in equity and is subsequently recognised in the statement of profit or loss together with the deferred gain or loss.\n\n## 1.15   Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is a present obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, however the timing or the amount is uncertain. Provisions are discounted when the effect of the time value of money is significant using a pre-tax discount rate.\n\nReorganisation provisions include employee termination benefits when ING Group is demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.\n\nA liability is recognised for a levy when the activity that triggers payment, as identified by the relevant legislation, occurs. For a levy that is triggered upon reaching a minimum threshold, the liability is recognised only upon reaching the specified minimum threshold.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ING Group; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because it is either not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position, but are rather disclosed in the notes unless the possibility of the outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of ING Group. Contingent assets are recognised in the statement of financial position only when realisation of the income that arises from such an asset is virtually certain. Contingent assets are disclosed in the notes when an inflow of economic benefits is probable.",

With or without reference to the above, ING Group may also offer compensation to certain of its customers. Judgement is required to assess whether a present obligation exists and to estimate the probability of an unfavourable outcome and the amount of potential loss. The degree of uncertainty and the method of making the accounting estimate depends on the individual case, its nature and complexity. Such cases are usually one of a kind. For the assessment of related provisions ING Group consults with internal and external legal experts. Even taking into consideration legal experts' advice, the probability of an outflow of economic benefits can still be uncertain and the provision recognised can remain sensitive to the assumptions used. Reference is made to Note 15 'Provisions'. For proceedings where it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the expected financial effect, that could result from the ultimate resolution of the proceedings, no provision is recognised, however disclosure is included in the financial statements, where relevant. Reference is made to Note 42 'Legal proceedings'.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and assumptions for the reorganisation provision are in estimating the amounts and timing of cash flows as the announced transformation initiatives are implemented over a period of several years. Reference is made to Note 15 'Provisions'.\n\n## 1.16   Irrevocable Payment Commitments on contributions to SRF and DGS\n\nING makes contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and Deposit Guarantee Schemes (DGS). The annual contributions are paid in cash or, in some cases, partly using Irrevocable Payment Commitments (IPCs) that become payable if and when called. Cash contributions are accounted for as levies as described in section 1.15 above while IPCs are disclosed as contingent liabilities in Note 41 'Contingent liabilities and commitments'. Cash collateral posted on IPCs to the SRF is accounted for as an interest bearing financial asset at amortised cost. Government bonds posted as collateral on IPCs to DGS continue to be recognised as assets of ING as securities at amortised cost.\n\n## 1.17   Other liabilities\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe net defined benefit asset or liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Changes in plan assets include mainly:\n\n- \u00b7 Return on plan assets are recognised as staff costs in the statement of profit or loss. It is determined using a high quality corporate bond rate (identical to the discount rate used in determining the defined benefit obligation) at the start of the reporting period; and\n- \u00b7 Remeasurements which are recognised in Other comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated by internal and external independent qualified actuaries through actuarial models and calculations using the projected unit credit method. This method considers expected future payments required to settle the obligation resulting from employee service in the current and prior periods, discounted using a high quality corporate bond rate. Inherent in these actuarial models are assumptions including discount rates, rates of increase in future salary and benefit levels, mortality rates, consumer price index and the expected level of indexation. The assumptions are based on available market data as well as management expectations and are updated regularly.\n\n## Changes in the defined benefit obligation include mainly:\n\n- \u00b7 Service cost which is recognised as staff costs in the statement of profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 Interest expenses are recognised as staff costs in the Statement of profit or loss. It is determined using a high quality corporate bond rate at the start of the period;\n- \u00b7 Remeasurements which are recognised in Other comprehensive income (equity) and not recycled to the Statement of profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 Any past service cost relating to a plan amendment is recognised in profit or loss in the period of the plan amendment; and\n- \u00b7 Gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the Statement of profit or loss when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe recognition of a net defined benefit asset in the Consolidated statement of financial position is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, ING Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension",

ING Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as staff expenses in the profit or loss when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.\n\n## Other post-employment obligations\n\nSome group companies provide other post-employment benefits to former employees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## 1.18   Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares (own equity instruments bought back by ING Group or its subsidiaries) are deducted from Equity (Other reserves). No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when purchasing, selling or cancelling these shares. Treasury shares are not taken into account when calculating earnings per ordinary share or dividend per ordinary share as they are not considered to be outstanding.\n\nTreasury shares can be purchased by ING as part of a share buyback programme. If a share buyback is executed by a broker and the agreement with the broker is irrevocable, ING has a contractual obligation to purchase its own shares that is unavoidable once it signs the agreement with the broker. This is the moment when ING recognises a financial liability measured at the present value of the redemption amount with a corresponding reduction in equity (Retained earnings). During the share buyback programme, ING settles this liability for the actual purchase price paid for the shares bought on a daily basis. Actual shares bought back and held by ING are presented as Treasury shares within Other reserves in equity.\n\n## 1.19   Income recognition\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the statement of profit or loss using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, ING Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses.\n\nThe calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.\n\nInterest results on instruments classified at Amortised Cost, assets measured at FVOCI and derivatives in a formal hedge accounting relationship is presented in 'Interest income (expense) using effective interest rate method'. Interest result on financial assets and liabilities voluntarily designated as at FVPL and derivatives in so called economic hedges and instruments designated at fair value are presented in 'Other interest income (expense)'. Interest result on all other financial assets and liabilities at FVTPL is recognised in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\n## Fees and commissions\n\nFees and commissions are generally recognised as the service is provided. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred (together with related direct costs) and recognised as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the loan. Loan syndication fees are recognised as income when the performance obligation has been satisfied based on the particular contract and ING Group has retained no part of the loan package for itself or has retained a part at the same effective interest rate as the other participants. Commission and fees arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of, a transaction for a third party - such as the arrangement of the acquisition of shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses - are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction. Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised based on the applicable service contracts as the service is provided. Asset management fees related to investment funds and investment contract fees are recognised on a pro-rata basis over the period the service is provided. The same principle is applied for wealth management, financial planning and custody services that are continuously provided over an extended period of time. Fees received and paid between banks for payment services are classified as commission income and expenses.\n\n## Lease income\n\nThe proceeds from leasing out assets under operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease agreement. Lease payments received in respect of finance leases when ING Group is the lessor are divided into an interest component (recognised as interest income) and a repayment component based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease.",

        "page_content": "- > 1   Basis of preparation and material accounting policy information\n\n## 1.20   Expense recognition\n\nExpenses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as incurred or when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase in a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. Fee and commission expenses are generally a result from a contract with ING service providers in order to perform the service for ING Group's customers. Costs are generally presented as 'Commission expenses' if they are specific, incremental, directly attributable and identifiable to generate commission income.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nING Group only engages in share-based payment transactions with its staff and directors. Share-based payment expenses are recognised as a staff expense over the vesting period. A corresponding increase in equity is recognised for equity-settled share-based payment transactions. A liability is recognised for cashsettled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at the grant date, and the fair value of cash-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at each balance sheet date. Rights granted will remain valid until the expiry date, even if the share based payment scheme is discontinued. The rights are subject to certain conditions, including a pre-determined continuous period of service.\n\n## 1.21   Earnings per ordinary share\n\nEarnings per ordinary share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. In calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding:\n\n- \u00b7 Own shares held by group companies are deducted from the total number of ordinary shares in issue;\n- \u00b7 In case of exercised warrants, the exercise date is taken into consideration.\n- \u00b7 The computation is based on daily averages; and\n\nDiluted earnings per share data are computed as if all convertible instruments outstanding at year-end were exercised at the beginning of the period. It is also assumed that ING Group uses the assumed proceeds thus received to buy its own shares against the average market price in the financial year. The net increase in the number of shares resulting from the exercise is added to the average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share.\n\n## 1.22   Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method, distinguishing cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In the net cash flow from operating activities, the result before tax is adjusted for those items in the statement of profit or loss and changes in items per the statement of financial position, which do not result in actual cash flows during the year.\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, Cash and cash equivalents include deposits from banks and loans and advances to banks that are on demand. Furthermore, it includes treasury bills and other eligible bills shorter than three months. Investments qualify as a cash equivalent if they are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nCash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.\n\nThe net cash flow shown in respect of Loans and advances to customers relates only to transactions involving actual payments or receipts. The Addition to loan loss provision which is deducted from the item Loans and advances to customers in the statement of financial position has been adjusted accordingly from the result before tax and is shown separately in the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe difference between the Net cash flow in accordance with the statement of cash flows and the change between the opening and closing balance of Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position is due to exchange rate differences and is presented separately in the cash flow statement.\n\nLiabilities arising from financing activities are debt securities, lease liabilities and subordinated loans.\n\n## 1.23   Parent company accounts\n\nThe parent company accounts of ING Groep N.V. are prepared in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with subsection 8 of section 362, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, the recognition and measurement principles applied in the Parent company accounts are the same as those applied in the Consolidated financial statements.",

At ING, these types of transactions are recognised in several lines in the statement of financial position depending on business model assessment and counterparty. Furthermore, for repurchase agreements the gross amount of assets must be considered together with the gross amount of related liabilities, which are presented separately on the statement of financial position since IFRS does not always allow netting of these positions in the statement of financial position.\n\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), securities borrowings and similar agreements are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as the counterparty continues to be exposed to substantially all risks and rewards of the transferred security. Based on the business model assessment and counterparty, the consideration paid to purchase securities is recognised as Loans and advances to customers, Loans and advances to banks, financial assets mandatorily at FVPL or Trading assets.\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos), securities lending and similar agreements continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as ING Group continues to be exposed to substantially all risks and rewards of the transferred financial asset. The counterparty liability is designated and measured at FVPL if the asset is measured at FVPL. Otherwise, the counterparty liability is included in Deposits from banks, Customer deposits or Trading.",

Furthermore in 2023, changes in unrealised revaluations of equity securities are mainly related to the revaluation of the stake in Bank of Beijing of EUR 77 million following changes in share price (31 December 2022: EUR -49 million).\n\nIn 2022, disposals of EUR 492 million mainly relate to the sale in the second quarter of HQLA eligible equity instruments triggered by the changing interest rate environment and deteriorating market sentiment. This portfolio was built up in early 2021 (additions in 2021: EUR 499 million) and was a relatively small part of the HQLA portfolio. This was a diversified buy-and-hold portfolio aimed at generating stable dividend income stream.\n\n## FVOCI debt instruments\n\nIn 2022, interest rates in both short and longer tenors increased significantly which resulted in changes in unrealised revaluations of debt securities of EUR -3,230 million. During 2023 interest rates decreased resulting in unrealised revaluations of EUR 657 million.\n\nReference is made to Note 6 'Debt securities' for details on ING Group's total exposure to debt securities.\n\n## 6   Debt securities\n\nING Group's exposure to debt securities is included in the following lines in the statement of financial position:\n\n| in EUR million                                                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income                    | 38,281 | 29,095 |\n| Debt securities at amortised cost                                                   | 48,313 | 48,160 |\n| Debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income and amortised cost | 86,594 | 77,255 |\n| Trading assets                                                                      | 6,907  | 4,189  |\n| Debt securities at fair value through profit or loss                                | 5,363  | 6,258  |\n| Total debt securities at fair value through profit or loss                          | 12,270 | 10,447 |\n|                                                                                     | 98,864 | 87,703 |\n\nING Group's total exposure to debt securities (excluding debt securities held in the trading portfolio) of EUR 91,957 million (31 December 2022: EUR 83,513 million) is specified as follows:\n\n## Debt securities by type of exposure\n\n|                                             | Debt Securities  at  FVPL   | Debt Securities  at  FVPL   | Debt Securities at  FVOCI   | Debt Securities at  FVOCI   | Debt Securities at  AC   | Debt Securities at  AC   |        |        |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in EUR million                              | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Government bonds                            | 362                         | 63                          | 20,988                      | 16,016                      | 24,050                   | 24,629                   | 45,400 | 40,708 |\n| Central bank bonds  1                       | 446                         | 307                         |                             |                             | 2,043                    | 2,331                    | 2,489  | 2,638  |\n| Sub-sovereign, Supranationals  and Agencies | 1,354                       | 2,343                       | 11,587                      | 8,529                       | 14,639                   | 14,210                   | 27,580 | 25,082 |\n| Covered bonds                               |                             |                             | 4,084                       | 2,663                       | 5,231                    | 5,543                    | 9,315  | 8,206  |\n| Corporate bonds                             | 799                         | 857                         | 127                         | 108                         | 109                      | 26                       | 1,035  | 991    |\n| Financial institutions' bonds               | 1,645                       | 1,931                       | 483                         | 772                         | 186                      | 220                      | 2,314  | 2,923  |\n| ABS portfolio                               | 758                         | 758                         | 1,025                       | 1,028                       | 2,077                    | 1,217                    | 3,860  | 3,003  |\n|                                             | 5,363                       | 6,258                       | 38,293                      | 29,116                      |                          | 48,335     48,177        | 91,991 | 83,551 |\n| Loan loss provisions                        |                             |                             | -13                         | -21                         | -22                      | -17                      | -34    | -39    |\n| Debt securities portfolio                   | 5,363                       | 6,258                       | 38,281                      | 29,095                      |                          | 48,313     48,160        | 91,957 | 83,513 |\n\n- 1 In 2023 Central bank bonds have been included as a separate type of exposure.

The key assumptions used in the calculation of the recoverable amounts are included in the table above. Furthermore, ING Group tests goodwill whenever a triggering event is identified.\n\nAt the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the CGUs as at 31 December 2023 and therefore no impairment is required (31 December 2022: EUR 32 million for T\u00fcrkiye CGU).\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn line with IFRS, the recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and Value in Use (VIU). The VIU calculation is based on a Dividend Discount model using three year management approved plans, updated for expected changes in the macroeconomic environment. When estimating the VIU of a CGU, local conditions and requirements determine the capital requirements, discount rates, and terminal growth rates. These local conditions and requirements determine the ability to upstream excess capital and profits to ING Group. The discount rate calculation includes other inputs such as equity market premium, country risk premium, and long term inflation which are based on market sources and management's judgement. The long term growth rate is based on the long term inflation rate obtained from market sources. The impacts of climate risk are included to the extent that they are observable in discount rates and assets prices.\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions\n\nKey assumptions in the goodwill impairment test model are the projected locally available cash flows (based on local capital requirements and projected profits), discount rates (cost of equity), and long-term growth rates.",

        "page_content": "- > 11  Other assets\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the CGUs are sensitive to the above key assumptions. A decrease in the available cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate of 1 percent point or a reduction of future growth rate to zero are considered reasonably possible changes in key assumptions. If the aforementioned changes occur to one of the above key assumptions holding the other key assumptions constant, goodwill of the remaining CGUs will continue to be recoverable.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware includes internally developed software amounting to EUR 628 million (2022: EUR 540 million).\n\nSoftware is reviewed for indicators of impairment. Irrespective of whether there is an indication of impairment, software under development is tested annually for impairment. In 2023, individually immaterial items were impaired for an amount of EUR 5 million (31 December 2022: 22 million).\n\n## 11   Other assets\n\n## Other assets by type\n\n| in EUR million                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net defined benefit assets                          | 554    | 617    |\n| Investment properties                               | 14     | 18     |\n| Property development and obtained from foreclosures | 32     | 34     |\n| Prepayments                                         | 438    | 366    |\n| Accrued assets                                      | 523    | 551    |\n| Amounts to be settled                               | 3,869  | 5,191  |\n| Other                                               | 1,687  | 2,073  |\n|                                                     | 7,117  | 8,850  |\n\nDisclosures in respect of Net defined benefit assets are provided in Note 33 'Pensions and other postemployment benefits'.\n\nAmounts to be settled include primarily transactions not settled at the balance sheet date.

The amounts included are based on best estimates with regard to amounts and timing of cash flows required to settle the obligation.\n\n## Reorganisation provisions\n\nIn 2023, the additions to the reorganisation provisions mainly relate to restructuring activities in Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands. The additions in 2022 mainly relate to the discontinuation of retail banking activities in France and the restructuring of the branch network and retail advice organisation in the Netherlands, as well as to restructuring activities in Belgium.\n\nThese initiatives are implemented over a period of several years and the estimate of the reorganisation provisions is inherently uncertain.\n\n## Litigation provisions\n\nReference is made to Note 42 'Legal proceedings' for developments in litigation provisions.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nIn 2023 ING Group voluntarily changed its accounting policy for non-financial guarantees that are subject to contractual indemnification rights from IAS 37 principles to loan commitment accounting under IFRS 9. The change from IAS 37 to IFRS 9 resulted in derecognition of the existing IAS 37 provision of EUR 109 million as per 1 January 2023 and recognition of a provision for Expected credit losses of EUR 151 million for nonfinancial guarantees as per 1 January 2023 (EUR 42 million pre-tax impact on Equity at the beginning of 2023). This change is included in Other changes in the movement table.\n\nFor details and changes on loan loss provisioning, refer to 'Risk management - Credit risk' paragraph 'Loan loss provisioning'. For details on the IFRS change, refer to Note 1.3.1 'Changes in IFRS effective in 2023'.\n\nIn 2022, the additions and releases include EUR 138 million and EUR 141 million respectively related to IAS 37 off balance facilities that in 2023 are included in IFRS 9 loan loss provisions.\n\nThe additions to the Other provisions in 2022 include EUR 75 million which relates to the provision for the compensation of Dutch retail customers for past interest charges that did not sufficiently track market rates and largely reflects the impact of interest-on-interest compensation. This is in addition to the provision of EUR 180 million recognised in 2021.",

ING Groep N.V. is legally required to create a non-distributable reserve insofar as profits of its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are subject to dividend payment restrictions which apply to those subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures themselves.\n\nNon distributable reserves, determined in accordance with the financial reporting requirements included in Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, from ING Group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are as follows:\n\n| Non-distributable reserves   |       |       |       |\n|------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| In EUR million               | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n| ING Bank                     | 6,727 | 8,408 | 8,205 |\n| Other                        | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n| Non-distributable reserves   | 6,727 | 8,408 | 8,205 |\n\nIn addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions on distributing dividends from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to ING Groep N.V. there are various other considerations and limitations that are taken into account in determining the appropriate levels of equity in the Group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. These considerations and limitations include, but are not restricted to, minimum capital requirements that are imposed by industry regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate, or other limitations which may exist in certain countries and may or may not be temporary in nature. It is not possible to disclose a reliable quantification of these limitations. Without prejudice to the authority of the Executive Board to allocate profits to reserves and to the fact that the ordinary shares are the most junior securities issued by ING Groep N.V., no specific dividend payment restrictions with respect to ordinary shares exist. Refer to Note 47 'Capital management' for further details of the minimal capital requirements and dividend policy of ING Group.\n\nFurthermore, ING Groep N.V. is subject to legal restrictions with respect to repayment of capital to holders of ordinary shares. Pursuant to the Dutch Civil Code, capital may only be repaid if none of ING Groep N.V.'s creditors opposes such a repayment within two months following the announcement of a resolution to that effect.\n\n## Cumulative preference shares (not issued)\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association of ING Groep N.V. the authorised cumulative preference share capital consists of 4.6 billion cumulative preference shares, of which none have been issued. The par value of these cumulative preference shares is EUR 0.01. A right to acquire cumulative preference shares has been granted to Stichting Continu\u00efteit ING (ING Continuity Foundation).\n\nThe cumulative preference shares rank before the ordinary shares in entitlement to dividend and to distributions upon liquidation of ING Groep N.V.\n\nThe dividend on the cumulative preference shares will be equal to a percentage, calculated on the amount compulsorily paid up or yet to be paid up. This percentage shall be equal to the average of the euro shortterm rate (\u20acSTR) as calculated by the European Central Bank during the financial year for which the distribution is made; this percentage being weighted on the basis of the number of days for which it applies, and increased by 2.585 percentage points.\n\nIf, and to the extent that the profit available for distribution is not sufficient to pay the dividend referred to above in full, the shortfall will be made up from the reserves insofar as possible. If, and to the extent that, the dividend distribution cannot be made from the reserves, the profits earned in subsequent years shall first be used to make up the shortfall before any distribution may be made on shares of any other category.\n\nING Groep N.V.'s Articles of Association make provision for the cancellation of cumulative preference shares. Upon cancellation of cumulative preference shares and upon liquidation of ING Groep N.V., the amount paid up on the cumulative preference shares will be repaid together with the accrued dividend as well as any dividend shortfall in preceding years, insofar as this shortfall has not yet been made up. No specific dividend payment restrictions with respect to the cumulative preference shares exist.",

The increasing net interest income for 2023 and 2022 is a reflection of the interest rates during the period which repriced faster on the asset side compared to the liability side of the balance sheet. In 2022 an one-off adjustment was recorded in interest income on loans regarding the credit moratoria in Poland (EUR -343 million).\n\nDue to prevalent rates during the comparative years, Negative interest on liabilities includes the ECB funding rate benefit from the TLTRO III programme of EUR 314 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 808 million), while for 2023 Interest expense on deposits from banks includes interest paid under the TLTRO III programme of EUR 557 million.\n\nThis was driven by the following applicable TLTRO III rates applicable for ING Group: -100 bps throughout the entire 2021 and the first half of 2022 until 23 June 2022; -37 bps, -36 bps, -29 bps between 23 June 2022 and 22 November 2022 for ING's participation in series 3,4 and 7 of TLTRO III, respectively; 150 bps between 22 November 2022 and 21 December 2022; 200 bps from 21 December 2022 until 8 February 2023; 250 bps between 8 February 2023 and 22 March 2023; 300 bps between 22 March 2023 and May 2023 and increased to 400 bps during the period May to December 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the before mentioned change in terms in 2022 caused the discontinuation of the fair value hedge accounting relationship on TLTRO III, impacting net interest income of 2022 for an amount of EUR -483 million (refer to Note 36 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for more details).",

In 2023, the financial markets were characterised by elevated levels of volatility. In the first quarter of the year, the markets worldwide were shaken by the demise of SVB bank and the stress surrounding Credit Suisse, fuelling uncertainty around possible additional defaults. Furthermore, the ongoing interest-rate hikes by the central banks in Europe and the US led to a fast increase in rates worldwide. Toward the end of the year, the probability increased for interest rates going down, which has been reflected in the forward interest rates. In 2022, the market was affected by a significant increase in interest-rates volatility, interest-rate hikes across EU and US, and a steady fall of the EUR value and appreciation of USD, while in 2021 the market recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, stabilised and returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nSecurities trading results includes the results of market making in instruments such as government securities, equity securities, corporate debt securities, money-market instruments. Derivatives trading results includes the results of derivatives such as interest rate swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts. Trading gains and losses relating to trading securities still held as at 31 December 2023 amount to EUR 160 million (2022: EUR -157 million; 2021: EUR -268 million). The majority of the risks involved in security and currency trading are economically hedged with derivatives. The securities trading results are partly offset by results on these derivatives. The result of these derivatives is included in Derivatives trading results.\n\nOther trading results include the results of trading loans and funds entrusted.",

The result on currency trading is included in foreign exchange transactions results.\n\nNet trading income relates to trading assets and trading liabilities which include assets and liabilities that are classified under IFRS as Trading but are closely related to servicing the needs of the clients of ING. ING offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional clients, corporate clients, and governments. ING's trading books are managed based on internal limits and comprise a mix of products with results which could be offset. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading portfolio are related to servicing corporate clients in their risk management to hedge for example currency or interest rate exposures. From a risk perspective, the gross amount of trading assets must be considered together with the gross amount of trading liabilities, which are presented separately on the statement of financial position. However, IFRS does not always allow netting of these positions in the statement of financial position. Reference is made to Note 4 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and Note 14 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss' for information on trading assets and trading liabilities respectively.\n\n'Valuation results and net trading income' include the fair value movements on derivatives (used for both hedge accounting and economically hedging exposures) as well as the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities included in hedging relationships as hedged items. During 2023, the interest-rate movements significantly affected the fair value changes of other non-trading derivatives as well as the fair value changes of both the derivatives and the hedged items designated in fair value hedges. Reference is made to Note 36 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for information on derivatives used for hedge accounting.\n\nFurthermore, derivatives trading results is also impacted by fair value movements arising from changes in credit spreads (CVA and DVA), bid offer spreads, model risk and incremental cost of funding on derivatives (FVA and CollVA). Refer to Note 35 'Fair value of assets and liabilities' for information on these valuation adjustments.\n\nValuation results on assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (excluding trading)' include fair value changes on financial assets and financial liabilities driven by changed market conditions. Refer to Note 4 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and to Note 14 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nIn addition, 'Valuation results on assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss (excluding trading)' include fair value adjustments on own issued notes amounting to EUR -230 million (2022: EUR 745 million; 2021: EUR 65 million).\n\n## 23   Investment income\n\n## Investment income\n\n| in EUR million                                                          | 2023   |   2022 | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Dividend income                                                         | 105    |    149 | 122    |\n| Realised gains/losses on disposal of debt instruments measured at FVOCI | -11    |     32 | 45     |\n| Income from and fair value gains/losses on investment properties        |        |     -1 |        |\n|                                                                         | 95     |    181 | 167    |\n\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021 dividend income mainly consists of dividend received from ING's equity stake in Bank of Beijing.\n\n## 24   Other net income\n\nIn 2023, Other net income of EUR -147 million (2022: EUR -363 million; 2021: EUR 236 million) includes EUR -244 million (2022: EUR -333 million) net monetary loss reflecting the IAS 29 hyperinflation impact in T\u00fcrkiye related to the indexation of T\u00fcrkiye's statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss with an offsetting effect in the currency translation reserve. Furthermore, it includes the positive recovery of defaulted receivables of EUR 25 million (2022 EUR 32 million; 2021 EUR 25 million).\n\nOther net income as per 31 December 2022, also includes an amount of EUR -307 million loss recognised to unwind a macro fair value hedge of deposits, which led to a timing difference with expected fair value. Furthermore, it includes the proceeds of the agreement with Boursorama after our exit from the retail banking market in France of EUR 125 million and a gain of EUR 67 million from a legacy entity in Retail Belgium.\n\nIn 2021, other net income included the recognition of EUR 72 million relating to a better than expected recovery of the insolvency of a financial institution in the Netherlands and EUR 34 million proceeds of the agreement with Raiffeisenbank due to the withdrawal from the retail banking market in the Czech Republic.",

The entitlement to the LSPP share awards is granted conditionally. If the participant remains in employment for an uninterrupted period between the grant date and the vesting date, the entitlement becomes unconditional, with the exception of the upfront shares which are immediately vested upon grant. Upfront and deferred shares awarded to the Management Board members of ING Group as well as identified staff, have a retention obligation that must be adhered to upon vesting, typically a minimum retention of 12 months applies.

In calculating the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, own shares held by group companies (including share buyback programmes) are deducted from the total number of ordinary shares in issue.\n\n## Dilutive instruments\n\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated as if the share plans outstanding at the end of the period had been exercised at the beginning of the period and assuming that the cash received from dilutive instruments (if any) is used to buy own shares against the average market price during the period. The net increase in the number of shares resulting from exercising share plans is added to the average number of shares used for the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## 29   Dividend per ordinary share\n\n| Dividends to shareholders of the parent       |                             |                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                               | Per ordinary share (in EUR) | Total (in EUR million) |\n| Dividends on ordinary shares:                 |                             |                        |\n| In respect of 2021                            |                             |                        |\n| - Interim dividend, paid October 2021         | 0.21                        | 820                    |\n| - Final dividend                              | 0.41                        | 1,548                  |\n| Total dividend in respect of 2021             | 0.62                        | 2,368                  |\n| In respect of 2022                            |                             |                        |\n| - Interim dividend, paid August 2022          | 0.17                        | 636                    |\n| - Final dividend, paid May 2023               | 0.389                       | 1,408                  |\n| Total dividend in respect of 2022             | 0.559                       | 2,044                  |\n| In respect of 2023                            |                             |                        |\n| - Interim dividend declared, paid August 2023 | 0.35                        | 1,260                  |\n| - Final dividend declared                     | 0.756                       | 2,500                  |\n| Total dividend in respect of 2023             | 1.106                       | 3,760                  |\n\nOn 24 April 2023, the Annual General Meeting of shareholders ratified the total dividend of EUR 0.559 per ordinary share of which EUR 0.17 per share was paid as an interim cash dividend during August 2022.

Business lines formulate strategic, commercial, and financial plans in conformity with the strategy and performance targets set by the CODM.\n\nRecognition and measurement of segment results are in line with the accounting policies as described in Note 1 'Basis of preparation and material accounting policy information'. The results for the period for each reportable segment are after intercompany and intersegment eliminations and are those reviewed by the CODM to assess performance of the segments. Corporate expenses are allocated to business lines based on time spent by head office personnel, the relative number of staff, or on the basis of income, expenses and/or assets of the segment.\n\nThe following table specifies the segments by line of business and main sources of income of each of the segments:",

Comparatives have been adjusted.\n- 4 As from 2023, Wholesale Banking in France as well as Wholesale Banking in the Philippines are recorded in Wholesale Banking Rest of World. Previously these financials were reported in Other Challengers and Growth Markets respectively. Comparatives have been adjusted. As from 2022, Wholesale Banking Austria as well as Wholesale Banking Czech Republic are recorded in Wholesale Banking Rest of World. Previously these financials were reported in Germany and Other Challengers respectively.\n\nING Group monitors and evaluates the performance of ING Group at a consolidated level and by segment. The Executive Board and the Management Board Banking consider this to be relevant to an understanding of the Group's financial performance, because it allows investors to understand the primary method used by management to evaluate the Group's operating performance and make decisions about allocating resources.\n\nING Group reconciles the total segment results to the total result using Corporate Line. The Corporate Line reflects capital management activities, as ING Group applies a system of capital charging for its banking operations in order to create a comparable basis for the results of business units globally, irrespective of the business units' book equity and the currency they operate in.\n\nAs from 2022, results in the Corporate Line have been impacted by the application of hyperinflation accounting in the consolidation of our subsidiary in T\u00fcrkiye (IAS 29). Following a change in governance, the Asian stakes (our investments in Bank of Beijing and TMBThanachart Bank (TTB)) are reported in Corporate Line as of 2023 (with a profit before tax of \u20ac185 million), whereas previously they were reported in Retail Other. Comparable data have been adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, Corporate Line includes certain other income and expenses that are not allocated to the banking businesses.\n\nTotal income for Corporate Line in 2023 amounted to EUR 450 million compared with EUR 84 million in 2022. This included a hyperinflation accounting impact of EUR -179 million in 2023 versus EUR -279 million in 2022. Excluding hyperinflation accounting impact, total income rose by EUR 266 million, mainly attributable to higher income from Treasury activities and because 2022 had included EUR -165 million impact for impairments on our stake in TTB.\n\nOperating expenses for Corporate Line were EUR 542 million, 1.3% up from EUR 535 million in 2022. Expenses in 2023 included a hyperinflation impact of EUR 48 million and EUR 51 million that was provisioned, while 2022 had included a hyperinflation impact of EUR 30 million and a EUR 32 million impairment loss related to the goodwill allocated to T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThe information presented in this note is in line with the information presented to the Executive Board of ING Group and Management Board Banking.\n\nThis note does not provide information on the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues, as this is not reported internally and is therefore not readily available.",

The geographical analyses are based on the location of the office from which the transactions are originated and do not include countries where ING only has representation offices. The Netherlands is ING Group's country of domicile.\n\nIn order to increase ING Group's tax transparency, additional financial information on a per country basis has been included in this disclosure: Tax paid represents all income tax paid to and/or received from tax authorities in the current year, irrespective of the fiscal year to which these payments or refunds relate. Total assets by country does not include intercompany balances and reconciles to the total assets in the consolidated statement of financial position of ING Group. At the date when these financial statements were authorized for issue, the Netherlands has implemented new legislation, based on an OECD legislative framework, to ensure that large multinational groups with their head office in the Netherlands pay income tax at a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in all the countries they are present in, applicable from 2024 and onwards. Countries in which ING operates that have an effective tax rate below 15% will be subject to an additional top-up tax.\n\nING Group expects to be subject to top-up tax in relation to its operations in Switzerland, Ireland, Bulgaria and United Arab Emirates, in which countries the statutory tax rate is below 15%, and in Singapore which country applies a special tax rate for certain profit components that reduces its effective tax rate to below 15%.\n\nING Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred. If the top-up tax had been applied in 2023, the total top up tax that had to be paid by ING Group would have amounted to approximately EUR 4 million.\n\nThe table below provide additional information, for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 respectively, on names of principal subsidiaries and branches, nature of main activities and average number of employees on a full time equivalent basis by country/tax jurisdiction.",

In 2023, the local results on a standalone basis were positively impacted by releases of loan loss provisions following improved macroeconomic indicators and decrease in exposures following sales and repayments. For further information, reference is made to 'Risk management'.\n\nThe lower negative tax charge reported for ING T\u00fcrkiye with respect to its loss is mainly caused by the non deductibility for tax purposes of the accounting loss based on hyperinflation accounting.\n\n## 2022\n\nThe higher tax charge of 39% in the Netherlands (compared to the statutory rate of 25.8%) is mainly caused by the non-deductible Dutch bank tax (EUR 179 million) and the non-deductible impairments regarding goodwill ING T\u00fcrkiye (EUR 32 million) and TTB (EUR 165 million).\n\nThe higher positive tax charge of T\u00fcrkiye combined with its accounting loss based on hyperinflation accounting  is mainly caused by the non deductibility of this loss for tax purposes.\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine, our strategy is no new business with Russian clients, including Russian-owned entities outside of Russia, and to get existing Russia-related credit exposures repaid as quickly as possible. These exposures are booked in various countries and totalled EUR 6.7 billion, published on 4 March 2022. Remaining at risk for ING Group at year-end 2022 is EUR 0.3 billion local equity and EUR 2.5 billion credit exposures booked outside of Russia. In 2022, ING's results in connection with Russia-related credit exposures declined significantly, as we have recognized EUR 0.5 billion risk costs related to these exposures. The local results on a standalone basis were higher compared to 2021. This was driven by the high local interest-rate environment and increased rouble inflow from existing, predominantly non-Russian, clients. Under local law and banking regulations, ING Russia must accept these rouble inflows. Furthermore, the local result before tax expressed in EUR (EUR 128 million) was positively impacted by the appreciation of the rouble against the euro for an amount of EUR 80 million throughout 2022. Going forward, we will continue to actively reduce our Russia-related credit exposure.\n\nThe higher tax charge in Poland is mainly caused by non-deductible regulatory and other costs.\n\n## 2021\n\nThe higher tax charge of 35% in the Netherlands (compared to the statutory rate of 25%) is mainly caused by the non-deductible Dutch bank tax (EUR 260 million) and the impairments on deferred tax assets regarding Payvision and Yolt (EUR 26 million tax).\n\nThe lower tax charge in Austria is caused by previously not recognised tax losses (EUR -10 million tax). The higher tax charge in Poland is mainly caused by non-deductible regulatory- and other costs.\n\n## Additional notes to the Consolidated financial statements\n\n## 32   Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities\n\n|                                     | Debt securities in  issue   | Debt securities in  issue   | Subordinated  Loans   | Subordinated  Loans   | Lease liabilities   | Lease liabilities   | Total Liabilities from  financing activities   | Total Liabilities from  financing activities   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| in EUR million                      | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2023                  | 2022                  | 2023                | 2022                | 2023                                           | 2022                                           |\n| Opening balance                     | 95,918                      | 91,784                      | 15,786                | 16,715                | 1,174               |                     | 1,220     112,878     109,719                  |                                                |\n| Cashflows:                          | Cashflows:                  | Cashflows:                  | Cashflows:            | Cashflows:            | Cashflows:          | Cashflows:          | Cashflows:                                     | Cashflows:                                     |\n| Additions                           | 116,436                     | 92,707                      | 2,225                 | 983                   |                     |                     | 118,661                                        | 93,690                                         |\n| Redemptions / Disposals             | -90,574                     | -82,844                     | -2,894                | -1,090                | -291                | -296                | -93,758                                        | -84,230                                        |\n| Non cash changes:                   | Non cash changes:           | Non cash changes:           | Non cash changes:     | Non cash changes:     | Non cash changes:   | Non cash changes:   | Non cash changes:                              | Non cash changes:                              |\n| Amortisation                        | 764                         | 312                         | 34                    | 30                    | 28                  | 15                  | 826                                            | 357                                            |\n| Other                               | 502                         | 39                          | 12                    | 7                     | 256                 | 239                 | 769                                            | 285                                            |\n| Changes in unrealised  revaluations | 2,680                       | -7,658                      | 473                   | -1,470                |                     |                     | 3,153                                          | -9,127                                         |\n| Foreign exchange movement           | -1,057                      | 1,577                       | -235                  | 611                   | -4                  | -4                  | -1,296                                         | 2,185                                          |\n| Closing balance                     | 124,670                     |                             | 95,918     15,401     | 15,786                | 1,162               |                     | 1,174     141,233     112,878                  |                                                |\n\nPart of Debt securities in issue and subordinated loans are subject to fair value hedge accounting.

The assets of all ING Group's defined contribution plans are held in independently administered funds. Contributions, including the defined contribution plan in the Netherlands, are principally determined as a percentage of remuneration. These plans do not give rise to provisions in the statement of financial position, other than relating to short-term timing differences included in other assets and in other liabilities.\n\nING Group maintains defined benefit retirement plans in some countries. These plans provide benefits that are related to the remuneration and service of employees upon retirement. The benefits in some of these plans are subject to various forms of indexation. The indexation is, in some cases, at the discretion of management; in other cases it is dependent upon the sufficiency of plan assets.\n\nAnnual contributions are paid to the funds at a rate necessary to adequately finance the accrued liabilities of the plans calculated in accordance with local legal requirements. Plans in all countries are designed to comply with applicable local regulations governing investments and funding levels.\n\nING Group provides other post-employment benefits to certain former employees. These post-employment benefits are primarily discounts on ING products.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nING, as part of the labour agreements with its employees, sponsors a number of defined contribution plans. ING's obligation is limited to contributions which are agreed in advance and also includes employee contributions. The most significant plans are in the Netherlands and Belgium. The employer's contribution is recognised as an expense which amounted for 2023 EUR 391 million (2022: EUR 364 million).\n\n## Defined benefit retirement plans\n\n## Statement of financial position - Net defined benefit asset/liability\n\n## Plan assets and defined benefit obligation per country\n\n|                                                      | Plan assets Defined benefit obligation   | Plan assets Defined benefit obligation   | Plan assets Defined benefit obligation   | Plan assets Defined benefit obligation   | Funded Status   | Funded Status   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| in EUR million                                       | 2023                                     | 2022                                     | 2023                                     | 2022                                     | 2023            | 2022            |\n| The Netherlands                                      | 331                                      | 310                                      | 426                                      | 400                                      | -95             | -90             |\n| United States                                        | 257                                      | 248                                      | 245                                      | 230                                      | 12              | 18              |\n| United Kingdom                                       | 1,257                                    | 1,277                                    | 790                                      | 750                                      | 467             | 527             |\n| Belgium                                              | 516                                      | 507                                      | 473                                      | 475                                      | 43              | 32              |\n| Other countries                                      | 317                                      | 295                                      | 353                                      | 305                                      | -37             | -10             |\n| Funded status (Net defined benefit  asset/liability) | 2,678                                    | 2,637                                    | 2,288                                    | 2,159                                    | 390             | 478             |\n| Presented as:                                        |                                          |                                          |                                          |                                          |                 |                 |\n| - Other assets                                       |                                          |                                          |                                          |                                          | 554             | 617             |\n| - Other liabilities                                  |                                          |                                          |                                          |                                          | -164            | -139            |\n|                                                      |                                          |                                          |                                          |                                          | 390             | 478             |\n\nThe most recent (actuarial) valuations of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out as at 31 December 2023.

The assumptions used in the determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability and the Other post-employment benefits include discount rates, mortality rates, expected rates of salary increases (excluding promotion increases), and indexation. The rates used for salary developments, interest discount factors, and other adjustments reflect country-specific conditions.\n\nThe key assumption in the determination of the net defined benefit asset/liability is the discount rate. The discount rate is the weighted average of the discount rates that are applied in different regions where ING Group has defined benefit pension plans (weighted by the defined benefit obligation). The discount rate is based on a methodology that uses market yields on high quality corporate bonds of the specific regions with durations matching the pension liabilities as key input. Market yields of high quality corporate bonds reflect the yield on corporate bonds with an AA rating for durations where such yields are available. An extrapolation is applied in order to determine the yield to the longer durations for which no AA-rated\n\ncorporate bonds are available. As a result of the limited availability of long-duration AA-rated corporate bonds, extrapolation is an important element of the determination of the discount rate. The weighted average discount rate applied for net defined benefit asset/liability for 2023 was 4.0% (2022: 4.3%) based on the pension plan in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. The average discount rate applied for Other post-employment benefits in 2023 was 5.2% (2022: 5.5%).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of key assumptions\n\nING performs sensitivity analyses on the most significant assumptions: discount rates, mortality, expected rate of salary increase, and indexation. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out under the assumption that the changes occurred at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis calculates the financial impact on the defined benefit obligation of an increase or decrease of the weighted averages of each significant actuarial assumption, all other assumptions held constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and some changes of the assumptions may be correlated. Changes to mortality, expected rate of salary increase, and indexation would have no material impact on the defined benefit obligation. The most significant impact would be from a change in the discount rate. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% creates an impact on the defined benefit obligation of  EUR 238 million (decrease) and EUR 282 million (increase), respectively.\n\n## Expected cash flows\n\nING Group's subsidiaries should fund the cost of the entitlements expected to be earned on a yearly basis.\n\nFor 2024, the expected contributions to defined benefit pension plans are EUR 58 million.\n\nThe benefit payments for defined benefit and other post-employment benefits expected to be made by the plan between 2024-2028 are estimated to be between EUR 133 million and EUR 150 million per year. From 2028 to 2032 the total payments made by the plan are expected to be EUR 738 million.",

Due to decreased (longer-term) interest rate yield curve in 2023 there was a positive revaluation of the cash flow hedge through other comprehensive income. This resulted in a decline in the deferred tax asset by EUR -251 million compared to the increase in deferred tax assets in 2022 by EUR 875 million due to the increase in the interest yield curve. The deferred tax asset in cash flow hedges decreased from EUR 752 million in 2022 to EUR 502 million in 2023.\n\nThe deferred tax on Loans and advances changes through net result in 2023 EUR -140 million (2022: EUR 177  million) relates mainly to valuation changes of collectively assessed expected credit losses.\n\nThe deferred tax  changes through equity - Other in 2023 of EUR 13 million (2022:EUR -123 million) is due to FX developments following the USD depreciation and the application of IAS 29 Hyperinflation in T\u00fcrkiye, and also due to the decline in the Credit liability Reserve due to credit spread tightening.\n\n## Changes in deferred tax\n\n| in EUR million  2022                                  | Net  liability (-)  Net asset (+)  opening  balance   | Change  through  equity   | Change  through  net result   | Exchange  rate  differences   | Changes in the  composition of  the group and  other changes   | Net  liability (-)  Net asset (+)  ending  balance   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets at FVOCI                             | -70                                                   | 148                       | 5                             | -3                            |                                                                | 80                                                   |\n| Financial assets and liabilities at FVPL              | 107                                                   |                           | -88                           |                               | 9                                                              | 28                                                   |\n| Depreciation                                          | -7                                                    |                           | -5                            | -2                            |                                                                | -13                                                  |\n| Cash flow hedges                                      | -126                                                  | 875                       |                               |                               | 2                                                              | 752                                                  |\n| Pension and post-employment  benefits                 | -49                                                   | 6                         | -13                           | 8                             | -7                                                             | -54                                                  |\n| Other provisions                                      | 19                                                    |                           | 44                            | -4                            |                                                                | 59                                                   |\n| Loans and advances                                    | 430                                                   |                           | 177                           | -3                            | 7                                                              | 612                                                  |\n| Unused tax losses carried forward                     | 199                                                   |                           | 137                           | -8                            |                                                                | 327                                                  |\n| Other                                                 | -148                                                  | -123                      | 26                            | -6                            |                                                                | -251                                                 |\n| Total                                                 | 354                                                   | 907                       | 283                           | -5                            | 0                                                              | 1,539                                                |\n| Presented in the statement of  financial position as: |                                                       |                           |                               |                               |                                                                |                                                      |\n| -

This tax loss can be carried forward for five years. Based on a taxable profit forecast, ING considers it probable that the future taxable profits will compensate for this tax loss carry forward position. Based on this a remaining deferred tax asset on unused tax losses carried forward, as per 31 December 2023: EUR 120 million (2022: EUR 224 million) is recognised. The remaining net deferred tax asset in Poland of EUR 124 million (2022: EUR 167 million) relates to temporary tax differences on loans and advances and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nRecognition is based on the fact that it is probable that the entity will have taxable profits and/or can utilise tax planning opportunities before expiration of the deferred tax assets. Changes in circumstances in future periods may adversely impact the assessment of the recoverability. The uncertainty of the recoverability is taken into account in establishing the deferred tax assets.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 and 2023, ING Group had no significant temporary differences associated with the parent company's investments in subsidiaries and associates as any economic benefit from those investments will not be taxable at parent company level.",

This is mainly caused by the impact in 2023 of the following non-deductible items for income tax purposes: hyperinflation accounting loss in T\u00fcrkiye, interest expenses, bank- and local taxes in various countries. Adjustments to prior periods mainly relates to a tax refund in Spain regarding previous years.\n\nThe weighted average statutory tax rate in 2022 (24.8%) was higher than the rate of 24.3% in 2021.\n\nThe effective tax rate of 31.4% in 2022 was higher than the weighted average statutory tax rate. This is mainly caused by the impact in 2022 of the following non-deductible items income tax purposes: hyperinflation accounting loss in T\u00fcrkiye, impairments on TTB, and interest expenses in various countries.\n\nThe effective tax rate of 27.7% in 2021 was significantly higher than the weighted average statutory tax rate. This is mainly caused by a high amount of expenses non-deductible for tax purposes like the nondeductible bank tax and a tax charge caused by the recapture of tax losses originated in the United Kingdom but previously deducted in the Netherlands.\n\n## Equity - Other comprehensive income\n\n| in EUR million                                                                                                          |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Unrealised revaluations financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive  income and other revaluations       |     -7 |    140 |     14 |\n| Realised gains/losses transferred to the statement of profit or loss (reclassifications  from equity to profit or loss) |     -3 |      8 |     12 |\n| Changes in cash flow hedge reserve                                                                                      |   -251 |    875 |    233 |\n| Remeasurement of the net defined benefit asset/liability                                                                |     31 |      6 |    -54 |\n| Changes in fair value of own credit risk of financial liabilities at fair value through  profit or loss                 |      2 |     19 |     -8 |\n| Exchange rate differences and other                                                                                     |     19 |   -141 |    -77 |\n| Total income tax related to components of other comprehensive income                                                    |   -209 |    907 |    120 |\n\n## 35   Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\n## a) Valuation Methods\n\nThe estimated fair values represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is a marketbased measurement, which is based on assumptions that market participants would use and takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on quoted prices in active market where available. When such quoted prices are not available, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques.",

        "page_content": "- > 35   Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\nIn 2023, the financial markets were characterised by elevated levels of volatility. In the first quarter of the year, the markets worldwide were shaken by the demise of SVB bank and the stress surrounding Credit Suisse, fuelling uncertainty around possible additional defaults. Furthermore, the ongoing interest rate hikes by the central banks in Europe and the US led to a fast increase in rates worldwide. Towards the end of the year, the probability increased for interest rates to go down, which has been reflected in the forward interest rates. Additionally, geopolitical risk increased with the Israel-Gaza conflict adding to the risk arising from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities, including Level 3, are valued using agreed methodologies, targeting the most appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\n## b) Valuation control framework\n\nThe valuation control framework covers the product approval process (PARP), pricing, market data assessment and independent price verification (IPV), valuation adjustments, model use, fair value hierarchy and day one profit or loss. Valuation processes are governed by various governance bodies, including Local Parameter Committees, Global Valuation and Impairment Committee, Market Data Committee and Valuation Model Committee. All relevant committees meet on a regular basis (monthly/quarterly), where agenda covers the aforementioned valuation controls.\n\nThe Global Valuation and Impairment Committee is responsible for the oversight and the approval of the outcome of impairments (other than loan loss provisions) and valuation processes. It oversees the quality and coherence of valuation methodologies and performance. The Valuation Model Committee is responsible for the approval of all valuation models used for the Fair valuation (IFRS) and Prudent Valuation (CRR) of positions measured at fair value. The Local Parameter Committee discusses the valuation results and monitors the performance of the valuation activities carried out on local or regional level. The Global Financial Markets Parameter Committee reviews the consolidated valuation outcome and resulting P&L for Financial Market products, targeting a globally consistent treatment across Financial Market. The Market Data Committee is responsible for the approval of the market data used in valuation.\n\n## c) Valuation Adjustments\n\nValuation adjustments are an integral part of the fair value. They are the adjustments to the output from a valuation technique in order to appropriately determine a fair value in accordance with IFRS13. ING considers various fair value adjustments including Bid-Offer adjustments, Model Risk adjustments, Bilateral Valuation Adjustments (BVA, consisting of Credit Valuation Adjustments or CVA, and Debit valuation Adjustments or DVA), Collateral Valuation Adjustment (CollVA) and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).\n\nFor financial instruments where the fair value at initial recognition is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs, a difference between the transaction price and the fair value resulting from the internal valuation process can occur. Such difference is referred to as Day One Profit or Day One Loss\n\n(hereafter: DOP). ING defers material Day One Profit or Loss of instruments with significant unobservable valuation inputs, which are the financial instruments classified as Level 3 and financial instruments with material unobservable inputs into CVA which are not necessarily classified as Level 3. The DOP is amortised over the life of the instrument, or until the significant unobservable inputs become observable, or until the significant unobservable inputs become non-significant. Both the impact on the profit and loss in 2023 and the DOP reserve is disclosed in the below table.\n\n## Deferred Day One Profit or Loss Reserve\n\nThe table below summarizes the movement in the aggregate DOP not recognised when financial instruments were initially recognised, because of the use of valuation techniques for which not all the inputs were market observable data.\n\n| in EUR million                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance at 1 January                                         | -108   | -7     |\n| DOP deferred on new transactions during the period                   | -83    | -107   |\n| DOP recognised in the statement of profit or loss during the period: |        |        |\n| \u00b7 of which release                                                   | 85     | 6      |\n| \u00b7 of which amortisation and exchange differences                     | 15     | 0      |\n| Closing balance at 31 December                                       | -90    | -108   |\n\nThe following table presents the models reserves for financial assets and liabilities.\n\n| in EUR million                  |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred Day One Profit or Loss |    -90 |   -108 |\n| Own credit adjustments          |     34 |     75 |\n| Bid/Offer                       |   -154 |   -216 |\n| Model Risk                      |    -26 |    -13 |\n| CVA                             |   -131 |   -192 |\n| DVA                             |     55 |     99 |\n| CollVA                          |     -4 |     -8 |\n| FVA                             |    -68 |    -78 |\n| Total Valuation Adjustments     |   -385 |   -441 |",

        "page_content": "- > 35   Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\n## Own Credit Adjustment\n\nOwn issued debt and structured notes that are designated at fair value through profit or loss are adjusted for ING's own credit risk by means of DVA.\n\n## Bid-Offer Adjustment\n\nFor positions priced based upon mid-market input parameters, Bid-Offer adjustments are required in order to reflect the valuation of that position based on bid price or offer price. In practice this adjustment accounts for the difference in valuation from 'mid to bid' and 'mid to offer' for long and short exposures respectively. In principle assets are valued at the bid prices and liabilities are valued at the offer price. For certain assets or liabilities, where a market quoted price is not available, the price used is the fair value that is most representative within the bid-offer spread.\n\n## Model Risk Adjustment\n\nFinancial instruments that are valued using a valuation model can be subject to model risk. Model risk is the risk of possible financial loss resulting from pricing model or model-based parameter deficiencies and/or uncertainties.\n\n## Bilateral Valuation Adjustments (Credit and Debit Valuation Adjustments)\n\nBilateral Valuation Adjustment is the valuation adjustment reflecting the counterparty credit risk of derivative contracts. It has a bilateral nature, where both the counterparty's credit risk (i.e. Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and ING's own credit risk (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA) are taken into account:\n\n- \u00b7 CVA is the fair value adjustment applicable to derivative instruments to account for the possibility that the counterparty defaults (i.e. it is the market value of the counterparty's credit risk).\n- \u00b7 DVA is the fair value adjustment applicable to derivative instruments to account for the possibility that ING defaults (i.e. it is the market value of ING's credit risk).\n\nThe calculation of CVA and DVA on derivatives is based on their expected exposures, the counterparties' and ING's risk of default, taking into account the collateral agreements as well as netting agreements. The counterparties' risk of default is measured by probability of default and expected loss given default, which is based on market information including credit default swap (CDS) spreads. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant proxy spreads are used. Additionally, wrong-way risk (which occurs when the probability of default by the counterparty increases (decreases) when ING's exposure to the counterparty increases (decreases)) and right-way risk (which occurs when the probability of default by the counterparty increases (decreases) when ING's exposure to the counterparty decreases (increases)) are included in the adjustment.\n\n## Collateral Valuation Adjustment (CollVA)\n\nCollateral Valuation Adjustment is a fair valuation adjustment applied on derivative instruments to capture specific features of CSA (Credit Support Annex) with a counterparty that the regular OIS discounting framework does not capture. Non-standard CSA features may include deviations in relation to the\n\ncurrencies in which ING posts or receives collateral, deviations in remuneration rate on collateral which may pay lower or higher rate than overnight rate or even no interest at all; other deviations can be posting securities rather than cash as collateral, etc.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)\n\nFunding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is a fair valuation adjustment applied on derivative instruments to address the asymmetry in funding costs or funding benefits between collateralized and uncollateralized derivatives portfolios. This adjustment is based on the expected exposure profiles of the uncollateralized or partially collateralized OTC derivatives and market-based funding spreads.\n\n## d) Fair value hierarchy\n\nING Group has categorised its financial instruments that are either measured in the statement of financial position at fair value or of which the fair value is disclosed, into a three level hierarchy based on the observability of the valuation inputs. Highest priority is retained to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to valuation techniques supported by unobservable inputs.\n\nTransfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels are made on a quarterly basis at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Level 1 - (Unadjusted) quoted prices in active markets\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is determined directly by reference to (unadjusted) quoted prices in an active market. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer markets, brokered markets, or principal to principal markets. Those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "- > 35   Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\nTransfers out of Level 1 into Level 2 or Level 3 occur when ING Group establishes that markets are no longer active and therefore (unadjusted) quoted prices no longer provide reliable pricing information.\n\n## Level 2 - Valuation technique supported by observable inputs\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is based on market observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within Level 1. The fair value for financial instruments in this category can be determined by reference to quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or market-corroborated inputs. ING analyses how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid tradable prices or model-based consensus prices taking various data as inputs.\n\nFor financial instruments that do not have a reference price available, fair value is determined using a valuation technique (e.g., a model), where inputs in the model are taken from an active market or are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities, and credit spreads.\n\nInstruments, where inputs are unobservable are classified in this category, provided that the impact of those unobservable inputs on the overall valuation is insignificant. The notion of significant is particularly relevant for the distinction between Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities, as the significance assessment of the valuation input on the entire fair value measurement will determine whether the instrument should be classified as Level 2 or Level 3. Expert judgement is required on the significance assessment approach.\n\n## Level 3 - Valuation technique supported by unobservable inputs\n\nThis category includes financial instruments whose fair value is determined using a valuation technique for which a significant part of the overall valuation is driven by unobservable valuation inputs. Where valuation inputs are unobservable, the Group must use the best information available to value the instruments. This may require internally derived inputs taking into account market participants assumptions that are reasonably available, including assumptions on the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Unobservable inputs may include, among others, volatility, correlation, spreads to discount rates, default rates, recovery rates, prepayment rates, and certain credit spreads.\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\nThe fair values of the financial instruments  were determined as follows:\n\n## Methods applied in determining fair values of financial assets and liabilities (carried at fair value)\n\n|                                                                     | Level 1   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Level 3   | Total             | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|---------|\n| in EUR million                                                      | 2023      | 2022      | 2023      | 2022      | 2023      | 2022      | 2023              | 2022    |\n| Financial Assets                                                    |           |           |           |           |           |           |                   |         |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through profit or loss              |           |           |           |           |           |           |                   |         |\n| - Equity securities                                                 | 15,438    | 11,783    | 3         | 2         | 150       | 156       | 15,590            | 11,941  |\n| - Debt securities                                                   | 4,825     | 1,636     | 4,081     | 5,361     | 3,364     | 3,450     | 12,270            | 10,447  |\n| - Derivatives                                                       | 39        | 22        | 27,134    | 34,229    | 535       | 483       | 27,708            | 34,734  |\n| - Loans and receivables                                             | 0         | 0         | 63,316    | 54,097    | 4,131     | 2,547     | 67,446            | 56,644  |\n|                                                                     | 20,302    | 13,441    | 94,533    | 93,690    | 8,179     |           | 6,635     123,015 | 113,766 |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through other  comprehensive income |           |           |           |           |           |           |                   |         |\n| - Equity securities                                                 | 1,622     | 1,639     | 0         | 0         | 263       | 247       | 1,885             | 1,887   |\n| - Debt securities                                                   | 35,848    | 25,644    | 2,433     | 3,451     | 0         | 0         | 38,281            | 29,095  |\n| - Loans and receivables                                             | 0         | 0         | 275       | 0         | 676       | 643       | 951               | 643     |\n|                                                                     | 37,470    | 27,284    | 2,707     | 3,451     | 938       | 891       | 41,116            | 31,625  |\n| Financial liabilities                                               |           |           |           |           |           |           |                   |         |\n| Financial liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss         |           |           |           |           |           |           |                   |         |\n| -  Debt securities                                                  | 1,088     | 822       | 7,635     | 5,743     | 47        | 53        | 8,770             | 6,619   |\n| -  Deposits                                                         | 0         | 0         | 57,063    | 50,257    | 13        | 0         | 57,076            | 50,257  |\n| -  Trading securities                                               | 3,604     | 1,952     | 41        | 273       | 0         | 1         | 3,645             | 2,226   |\n| -  Derivatives                                                      | 41        | 40        | 24,437    | 33,200    | 670       | 678       | 25,148            | 33,917  |\n|                                                                     | 4,733     | 2,814     | 89,175    | 89,473    | 729       | 732       | 94,638            | 93,019  |",

        "page_content": "- > 35   Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by ING Group to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments:\n\n## Equity securities\n\nInstrument description: Equity securities include stocks and shares, corporate investments and private equity investments.\n\nValuation: If available, the fair values of publicly traded equity securities and private equity securities are based on quoted market prices. In absence of active markets, fair values are estimated by analysing the investee's financial position, result, risk profile, prospect, price, earnings comparisons and revenue multiples. Additionally, reference is made to valuations of peer entities where quoted prices in active markets are available. For equity securities best market practice will be applied using the most relevant valuation method. All non-listed equity investments, including investments in private equity funds, are subject to a standard review framework which ensures that valuations reflect the fair values.\n\nFair value hierarchy: The majority of equity securities are publicly traded and quoted prices are readily and regularly available. Hence, these securities are classified as Level 1.  Equity securities which are not traded in active markets mainly include corporate investments, fund investments and other equity securities and are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nInstrument description: Debt securities include government bonds, financial institutions bonds and Assetbacked securities (ABS).\n\nValuation: Where available, fair values for debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices. Quoted market prices are obtained from an exchange market, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory service. The quoted prices from non-exchange sources are reviewed on their tradability of market prices. If quoted prices in an active market are not available, fair value is based on an analysis of available market inputs, which includes consensus prices obtained from one or more pricing services. Furthermore, fair values are determined by valuation techniques discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rate curves, referenced credit spreads, maturity of the investment, and estimated prepayment rates where applicable.\n\nFair value hierarchy: Government bonds and financial institutions bonds are generally traded in active markets, where quoted prices are readily and regularly available and are hence, classified as Level 1. The remaining positions are classified as Level 2 or Level 3. Asset backed securities for which no active market is available and a wide discrepancy in quoted prices exists, are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nInstrument description: Derivatives contracts can either be exchange-traded or over the counter (OTC). Derivatives include interest rate derivatives, FX derivatives, Credit derivatives, Equity derivatives and commodity derivatives.\n\nValuation: The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is determined using quoted market prices in an active market and are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. For instruments that are not actively\n\ntraded, fair values are estimated based on valuation techniques. OTC derivatives and derivatives trading in an inactive market are valued using valuation techniques. The valuation techniques and inputs depend on the type of derivatives and the nature of the underlying instruments. The principal techniques used to value these instruments are based on (amongst others) discounted cash flows, option pricing models and Monte Carlo simulations. These valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based on 'no-arbitrage' principles. The models are commonly used in the financial industry and inputs to the validation models are determined from observable market data where possible. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market, but can be determined from observable prices via valuation model calibration procedures. These inputs include prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of pricing, yield curves, credit spreads, default rates, recovery rates, dividend rates, volatility of underlying interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates and reference is made to quoted prices, recently executed trades, independent market quotes and consensus data, where available.\n\nFor uncollateralised OTC derivatives, ING applies Credit Valuation Adjustment to correctly reflect the counterparty credit risk in the valuation and Debit Valuation Adjustments to reflect the credit risk of ING for its counterparty. In addition, for these derivatives ING applies Funding Valuation Adjustment. See sections CVA/DVA and FVA in section c) Valuation Adjustments for more details regarding the calculation. Fair value hierarchy: The majority of the derivatives are priced using observable inputs and are classified as Level 2. Derivatives for which the input cannot be implied from observable market data are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Loans and receivables\n\nInstrument description: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables carried at fair value includes trading loans, being securities lending and similar agreement comparable to collateralised lending, syndicated loans, loans expected to be sold and receivables with regards to reverse repurchase transactions.\n\nValuation: The fair value of loans and receivables is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects credit risk, liquidity, and other current market conditions. The fair value of mortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour.\n\nFair value hierarchy: Loans and receivables are predominantly classified as Level 2. Loans and receivables for which current market information about similar assets to use as observable, corroborated data for all significant inputs into a valuation model is not available, are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss\n\nInstrument description: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss include debt securities, debt instruments, primarily comprised of structured notes, which are held at fair value under the fair value option. Besides that, it includes derivative contracts and repurchase agreements.\n\nValuation: The fair values of securities in the trading portfolio and other liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are based on quoted market prices, where available. For those securities not actively traded, fair values are estimated based on internal discounted cash flow valuation techniques using interest rates and",

Derivatives and debt instruments for which the input cannot be derived from observable market data are classified as Level 3.\n\n## e) Transfers between Level 1 and 2\n\nAs a consequence of change in observable inputs, ING recorded an EUR 2.4 billion transfer from Level 2 to Level 1 in debt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Furthermore, EUR 1.7 billion transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 were recorded in the reporting period 2023.\n\n## f) Level 3: Valuation techniques and inputs used\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in Level 3 include both assets and liabilities for which the fair value was determined using (i) valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs as well as (ii) quoted prices which have been adjusted to reflect that the market was not actively trading at or around the balance sheet date. Unobservable inputs are inputs which are based on ING's own assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, spreads to discount rates, default rates and recovery rates, prepayment rates, and certain credit spreads. Valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs are sensitive to the inputs used.\n\nOf the total amount of financial assets classified as Level 3 as at 31 December 2023 of EUR 9.1 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 7.5 billion), an amount of EUR 7.0 billion (76.7%) (31 December 2022: EUR 2.2 billion, being 29.2%) is based on unadjusted quoted prices in inactive markets. As ING does not generally adjust quoted prices using its own inputs, there is no significant sensitivity to ING's own unobservable inputs.\n\nFurthermore, Level 3 financial assets includes approximately EUR 0.3 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 4.2 billion) which relates to financial assets that are part of structures that are designed to be fully neutral in terms of market risk. Such structures include various financial assets and liabilities for which the overall sensitivity to market risk is insignificant. Whereas the fair value of individual components of these structures may be determined using different techniques and the fair value of each of the components of these structures may be sensitive to unobservable inputs, the overall sensitivity is by design not significant.\n\nThe remaining EUR 1.8 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 1.1 billion of the fair value classified in Level 3 financial assets is established using valuation techniques that incorporates certain inputs that are unobservable.\n\nOf the total amount of financial liabilities classified as Level 3 as at 31 December 2023 of EUR 0.7 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 0.7 billion), an amount of EUR 0.4 billion (50.0%) (31 December 2022: EUR 0.02 billion, being 2.5%) is based on unadjusted quoted prices in inactive markets. As ING does not generally adjust quoted prices using its own inputs, there is no significant sensitivity to ING's own unobservable inputs.\n\nFurthermore, Level 3 financial liabilities includes approximately EUR 0.3 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 0.6 billion) which relates to financial liabilities that are part of structures that are designed to be fully neutral in terms of market risk. As explained above, the fair value of each of the components of these structures may be sensitive to unobservable inputs, but the overall sensitivity is by design not significant.\n\nThe remaining EUR 0.1 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 0.1 billion of the fair value classified in Level 3 financial liabilities is established using valuation techniques that incorporates certain inputs that are unobservable.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of the valuation techniques, key unobservable inputs and the lower and upper range of such unobservable inputs, by type of Level 3 asset/liability. The lower and upper range mentioned in the overview represent the lowest and highest variance of the respective valuation input as actually used in the valuation of the different financial instruments. Amounts and percentages stated are unweighted. The range can vary from period to period subject to market movements and change in Level 3 position. Lower and upper bounds reflect the variability of Level 3 positions and their underlying valuation inputs in the portfolio, but do not adequately reflect their level of valuation uncertainty. For valuation uncertainty assessment, reference is made to section Sensitivity analysis of unobservable inputs (Level 3).",

        "page_content": "- > 35   Fair value of assets and liabilities\n\n## Price\n\nFor securities where market prices are not available, fair value is measured by comparison with observable pricing data from similar instruments. Prices of 0% are distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 100% or par are expected to pay a yield above current market rates.\n\n## Credit spreads\n\nCredit spread is the premium above a benchmark interest rate required by the market participant to accept a lower credit quality. Higher credit spreads indicate lower credit quality and a lower value of an asset.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure for variation of the price of a financial instrument or other valuation input over time. Volatility is one of the key inputs in option pricing models. Typically, the higher the volatility, the higher value of the option. Volatility varies by the underlying reference (equity, commodity, foreign currency and interest rates), by strike, and maturity of the option. The minimum level of volatility is 0% and there is no theoretical maximum.\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of dependence between two underlying references which is relevant for valuing derivatives and other instruments having more than one underlying reference. High positive correlation (close to 1) indicates strong positive (statistical) relationship, where underliers move, everything else equal, into the same direction. The same holds for a high negative correlation.\n\n## Interest rate\n\nAn interest rate is the amount of interest due per period, as a proportion of the amount lent, deposited, or borrowed.\n\n## Reset spread\n\nReset spreads are key inputs to mortgage linked prepayment swaps valuation. Reset spread is the future spread at which mortgages will re-price at interest rate reset dates.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nDividend yield is an important input for equity option pricing models showing how much dividends a company is expected to pay out each year relative to its share price. Dividend yields are generally expressed as an annualised percentage of share price.\n\n## Prepayment rate\n\nPrepayment rate is a key input to mortgage and loan valuation. Prepayment rate is the estimated rate at which mortgage borrowers will repay their mortgages early, e.g. 5% per year. Prepayment rate and reset spread are key inputs to mortgage linked prepayment swaps valuation.",

The structured notes were transferred out of Level 3 as the valuation was no longer impacted by significantly unobservable inputs.\n\nIn 2022, the transfers into Level 3 mainly consisted of non-trading derivatives that were transferred to Level 3 as a result of the valuation being significantly impacted by unobservable inputs.\n\n## g) Recognition of unrealised gains and losses in Level 3\n\nAmounts recognised in the statement of profit or loss relating to unrealised gains and losses during the year that relates to Level 3 assets and liabilities are included in the line item 'Valuation results and net trading income' in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## h) Level 3: Sensitivity analysis of unobservable inputs\n\nWhere the fair value of a financial instrument is determined using inputs which are unobservable and which have a more than insignificant impact on the fair value of the instrument, the actual value of those inputs at the balance date may be drawn from a range of reasonably possible alternatives. In line with market practice the upper and lower bounds of the range of alternative input values reflect a level of valuation certainty. The actual levels chosen for the unobservable inputs in preparing the financial statements are consistent with the valuation methodology used for fair valued financial instruments.\n\nIn practice valuation uncertainty is measured and managed per exposure to individual valuation inputs (i.e. risk factors) at portfolio level across different product categories. Where the disclosure looks at individual Level 3 inputs, the actual valuation adjustments may also reflect the benefits of portfolio offsets.\n\nThis disclosure does not attempt to indicate or predict future fair value movement. The numbers in isolation give limited information as in most cases these Level 3 assets and liabilities should be seen in combination with other instruments (for example as a hedge) that are classified as Level 2.\n\nThe valuation uncertainty in the table below is broken down by related risk class rather than by product. The possible impact of a change of unobservable inputs in the fair value of financial instruments where unobservable inputs are significant to the valuation is as follows:\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of Level 3 instruments\n\n|                                                                       |   Positive fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives | Positive fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives   |   Negative fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives |   Negative fair value  movements from  using reasonable  possible alternatives |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| in EUR million                                                        |                                                                           2023 | 2022                                                                           |                                                                           2023 |                                                                           2022 |\n| Equity (equity derivatives, structured notes)                         |                                                                             18 | 12                                                                             |                                                                             -9 |                                                                             -6 |\n| Interest rates (Rates derivatives, FX derivatives)                    |                                                                              3 | 22                                                                             |                                                                              0 |                                                                            -14 |\n| Credit (Debt securities, Loans, structured notes, credit derivatives) |                                                                             45 | 32                                                                             |                                                                            -54 |                                                                            -28 |\n| Loans and advances                                                    |                                                                              3 |                                                                                |                                                                            -17 |                                                                            -32 |\n|                                                                       |                                                                             69 | 65                                                                             |                                                                            -80 |                                                                            -80 |\n\n## i) Financial instruments not measured at fair value\n\nThe following table presents the estimated fair values of the financial instruments not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position.",

These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. The carrying amount of financial instruments presented in the above table includes, when applicable, the fair value hedge adjustment, this explains why (for these cases) the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nFor short term receivables from banks carrying amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The fair value of long term receivables from banks is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate based on specific available market data, such as interest rates and appropriate spreads that reflects current credit risk or quoted bonds.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\nFor short term loans carrying amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The fair value of long term loans is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects current credit risk, current interest rates, and other current market conditions where applicable. The fair value of mortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for calculation purposes.\n\n## Securities at amortised cost\n\nWhere available, fair values for debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices. Quoted market prices are obtained from an exchange market, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory service. The quoted prices from non-exchange sources are reviewed on their tradability of market prices. If quoted prices in an active market are not available, fair value is based on an analysis of available market inputs, which includes consensus prices obtained from one or more pricing services. Furthermore, fair values are determined by valuation techniques discounting expected future cash flows using market interest rate curves, referenced credit spreads, maturity of the investment, and estimated prepayment rates where applicable.\n\n## Deposits from banks\n\nFor short term payables to banks carrying amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The fair value of long term payables to banks is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate based on available market interest rates and appropriate spreads that reflects ING's own credit risk.\n\n## Customer deposits\n\nIn the current interest rate environment there is significant embedded value in our on-demand deposits, therefore providing a natural hedge against the impact from rising rates on financial assets. However, for the purpose of this disclosure and in accordance with IFRS, the carrying amounts of deposits with an immediate on demand feature is presented as fair value.",

Where no quoted market prices are available, fair value of the subordinated loans is estimated using discounted cash flows based on interest rates and credit spreads that apply to similar instruments.\n\n## 36   Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\n## Use of derivatives\n\nING uses derivatives for economic hedging purposes to manage its asset and liability portfolios and structural risk positions. The primary objective of ING's hedging activities is to manage the risks which arises from structural imbalances in the duration and other profiles of its assets and liabilities. The objective of economic hedging is to enter into positions with an opposite risk profile to an identified risk exposure to reduce that exposure. The main risks which are being hedged are interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. These risks are primarily hedged with interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards/swaps.\n\nING uses credit derivatives to manage its economic exposure to credit risk, including total return swaps and credit default swaps, to sell or buy protection for credit risk exposures in the loan, investment, and trading portfolios. Hedge accounting is not applied in relation to these credit derivatives.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS are classified and accounted for in accordance with the nature of the instrument hedged and the type of IFRS hedge accounting model that is applicable. The three models applicable under IFRS are: fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, and hedge accounting of a net investment in a foreign operation. How and to what extent these models are applied are described under the relevant headings below. The company's detailed accounting policies for these three hedge models are set out in paragraph 1.5 'Financial instruments' of Note 1 'Basis of preparation and material accounting policy information'.\n\n## IBOR transition\n\nReference is made to the note 'Risk management/ IBOR Transition' for information on how ING is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates and ING's progress in completing the transition with respect to derivatives in hedge accounting relationships.\n\n## TLTRO\n\nIn 2022, ING hedged the interest rate risk of the TLTRO-III funding with derivatives and designated this in a fair value hedge relationship. In Q4 2022 the ECB changed the terms of the TLTRO-III, resulting in the discontinuation of the hedging relationship. The fair value hedge adjustment was amortized to profit or loss over the revised interest period (i.e. until the date the change in TLTRO-III terms became effective). The impact of this was recorded in net interest income. Refer to Note 20 'Net interest income' for more details.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nING's fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate instruments due to movements in market interest rates. ING's approach to manage market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in 'Risk management -Market risk'. ING's exposure to interest rate risk is disclosed in paragraph 'Interest rate risk in banking book'.\n\nING Group designates specific non-contractual risk components of hedged items. This is usually determined by designating benchmark interest rates such as EURIBOR, SOFR, SONIA or TONAR, between others, because the fair value of a fixed-rate instrument varies directly in response to changes in its benchmark interest rate.\n\nBy using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, ING also exposes itself to credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged item. ING minimises counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by clearing most of the derivatives through Central Clearing Counterparties. In addition, ING only enters into transactions with high-quality counterparties and requires posting collateral.\n\nING applies fair value hedge accounting on micro level in which one hedged item is hedged with one or multiple hedging instruments as well as on macro level whereby a portfolio of items is hedged with multiple hedging instruments. For these macro hedges of interest rate risk ING applies the EU carve-out. The EU 'carve-out' for macro hedging enables a group of derivatives (or proportions) to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting relating to hedging core deposits and under-hedging strategies. In retail operations, exposure on retail funding (savings and current accounts) and retail lending (mortgages) is initially offset. The remaining exposure is hedged in a portfolio hedge, using the EU carve-out, in which a portion of the retail lending portfolio and core deposits are designated as a hedged item for hedge accounting purposes.",

        "page_content": "- > 36   Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nFor portfolio hedges the fair value is projected based on contractual terms and other variables including prepayment expectations. These projected fair values of the portfolios form the basis for identifying the notional amount subject to interest rate risk that is designated under fair value hedge accounting.\n\nMicro fair value hedge accounting is mainly applied on issued debt securities and purchased debt instruments for hedging interest rate risk.\n\nBefore fair value hedge accounting is applied, ING determines whether an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument exists based on an evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. ING considers whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. ING evaluates whether the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to similar risks. In addition, ING is mainly using regression analysis to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nFor the macro hedge on the loan portfolio ING follows a dynamic hedging strategy. This means that on monthly basis, based on the new portfolio projection, the hedging relationship is renewed. From an operational point of view, the existing hedging relationship is adjusted based on the new portfolio projection and additional hedging instruments are added to the hedging relationship.\n\nING uses the following derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedge accounting relationship:\n\n| in EUR million                           | Assets 2023   | Liabilities   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|---------------|\n|                                          |               | 2023          | 2022     | 2022          |\n| As at 31 December                        |               |               |          |               |\n| Hedging instrument on interest rate risk |               |               |          |               |\n| - Interest rate swaps                    | 32,612        | 27,350        | 40,346   | 32,482        |\n| - Other interest derivatives             | 284           | 34            | 395      | 39            |\n\nThe derivatives used for fair value hedge accounting are included in the statement of financial position lineitem 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' for EUR 716 million (2022:\n\nEUR 836 million) respectively 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 113 million (2022: EUR 244 million). The difference between the gross carrying value as presented in the table and the net carrying value as presented in the statement of financial position is due to offsetting with other derivatives and collaterals paid or received.\n\nFor our main currencies the average fixed rate for interest rate swaps used in fair value hedge accounting are 1.32% (2022: 0.54%) for EUR and 3.93% (2022: 3.86%) for USD.\n\nThe following table shows the net notional amount of derivatives designated in fair value hedging, split into the maturity of the instruments.

        "page_content": "- > 36   Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nIn addition, the increase in hedged items is due to higher volumes in loans and advances and debt securities designated in hedge accounting. Discontinued hedges further mainly relate to the transfer of derivatives from UK based clearing houses to EU based clearing houses related to Brexit in 2020.\n\n## The main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u00b7 differences in maturities of the hedged item(s) and hedging instrument(s);\n- \u00b7 differences in timing of cash flows of the hedged item(s) and hedging instrument(s).\n- \u00b7 different interest rate curves applied to discount the hedged item(s) and hedging instrument(s);\n\nAdditionally, for portfolio (macro) fair value hedges of ING's fixed rate mortgage portfolio, ineffectiveness also arises from the disparity between expected and actual prepayments (prepayment risk).\n\nThere were no other sources of significant ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nING applies cash flow hedge accounting on micro and macro level. ING's cash flow hedges mainly consist of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against the exposure to variability in future cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates or are expected to be refunded or reinvested in the future. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities, based on contractual terms and other variables including estimates of prepayments. These projected cash flows form the basis for identifying the notional amount subject to interest rate risk or foreign currency exchange rate risk that is designated under cash flow hedge accounting.\n\nING's approach to manage market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk, is discussed in 'Risk management - Credit risk and Market risk'. ING determines the amount of the exposures to which it applies hedge accounting by assessing the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the future cash flows from its floating-rate assets and liabilities. This assessment is performed using analytical techniques.\n\nAs noted above for fair value hedges, by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, ING exposes itself to credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged items. This exposure is managed similarly to that for fair value hedges.\n\nGains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated under cash flow hedge accounting are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. Interest cash flows on these derivatives are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 'Net interest income' consistent with the manner in which the forecasted cash\n\nflows affect net result. The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\nING determines an economic relationship between the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument based on an evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. ING considers whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. ING evaluates whether the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to the hedged risk, such as the benchmark interest rate of foreign currency. In addition, a regression analysis is performed to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nING uses the following derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship:\n\n## Gross carrying value of derivatives used for cash flow hedge accounting\n\n| in EUR million                                           | Assets 2023   | Liabilities 2023   | Assets 2022   | Liabilities 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| As at 31 December                                        |               |                    |               |                    |\n| Hedging instrument on interest rate risk                 |               |                    |               |                    |\n| - Interest rate swaps                                    | 11,839        | 14,051             | 10,038        | 14,836             |\n| Hedging instrument on FX rate risk                       |               |                    |               |                    |\n| - Cross currency swaps                                   | 324           | 39                 |               |                    |\n| Hedging instrument on combined interest and FX rate risk |               |                    |               |                    |\n| - Cross currency interest rate swaps                     | 57            |                    | 428           | 168                |\n\nThe derivatives used for cash flow hedge accounting are included in the statement of financial position lineitem 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 440 million (2022: EUR 814 million) respectively 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 458 million (2022: EUR 1,275 million).

No material hedging relationship was discontinued as a result of the interest rate movements in 2023.\n\nThe main sources of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges are:\n\n- \u00b7 differences in timing of cash flows of the hedged item(s) and hedging instrument(s);\n- \u00b7 mismatches in reset frequency between hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nThe following table shows the movement of the cash flow hedge reserve:\n\n| in EUR million                          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance                         | -3,055 | -153   |\n| Value changes recognised in OCI         | 1,922  | -3,982 |\n| Amounts recycled to profit or loss      | -325   | -313   |\n| Income tax                              | -381   | 1,123  |\n| Exchange rate and other changes         | -103   | 20     |\n| Adjustment for non controlling interest | -116   | 251    |\n| Movement for the year                   | 997    | -2,901 |\n| Ending balance                          | -2,058 | -3,055 |\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nA foreign currency exposure arises from a net investment in subsidiaries that have a different functional currency from the presentation currency of ING. The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and ING's presentation currency, which causes the amount of the net investment to vary in the consolidated financial statements of ING. This risk may have a significant impact on ING's financial statements. ING's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so it is expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory capital ratios of ING and its subsidiaries.\n\nING's net investment hedges principally consist of derivatives (including currency forwards and swaps) and non-derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency denominated funding. When the hedging instrument is foreign currency denominated debt, ING assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in the spot rate (the offset method).\n\nGains and losses on the effective portions of derivatives designated under net investment hedge accounting are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. The balance in equity is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the related foreign subsidiary is disposed. The gains and losses on ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss in 'Valuation results and net trading income'.\n\nING has the following derivative financial instruments used for net investment hedging:\n\n| Gross carrying value of derivatives used for net investment hedging   | Assets   | Liabilities   | Assets   | Liabilities   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------|\n| in EUR million                                                        | 2023     | 2023          | 2022     | 2022          |\n| As at 31 December                                                     |          |               |          |               |\n| - FX forwards and Cross currency swaps                                | 100      | 92            | 119      | 83            |\n\nThe derivatives used for net investment hedge accounting are included in the statement of financial position line-item 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - Non-trading derivatives' EUR 100 million (2022: EUR 119 million) respectively 'Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - Non trading derivatives' EUR 92 million (2022: EUR 83 million).\n\nFor ING's main currencies the average exchange rates used in net investment hedge accounting for 2023 are EUR/USD 1.08 (2022: 1.06), EUR/PLN 4.54 (2022: 4.68), EUR/AUD 1.63 (2022: 1.52) and EUR/THB 37.65 (2022: 36.87).\n\nThe following table shows the notional amount of derivatives designated in net investment hedging split into the maturity of the instruments:\n\n## Maturity derivatives designated in net investment hedging\n\n| in EUR million                          | Less          | 1 to 3   | 3 to 12   | 1 to 2  years   | 2 to 3   | 3 to  4  years   | 4 to 5  years   | >5  years   |         |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|\n| As at 31 December 2023                  | than 1  month | months   | months    |                 | years    |                  |                 |             | Total   |\n| - FX forwards and cross  currency swaps | -6,009        | -4,576   | -87       |                 |          |                  |                 |             | -10,672 |\n| As at 31 December 2022                  |               |          |           |                 |          |                  |                 |             |         |\n| - FX forwards and Cross  currency swaps | -6,164        | -2,638   | -97       |                 |          |                  |                 |             | -8,899  |",

These balances are included in the maturity analysis as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Perpetual liabilities are included in the column 'Maturity not applicable'.\n- \u00b7 Derivative liabilities are included on a net basis if cash flows are settled net. For other derivative liabilities the contractual gross cash flow payable is included.\n- \u00b7 Undiscounted future coupon interest on financial liabilities payable is included in a separate line and in the relevant maturity bucket.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial liabilities are included based on a breakdown of the amounts per statement of financial position, per expected maturity.\n- \u00b7 Loans and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.\n\nING Group's expected cash flows on some financial liabilities vary significantly from contractual cash flows. Principal differences are in demand deposits from customers that are expected to remain stable or increase and in unrecognised loan commitments that are not all expected to be drawn down immediately. Reference is made to the liquidity risk paragraph in 'Risk Management - Funding and liquidity risk' for a description on how liquidity risk is managed.",

They serve to secure margin accounts and are used for other purposes required by law. Pledges are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for collateralised transactions including standard sale and repurchase agreements, securities lending and borrowing and derivatives margining. The financial assets pledged are as follows:\n\n| in EUR million                                        | 2023   | 2022               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Banks                                                 |        |                    |\n| -  Cash and balances with central banks               | 322    | 364                |\n| -  Loans and advances to banks                        | 3,305  | 4,007              |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss | 23,641 | 17,079             |\n| Financial assets at fair value through OCI            | 1,896  | 2,142              |\n| Securities at amortised cost                          | 2,672  | 3,578              |\n| Loans and advances to customers                       | 73,860 | 98,917             |\n| Other assets                                          | 357    | 596                |\n|                                                       |        | 106,052    126,682 |\n\nIn 2023 the financial assets pledged as collateral reduced due to the partial repayment of ING's TLTRO III. In addition, in some jurisdictions ING Bank N.V. has an obligation to maintain a reserve with central banks. As at 31 December 2023, the minimum mandatory reserve deposits with various central banks amount to EUR 11,653 million (2022: EUR 11,108 million).\n\n## Financial assets received as collateral\n\nThe financial assets received as collateral that can be sold or repledged in absence of default by the owner of the collateral consists of securities obtained through reverse repurchase transactions and securities borrowing transactions.\n\nThese transactions are generally conducted under standard market terms for most repurchase transactions and the recipient of the collateral has unrestricted right to sell or repledge it, provided that the collateral (or equivalent collateral) is returned to the counterparty at term.\n\n| in EUR million                                                         | 2023   | 2022               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Total received collateral available for sale or repledge at fair value |        |                    |\n| -  equity securities                                                   | 33,234 | 22,847             |\n| -  debt securities                                                     |        | 119,908    103,723 |\n| of which sold or repledged at fair value                               |        |                    |\n| -  equity securities                                                   | 20,526 | 18,613             |\n| -  debt securities                                                     | 86,448 | 66,636             |\n\n## Transfer of financial assets\n\nThe majority of ING's financial assets that have been transferred, but do not qualify for derecognition are debt and equity instruments used in securities lending or sale and repurchase transactions.\n\n## Transfer of financial assets not qualifying for derecognition\n\n|                                                                    | Securities lending   | Securities lending   | Securities lending   | Securities lending   | Sale and repurchase   | Sale and repurchase   | Sale and repurchase   | Sale and repurchase   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                                    | Equity               | Equity               |                      | Debt                 |                       | Equity                |                       | Debt                  |\n| in EUR million                                                     | 2023                 | 2022                 | 2023                 | 2022                 | 2023                  | 2022                  | 2023                  | 2022                  |\n| Transferred assets at carrying amount                              |                      |                      |                      |                      |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or  loss             | 3,894                | 2,087                |                      |                      | 7,357                 |                       | 6,357    11,780       | 7,178                 |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other  comprehensive income |                      |                      | 328                  | 499                  |                       |                       | 470                   | 453                   |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                    |                      |                      |                      |                      |                       |                       | 2,396                 | 4,637                 |\n| Securities at amortised cost                                       |                      |                      | 431                  | 435                  |                       |                       | 465                   | 261                   |\n| Associated liabilities at carrying amount 1                        |                      |                      |                      |                      |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss        | n/a                  | n/a                  | n/a                  |                      | n/a  11,010           | 6,245                 | 9,467                 | 8,932                 |\n\nThe table above does not include assets transferred to consolidated securitisation entities as the related assets remain recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.

        "page_content": "- > 40   Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\n## 40   Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe following tables include information about rights to offset and the related arrangements. The amounts included consist of all recognised financial instruments that are presented net in the statement of financial position under the IFRS netting criteria (legal right to offset and intention to settle net or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously) and amounts presented gross in the statement of financial position but subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar arrangements.\n\nAt ING Group amounts that are offset mainly relate to derivatives transactions, sale and repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements and cash pooling arrangements. A significant portion of offsetting is applied to OTC derivatives which are cleared through central clearing parties.\n\nRelated amounts not set off in the statement of financial position include transactions where:\n\n- \u00b7 The counterparty has an offsetting exposure and a master netting or similar arrangement is in place with a right to set off only in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy, or the offsetting criteria are otherwise not satisfied, and\n- \u00b7 In the case of derivatives and securities lending or sale and repurchase agreements, cash and non-cash collateral has been received or pledged to cover net exposure in the event of a default or other predetermined events. The effect of over-collateralisation is excluded.\n\nThe net amounts resulting after set off are not intended to represent ING's actual exposure to counterparty risk, as risk management employs a number of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements. Reference is made in the Risk Management Credit risk' section 'Credit risk mitigation'.",

In response to the needs of its customers, the Group offers financial products related to loans. These products include traditional off-balance sheet credit-related financial instruments.\n\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments in EUR million   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Contingent liabilities in respect of                    |         |         |\n| -  Guarantees                                           | 27,894  | 28,859  |\n| -  Irrevocable letters of credit                        | 14,925  | 15,682  |\n| -  Other                                                |         | 3       |\n|                                                         | 42,821  | 44,544  |\n| Guarantees issued by ING Groep N.V.                     | 197     | 336     |\n| Irrevocable facilities                                  | 166,810 | 161,940 |\n|                                                         | 209,828 | 206,820 |\n\nGuarantees relate both to credit and non-credit substitute guarantees. Credit substitute guarantees are guarantees given by ING Group in respect of credit granted to customers by a third party. Many of them are expected to expire without being drawn on and therefore do not necessarily represent future cash outflows.\n\nIrrevocable letters of credit mainly secure payments to third parties for a customer's foreign and domestic trade transactions in order to finance a shipment of goods. ING Group's credit risk in these transactions is limited since these transactions are collateralised by the commodity shipped and are of a short duration.\n\nOther contingent liabilities include acceptances of bills and are of a short-term nature. Other contingent liabilities also include contingent liabilities resulting from the operations of the Real Estate business including obligations under development and construction contracts.\n\nIrrevocable facilities mainly constitute unused portions of irrevocable credit facilities granted to corporate clients. Many of these facilities are for a fixed duration and bear interest at a floating rate. ING Group's credit risk and interest rate risk in these transactions is limited. The unused portion of irrevocable credit facilities is partly secured by customers' assets or counter-guarantees by the central governments and other public sector entities under the regulatory requirements. Irrevocable facilities also include commitments made to purchase securities to be issued by governments and private issuers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, ING Groep N.V. guarantees various US dollar debentures (that mature between 2024 and 2036) which were issued by a subsidiary of Voya Financial Inc. In accordance with the Shareholder's agreement, the net exposure of ING Groep N.V. as at 31 December 2023 was nil, as the outstanding principal amount of the US dollar debentures was fully covered with collateral of EUR 205 million (2022: EUR 344 million) pledged by Voya Financial Inc.\n\nIn addition to the items included in contingent liabilities, ING Group has issued certain guarantees as participant in collective arrangements of national banking funds and as a participant in required collective guarantee schemes which apply in different countries.\n\nING Bank N.V. provided a guarantee to the German Deposit Guarantee Fund ('Einlagensicherungsfonds' or ESF) under section 5 (10) of the by-laws of this fund, where ING Bank N.V. indemnifies the Association of German Banks Berlin against any losses it might incur as result of actions taken with respect to ING Germany. The ESF is a voluntary collective guarantee scheme for retail savings and deposits in excess of EUR 100,000.\n\nING uses Irrevocable Payment Commitments (IPCs) for a part of its contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). ING Group has EUR 346 million of IPCs outstanding to the SRF as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 283 million). Of these, EUR 63 million of IPCs were provided to the SRF during 2023 (2022: EUR 57 million). No IPCs were called by the SRF in 2023 (2022: nil). Cash collateral provided to the SRF is equal to the outstanding amount of IPCs.\n\nING also uses IPCs for a part of its contributions to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme in Germany. Contingent liabilities for such outstanding IPCs amount to EUR 273 million as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 237 million). Of these, EUR 36 million of IPCs were provided to the DGS during 2023 (2022: EUR 31 million). No IPCs were called by the DGS in 2023 (2022: nil). ING posted government bonds as collateral for the total nominal amount of EUR 319 million as at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 259 million).\n\nFurthermore we refer to Note 42 'Legal proceedings' for any contingent liabilities in respect of legal proceedings.",

        "page_content": "Contents Introduction Strategy and performance ESG overview Our leadership and corporate governance Risk management > 42   Legal proceedings\n\n## 42   Legal proceedings\n\nING Group and its consolidated subsidiaries are involved in governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations in the Netherlands and in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S., involving claims by and against them which arise in the ordinary course of their businesses, including in connection with their activities as lenders, broker-dealers, underwriters, issuers of securities and investors and their position as employers and taxpayers. In certain of such proceedings, very large or indeterminate amounts are sought, including punitive and other damages. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending or threatened governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations, ING is of the opinion that some of the proceedings and investigations set out below may have or have in the recent past had a significant effect on the financial position, profitability or reputation of the ING and/or the ING and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nSettlement agreement : On 4 September 2018, ING announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement with the Dutch Public Prosecution Service relating to previously disclosed investigations regarding various requirements for client on-boarding and the prevention of money laundering and corrupt practices. Following the entry into the settlement agreement, ING has experienced heightened scrutiny from authorities in various countries. ING is also aware, including as a result of media reports, that other parties may, among other things, seek to commence legal proceedings against ING in connection with the subject matter of the settlement. Certain parties filed requests with the Court of Appeal in The Netherlands to reconsider the prosecutor's decision to enter into the settlement agreement with ING and not to prosecute ING or (former) ING employees. In December 2020, the Court of Appeal issued its final ruling. In this ruling the prosecutors' decision to enter into the settlement agreement with ING was upheld, making the settlement final. However, in a separate ruling, the Court ordered the prosecution of ING's former CEO.\n\nLitigation by investors : In February 2024, ING and certain (former) board members were served with a writ of summons for litigation in The Netherlands on behalf of investors who claim to have suffered financial losses in connection with ING's disclosures on historic shortcomings in its financial economic crime policies, related risk management and control systems, the investigation by and settlement with the Dutch authorities in 2018 and related risks for ING. We do not agree with the allegations and will defend ourselves against these and the claimed damages of around EUR 500 million. We follow IFRS rules for taking legal provisions and would disclose material amounts in that regard if and when applicable - which currently is not the case.\n\nFindings regarding AML processes: As previously disclosed, after its September 2018 settlement with Dutch authorities concerning anti-money laundering matters, and in the context of significantly increased attention on the prevention of financial economic crime, ING has experienced heightened scrutiny by authorities in various countries. The interactions with such regulatory and judicial authorities have included, and can be expected to continue to include, onsite visits, information requests, investigations and other enquiries. Such interactions, as well as ING's internal assessments in connection with its global enhancement programme, have in some cases resulted in satisfactory outcomes, and also have resulted in,\n\nand may continue to result in, findings, or other conclusions which may require appropriate remedial actions by ING, or may have other consequences. ING intends to continue to work in close cooperation with authorities as it seeks to improve its management of non-financial risks in terms of policies, tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and behaviour.\n\nIn January 2022, a Luxembourg investigating judge informed ING Luxembourg that he intends to instruct the relevant prosecutor to prepare a criminal indictment regarding alleged shortcomings in the AML process at ING Luxembourg. Although this matter still remains at an early procedural stage and it is currently not possible to determine how this matter will be resolved or the timing of any such resolution, ING does not expect a financial outcome of this matter to have a material effect.\n\nING's subsidiary Payvision is the subject of a criminal investigation by Dutch authorities regarding money laundering and various requirements of the Dutch act on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Financing, focusing on the period from 1 January 2015 up to and including April 2020. Payvision is cooperating with such ongoing investigation. In October 2021, the phasing out of Payvision was announced. The phasing out of activities and the transfer of customers to a new service provider were completed in 2022. At the request of Payvision, its license has been withdrawn. It is currently not feasible to determine how the ongoing investigation may be resolved or the timing of any such resolution, nor to estimate reliably the possible timing, scope or amounts of any resulting fines, penalties and/or other outcome.\n\nING continues to take steps to enhance its management of compliance risks and embed stronger awareness across the whole organisation. These steps are part of the global KYC programme and set of initiatives, which includes enhancing KYC files and working on various structural improvements in compliance policies, tooling, monitoring, governance, knowledge and behaviour.\n\nTax cases : Because of the geographic spread of its business, ING may be subject to tax audits, investigations and procedures in numerous jurisdictions at any point in time. Although the Issuer believes that it has adequately provided for all its tax positions, the ultimate resolution of these audits, investigations and procedures is uncertain and may result in liabilities which are materially different from the amounts recognised.\n\nLitigation regarding products of a former subsidiary in Mexico: Proceedings in which ING is involved include complaints and lawsuits concerning the performance of certain interest sensitive products that were sold by a former subsidiary of ING in Mexico.\n\nClaims regarding accounts with predecessors of ING Bank T\u00fcrkiye: ING Bank T\u00fcrkiye has received numerous claims from (former) customers of legal predecessors of ING Bank T\u00fcrkiye. The claims are based on offshore accounts held with these banks, which banks were seized by the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund ('SDIF') prior to the acquisition of ING Bank T\u00fcrkiye in 2007 from OYAK. Pursuant to the acquisition contract, ING can claim compensation from SDIF if a court orders ING to pay amounts to the offshore account holders.",

        "page_content": "- > 42   Legal proceedings\n\nSDIF has made payments to ING pursuant to such compensation requests, but filed various lawsuits to receive those amounts back. These lawsuits are ongoing in favour of ING Bank T\u00fcrkiye. In April 2022, the Turkish Supreme Court decided that the prescription period for the offshore account holders' compensation claims starts on the transfer date of the account holders to the offshore accounts. The exact impact of this decision on the ongoing cases is not clear yet. At this moment it is not possible to assess the outcome of these procedures nor to provide an estimate of the (potential) financial effect of these claims.\n\nInterest rate derivatives claims: In the past a uniform recovery framework for Dutch SME clients with interest rate derivatives was established by a committee of independent experts appointed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance. In the context of this recovery framework most claims have been settled, however ING is still involved in several legal proceedings in the Netherlands with respect to interest rate derivatives that were sold to clients in connection with floating interest rate loans in order to hedge the interest rate risk of the loans. These proceedings are based on several legal grounds, depending on the facts and circumstances of each specific case, inter alia alleged breach of duty of care, insufficient information provided to the clients on the product and its risks and other elements related to the interest rate derivatives that were sold to clients. In some cases, the court has ruled in favour of the claimants and awarded damages, annulled the interest rate derivative or ordered repayment of certain amounts to the claimants.\n\nInterest surcharges claims: ING received complaints and was involved in litigation with certain individuals in the Netherlands regarding increases in interest surcharges with respect to several credit products, including but not limited to commercial property. ING has reviewed the relevant product portfolio. The provision previously taken has been reversed for certain of these complaints. All claims are dealt with individually. Thus far, the courts have ruled in favour of ING in each case, ruling that ING was allowed to increase the interest surcharge based upon the essential obligations in the contract. In a relevant case the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in favor of another Dutch bank, addressing the question whether or not a bank is allowed to increase interest surcharges unilaterally. The Supreme Court ruled affirmatively and referred the case to the Court of Appeal in The Hague. The Court of Appeal also ruled in favour of the Dutch bank in October 2022 and this ruling has been confirmed by the Supreme Court in its ruling of 22 December 2023. ING will continue to deal with all claims individually. In the last pending case against ING, the Court of Appeal dismissed all claims in its ruling of 9 January 2024. The time limit for lodging a cassation appeal at the Supreme Court expires on 9 April 2024.\n\nMortgage expenses claims: ING Spain has received claims and is involved in procedures with customers regarding reimbursement of expenses associated with the formalisation of mortgages. In most first instance court proceedings the expense clause of the relevant mortgage contract has been declared null and ING Spain has been ordered to reimburse all or part of the applicable expenses. Since 2018, the Spanish Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice have issued rulings setting out which party should bear notary, registration, agency, and stamp duty costs. In January 2021, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that valuation costs of mortgages, signed prior to 16 June 2019, the date the new mortgage law entered into force, should be borne by the bank. Media attention for the statute of limitations applicable to the right to claim reimbursement of costs resulted in an increased number of claims at the beginning of 2021. In June\n\n2021, the Supreme Court published a press release informing of its decision to ask the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling regarding the criteria that should be applied to determine the date from which the action for claiming the reimbursement of mortgage expenses is considered to be expired. Two other preliminary rulings that were submitted by Catalunya courts also related to the limitation period. In January 2024, the European Court of Justice ruled on one of the complaints filed by the Catalunya Provincial Court. The European Court of Justice determined that the limitation period for the judicial claim for reimbursement of expenses cannot begin to run from a Supreme Court decision declaring the clause null and void, nor from the moment of the payment of the expenses. The European Court of Justice indicated that it is up to national case-law to determine the criterion that should be applied for the calculation of the limitation period, so uncertainty remains until the Supreme Court unifies the case-law. Currently, ING is reviewing the strategy in order to address the latest developments.\n\nING Spain was also included, together with other Spanish banks, in three class actions filed by customer associations. In one of the class actions an agreement was reached with the association. In another class action ING filed an appeal asking the Spanish Court of Appeal to determine that the ruling of the court of first instance is only applicable to the consumers that were part of the case. The National Court has revoked the ruling and declared that the consumers will not be able to initiate an action for compensation based on the first instance ruling, as the claimant association intended. This last decision is not yet final, as it has been appealed in the Supreme Court. A provision has been established in the past and has been adjusted where appropriate.\n\nImtech claims: In the Netherlands, the trustees in the bankruptcy of Imtech N.V. ('Imtech') claimed in September 2018 from various financing parties, including ING, payment of what the security agent has collected following bankruptcy or intends to collect, repayment of all that was repaid to the financing parties, as well as compensation for the repayment of a bridge financing, provided by ING and another bank. This matter was settled by all Imtech financiers, including ING, and the Imtech trustees in October 2023.\n\nIn January 2018, ING Bank received a claim from Stichting ImtechClaim.nl and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. on behalf of certain (former) shareholders of Imtech. Furthermore, in March 2018, ING Bank received another claim on the same subject matter from the Dutch Association of Stockholders (Vereniging van Effectenbezitters, 'VEB'). In June 2022, VEB reiterated and further substantiated its claim in a letter to ING. Each of the claimants allege inter alia that shareholders were misled by the prospectus of the rights issues of Imtech in July 2013 and October 2014. ING Bank, being one of the underwriters of the rights issues, is held liable by the claimants for the damages that investors in Imtech would have suffered. ING Bank responded to the claimants denying any and all responsibility in relation to the allegations made in the relevant letters. ING (and the other underwriting banks) received a tolling letter (stuitingsbrief) from Stichting Imtechclaim.nl, Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. and individual shareholders in December 2022, in connection with the allegations made in their original claim letter of January 2018. At this moment it is not possible to assess the outcome of these claims nor to provide an estimate of the (potential) effect of these claims.",

        "page_content": "- > 42   Legal proceedings\n\nClaims regarding mortgage loans in Swiss franc in Poland: ING Poland is a defendant in several lawsuits with retail customers who took out mortgage loans indexed to the Swiss franc. Such customers have alleged that the mortgage loan contract contains abusive clauses. One element that the court is expected to consider in determining whether such contracts contain abusive clauses is whether the rules to determine the exchange rate used for the conversion of the loan from Polish zloty to Swiss franc are unambiguous and verifiable. In December 2020, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) proposed that lenders offer borrowers voluntary out-of-court settlements on foreign-currency mortgage disputes, with mortgages indexed to Swiss franc serving as a reference point. In February 2021, ING Poland announced its support for this initiative and in October 2021 began offering the settlements to the borrowers following the PFSA's proposal. The Polish Supreme Court was expected to provide further clarity on this topic in a ruling scheduled for November 2021, however the court's session on this matter was postponed and the date of the next session has not yet been announced. In October 2022, a hearing of the European Court of Justice (\"CJEU\") was held inter alia on the question whether, after cancellation of a contract regarding a Swiss franc loan by a court, banks may still charge interests for the amount borrowed under such loan prior to cancellation.\n\nOn 15 June 2023 the CJEU issued a ruling. It ruled that under EU law when a loan agreement indexed to the Swiss franc is declared null and void, banks cannot claim any remuneration (i.e. interest) for the duration the principal amount was available to the customer. The customer, however, may assert claims against banks in addition to reimbursement of interest and instalments previously paid to the bank. ING has recorded a portfolio provision.\n\nCertain Consumer Credit Products: In October 2021, ING announced that it would offer compensation to its Dutch retail customers in connection with certain revolving consumer loans with variable interest rates that allegedly did not sufficiently follow market rates. This announcement was made in response to several rulings by the Dutch Institute for Financial Disputes (Kifid) regarding similar products at other banks. ING has recognized a provision of EUR 180 million in 2021 for compensation and costs in connection with this matter. On 22 December 2021, ING announced that it reached an agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association (Consumentenbond) on the compensation methodology for revolving credits. Based on a Kifid ruling regarding similar products, ING has amended its previously announced compensation scheme by also compensating interest on interest. In the third quarter of 2022, ING increased its provision for this matter by EUR 75 million. In the fourth quarter of 2022, ING and the Dutch Consumers' Association reached an agreement on the compensation of customers who have had an overdraft facility or a revolving credit card with a variable interest rate. ING has started compensating such customers in line with Kifid rulings about revolving credits including 'interest-on-interest'-effect in these cases. The compensation process is taking more time than expected. Timelines for compensation vary depending on customer and product segmentation and are dependent on the availability of data.\n\nClimate litigation: In January 2024, Friends of the Earth Netherlands (Milieudefensie) announced that it holds ING liable for alleged contribution to climate change and threatens to initiate legal proceedings against ING. If necessary, we will defend our science-based climate approach in court.\n\n## 43   Consolidated companies and businesses acquired and divested Acquisitions and divestments\n\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2023, 2022 or 2021, and there was no significant divestment in 2023.\n\n## Divestments 2022\n\nING announced at 13 December 2022 that it has sold their interest (80%) in Intersoftware Holding BV to the Sky Group/ DIAS and realised a transaction result of EUR 11.0 million which consists of a profit of EUR 7.0 on sale of InterSoftware Holding BV and the release of the redemption liability of EUR 3.0 million.\n\n## Divestments 2021\n\nIn  2021 ING decided to discontinue the Czech Retail Banking activities entailing the closure of retail customer accounts /mutual funds and the sale of assets comprising the related government bond portfolio. The discontinuation of the Czech retail Banking activities in 2021 resulted in EUR 2.5 billion saving accounts being transferred to Raiffeisenbank and the government bond portfolio with a carrying amount of EUR 0.5 billion being sold.\n\nAt 12 July 2021, ING announced that it has reached an agreement to transfer ING's Retail Banking operations in Austria to Bank99. Under the terms of the agreement, approximately EUR 1.7 billion of savings deposits and approximately EUR 1.0 billion of mortgages, approximately EUR 0.4 billion other personal lending and approximately EUR 0.4 billion loans to banks of ING Austria have been transferred to Bank99. In December 2021 the transaction was completed and a loss on disposal of EUR 26 million was realised. In 2022 some final closing activities resulted in an additional loss of EUR 1 million. ING Austria was included in the segment Retail Challengers & Growth Markets.\n\nIn 2021, ING and the board of Makelaarsland agreed to continue Makelaarsland independently. The new board will take over all clients and employees, and services to clients will continue unchanged. The negative result on disposal of group companies from this management buyout amounted to approximately EUR 3 million.\n\nOn 28 October 2021 ING announced that its subsidiary Payvision will start phasing out its services as a payment service provider and acquirer.

ING's departure from the France retail banking market resulted in transferring EUR 9.7 billion saving accounts to Boursorama. ING will continue its Wholesale Banking activities in France, with a focus on strengthening its position and the ambition to be the go-to bank for sustainable finance.\n\n## 44   Principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nFor the majority of ING's principal subsidiaries, ING Groep N.V. has control because it either directly or indirectly owns more than half of the voting power. For subsidiaries in which the interest held is below 50%, control exists based on the combination of ING's financial interest and its rights from other contractual arrangements which result in control over the operating and financial policies of the entity.\n\nFor each of the subsidiaries listed, the voting rights held equal the proportion of ownership interest and consolidation by ING is based on the majority of ownership.\n\nFor the principal investments in associates and joint ventures ING Group has significant influence but not control. Significant influence generally results from a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, but also the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies through situations including, but not limited to one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Representation on the board of directors;\n- \u00b7 Interchange of managerial personnel.\n- \u00b7 Participation in the policymaking process; and\n\nThe principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures of ING Groep N.V. and their statutory place of incorporation or primary place of business are as follows:\n\n## Principal subsidiaries, investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nProportion of ownership and interest held by the group\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n| Subsidiary                                    | Statutory place of  Incorporation   | Country of operation     |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|-------|\n| ING Bank N.V.                                 | Amsterdam                           | the Netherlands          | 100 % | 100 % |\n| Bank Mendes Gans N.V.                         | Amsterdam                           | the Netherlands          | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Belgium S.A./N.V.                         | Brussels                            | Belgium                  | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Luxembourg S.A.                           | Luxembourg City                     | Luxembourg               | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING-DiBa AG                                   | Frankfurt am Main                   | Germany                  | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Bank Slaski S.A. 1                        | Katowice                            | Poland                   | 75 %  | 75 %  |\n| ING Financial Holdings Corporation            | Delaware                            | United States of America | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Bank A.S.                                 | Istanbul                            | T\u00fcrkiye                  | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Bank (Australia) Ltd                      | Sydney                              | Australia                | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Commercial Finance B.V.                   | Amsterdam                           | the Netherlands          | 100 % | 100 % |\n| ING Groenbank N.V.                            | Amsterdam                           | the Netherlands          | 100 % | 100 % |\n| Investments in associates and joint  ventures |                                     |                          |       |       |\n| TMBThanachart Bank Public Company  Ltd 2      | Bangkok                             | Thailand                 | 23 %  | 23 %  |\n\n## 45   Structured entities\n\nING Group's activities involve transactions with various structured entities (SE) in the normal course of its business. A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. ING Group's involvement in these entities varies and includes both debt financing and equity financing of these entities as well as other relationships. Based on its accounting policies, ING establishes whether these involvements result in no significant influence, significant influence, joint control or control over the structured entity.\n\nThe structured entities over which ING can exercise control are consolidated. ING may provide support to these consolidated structured entities as and when appropriate. However, this is fully reflected in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group as all assets and liabilities of these entities are included and off-balance sheet commitments are disclosed.",

        "page_content": "- > 45   Structured entities\n\nING's activities involving structured entities are explained below in the following categories:\n\n- 1. Consolidated ING originated securitisation programmes;\n- 2. Consolidated ING originated Covered bond programme (CBC);\n- 3. Consolidated ING sponsored Securitisation programme (Mont Blanc);\n- 4. Unconsolidated Securitisation programme; and\n- 5. Other structured entities.\n\n## 1. Consolidated ING originated securitisation programmes\n\nING Group enters into liquidity management securitisation programmes in order to obtain funding and improve liquidity. Within the programme ING Group sells ING originated assets to a structured entity. The underlying exposures include residential mortgages and SME loans in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Australia and Germany.\n\nThe structured entity issues securitised notes (traditional securitisations) which are eligible collateral for central bank liquidity purposes. In most programmes ING Group acts as investor of the securitised notes. ING Group continues to consolidate these structured entities if it is deemed to control the entities.\n\nThe structured entity issues securitisation notes in two or more tranches, of which the senior tranche obtains a high rating (AAA or AA) by a rating agency. The retained tranche can subsequently be used by ING Group as collateral in the money market for secured borrowings.\n\nING Group originated various securitisations, as at 31 December 2023, these consisted of approximately EUR 67 billion (2022: EUR 65 billion) of senior and subordinated notes, of which approximately EUR 2 billion (2022: EUR 1 billion) were issued externally. The underlying exposures are residential mortgages and SME loans. Apart from the third party funding, these securitisations did not impact ING Group's Consolidated statement of financial position and profit or loss.\n\nIn 2023, there are no non-controlling interests as part of the securitisation structured entities that are significant to ING Group. ING Group for the majority of the securitisation vehicles provides the funding for the entity except for EUR 2 billion (2022: EUR 1 billion).\n\nIn addition ING Group originated various securitisations for liquidity management optimisation purposes which consist of senior secured portfolio loans issued to ING subsidiaries in Germany. The underlying exposures were senior loans to large corporations and financial institutions, and real estate finance loans, mainly in the Netherlands. As at 31 December 2023, all securitized loans are redeemed (2022: EUR 444 million).\n\n## 2. Consolidated ING originated covered bond programme (CBC)\n\nING Group has entered into a covered bond programme. Under the covered bond programme ING issues bonds. The payment of interest and principal is guaranteed by the ING administered structured entities, ING Covered Bond Company B.V., and ING SB Covered Bond Company B.V. In order for these entities to fulfil their guarantee, ING legally transfers mainly Dutch mortgage loans originated by ING. Furthermore, ING offers protection against deterioration of the mortgage loans. The entities are consolidated by ING Group.\n\n## Covered bond programme\n\n|                              | Fair value pledged mortgage loans   |        |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------|\n| in EUR million               | 2023                                | 2022   |\n| Dutch Covered Bond Companies | 27,148                              | 21,379 |\n|                              | 27,148                              | 21,379 |\n\nIn addition, subsidiaries of ING in Germany, Belgium, Poland and Australia also issued covered bonds with pledged mortgages loans of approximately EUR 29,950 million (2022: EUR 24,880 million) in total.\n\nFor the covered bond programme, third-party investors in securities issued by the structured entity have recourse to the assets of the entity and to the assets of ING Group.\n\n## 3. Consolidated ING sponsored Securitisation programme (Mont Blanc)\n\nIn the normal course of business, ING Group structures financing transactions for its clients by assisting them in obtaining sources of liquidity by selling the clients' receivables or other financial assets to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The senior positions in these transactions may be funded by the ING administered multi seller Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) conduit Mont Blanc Capital Corp. (rated A-1/P-1). Mont Blanc Capital Corp. funds itself externally  in the ABCP markets.\n\nIn its role as administrative agent, ING Group facilitates these transactions by acting as administrative agent, swap counterparty and liquidity provider to Mont Blanc Capital Corp. ING Group also provides support facilities (i.e. liquidity) backing the transactions funded by the conduit. The types of asset currently in the Mont Blanc conduit include trade receivables, consumer finance receivables, car leases and residential mortgages.\n\nING Group supports the commercial paper programmes by providing Mont Blanc Capital Corp. with shortterm liquidity facilities. Once drawn these facilities bear normal credit risk.\n\nThe liquidity facilities, provided to Mont Blanc are EUR 2,268 million (2022: EUR 2,446 million). The drawn liquidity amount is nil as at 31 December 2023 (2022: nil).",

        "page_content": "- > 45   Structured entities\n\nThe standby liquidity facilities are reported under irrevocable facilities. All facilities, which vary in risk profile, are granted to the Mont Blanc Capital Corp. subject to normal ING Group credit and liquidity risk analysis procedures. The fees received for services provided and for facilities are charged subject to market conditions.\n\n## 4. Unconsolidated Securitisation programme\n\nIn 2013 ING transferred financial assets (mortgage loans) for an amount of approximately EUR 2 billion to a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The transaction resulted in full derecognition of the financial assets from ING's statement of financial position. Following this transfer ING continues to have two types of on-going involvement in the transferred assets: as counterparty to the SPE of a non-standard interest rate swap, which is recognized as a non-trading derivative and as servicer of the transferred assets. ING has an option to unwind the transaction by redeeming all notes at their principal outstanding amount, in the unlikely event of changes in accounting and/or regulatory requirements that significantly impact the transaction. The fair value of the swap held by ING at 31 December 2023 amounted to EUR -26 million (2022: EUR -40 million); fair value changes on this swap recognised in the statement of profit or loss in 2023 were EUR 14 million (2022: EUR -6 million). Service fee income recognised, for the role as administrative agent, in the statement of profit or loss in 2023 amounted to EUR 1 million (2022: EUR 1 million). The cumulative income recognised in profit or loss since derecognition amounts to EUR 19 million (2022: EUR 18 million).\n\n## 5. Other structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, ING Group enters into transactions with structured entities as counterparty. Predominantly in its structured finance operations, ING can be instrumental in facilitating the creation of these structured entity counterparties. These entities are generally not included in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group, as ING facilitates these transactions as administrative agent by providing structuring, accounting, funding, lending, and operation services.\n\nING Group offers various investment fund products to its clients. ING Group does not invest in these investment funds for its own account nor acts as the fund manager.\n\n## 46   Related parties\n\nIn the normal course of business, ING Group enters into various transactions with related parties. Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operating decisions. Related parties of ING Group include, among others, its associates, joint ventures, key management personnel, and various defined benefit and contribution plans. For post-employment benefit plans, reference is made to Note 33 'Pensions and other post-employment benefits' Transactions between related parties include rendering or receiving of services, leases, transfers under finance arrangements and provisions of guarantees or collateral. All transactions with related parties\n\ntook place at conditions customary in the market. There are no significant provisions for doubtful debts or individually significant bad debt expenses recognised on outstanding balances with related parties.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\n## Transactions with ING Group's main associates and joint ventures\n\n|                               |   Associates | Associates   | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|\n| in EUR million                |         2023 | 2022         | 2023             | 2022             |\n| Assets                        |          121 | 121          |                  |                  |\n| Liabilities                   |          424 | 309          | 1                | 1                |\n| Off-balance sheet commitments |           20 | 28           |                  |                  |\n| Income received               |           10 | 12           |                  |                  |\n| Expenses paid                 |            3 |              |                  |                  |\n\nAssets, liabilities, commitments, and income related to Associates and joint ventures result from transactions which are executed as part of the normal Banking business.

This involves not only managing, planning and allocating capital within ING Group, ING Bank and its various entities, but also helping to execute necessary capital market transactions, term (capital) funding and risk management transactions. ING takes an integrated approach to assess the adequacy of its capital position in relation to its risk profile and operating environment. This means GT Balance Sheet & Capital Management takes into account both regulatory and internal, economic based metrics and requirements as well as the interests of key stakeholders such as shareholders and rating agencies.\n\nING applies the following main capital definitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Common equity Tier 1 capital (CET1) - is defined as shareholders' equity less regulatory adjustments. CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio.\n- \u00b7 Tier 1 capital - is defined as CET1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 (hybrid) securities and other regulatory adjustments. Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the Tier 1 capital ratio.\n- \u00b7 Total capital - is Tier 1 capital plus subordinated Tier 2 liabilities and regulatory adjustments. Total capital divided by risk-weighted assets equals the Total capital ratio.\n- \u00b7 CET1 ratio target - is built on the CET1 requirements specified for ING, potential increase in the regulatory requirement of the Countercyclical Buffer, the potential impact of a standardised and pre-determined stress scenario and general uncertainties.\n- \u00b7 Leverage ratio (LR) - is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage exposure.\n- \u00b7 Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) - is Total capital plus senior unsecured bonds and amortisations. TLAC ratios are based on both risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure.\n- \u00b7 Minimum Required Eligible Liabilities (MREL) - is Total capital plus senior unsecured bonds and amortisations. MREL ratios are based on both risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure.\n\n## Capital developments\n\nING's capital position remained strong despite the challenging geopolitical environment. At both the consolidated and entity level, ING has sufficient buffers to withstand various stressed scenarios.\n\nING's CET1 target level of around 12.50% is well above the prevailing Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) level of 10.98%, implying a management buffer of about 150 basis points.\n\nING Group's capital ratios at the end of the year increased compared to 2022 primarily due to higher net profit after dividend reserving, coupled with lower risk-weighted assets. Besides the regular 50% dividend distribution, ING distributed an additional EUR 1.5 billion and EUR 2.5 billion as next steps to converge the",

Between 11 May 2023 and 13 October 2023, 121.3 million of ordinary shares have been repurchased with a total consideration of EUR 1,566 million.\n- \u00b7 An additional distribution of EUR 2.5 billion, by means of a share buyback programme, was announced on 2 November 2023. Between 3 November 2023 and 5 February 2024, 194.8 million of ordinary shares have been repurchased with a total consideration of EUR 2,508 million.\n\n## Processes for managing capital\n\nGT Balance Sheet & Capital Management ensures adherence to ING's solvency risk appetite statements by planning and executing capital management transactions. The ongoing assessment and monitoring of capital adequacy is embedded in the capital planning process as part of the ICAAP framework. As part of the dynamic business planning process, ING prepares a capital and funding plan on a regular basis for all its material businesses and assesses continuously the timing, need and feasibility for capital management actions in scope of its execution strategy. Sufficient financial flexibility should be preserved to meet important financial objectives. Risk appetite statements are at the foundation of the capital plan and are cascaded to the different businesses in line with ING's risk management framework. Contingency capital measures and early warning indicators are in place in conjunction with ING's contingency and recovery plan to support the strategy in times of stress.\n\nAdverse planning and stress testing, which reflect the outcome of the annual risk assessment, are integral components of ING's risk and capital management framework. It allows to (i) identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in ING's businesses, business model, portfolios or operating environment; (ii) understand the sensitivities of the core assumptions used in ING's strategic and capital plan; and (iii) improve decisionmaking and business steering through balancing risk and return following a forward looking and prudent management approach.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nCapital adequacy and the use of required regulatory capital are based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (The Basel Committee) and the European Union Directives, as implemented by the Dutch Central Bank and the ECB for supervisory purposes. In 2010, the Basel Committee issued new solvency and liquidity requirements that superseded Basel II, implemented in the EU via CRR / CRD. In accordance with the CRR the minimum Pillar 1 capital requirements applicable to ING Group are: a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 ratio of 6.0% and a Total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe overall SREP CET1 requirement (including buffer requirements) for ING Group at a consolidated level increased during 2023 due to changes in the Countercyclical Buffer and was 10.98% at the end of December 2023. This requirement is the sum of a 4.5% Pillar I requirement, a 0.98% Pillar II requirement, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), a 0.50% Countercyclical Buffer (CCyB) and a 2.5% O-SII (Other Systemically Important Institutions) buffer that is set separately for Dutch systemic banks by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank). This requirement excludes the Pillar II guidance, which is not disclosed.\n\nING's fully loaded CET1 requirement stood at 10.76% in 4Q2023 (4Q2022: 10.98%), which is lower than the prevailing CET1 ratio requirement as a result of the reduction in the Pillar II requirement applicable as of 1 January 2024 and a 0.50% lower O-SII buffer requirement effective as of 31 May 2024. This is partly offset by various countercyclical buffers becoming effective over the coming quarters. The fully loaded CET1 requirement of 10.76% also reflects the increase from the re-activation of the countercyclical buffer in Belgium to 1% from 4Q2024 which will be phased in over the coming quarters.\n\nThe Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) trigger level stood at 10.98% in 4Q2023 for CET1, 12.81% for Tier 1 Capital and 15.25% for Total Capital. These MDA levels are in line with the application of Art.104a in CRD V, which allows ING to partly fulfill the total Pillar II requirement (1.75%) with Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As per 1 January 2024, the Pillar II requirement is 1.65%. As per 1 January 2023 a MDA requirement on the leverage ratio of 3.5% applies to ING Group. In the event that ING Group breaches an MDA level, ING may face restrictions on dividend payments, coupons on AT1 securities and payment of variable remuneration.\n\n## Ratings\n\nING's credit ratings and outlook are shown in the table below.

This mitigates the prospect of disruptions in the financial intermediation process that are severe enough to adversely impact real economic activity. (Based on ECB  definition of financial stability).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Anti-corruption, fraud and financial crime | Corruption is defined as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain, which can be instigated by individuals or organisations. It includes practices such as facilitation payments, fraud, extortion,  collusion, and money laundering. It also includes an offer or receipt of any gift, loan, fee, reward, or other advantage to or from any person as an inducement to do something that is dishonest, illegal, or  a breach of trust in the conduct of the undertaking's business. This can include cash or in-kind benefits, such as free goods, gifts, and holidays, or special personal services provided for the purpose of an  improper advantage, or that can result in moral pressure to receive such an advantage. (Based on ESRS definition of Anti-corruption, fraud and financial crime). |\n| Data privacy and security                  | The category addresses management of risks related to collection, retention, and use of sensitive, confidential, and/or proprietary customer or user data. It includes social issues that may arise from  incidents such as data breaches in which personally identifiable information (PII) and other user or customer data may be exposed. It addresses a company's strategy, policies, and practices related to IT  infrastructure, staff training, record keeping, cooperation with law enforcement, and other mechanisms used to ensure security of customer or user data.

The category addresses the company's ability to provide  customers with financial services and financial products that are aligned with societal expectations. Furthermore, the category addresses qualities inherent to the design and delivery of financial  products and services where customer welfare may be in question. (Based on SASB definition).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Society welfare                            | Engaging with our local communities through partnerships and sponsorships, for example, to support with financial health improvement.

Mobile represents the logins (contacts) to the mobile app and those logins to the m-site (mobile device login through the website) done by retail operative private individuals customers in a quarter.\n\n## Net Promoter Score\n\nThe Net Promoter Score is a measure for customer satisfaction and loyalty. The measure is derived from the survey question on the scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely likely): 'How likely is it that you would recommend a product or brand to a friend, family member or colleague?' (RB) and 'how likely are you to recommend ING to a colleague or business partner?' (WB). The score is calculated as the difference between the percentage of promoters (who rate ING as 9 or 10, and detractors (rating ING with a score of 6 or below).\n\n## Digi Index Score\n\nThe basis of digi index concerns the straight through process (STP) percentage of the volume of a customer journey handled without any manual intervention. The STP is calculated for 33 global processes for our Retail countries (the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, Italy, Romania, T\u00fcrkiye and Australia), covering processes such as daily banking, insurance, investments, KYC, lending, mortgage and saving value chains. The processes are aligned and consistent throughout these countries.\n\nEach quarter, every country reports the STP rate of the 33 global customer journeys. The STP is calculated with the use of automated scripts, which run per process. The country digi index score is calculated by taking the average of those journeys STP rates. The overall ING digi index rate concerns a weighted average and considers both the country STP rates as well as the active customer numbers per country. A customer is considered active when the account has at least one active product category by reporting date.\n\n## Channel Availability\n\nRetail Banking\n\nRetail Banking Channel Availability represents the availability of the channels in the Netherlands and Belgium. The availability of the two countries is weighted using the number of primary customers per\n\ncountry. For the definition of primary customer, please see the description further on in this chapter. The average availability is calculated for prime time (service window 6:30h - 1.00h) of the critical channels Mobile & Internet. The channels are considered 'available' when the basic functionalities are operational, meaning that customers are able to log in, view balances and initiate payment transactions. To measure the availability of the channel we trigger a script every five minutes from an external environment that imitates customer behaviour using the channel to test if the functionality is available from a customer point of view. Based on these measurements, the availability of the channels for our customers within the service window is calculated. In addition to this, there are different types of monitoring in place for our channels and applications for health checking and alerting.\n\n## Wholesale Banking\n\nWholesale Banking Channel Availability measures the availability of the channels Inside Business Payments and Inside Business Connect.\n\n- 1. Inside Business Payments (IBP) is an online banking solution that helps the customer manage its ING- or third-party bank accounts globally. IBP is measured as available when during the service window, the customer is able to log in and use all the payment functionalities (e.g. able to select all payment-formats and countries, initiate and sign payments; reporting; archiving & billing). The service window is 0:00h 24:00h (7x24) excluding the planned pre-announced maintenance done during the maintenance window agreed, between Saturday 00:00 and Sunday 24:00h. IBP is considered to be available when the synthetic monitoring system and/or customer interaction proves it is possible to initiate and sign a payment.\n- 2. Inside Business Connect (IBC) offers a safe and reliable solution for automated processing of large transaction volumes or automated receipt of various reports. It enables a host-to-host connection between the customers' IT systems and ING. IBC is considered to be available when the synthetic monitoring system or/and customer interaction proves it is possible to send in a file. The service window is 24*7 (excluding pre-announced changes agreed with the internal business partner).\n\n## ING Private Cloud (IPC) adaption ratio\n\nThe adoption ratio is based on physical cores and measures how much of the global ING-owned infrastructure workloads is running on IPC. The adoption ratio is calculated as the percentage of physical cores in IPC from the total physical cores in ING globally. The IPC adoption ratio focuses on private cloud only. Public cloud is out of scope because public cloud CPUs are per definition not owned by IPC and can therefore not be measured nor included in the IPC adoption ratio.\n\n## Shared engineering adaption ratio\n\nOnePipeline is our global service that supports the end-to-end engineering journey from (business) idea to deploying working code in a production environment. We measure OnePipeline's adoption ratio by the number of applications onboarded to the pipeline (used to develop and deploy to production), compared to",

        "page_content": "- > ESG appendix to the Report of the Executive Board\n\nthe total number of applications registered in our IT management platform across all ING entities. We exclude those applications where a pipeline is not applicable, such as nocode or SaaS applications. Deployment of applications onboarded to OnePipeline can also be done in a way that was not accounted for in the existing measurement and reporting of the adoption ratio. In 2023, we included this deployment methodology in the measurement and reporting of the OnePipeline adoption ratio. This resulted in a more accurate reported adoption ratio in 2023. When applying the 2022 methodology the Onepipeline Adoption rate would have amounted between 50 percent and 55 percent in 2023.\n\n## Customer online traffic using the Touchpoint Platform\n\nTouchpoint is part of our banking technology platform. It provides a set of reusable shared services, freeing up capacity for engineers to create more value for customers and employees. The usage percentage of the Touchpoint Authentication service is calculated by dividing the 'total number of Touchpoint-enabled unique authentications' by the 'total number of unique authentications'. The unique authentications concern authentications of customer and employees in the retail countries and within Wholesale Banking.\n\n## Operations workforce in HUBS\n\nThe 'percentage operations workforce in hubs' reflects the number FTEs working on operations in Hubs against the FTEs within COO. The metric is calculated by dividing the number of FTEs working on operational activities in the Hubs by the total number of FTEs within COO. The number of FTEs working in the Hubs for total COO, include Retail, Wholesale Banking, and staff functions. This ratio is one of the key drivers of our scalable operations, focusing on leveraging expertise and using scale, and sharing productive, quality services across the ING network.\n\n## KYC workforce in hubs\n\nThe percentage 'KYC workforce in hubs' reflects the KYC FTEs working in the Hubs against the total KYC FTEs. The metric is calculated by dividing the number of FTEs working in the Hubs for KYC by the total number of KYC FTEs, including Retail, Wholesale and Staff functions. This ratio is one of the key drivers of our scalable operations, focusing on leveraging expertise and using scale, and sharing productive, quality services across the ING network.\n\n## Number of inbound calls\n\nThis KPI measures the incoming contacts from customers that have been answered by a contact-centre agent. This excludes the calls that have been abandoned during their journey in the service menu, or when waiting in a queue with an agent. To ensure a complete view, this KPI includes contacts from all inboundchannels calls, emails, chat, social (1-to1) and messaging. By digitalising key customer journeys, we are enabling a superior customer experience at a reduced cost-to-serve, while measuring impact through NPS and cost efficiency. Inbound calls (contacts) is the end-result of many different bank-wide initiatives aiming to provide the customer with the means to solve their questions on their own. All retail countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, Italy, Romania, T\u00fcrkiye and Australia) and daily banking, insurance, investments, lending, mortgage, savings product journeys chains are in scope. Before 2021, the areas in scope of the contact centre varied across countries and consisted of different products, channels and self-service capabilities. Currently, the aligned scope covers all Retail Banking products. As a result, all the volume-reduction data was updated retrospectively (starting point H1 2021) to be able to monitor the progress consistently.\n\n## CO2e emissions of our own operations\n\nOur methodology and calculations regarding our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions currently within our operational boundary and inventory, are in line with guidance provided by the GHG Protocol. This is measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalents (CO2e) and expressed as both Tonnes and Kilotonnes. Scope 1 comprises the emissions from sources controlled by us, including our usage of natural gas, fuel oils and diesel. Scope 2 refers to the emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat and steam. Scope 3 includes the emissions from business travel, specifically from air travel, car travel and train.\n\n## Notes on methodology:\n\n- \u00b7 We use the operational control method to delineate our organisational boundary. Currently, this includes the primary subsidiaries of ING Bank. The reporting excludes fixed-asset investments, franchises, incorporated and non-incorporated joint-ventures and partnerships. Emissions from several major subleased buildings are included in reporting, however the full scope of sub-leased buildings will be further assessed in 2024.\n- \u00b7 The base year will be recalculated on best effort basis with the aim to ensure consistency and relevance of reported data in case of: (1) structural (scope) changes in the organisation, changes in calculation methodology, improvement in the accuracy of emission factors or activity data. (2) The discovery of required data or calculation improvements that materially impact the base-year emissions data, using a 3 percent threshold on the last two years.\n- \u00b7 For natural gas, fuel oil and diesel, we use emissions factors from DEFRA2022. For electricity generation, we use emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA). For district heating, we use countryspecific factors, informed by GaBi, and in the case of Poland by the country office (which provides an average factor of each location and the different district heating factors that apply across the geography).",

This distance classification changed this year from last year's short haul (<450km), medium haul (450-1600km) and long haul (>1600km), following the implementation of an updated classification. When hauls are unknown, an average is used.\n- \u00b7 Emissions from car travel include lease-, pool- and private cars, and available information on taxi travel undertaken for business related activities. As lease cars are also used by employees for private purposes, we assume (based on sample statistics from an ING internal survey) that 30 percent of all kilometers driven in lease cars are for business purposes. For car travel, we apply bespoke emission factors provided by the suppliers of lease vehicles and, if not provided in some markets, DEFRA2022 emission factors are used. We currently apply emission factors for car travel using an average of car types.\n\n## Environmental programme\n\n## Carbon emissions 1\n\n|                                                        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2014   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Coverage (% of employees)  2                           | 97     | 98     | 95     | 91     |\n| Kilotonne CO 2 e                                       |        |        |        |        |\n| Total CO2e (including extrapolations) 3                | 29     | 29     | 26     | 106    |\n| Total CO2e (actuals)  4                                | 28     | 28     | 25     | 97     |\n| Total CO2e scope 1 (actuals)  5                        | 6      | 8      | 10     | 25     |\n| Total CO2e scope 2 (market-based)  6                   | 8      | 9      | 9      | 49     |\n| Total carbon scope 3 (actuals from business travel)  7 | 14     | 11     | 7      | 23     |\n\n| Scope 1 (including extrapolations)   |      |      |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                      | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2014 |\n| Coverage (% of employees)            | 98   | 98   | 89   | 91   |\n| Kilotonne CO2e                       |      |      |      |      |\n| Natural gas                          | 6    | 7    | 10   | 26   |\n| Fuel oil                             | 0.2  | 0.2  | 0.4  |      |\n\n## Scope 2 (including extrapolations)\n\n|                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2014   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Coverage (% of employees) | 98     | 98     | 98     | 91     |\n| Kilotonne CO2e            |        |        |        |        |\n| Electricity 1             | 1.4    | 0.5    | 0.1    | 47     |\n| District heating          | 7      | 9      | 8      | 7      |\n\n- 1 Electricity emissions include emissions for countries where non-renewable electricity was purchased.

        "page_content": "- > ESG appendix to the Report of the Executive Board\n\n## Fossil-fuel exposure\n\nAs part of the energy disclosure, we have reported our exposure to fossil fuel. Fossil fuel consists of Oil & Gas (O&G) and is managed in accordance with its value chain, of which we report on upstream, mid-and downstream O&G and Trade Commodity Finance. The reported outstandings on our Trade Commodity Finance portfolio relate to the commodity itself e.g. Oil barrels.\n\n## Upstream O&G is defined by four types of activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Exploration - geological surveys, including seismic imaging and analyses and drilling of exploration wells;\n- Development - design, construction and commissioning of infrastructure required to produce oil and/or gas from discovered reserves;\n- \u00b7\n- \u00b7 Production - maximising recovery from a field through continuous investments;\n- \u00b7 Abandonment - decommissioning and removal of infrastructure in an efficient way that minimises the impact on the environment.\n\n## Mid- and Downstream O&G is defined by six activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Processing of crude products;\n- \u00b7 Transportation - including pipelines and infrastructure to transport gas;\n- \u00b7 Storage;\n- \u00b7 Refineries - processing oils into fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene;\n- \u00b7 Petrochemical industry - processing of oil and gas into, amongst others, plastics, building materials and fertilisers;\n- \u00b7 Marketing of end products.\n\nThe reported outstandings for both energy and Trade Finance are reported in line with out credit risk portfolios, these portfolios are defined by industry codes (NAICS) for financial reporting which are based on the primary activity of our clients.\n\n## Coal-fired power generation\n\nFinancing of coal fired power generation (power plants). In December 2017, the goal of 'close to zero' by end of 2025 was sharpened in the coal policy in support of the transition to a low carbon economy. The definition of 'close to zero' refers to a maximum level of 5%, based on the outstandings at time of target setting (EUR 452 million).\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nFinanced emissions are absolute emissions associated with our direct lending and investment activities, also known as absolute GHG scope 3 category 15 emissions. Our estimates cover our lending, including both Wholesale and Retail Banking, equity and corporate bonds books, as per 31 December 2023. This year, we included the emissions associated with our commercial real estate portfolio. An overview of ING's financed emissions is provided in the 'Environment' section of this report. A breakdown of the results for the lending portfolio (in NAICS) is provided in this paragraph.\n\nWe calculated our absolute financed emissions using the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, developed by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). This is the global standard, endorsed by the GHG Protocol and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). For residential real estate (mortgages), we apply a loan-to-value (LTV) attribution at property-level for four significant countries. For the remaining six countries, we currently apply, due to data limitations, a country-average LTV attribution factor. Our financed emissions disclosure is currently limited to  scope 1 and scope 2 emissions of our clients. Clients' scope 3 emissions will be added and disclosed in line with PCAF, and EBA pillar 3 reports in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nIn our 2023 Climate Report, we updated our financed emissions based on financial information published in our 2022 Annual Report. We improved the data quality of our balance sheet related to our Wholesale Banking (WB) clients, and we aligned the calculations for both our WB and Business Banking books with the PCAF methodology. The latter requires us to include only funded (on balance exposures) in the measured outstanding, while we had previously also included unfunded exposures. Therefore, while ING generally reports guarantees as outstanding, these positions are now deducted from the ING reported outstandings in line with the PCAF GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard. Compared to the reported financed emissions in our 2022 Annual Report, the net effect of these two improvements led to an increase of financed emissions of 9.4 percent, which has been adjusted in this report and presented in the Terra section in the 'Environment' chapter.",

GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard. In this standard, data quality score 1 and 2 relates to high-quality data coming from a company's disclosure or actual asset-level data, whereas data quality 4 and 5 relates to low-quality data, i.e. based on revenue or sector-average proxies. The weighted average data-quality score per asset class or sector are listed in the table above and in the Environment section of this report.\n\nBy applying PCAF methodology to calculate financed emissions, we use the emissions data currently available to ING and appropriate for each asset class. Except for verified or unverified emissions collected from the borrower or investee company directly via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the primary source of emissions data across asset classes is emissions factors provided by the PCAF database. In September 2023, PCAF issued an updated database. However, we continued to use the initial PCAF database (2020) as it provides more granular and relevant data. The new release of the PCAF database provides emissions factors for only three regions and at a higher level of industry classification codes, making it less appropriate for our",

For commercial and residential real estate, we use property type-, country-specific data and emissions factors. Next to emissions data, we source financial data (EVIC data) from S&P Capital IQ to measure the financed emissions of listed companies in our portfolio, in line with PCAF methodology.\n\nOur data vendors have procedures and methodologies in place to perform checks and controls on their data. When receiving the data from our providers, we perform data quality reviews and plausibility checks, including the assessment of historical trends, which in some cases lead to the removal of outliers. The data processes and models of our data vendors are not audited, which means that regardless of their checks and controls, data limitations may still exist. Although we perform our own procedures, we cannot fully mitigate the risk of applying inaccurate, incorrect and/or incomplete data.\n\n## Sustainable finance volume mobilised in Wholesale Banking\n\nWithin the 'Environment' section - ING's role in accelerating our Wholesale Banking clients' transition to net zero by 2050, we elaborate on our ambition to mobilise an amount of \u20ac125 billion of volume by 2025, contributing to our corporate clients' transitions to more sustainable business models. The following product categories are included in the metric:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable structured finance transactions\n- \u00b7 Green and sustainability-linked Schuldscheine\n- \u00b7 Green, social, transition and sustainability bonds and sustainability-linked bonds\n- \u00b7 Sustainable asset-backed securities (ABS)\n- \u00b7 Sustainability-linked commercial paper\n- \u00b7 Sustainability-linked derivatives\n- \u00b7 Green commercial paper\n- \u00b7 Green receivables finance program\n- \u00b7 Sustainability-linked receivables finance program\n- \u00b7 Sustainable supply-chain finance (SCF)\n- \u00b7 Green guarantee\n- \u00b7 Sustainability-linked guarantee\n- \u00b7 Sustainable investments\n- \u00b7 Advisory propositions for sustainable activities\n- \u00b7 Scorecard transactions\n\nThe commitment makes a distinction between transactions where we are ESG lead (such as ESG coordinator or an ESG structuring role) and transactions where we do not fulfil such a role (like when we are part of a consortium of banks). In cases where we have the ESG lead role for a loan, we record the pro-rata share (in cases where there are multiple ESG leads) of the total transaction, and if we merely participate, we only take our share into account. This methodology has been selected to reflect that if we are the ESG lead role for a transaction, we can pro-actively engage with our clients on their sustainability strategy, so our potential impact is more significant compared to a participation.\n\n## In more detail:\n\n- \u00b7 Loan products: for loans such as sustainability-linked loans, green loans and scorecard transactions, in case we:\n- \u00b7 Only participate in a transaction with no ESG role, we limit ourselves to our own commitment;\n- \u00b7 When we fulfil an ESG lead role by structuring and/or coordinating the ESG debt structure, we reflect (our pro-rata share in) the full transaction given that we mobilised the transaction for our client.\n- \u00b7 For example: in a revolving credit facility (RCF) with a limit of \u20ac1 billion where ING has a final take of \u20ac100 million. The nature of RCFs is that they are fluctuating and therefore can be fully or partially drawn by the client at any time depending on their liquidity needs throughout the year. Therefore, we record the RCF limit, where we differentiate between our role as a participant and as an ESG coordinator:\n- \u00b7 If we are a participant only: we register our final take of \u20ac100 million in the \u20ac1 billion limit;\n- \u00b7 If we are the ESG coordinator: we register the entire \u20ac1 billion in case we are sole ESG coordinator, and our pro-rata share in case there are multiple ESG coordinators, to reflect our efforts of supporting our clients in their transition by addressing key ESG topics.\n- \u00b7 Capital markets products: for the bonds we record in accordance with the role we take:\n- \u00b7 ESG lead role: if we are the ESG structurer or coordinator we take our pro-rata share of the full transaction, as we believe it properly reflects our contribution to support our clients to achieve their sustainability transition (for the avoidance of doubt: if we are the sole ESG structurer/coordinator we register the entire transaction, but if we for example are a joint structurer/coordinator with another bank, we only register the pro-rata part of the transaction as volume mobilised);\n- \u00b7 Other roles: when we do not fulfil the ESG lead role, we only register our share of the bond, where we make a distinction between passive bookrunner roles and active bookrunner roles.\n- \u00b7 Derivatives: For sustainable derivatives such as interest-rate swaps, we record the full notional amount hedged with ING. To prevent double counting, we exclude from the total any sustainable derivatives used to hedge sustainability-linked loans (or other securities) already included in our total.\n- \u00b7 Transaction Services products follow the same reporting protocol as Loan products.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Investments: for financing solutions provided by our Sustainable Investments team (equity and subordinated debt solutions), we report ING's final take in the transaction at closing.\n- \u00b7 Advisory propositions for sustainable activities: we are increasingly asked to provide tailored ESG advice to our clients and we also address ESG-related topics as key part of our client engagements. When we provide such advice related to a financial transaction not yet captured as a ESG bond, loan or derivative, to avoid double counting we report:\n- \u00b7 The full transaction when we are the sole ESG adviser;\n- \u00b7 The pro-rata share if we fulfilled a joint ESG advisory mandate.\n\nTo realise our 2025 target, we aim to actively steer on increasing the share of sustainable transactions and ESG lead roles in our overall number of transactions through company wide KPIs as well as striving to ramp up our sustainable finance capabilities.",

The date on which the limit was generated determines the reporting date. In scope are Sustainable Finance assets in the Business Banking countries that offer Sustainable Finance products: the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Romania, T\u00fcrkiye and Luxembourg. Sustainable Finance assets include: sustainable loans, sustainable lease solutions and sustainability improvement loans. Sustainable loans are investment loans financing or re-financing, in whole or in part, new and/or existing sustainable projects, assets or themes and activities, such as energy transition, sustainable real estate, circular economy or sustainable mobility. Sustainable lease solutions are lease solutions offered where the same themes and activities are applicable as sustainable loans. The sustainability improvement loan ('SIL') is a lending product linking pricing to the borrower's sustainability achievements: if the borrower's achievements improve, the pricing decreases and vice versa. To be noted that contrary to sustainable loans, the SIL does not require a known use of proceeds but can be used for general corporate purposes. The borrower's sustainability achievements are assessed through the monitoring of ratings/KPIs. The volume of sustainability improvement loans is not included in the reported figure of \u20ac1 billion new production.\n\n## Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR)\n\nThe SFDR percentage (Article 8 and 9) as at year-end is based on the proportion of ING Client Assets held in SFDR Article 8 & 9 funds of the total ING Client Assets (assets under management and/or custody) held in funds distributed in EU markets. These funds were purchased by our customers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Spain, Romania, Poland and Italy. The SFDR classification (article 8 or 9) is obtained from data vendors, which on their turn acquire the data from the relevant asset managers.\n\n## Sustainable assets under management\n\nSustainable assets under management refers to sustainable investing services offered to ING customers. This service is defined as investment instruments that have been assessed, according to ING's Responsible investment guidelines, as eligible for the sustainable or impact investing approach. These investments can fall under one of the following three categories, which have all been labelled sustainable by ING:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable investment portfolios: consisting of individual shares, individual bonds (government and corporates), investment funds and combinations of these;\n- \u00b7 Sustainable structured products: including guaranteed products;\n- \u00b7 Sustainable investment funds: investment funds, index funds and ETFs.\n\nFor investment funds and index funds we apply a three-step process, to screen the ESG profile of the asset and the fund manager. First, we send out a survey which covers nine ESG categories across policies, selection methodology and governance. The responses of this survey are analysed to obtain a thorough understanding of the ESG profile of the asset and the fund manager. The second step consists of an interview with the fund manager where we focus on their assessment and ESG approach. Finally, we\n\nvalidate the fund's underlying holdings against our sustainable investing criteria, which determines the classification of the funds as sustainable. External investment funds use their own policies and data providers to assess and classify the underlying assets. When using ING policies and/or other data providers in making that assessment, the outcome and thus the classification may vary.\n\nWithin discretionary management propositions, we also perform a company-level analysis, which integrates both positive and negative ESG screening. Positive screening is based on a company score that incorporates the company's ESG risk management, the evolution of that risk, and the management of adverse impacts on society and the environment by the company. We invest only in companies that belong to the top 70 percent in their sector, when it comes to ESG performance. Applying negative screening means that we exclude companies with severe negative corporate conduct. We also exclude companies whose revenues from products or services that have a negative environmental or societal impact are higher than five percent (for production) or 10 percent (for distribution). Excluded companies operate in the following sectors: alcohol, coal, controversial weapons, fur, gambling, non-conventional gas, oil, tobacco, and weapons. We aim to follow this same screening process for international financial institutions and semisovereigns.\n\nOur sovereign-level analysis integrates several sustainability factors such as social issues, environmental performance, corruption, endorsement of international treaties and the adverse impacts of these sovereigns on environment and society. By combining best-in-class scores with minimum requirements, we define the eligibility of a sovereign for our sustainable investment portfolios. More detailed information on the screening process can be found on ing.com (https://www.ing.nl/particulier/beleggen/duurzaam-beleggen/ esg).\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\nThe EU Taxonomy reporting is prepared according to the prudential consolidated of ING Group N.V., excluding loan loss provisions. For more information, see note 1 basis of 'preparation and material accounting policy information'.\n\nAs a global bank, ING's operations extend beyond the scope of EU Taxonomy, which initially applies only to companies that are subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), which will be replaced by CSRD as per 2024 reporting. Hence, we have not included lending exposures to non-NFRD companies in our proportion of taxonomy-eligible economic activities. This means that a significant portion of ING's balance sheet will not be immediately subject to evaluation under the Taxonomy's criteria and is excluded from the eligibility ratio.\n\nIn addition, we excluded home renovation loans that are uncollateralised as well as motor vehicle loans from our eligible- and alignment exposure, due to data unavailability. To derive alignment of the global residential mortgage portfolio, the approach taken is mainly based on energy labels and/or energy",

Assets in trading books, sovereign and central bank exposures are not included in the calculation of the GAR.\n\nEligible economic activities are described in the Delegated Act (DA) under Article 8 as having potential to contribute to one or both of the first two environmental goals, climate change mitigation (CCM) and climate change adaptation (CCA).\n\nFinancial companies, including ING, use the disclosed information from NFRD companies (financial as well as non-financial corporations) to determine eligibility. Once it is established that a counterparty has eligible assets (economically sustainable activities), an assessment is performed to determine that the activities substantially contribute to one of the environmental goals and do no significant harm (DNSH) to any of the other environmental goals: water and marine resources, circular economy, pollution prevention and control and biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe DNSH physical-risk assessment on our mortgage portfolio has been performed in line with ING's riskmanagement process. The assessment has been performed in line with the EU Taxonomy regulations, however we noted that data unavailability sometimes leads to limitations. We expect this to improve with the maturity of the regulation and market wide implementation.\n\nThe counterparties of the identified economic sustainable activities should be assessed against the minimum safeguards, in accordance with Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy. For our Known use of proceeds, this is an integral part of our process in determining sustainable investments. The purpose of Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy is to prevent green investments from being labelled and regarded as 'sustainable' when they involve negative impacts on human rights, including labor rights, corrupt practices, or are linked to non-compliance with letter or spirit of tax laws or anti-competitive practices.\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk Framework\n\nWholesale banking transactions with companies/clients in scope of the ESR framework need to be routed through an 'Approval Package' (AP), part of ING's standard credit-risk approval process. Disclosed is the total ESR outcome (i.e. result of combined ESR client assessment and ESR transaction assessment), which can be low-, medium-, or high-risk. This disclosure comprises of approved wholesale banking engagements, as the most significant potential environmental and social impacts come from large corporates within our WB segment. For the exact WB activities in scope of the ESR Framework, plus definitions and methodologies, please find the Framework on our website, ing.com. When the ESR outcome is high risk, the transaction requires an assessment and advice from the dedicated ESR team. The absolute number of the total ESR advices related to new requests and the distribution of the ESR desk advice. outcome is reported. The ESR desk advice outcome can be positive, positive subject to conditions and negative.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nThe gender pay gap consists of two types of gaps, the unadjusted- the adjusted gender pay  gap.\n\nUnadjusted gender pay gap is the difference, expressed as a percentage, between the mean hourly rate of men and women across a workforce. The unadjusted gender pay gap will not be adjusted for other factors that may have an impact on the remuneration of staff (e.g. calculated independently of, for example, the position of the staff members and their experience).\n\nAdjusted gender pay gap is the unadjusted gender pay gap, decomposed into three components to gain insight in the gap. Two main gap drivers are structural differences in base salary between countries and systemic differences in characteristics between male and female employees as two distinct groups, mostly due to over or underrepresentation of male or females within a group characteristic. After eliminating aforementioned two effects, the unexplained gap remains. This unexplained portion of the gap can be due to bias or missing data. It is also called the adjusted gender pay gap. The two-fold Oaxaca-Blinder (statistical) decomposition model is applied to decompose the unadjusted gender pay gap into explained and unexplained components of the gap per variable.\n\n## Average remuneration\n\nThe sum of base salary, fixed allowances and variable remuneration divided by the number of employees.\n\n## Significant location\n\nA significant location for this purpose is every country/entity with at least 250 internal employees.\n\n## Headcount breakdown by region, gender and age group\n\nHeadcount breakdown by region, gender and age group describe the demographics of ING's internal staff per 31 December 2023 (total number of active employees and gender distribution) displayed by specific geographical and contract type segmentation. Information is presented by location (top countries with highest population and regions) and type of working agreement (permanent and temporary staff, full-time and part-time). Age segments on total ING population is presented in clusters of 30; 30 to 50; and over 50.\n\n## % of women in senior management positions\n\nPercentage of women in senior management positions shows gender representation in the highest management roles at ING, globally. The value is calculated counting reported gender of individuals performing roles labelled between grades 22 and 27, both included, of the Global Job Architecture (GJA) scale. The GJA scale ranges between 0 (N/A) to 27 and covers all job types performed within ING below MBB level, with 27 being the highest possible value.",

The templates are based on the six environmental goals set out by the EC, for which only the first two environmental goals, Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation, are applicable for the 2023 reporting. Although it is not allowed to alter the tables, we have excluded the columns related to the other four objectives as these are not yet mandatory as per 2023 reporting.\n\nBased on our industry type and exposures we have through our clients, we have two mandatory templates in scope for EU Taxonomy reporting:\n\n- 1. Templates for the KPIs of Credit Institutions;\n- 2. Templates for Nuclear Energy and Fossil gas-related activities.\n\nThe templates only include figures when there is a value to report; fields which are zero are presented as blank field. In case a field is not applicable, this is indicated with n/a. Regarding the Nuclear and Gas templates, we have only reported templates two to five for the total GAR Stock, as deemed relevant.\n\n## 0.

(hereafter: 'the Company' or 'ING Group') based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the assurance information obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial information in the accompanying Annual Report does not present fairly, in all material respects:\n\n- - the policy with regard to sustainability matters; and\n- - the business operations, events and achievements in that area in 2023.\n\nin accordance with the applicable criteria as included in the section 'Criteria'.\n\nThe non-financial information is included in the chapters:\n\n- - 'Introduction' (pages 3-12);\n- - 'Strategy and performance' (pages 18-39),\n- - 'ESG overview' (pages 40-71),\n\n## and the sections:\n\n- - 'Environmental, social and governance risk' (pages 188-192),\n- - 'ESG appendix to the Report of the Executive Board' (pages 324-369)\n- - 'Annex - UN Principles for Responsible Banking Assessment' (as referred to on page 3 and 401), and\n- - 'Annex - Global Reporting Initiative Table' (as referred to on page 3 and 401).\n\nof the Annual Report 2023.\n\n## Basis for our conclusion\n\nWe performed our limited assurance engagement on the non-financial information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake duurzaamheidsverslaggeving' (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reporting). Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities for the assurance engagement on the non-financial information' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ING Groep N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence). Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants). We believe the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe criteria applied for the preparation of the non-financial information are the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) as listed in the GRI Content Index  included in the 'Annex - Global Reporting Initiative Table' (as referred to on page 3 and 401) and the criteria supplementally applied (pages 326-334), including the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative Principles for Responsible Banking, as listed in the 'Annex - UN Principles for Responsible Banking Assessment' (as referred to on page 3 and 401) of the Annual Report. The non-financial information is prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards and the applied supplemental reporting criteria.\n\nThe comparability of non-financial information between entities and over time may be affected by the absence of an uniform practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure this information. This allows for the application of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques.\n\nConsequently, the non-financial information needs to be read and understood together with the criteria applied.\n\n## Materiality\n\nBased on our professional judgement we determined materiality levels for each relevant part of the sustainability matter. When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative aspects as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the Company.\n\nWe agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified during the limited assurance engagement and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our assurance engagement\n\nThe non-financial information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and estimates. Inherent to prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information on the non-financial information.\n\nReferences to external sources or websites in the non-financial information are not part of the non-financial information itself as reviewed by us. Therefore, we do not provide assurance on this information.\n\nOur conclusion is not modified in respect to these matters.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board for the non-financial information\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the non-financial information in accordance with the criteria as included in the section 'Criteria', including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The Executive Board is also responsible for selecting and applying the criteria and for determining that these criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, considering applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by the Executive Board regarding the scope of the non-financial information and the reporting policy are summarised in the sections 'About this report' (pages 3-4), 'Our GRI Material Topics defined' (page 325) and 'Contextualisation and definitions of the Key Performance Indicators' (pages 326-334) of the Annual Report.\n\nFurthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the non-financial information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",

The procedures vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less than the assurance that is obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement is performed.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere Voorschriften Kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for Quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality management including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our assurance engagement included among others:\n\n- - Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant sustainability themes and issues, and the characteristics of ING Group.\n- - Evaluating the appropriateness of the criteria applied, their consistent application and related disclosures in the nonfinancial information. This includes the evaluation of the Company's materiality assessment and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Executive Board.\n- - Obtaining through inquiries a general an understanding of the internal control environment, the reporting processes, the information systems and the Company's risk assessment process relevant to the preparation of the non-financial information, without obtaining assurance information about the implementation or testing the operating effectiveness of controls.\n- - Identifying areas of the non-financial information where misleading or unbalanced information or a material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, is likely to arise.\n- - Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the non-financial information responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures consisted amongst others of:\n- - Obtaining inquiries from management and/or relevant staff at Group (and local) level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results.\n- -Obtaining inquiries from relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data in the non-financial information.\n- -Determining the nature and extent of the procedures to be performed for the group components and locations. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of these components are decisive.\n- -Obtaining assurance evidence that the non-financial information reconciles with underlying records of the Company.\n- -Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation.\n- -Considering the data and trends in the information submitted for consolidation at Group level.\n\n- - Reading the information in the Annual Report which is not included in the scope of our assurance engagement to identify material inconsistencies, if any, with the non-financial information.\n- - Considering the overall presentation and balanced content of the non-financial information.\n- - Considering whether the non-financial information as a whole, including the sustainability matters and disclosures, is clearly and adequately disclosed in accordance with applicable criteria.\n\nWe have communicated with the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the assurance engagement and significant findings that we identify during our assurance engagement.\n\nAmstelveen, 4 March 2024\n\nKPMG Accountants N.V.\n\n## P.A.M. de Wit RA",

The materiality is determined with reference to profit before tax and represents 2.9% (2022: 4.5%) of that balance. We consider profit before tax as the most appropriate benchmark based on our assessment of the general information needs of the users of the financial statements and given the fact that ING Group is a profit-oriented listed entity. The increase in materiality reflects an increase in profit before tax. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board that misstatements identified during our audit in excess of EUR 15 million (2022: EUR 12.5 million) would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds.\n\n## Scope of the group audit\n\nING Group is at the head of a group of components. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of ING Group.\n\nING Group is structured in 6 segments: Retail Netherlands, Retail Belgium, Retail Germany, Retail Other, Wholesale Banking and Corporate Line Banking, each comprising of multiple legal entities and/or covering different countries.\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant components. These components are either individually financially significant due to their relative size in the group or because we identified a significant risk of material misstatement for one or more account balances of these entities. In addition, we included certain other non-significant components in the scope of our group audit in order to arrive at a sufficient coverage over all significant account balances.\n\nThis resulted in a full or specific scope audit for 36 components globally, in total covering 16 countries. This resulted in a coverage of 88% of profit before tax and 92% of total assets. For the remaining 12% of profit before tax and the remaining 8% of total assets, procedures were performed at the group level including analytical procedures in order to corroborate that our scoping remained appropriate throughout the audit.\n\nThe consolidation of components in the group, the disclosures in the financial statements and certain accounting topics that are performed on a group level were further covered by the group audit team. Procedures performed by the group audit team included, but were not limited to, substantive procedures with respect to equity and certain elements of the expected credit loss provisioning process.\n\nAll components in scope for group reporting are audited by KPMG member firms. We sent detailed audit instructions to all component auditors, covering significant areas such as the identified risks of material misstatement on a group level and further set out the information that is required to be reported to the group audit team.\n\nWe performed site visits with local management and local audit teams, also to perform file reviews in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Poland. We performed a remote file review for Singapore and the USA. We visited Australia, The Philippines, The United Kingdom, Switzerland and T\u00fcrkiye during the year to meet local management and the local audit team to discuss the planned audit approach and progress of their audit work.\n\nFor all components in scope of the group audit, we held our annual planning conference in The Netherlands. Our component auditors were directly informed by the Group Financial Controller and Investor Relations on current developments. In addition, we held conference calls and/or had remote meetings with the audit teams of these components and we attended closing meetings with management for components in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. During these meetings and calls, the planning, risk assessment, procedures performed, findings and observations reported to the group auditor were discussed in detail and any further work deemed necessary by the group audit team was then performed.\n\nThe group audit team set component materiality levels which ranged from EUR 30 million to EUR 115 million, based on the mix of relative size and financial statement risk profile of the components within the group in order to reduce the aggregation risk to an acceptable level.\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at group components, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the group audit, we are responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of audit procedures to be carried out for group entities or so-called components.",

In the Supervisory Board report the assessment in respect of these topics is described.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have gained insights into the Company and its business environment and the Company's risk management in relation to fraud and non-compliance.\n\nOur procedures included, among other things, assessing the Company's code of conduct, whistleblowing procedures, incidents register and its procedures to investigate indications of possible fraud and non-compliance. Furthermore, we performed relevant inquiries with management, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and other relevant functions, such as Internal Audit, Legal Counsel and Compliance. We corroborated these inquiries with the results of our inspection of correspondence with relevant supervisory authorities and regulators. We have also incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit, such as making changes to our high-risk criteria that we applied to journal entry testing, designing additional substantive audit procedures, varying the timing of audit procedures including testing of controls, a site visit to a remote location (The Philippines) and involved forensic specialists in our audit procedures.\n\n## Non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nAs a result, from our risk assessment, we identified the following laws and regulations as those most likely to have a material effect on the financial statements in case of non-compliance:\n\n- - fraud, corruption and anti-bribery law (reflecting the Company's significant and geographically diverse nature of operations and clients);\n- - anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing law (reflecting the Company's involvement in a number of ongoing investigations by national competent authorities);\n- - data protection law (reflecting the processing of sensitive data inherent to the Company's business activities);\n- - prudential and supervision regulations (reflecting the Company's nature of operations);\n- - sanction law (reflecting the Company's significant and geographically diverse nature of operations and clients); and\n- - anti-competition law (reflecting the Company's involvement in a number of ongoing investigations by national competition authorities).\n\nOur procedures did not result in the identification of a risk of material misstatement.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nWe assessed the presumed fraud risk on revenue recognition as not significant, because the accounting of interest income and commission income is based on automatically generated accruals based on static data taken from the source systems and therefore contains routine transactions not subject to management judgement. Furthermore, the contracts used in the financial sector generally use standardised definitions which reduce the complexity of revenue recognition to a low level.\n\nBased on the above and on the auditing standards, we identified the following fraud risks that are relevant to our audit and responded as follows:\n\n## Management override of controls (a presumed risk)\n\nManagement is in a unique position to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively, such as reporting fictitious journal entries.\n\nWe evaluated the design and the implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that mitigate fraud risks, such as processes related to journal entries and estimates related to loan loss provisions. We also performed a data analysis of high-risk journal entries and evaluated key estimates and judgments for bias by the Company's management. Where we identified instances of unexpected journal entries or other risks through our data analytics, we performed additional audit procedures to address each identified journal entry, including testing of transactions back to source information.\n\n## Management override of collective loan loss provisioning (ECL)\n\nWith respect to the risk and responses in regards of fraud in relation to management override of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provision results, we refer to the Key audit matter 'Assessment of Expected Credit Losses on loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks'.\n\n## Total assets\n\n12% Covered by additional procedures\n\nperformed at group level",

Our audit procedures did not reveal indications and/or reasonable suspicion of fraud and non-compliance that are considered material for our audit.\n\nWe communicated our risk assessment, audit responses and results to management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Audit response to going concern\n\nAs explained on page 215 of the financial statements, the Executive Board has performed its going concern assessment and has not identified any going concern risks. To assess the Executive Board's assessment, we have performed, inter alia, the following procedures:\n\n- - we considered whether the Executive Board's assessment of the going concern risks includes all relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit;\n- - we considered whether the developments in interest and inflation rates, geopolitical uncertainty and risks of disruption due to innovation and the emergence of new competitors from the technology sector indicate a going concern risk;\n- - we analysed the Company's financial position as at year-end and compared it to the previous financial year in terms of indicators that could identify going concern risks; and\n- - we inspected regulatory correspondence to obtain an understanding of the Company's capital and liquidity position, that underpins management's assessment of the going concern assumption for financial reporting.\n\nThe outcome of our risk assessment procedures on the going concern assessment, including our consideration of findings from our audit procedures on other areas, did not give reason to perform additional audit procedures on the Executive Board's going concern assessment.\n\n## Audit response to climate-related risks\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of risks arising from climate change on the Company's business and its financial statements. The Company has set out its commitments and ambitions relating to climate change in the chapters 'Strategy and performance' ('Sustainability at the heart') and 'Risk management' ('Environmental, social and governance risk') of the annual report. The Company aims to reach net zero in their own operations, to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of the loan portfolio towards net zero by 2050 and intermediate target setting, and to finance and advise specific clients in line with a net-zero economy.\n\nManagement extensively assessed, against the background of the Company's business and operations, how climaterelated risks and opportunities and the Company's own commitments and ambitions could have a significant impact on its business or could impose the need to modify its strategy and operations.\n\nManagement has considered the impact of both transition and physical risks on the financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, more specifically the expected credit losses of loans and advances, as described in section 'Risk management - environmental, social and governance risk' and the section 'Risk management - climate and environmental risks in IFRS9 models' of the annual report. Management disclosed considerations directly impacting the financial statements captions as well as the medium to longer term risk drivers and concluded that these do not have a material impact on the 2023 financial statements.\n\nManagement prepared the financial statements, including considering whether the implications from climate-related risks and commitments and ambitions have been appropriately accounted for and disclosed. As part of our audit we performed a risk assessment of the impact of climate-related risk and the Company's commitments/ambitions in respect of climate change on the financial statements and our audit approach. In doing this we performed the following:\n\n- - To understand management's processes:\n- - we performed an analysis of the external environment and obtained an understanding of relevant sustainability themes and issues relevant for ING;\n- -we made inquiries with the Executive Board, other senior management and members of the ESG Committee and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n- -we inspected relevant documents to understand management's assessment against the background of the Company's business and operations of the potential impact of climate-related risk and opportunities on the company's annual report and financial statements and the company's preparedness for this;\n- -we read the minutes of meetings of the Executive Board, Management Board Banking and the Supervisory Board;\n- -we inspected regulatory correspondence to obtain an understanding of management's assessment of climate risk and the related risk management thereof:\n- -we gained an understanding whether any current and/or future regulations may impact ING, such as greenhouse gas emission regulations, potential increases in taxes on current products and future climate reporting obligations; and\n- -we gained an understanding of ING's Net Zero alignment pathways, including the intermediate target setting for 2030.\n- - We evaluated climate-related fraud risk factors on reporting inappropriate disclosures on climate-related risk and pressures for management to meet the climate targets, since that such targets are linked to the Executive Board's remuneration.\n- - We performed specific inquiries with the Legal Counsel on any climate risk related allegations and claims against the Company, and we performed specific substantive procedures in relation to the related disclosure in Note 42 Legal proceedings.\n- - We used our climate change subject matter experts to assist in understanding how climate-related risks and pressures for management to meet the climate targets and opportunities may affect the Company and its accounting in the current year's financial statements.\n- - We used our climate change subject matter experts and modelling experts to assist in gaining understanding how climate-related risks are of impact on the expected credit loss estimation, including the credit risk models, as determined by the Company.\n\nBased on the procedures performed above, we found that climate related risks have no material impact on the 2023 financial statements under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and have no impact on our key audit matters.",

We have communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\n## Assessment of expected credit losses on loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks\n\n## Description\n\nAs discussed in the Credit Risk section on pages 142-170 and in Note 3 and Note 7 in the consolidated financial statements, the loans and advances to customers amount to EUR 642 billion and loans and advances to banks amount to EUR 17 billion as at 31 December 2023. These loans and advances are measured at amortised cost, less expected credit losses ('ECL') of EUR 6 billion.\n\nManagement estimated ECL using three components: probability of default ('PD'), loss given default ('LGD') and exposure at default ('EAD'). Management applied forward looking economic scenarios with associated weights. Relevant macroeconomic factors include the gross domestic product ('GDP'), house price index ('HPI') and unemployment rate. The recent economic conditions are outside the bounds of historical experience used to develop ECL model methodologies and result in greater uncertainties to estimate ECLs. These uncertainties are addressed by judgemental overlays by management.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe identified the assessment of ECL on loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks as a key audit matter because of the significant and complex auditor judgment and specialised skills and knowledge required to evaluate the following elements of the overall ECL estimate:\n\n- - The judgements used to develop the model-driven PD and LGD parameters.\n- - The determination of the amount and timing of expected future recovery cash flows for individual loan provision assessments for impaired loans and the probability weights applied in the presence of more than one recovery scenario.\n- - The use of forward-looking macroeconomic forecasts in ECL, including GDP, HPI and unemployment rate.\n- - The consistent identification and application of criteria for significant increase in credit risk ('SICR') in the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical situation which remains uncertain.\n- - The determination of management overlays to the modelled ECL due to the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook in the global economy combined with the delay in which the models capture emerging risks.\n- The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter.\n\nselection of key assumptions (including PD, LGD and macroeconomic forecasts), review and authorisation of model outputs, governance and monitoring of the ECL process, determination of credit risk ratings, the estimation of future recovery cash flows of individual loan loss provisions and associated scenario weights assigned and the determination of management overlays to the modelled ECL.\n\n- - We involved credit risk professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the assumptions to determine the PD and LGD parameters in models used by the Company to determine the collective provisions, including the evaluation of the recalibrated and redeveloped credit risk models.\n- - This included reperforming back-testing of certain models to evaluate the current model performance and evaluation of the identification of SICR in loans by challenging the scope of management's criteria used in staging assessments, consistent application of the thresholds applied within each criterion, and the ability of staging criteria to identify SICR prior to loans being credit impaired. In addition, the credit risk professionals assisted in testing management overlays recorded, including interest and inflation related overlays for both the wholesale banking and retail banking portfolios and an overlay related to interest only residential mortgages in the Netherlands.\n- - We involved economic professionals with specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the Company's methodology to determine the macroeconomic forecasts used in determining the ECL. We tested the reasonableness of management's forecasts against other external benchmarks and our own internal forecasts.\n- - We involved corporate finance professionals with specialised skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the methodologies, cash flows and collateral values used in expected future recovery cash flow assessments of individual loan loss provisions for impaired loans, challenging management's use of recovery scenarios and expected cash flows by comparing against industry trends and comparable benchmarks and recalculating recovery amounts.\n- - We assessed whether the credit risk management disclosures appropriately reflect and address the uncertainties which exist in determining the ECL.\n\n## Our observation\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we found management's overall assessment relating to the valuation of loans and advances to customers and banks within an acceptable range and adequately disclosed in Note 3 and Note 7 of the financial statements.\n\n## User access and change management\n\n## Description\n\nING Group is highly dependent on its IT environment for the continuity of operations and reliability of financial reporting. The IT environment of ING Group evolves over time, which includes the implementation of tooling to support automated control execution related to user access and change management of IT assets. We consider general IT controls, and in particular user access and change management controls, that support the effective operations of automated controls a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit approach depends to a large extent on the effectiveness of automated controls, which are dependent on user access and change management general IT controls to operate effectively. Given the technical characteristics of these controls, IT auditors are an integrated part of our engagement team.\n\n- - We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of ECL for loans and advances to customers and loans and advances to banks. This included controls relating to the",

The general IT controls included access provisioning, design of access rights, timely removal of user access rights, high privileged user access and monitoring, access to deploy changes and the testing and approval of changes prior to implementation.\n\nOur audit procedures identified deficiencies in high privileged user access and monitoring, including access to modify configurations, deploy code and or change data. Management has remediated some but not all the deficiencies before year end. For the deficiencies open during the year or at year end, we performed additional procedures to respond to the risk of unauthorised and/or unintentional access or changes to automated controls. These procedures included testing compensating controls implemented by management and additional substantive procedures.\n\n## Our observation\n\nThe combination of compensating controls and additional substantive procedures support our audit approach\n\n## Report on the other information included in the annual report\n\nIn addition to the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, the annual report contains other information.\n\nBased on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information:\n\n- - is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; and\n- - contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the management report and other information.\n\nWe have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements.\n\nBy performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF\n\n## Engagement\n\nWe were engaged by the General Meeting of Shareholders as auditor of ING Groep N.V. on 11 May 2015, as of the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that financial year. We have been reappointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 23 April 2019 to continue to serve ING Group as its external auditor for the financial years 2020-2023. Furthermore, we have been reappointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders on  24 April 2023 to continue to serve ING Group as its external auditor for the financial years 2024 and 2025.\n\n## No prohibited non-audit services\n\nWe have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest entities.\n\n## Services rendered\n\nFor the period to which our statutory audit relates, in addition to this audit, we have provided the following services to the Company and its controlled undertakings:\n\n- - agreed-upon procedures and assurance engagements for the benefit of external stakeholders, largely driven by regulatory requirements.\n\n## European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\nING Group has prepared its annual report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion the annual report prepared in XHTML format, including the (partly) marked-up consolidated financial statements as included in the reporting package by ING Group, complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for preparing the annual report including the financial statements in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Executive Board combines the various components into one single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF. We performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included among others:\n\n- - Obtaining an understanding of the entity's financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting package.\n- - Identifying and assessing the risks that the annual report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:\n- - obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files have been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF; and\n- - examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.\n\n## Description of responsibilities regarding the financial statements\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nFurthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as the Executive Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to",

Our audit included among others:\n\n- - identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- - obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control;\n- - evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Executive Board;\n- - concluding on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- - evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures; and\n- - evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe are solely responsible for the opinion and therefore responsible to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the financial statements. In this respect we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

ING may face a number of the risks described below simultaneously and some risks described below may be interdependent. While the risk factors below have been divided into categories, some risk factors could belong in more than one category and investors should carefully consider all of the risk factors set out in this section. Additional risks of which the Company is not presently aware, or that are currently viewed as immaterial, could also affect the business operations of ING and have a material adverse effect on ING's business activities, financial condition, results and prospects. The market price of ING shares or other securities could decline due to any of those risks including the risks described below, and investors could lose all or part of their investments.\n\nAlthough the most material risk factors have been presented first within each category, the order in which the remaining risk factors are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of the risks actually materialising, of the potential significance of the risks or of the scope of any potential negative impact to our business, results, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## Risks related to financial conditions, market environment and general economic trends\n\nOur revenues and earnings are affected by the volatility and strength of the economic, business, liquidity, funding and capital markets environments of the various geographic regions in which we conduct business, as well as by changes in customer behaviour in these regions, and an adverse change in any one region could have an impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nBecause ING is a multinational banking and financial services corporation, with a global presence and serving 40 million customers, corporate clients and financial institutions in 38 countries, ING's business, results and financial condition may be significantly impacted by turmoil and volatility in the worldwide financial markets or in the particular geographic areas in which we operate. In Retail Banking, our products include savings, payments, investments, loans and mortgages. In Wholesale Banking, we provide specialised lending, tailored corporate finance, debt and equity market solutions, payments & cash management, trade and treasury services. Negative developments in relevant financial markets and/or countries or regions have in the past had and may in the future have a material adverse impact on our business, results and financial condition, including as a result of the potential consequences listed below.\n\nFactors such as inflation or deflation, interest rates, securities prices, credit spreads, liquidity spreads, exchange rates, consumer spending, changes in customer behaviour, climate change, business investment, real estate values and private equity valuations, government spending the volatility and strength of the capital markets, political events and trends, supply chain disruptions, shortages, terrorism, pandemics and epidemics (such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic) or other widespread health emergencies all impact the\n\nbusiness and economic environment and, ultimately, our solvency, liquidity and the amount and profitability of business we conduct in a specific geographic region. Some of these risks are often experienced globally as well as in specific geographic regions and are described in greater detail below under the headings: 'Interest rate volatility and other interest rate changes may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition'; 'Inflation and deflation may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition'; 'Market conditions, including those observed over the past few years may increase the risk of loans being impaired and have a negative effect on our results and financial condition'; and 'Continued risk of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in Europe and the United States, as well as ongoing volatility in the financial markets and the economy generally have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results and financial condition'. All of these are factors in local and regional economies as well as in the global economy, and we may be affected by changes in any one of these factors in any one country or region, and more if more of these factors occur simultaneously and/ or in multiple countries or regions or on a global scale.\n\nIn case one or more of the factors mentioned above adversely affects the profitability of our business, this might also result, among other things, in the following:\n\n- \u00b7 inadequate reserves or provisions, in relation to which losses could ultimately be realised through profit and loss and shareholders' equity;\n- \u00b7 the write-down of tax assets impacting net results and/or equity;\n- \u00b7 impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, impacting our net result and equity; and/or\n- \u00b7 movements in risk-weighted assets for the determination of required capital.\n\nIn particular, we are exposed to financial, economic, market and political conditions in the Benelux countries and Germany, from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues in both Retail Banking and Wholesale Banking, and which could present risks of economic downturn. Though less material, we also derive substantial revenues in the following geographic regions: United States, T\u00fcrkiye, Poland and the remainder of Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, East Asia (primarily Singapore among others) and Australia. In an economic downturn affecting some or all of these jurisdictions, we expect that higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, higher corporate and private debt defaults, lower business investments and lower consumer spending would adversely affect the demand for banking products, and that ING may need to increase its reserves and provisions, each of which may result in overall lower earnings. Securities prices, real estate values and private equity valuations may also be adversely impacted, and any such losses would be realised through profit and loss and shareholders' equity. We also offer a number of financial products that expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates, securities prices, corporate and private default rates, the value of real estate assets, exchange rates and credit spreads. Further, while the Covid-19 pandemic and related response measures have eased, the effects of these measures (including consequences for commercial real estate occupancies and valuations as a result of the increased prevalence of work-from-home or hybrid working arrangements) are still being felt in the financial performance and stability of certain of our business customers. As a result, their impact may",

We also have wholesale banking activities in both Russia and Ukraine, as well as investments in Russia, some of which are denominated in local currency. In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the international community imposed various punitive measures, including sanctions, capital controls, restrictions on SWIFT access and restrictions on central bank activity. These measures have significantly impacted, and may continue to significantly impact, Russia's economy and have contributed to heightened instability in global markets and increased inflation due in part to supply chain constraints, as well as higher energy and commodity prices. Should prices remain elevated for an extended period, most businesses and households would be negatively impacted, and our business in Russia and Ukraine, as well as our broader business, may be adversely affected, including through spill-over risk to the entire wholesale banking portfolio (e.g. commodities financing, energy and utilities and energy-consuming clients).\n\nEnvironmental and/or climate risks may also directly and indirectly impact ING, for example through, among other things, losses suffered as a result of extreme weather events, the impact of climate-related transition risk on the risk and return profile or value of security or operations of certain categories of customer to which ING has exposure. In addition, these risks may also increase ING's reputational and litigation risk if the economic activity that ING supports is not in line with community expectations or ING's external commitments or legal or regulatory requirements (this includes, but is not limited to, greenwashing risk).\n\nFor further information on ING's exposure to particular geographic areas, see Note 31 'Information on geographical areas' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInflation, interest rate volatility and other interest rate changes may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nGlobally, inflation has increased significantly over the past two years and has remained elevated for a prolonged period. In general, both inflation and deflation may influence consumers' spending habits, affecting the economic activity and consequently our core revenue stream (e.g. in terms of overall financial health of borrowers and loan demand, and collateral management, among other things). Furthermore, inflation and deflation may have repercussions on interest rate spreads, and therefore on the profitability of traditional banking activities. Overall, both inflation and deflation can pose significant challenges, impacting our ability to generate revenue, manage risk, and maintain a stable financial position.\n\nFurther, the recent increase in inflation has resulted in an increase in market interest rates in many major economies. Increased interest rates may impact our business by:\n\n- \u00b7 Decreasing the estimated fair value of certain fixed income securities that we hold in our investment portfolios, resulting in:\n- \u00b7 Reduced levels of unrealised capital gains available to us, which could negatively impact our solvency position and net income, and/or\n\n- \u00b7 a decrease in collateral values;\n- \u00b7 Resulting in increased withdrawal of certain savings products, particularly those with fixed rates below market rates;\n- \u00b7 Requiring us, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities that we issue in the financial markets from time to time to finance our operations, which would increase our interest expenses and reduce our results;\n- \u00b7 Resulting in further customer defaults as interest rate rises flow through into payment stress for lower credit quality customers.\n\nA significant and sustained increase in inflation has historically also been associated with decreased prices for equity securities and sluggish performance of equity markets generally. A sustained decline in equity markets may:\n\n- \u00b7 Result in impairment charges to equity securities that we hold in our investment portfolios and reduced levels of unrealised capital gains available to us which would reduce our net income, and;\n- \u00b7 Lower the value of our equity investments impacting our capital position.\n\nCentral Banks (including the ECB, the US Federal Reserve and the RBA and RBNZ) have undertaken successive raises in policy rates over the last two years, and have reiterated their commitments to keeping policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary, believing that maintaining the key interest rates at their current levels over an extended period could significantly contribute to reducing inflation. As a result of these measures, inflation decreased in 2023 from peak 2022 levels, and is expected to decrease further in 2024. Despite the publicly stated approach of Central Banks, analysts foresee the ECB leading the ratecutting cycle in 2024 ahead of the Federal Reserve. A decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to lower interest income from loans and investments, reduced profitability of traditional banking activities, and potential declines in the value of certain fixed income securities we hold in our investment portfolio, as well as negatively affecting our business in other ways, including leading to:\n\n- \u00b7 Lower interest rates, which can compress the net interest income margins because of potential reduction in the interest income earned from loans;\n- \u00b7 Lower earnings over time on investments, as reinvestments will earn lower rates;\n- \u00b7 Increased prepayment or redemption of mortgages and fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolios, as well as increased prepayments of corporate loans. This as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates potentially combined with lower credit spreads. Consequently, we may be required to reinvest the proceeds into assets at lower interest rates;\n- \u00b7 Lower profitability as the result of a decrease in the spread between client rates earned on assets and client rates paid on savings, current account and other liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Higher costs for certain derivative instruments that may be used to hedge certain of our product risks;",

This may, for example, be the consequence of increased competition for investments as result of the low rates, thereby driving margins down; and/or\n- \u00b7 (Depending on the position) a significant collateral posting requirement associated with our interest rate hedge programs, which could materially and adversely affect liquidity and our profitability.\n\nIn addition, given the volatility in inflation and related volatility in interest rates, a failure to accurately anticipate inflation on an ongoing basis and factor it into our product pricing assumptions may result in mispricing of our products, which could materially and adversely impact our results.\n\nEach of the preceding risks, should they materialise, may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nThe default of a major market participant could disrupt the markets and may have an adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nWithin the financial services industry, the severe distress or default of any one institution (including sovereigns and central counterparties (CCPs)) could lead to defaults by, or the severe distress of, other market participants. While prudential regulation may reduce the probability of a default by a major financial institution, the actual occurrence of such a default could have a material adverse impact on ING. Such distress of, or default by, a major financial institution could disrupt markets or clearance and settlement systems and lead to a chain of defaults by other financial institutions, since the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely related as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships. Also, the perceived lack of creditworthiness of a sovereign or a major financial institution (or a default by any such entity) may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. This risk is also referred to as 'systemic risk' and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with whom we interact on a daily basis and financial instruments of sovereigns in which we invest. Systemic risk could impact ING directly, by exposing it to material credit losses on transactions with defaulting counterparties or indirectly by significantly reducing the available market liquidity on which ING and its lending customers depend to fund their operations and/or leading to a write-down of loans or securities held by ING. In addition, ING may also be faced with additional open market risk for which hedging or mitigation strategies may not be available or effective (either by hedges eliminated by defaulting\n\ncounterparties, or reduce market liquidity). Systemic risk could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise new funding and on our business, results and financial condition. In addition, such distress or failure could impact future product sales as a potential result of reduced confidence in the financial services industry.\n\nContinued risk of political instability and fiscal uncertainty in Europe and the United States, as well as ongoing volatility in the financial markets and the economy generally have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results and financial condition.\n\nOur global business and results are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. In Europe, there are continuing concerns over weaker economic conditions, levels of unemployment in certain countries, the availability and cost of credit, as well as credit spreads. In addition, geopolitical issues, including trade tensions between the US and China, increasing protectionism between key countries, and issues with respect to North Korea and the Middle East, including the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, may all contribute to adverse developments in the global capital markets and the economy generally. In addition, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and related international response measures have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on regional and global economic conditions, including heightened instability in global markets and increased inflation due in part to supply chain constraints, as well as higher energy and commodity prices. Should prices remain elevated for an extended period, most businesses and households would be negatively impacted, and our business in Russia and Ukraine, as well as our broader business, may be adversely affected, including through spill-over risk to our entire wholesale banking portfolio, in areas such as commodities financing, energy and utilities and energy-consuming clients. Furthermore, the upcoming presidential election cycle in the United States has the potential to be disruptive to the global economy as it may result in leadership changes in many federal administrative agencies and result in a range of new policies, executive orders, rules, initiatives and other changes to United States fiscal, tax, regulation, environmental, climate and other policies.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk that an adverse credit event at one or more European sovereign debtors (including a credit rating downgrade or a default) could trigger a broader economic downturn in Europe and elsewhere. In addition, the confluence of these and other factors has resulted in volatile foreign exchange markets. International equity markets have also continued to experience heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers, including ourselves, that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage, private equity and credit markets particularly affected. These events, market upheavals and continuing risks, including high levels of volatility, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our results, in part because we have a large investment portfolio.\n\nThere is also continued uncertainty over the long-term outlook for the tax, spending and borrowing policies of the US, the future economic performance of the US within the global economy and any potential future budgetary restrictions in the US, with a potential impact on a future sovereign credit ratings downgrade of",

A downgrade of US Treasury securities could also impact the ratings and perceived creditworthiness of instruments issued, insured or guaranteed by institutions, agencies or instrumentalities directly linked to the US government. US Treasury securities and other US government-linked securities are key assets on the balance sheets of many financial institutions and are widely used as collateral by financial institutions to meet their day-to-day cash flows in the short-term debt market. The impact of any further downgrades to the sovereign credit rating of the US government or a default by the US government on its debt obligations would create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty, which would weigh heavily on the global financial system and could consequently result in a significant adverse impact to the Group's business and operations.\n\nIn many cases, the markets for investments and instruments have been and remain illiquid, and issues relating to counterparty credit ratings and other factors have exacerbated pricing and valuation uncertainties. Valuation of such investments and instruments is a complex process involving the consideration of market transactions, pricing models, management judgement and other factors, and is also impacted by external factors, such as underlying mortgage default rates, interest rates, rating agency actions and property valuations. Historically these factors have resulted in, among other things, valuation and impairment issues in connection with our exposures to European sovereign debt and other investments.\n\nAny of these general developments in global financial and political conditions could negatively impact our business, results and financial condition in future periods.\n\n## Discontinuation of interest rate benchmarks may negatively affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nChanges to major interest rates benchmarks may negatively affect our business, including the level of net interest revenue. Financial markets have historically relied on Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) benchmarks, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Euro Over Night Index Average (EONIA) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR). While some interest rate benchmarks have been reformed and will continue to exist, such as EURIBOR, others such as EONIA and LIBOR have been, or will be, replaced by recommended alternative rates. EONIA ceased to be published on 3 January 2022, and was succeeded by \u20acSTR. GBP, JPY, CHF and EUR LIBOR ceased in 2021/2022, and, more recently, USD LIBOR ceased on 30 June 2023. Synthetic rates of certain GBP and USD LIBOR rates are available for a limited time to facilitate the transition of remaining legacy transactions.\n\nIn 2022 the Polish National Working Group published a roadmap indicating that the market should be prepared for a cessation of, among others, the WIBOR reference rate. It is expected that the reform will be completed by the end of 2027, with the offering of financial products using the new benchmark (WIRON) to progress gradually in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe discontinuation of WIBOR, CDOR and other local benchmarks in the future could result in a number of risks for the Group, its customers, and the financial services industry more widely. These risks include legal risks and costs in relation to changes required to documentation for existing transactions and for clients' contracts. In addition to the heightened conduct and operational risks, the process of adopting new reference rates may expose the Group to an increased level of financial risk, such as potential earnings volatility resulting from contract modifications and changes in hedge accounting relationships.\n\nING continues to monitor market developments and reform plans for other rates to anticipate the impact on our customers and any related risks.\n\n## Market conditions, including those observed over the past few years, may increase the risk of loans being impaired and have a negative effect on our results and financial condition.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers (including sovereigns) may not repay their loans according to their contractual terms and that the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient. We may see adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and counterparties, for example, as a result of their inability to refinance their indebtedness or in the case of a decline in financial performance. Adverse changes in the credit quality of our borrowers and/or decreasing collateral values would result in increased capital requirements and provisions, and any deterioration of market conditions may lead to increasing delinquencies, defaults and insolvencies across a range of sectors. This may lead to impairment charges on loans and other assets, higher costs and additions to loan loss provisions. A significant increase in the size of our provision for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nIf we are significantly exposed to a concentrated set of customers or counterparties, an adverse event affecting these parties could lead to increased losses for the Group, and adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\n## We may incur losses due to failures of banks falling under the scope of state compensation schemes.\n\nWhile prudential regulation is intended to minimise the risk of bank failures, in the event such a failure occurs, given our size, we may incur significant compensation payments to be made under the Dutch Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS), which we may be unable to recover from the bankrupt estate, and therefore the consequences of any future failure of such a bank could be significant to ING. Such costs and the associated costs to be borne by us may have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. On the basis of the EU Directive on deposit guarantee schemes, ING pays quarterly risk-weighted contributions into a DGS-fund. The DGS-fund is to grow to a target size of 0.8 percent of all deposits guaranteed under the DGS, which is expected to be reached in July 2024. In case of failure of a Dutch bank,",

If the available financial means of the fund are insufficient, Dutch banks, including ING, may be required to pay extraordinary ex-post contributions not exceeding 0.5 percent of their covered deposits per calendar year. In exceptional circumstances, and with the consent of the competent authority, higher contributions may be required. However, extraordinary expost contributions may be temporarily deferred if, and for so long as, they would jeopardise the solvency or liquidity of a bank. Depending on the size of the failed bank, the available financial means in the fund, and the required additional financial means, the impact of the extraordinary ex-post contributions on ING may be material.\n\nSince 2015, the EU has been discussing the introduction of a pan-European deposit guarantee scheme (EDIS), which would (partly) replace or complement national compensation schemes.\n\nOn 18 April 2023, the European Commission published its proposals for the revision of the common framework for bank crisis management and deposit insurance (CMDI) that focuses on small and mediumsized banks, but will affect all EU banks. The CMDI framework consists of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRMR) and the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive (DGSD). The revision of the CMDI framework is part of the debate on the completion of the Banking Union and in particular its third and missing pillar EDIS. As at the date hereof, EDIS has not yet been adopted by the European Commission.\n\n## Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group\n\nNon-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, including with respect to financial economic crimes, could result in fines and other liabilities, penalties or consequences for us, which could materially affect our business and reputation and reduce our profitability.\n\nING has faced, and in the future may continue to face, the consequences of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the potential commencement of regulatory investigations or legal proceedings. For additional information on legal proceedings, see Note 42 'Legal proceedings' in the consolidated financial statements. There are potential risks in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear: subject to multiple interpretations or under development; where regulations may conflict with one another; or where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings. These could result in our failure to meet applicable standards. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring investigations and/or administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which could result, among other things, in suspension or revocation of our licences, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm our results and financial condition as well as ING's reputation. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, any of these matters appropriately, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to additional legal risk, which could, in turn, increase\n\nthe size and number of claims and damages brought against us or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\n\nFurthermore, as a financial institution, we are exposed to the risk of unintentional involvement in criminal activity in connection with financial economic crimes, including sanctions circumvention and money laundering and the funding of terrorist and other criminal activities. The failure or perceived failure by us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements with respect to financial economic crimes may result in adverse publicity, claims and allegations, litigation and regulatory investigations and sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results, financial condition and/or prospects in any given period. For further discussion on the impact of litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions with respect to financial economic crimes, see 'We may be subject to litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions, and adverse publicity' below.\n\n## Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities.\n\nWe are subject to detailed banking laws and financial regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Regulation of the industries in which we operate has become more extensive and complex, while also attracting supervisory scrutiny. Compliance with applicable and new laws and regulations is resourceintensive, and may materially increase our operating costs. Moreover, these regulations intend to protect our customers, markets and society as a whole and can limit or redirect our activities, among others, through stricter net capital, market conduct and transparency requirements and restrictions on the businesses in which we can operate or invest.\n\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our industry have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and longterm funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions.\n\nWe are subject to additional legal and regulatory risk in certain countries where we operate with less developed or predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn certain countries in which we operate or where our clients reside, judiciary and dispute resolution systems may be less effective. As a result, in case of a breach of contract, we may have difficulties in making and enforcing claims against contractual counterparties and, if claims are made against us, we might encounter difficulties in mounting a defence against such allegations. If we become party to legal proceedings in a market with an insufficiently developed judicial system, it could have an adverse effect on our operations and net results.",

In particular, we have wholesale banking activities in both Russia and Ukraine, as well as investments in Russia, some of which are denominated in local currency. Furthermore, the current economic environment in certain countries in which we operate may increase the likelihood for regulatory initiatives to enhance consumer protection or to protect homeowners from foreclosures. Any such regulatory initiative could have an adverse impact on our ability to protect our economic interest, for instance in the event of defaults on residential mortgages.\n\n## We are subject to the regulatory supervision of the ECB and other regulators with extensive supervisory and investigatory powers.\n\nIn its capacity as principal prudential supervisor in the EU, the ECB has extensive supervisory and investigatory powers, including the ability to issue requests for information, to conduct regulatory investigations and on-site inspections, and to impose monetary and other sanctions. For example, under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the relevant (national) competent authorities, including the ECB, may conduct stress tests and have discretion to impose capital surcharges on financial institutions for risks that are not otherwise recognised in risk-weighted assets or other surcharges depending on the individual situation of the bank, and take or require other measures, such as restrictions on or changes to the Group's business. Competent authorities may also prohibit the Group from making dividend payments to shareholders or distributions to holders of its regulatory capital instruments if the Group fails to comply with regulatory requirements, in particular with supervisory actions, minimum capital requirements (including buffer requirements) or with liquidity requirements, or if there are shortcomings in its governance and risk management processes. A failure to comply with prudential or conduct regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results and financial condition.\n\nFailure to meet minimum capital and other prudential regulatory requirements as applicable to us from time to time may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition and on our ability to make payments on certain of our securities.\n\nING is subject to a variety of regulations that require us to comply with minimum requirements for capital (own funds) and additional loss-absorbing capacity, as well as for liquidity, and to comply with leverage restrictions. In addition, such capital, liquidity and leverage requirements and their application and interpretation may change. Any changes may require us to maintain more capital or to raise a different type of capital by disqualifying existing capital instruments from continued inclusion in regulatory capital, requiring replacement with new capital instruments that meet the new criteria. Sometimes changes are introduced subject to a transitional period during which the new requirements are being phased in, gradually progressing to a fully phased-in, or fully-loaded, application of the requirements.\n\nAny failure to comply with these requirements, or to adapt to changes in such requirements, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition, and may require us to seek additional capital. Failures to meet minimum capital or other prudential requirements may also result in ING being prohibited from making payments on certain of our securities. Because implementation phases and transposition into EU or national regulation where required may often involve a lengthy period, the impact of changes in capital, liquidity and leverage regulations on our business, results and financial condition, and on our ability to make payments on certain of our securities, is often unclear.\n\n## Our US commodities and derivatives business is subject to CFTC and SEC regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nOur affiliate ING Capital Markets LLC is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a swap dealer and is subject to CFTC regulation of the off-exchange derivatives market pursuant to Title VII of the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Operating as a swap dealer requires compliance with CFTC regulatory requirements, which may be burdensome, impose additional compliance costs and could adversely affect the profitability of this business, as well as exposing ING to the risk of non-compliance with these regulations.\n\nING Capital Markets LLC is also registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer. Operating as a security-based swap dealer requires compliance with SEC regulatory requirements, which may be burdensome, impose additional compliance costs and could adversely affect the profitability of this business, as well as exposing ING to the risk of non-compliance with these regulations. While most of these SEC requirements apply to ING Capital Markets LLC, in addition to its CFTC swap dealer requirements, SEC rules have permitted an Alternative Compliance Mechanism that allows for compliance, subject to eligibility requirements, with CFTC capital and margin rules applying to swap dealers in lieu of SEC capital and margin rules applying to security-based swap dealers. ING Capital Markets LLC has elected to use the Alternative Compliance Mechanism. However, should ING Capital Markets LLC in the future be ineligible for the Alternative Compliance Mechanism it would be subject to SEC security-based swap dealer rules for margin, capital, and related financial reporting instead of the CFTC swap dealer rules which could be more capitalintensive.\n\nOn 15 December 2021, the SEC proposed new rules that would for the first time impose public reporting requirements for some significant security-based swaps positions. The rules would apply even to trades between non-US counterparties, including ING Bank, provided that the issuer of the reference securities underlying the security-based swaps is organised in the US, the issuer of the reference securities underlying the security-based swaps has its principal place of business in the US, or the securities are in certain categories registered with the SEC.\n\nThese proposed regulations, if adopted in their current form, could constrain trading activity in securitybased swaps. In addition, there are, or may be in the future, regulatory requirements or limitations related",

These various requirements and limitations with respect to equity derivatives generally could have a significant impact on the liquidity and utility of these markets, materially impacting ING's business in this market.\n\nIn addition, position limits requirements have been imposed by the CFTC for enumerated listed futures referencing twenty-five physical commodities. In addition, on 1 January 2023, these position limits were extended to certain positions in swaps that are 'economically equivalent' to the enumerated futures contracts. The position limits on futures and related swaps could limit ING's position sizes in these swaps referencing specified physical commodities and similarly limit the ability of counterparties to utilise certain of our products, to the extent that hedging exemptions from the position limits are unavailable. Any of the foregoing factors, and any further regulatory developments with respect to commodities and derivatives, could have a material impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to several other bank recovery and resolution regimes that include statutory write-down and conversion as well as other powers, which remains subject to significant uncertainties as to scope and impact on us.\n\nWe are subject to several recovery and resolution regimes, including the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive' (BRRD) as implemented in national legislation, such as the Dutch Financial Supervision Act. The SRM applies to banks that are supervised by the ECB under the SSM, with the aim of ensuring an orderly resolution of failing banks at minimum cost for taxpayers and the real economy. The BRRD establishes a common framework for the recovery and resolution of banks within the European Union, with the aim of providing supervisory authorities and resolution authorities with common tools and powers to address banking crises pre-emptively to safeguard financial stability and minimise taxpayers' exposure to losses. Any application of statutory write-down and conversion or other powers would not be expected to constitute an event of default under our securities entitling holders to seek repayment. If any of these powers were to be exercised in respect of ING, there could be a material adverse effect on both ING and on holders of ING securities, including through a material adverse effect on credit ratings and/or the price of our securities. Investors in our securities may lose their investment if resolution measures are taken under current or future regimes.\n\n## Risks related to litigation, enforcement proceedings and investigations and to changes in tax laws\n\nWe may be subject to litigation, enforcement proceedings, investigations or other regulatory actions, and adverse publicity.\n\nWe are involved in governmental, regulatory, arbitration and legal proceedings and investigations involving claims by and against us which arise in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in connection with\n\nour activities as financial services provider, employer, investor and taxpayer. As a financial institution, we are subject to specific laws and regulations governing financial services and/or financial institutions. See 'Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group. Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities' and 'Our US commodities and derivatives business is subject to CFTC and SEC regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act' above. Financial reporting irregularities involving other large and well-known companies, possible findings of government authorities in various jurisdictions which are investigating several processes, notifications made by whistleblowers, increasing regulatory and law enforcement scrutiny of 'know your customer' anti-money laundering regulations, tax evasion, prohibited transactions with countries or persons subject to sanctions, and bribery or other anti-corruption measures and anti-terrorist-financing procedures and their effectiveness, regulatory investigations of the banking industry, and litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure by us to comply with legal, regulatory, tax and compliance requirements could result in adverse publicity and reputational harm, lead to increased regulatory supervision, affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and maintain access to the capital markets, result in cease and desist orders, claims, enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal penalties, other disciplinary action or have other material adverse effects on us in ways that are not predictable. With respect to sanctions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed the global political landscape, resulting in a world-wide response, whereby new and significant sanctions packages were imposed against Russia and Belarus during 2022 and 2023. During 2023, there have been several noteworthy developments highlighting the increasing focus of the EU, US, and other governments on the potential circumvention of sanctions against Russia, and the roles of third countries and companies in facilitating the circumvention or undermining of such sanction's measures. This has prompted a concerted effort by governments to impose pressure on companies operating in these jurisdictions, and to stop the sanctions measures from being sidestepped by targeted Russian parties. The EU introduced additional measures combating sanctions circumvention and several locations have come into focus as potential diversion hubs. While various sanctions include grace periods before full compliance is required, there is no guarantee that ING will be able to implement all required procedures within the applicable grace periods. In addition, some claims and allegations may be brought by or on behalf of a class and claimants may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including compensatory, liquidated, treble and punitive damages. Our reserves for litigation liabilities may prove to be inadequate. Claims and allegations, should they become public, need not be well founded, true or successful to have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, press reports and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing could result in inquiries or investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials, and responding to these inquiries and investigations, regardless of their ultimate outcome, is time consuming and expensive. Adverse publicity, claims and allegations, litigation and regulatory investigations and sanctions may have a material adverse effect on our business, results, financial condition and/or prospects in any given period.",

Changes in tax laws could also make certain ING products less attractive, which could have adverse consequences for our businesses and results. On 7 June 2021, the Dutch government received a formal notice of termination of the Dutch-Russian tax treaty from Russia, and as a result, the tax treaty was terminated as of 1 January 2022. The termination of the Dutch-Russian tax treaty or any other similar developments may have adverse effects on ING and ING's customers.\n\nBecause of the geographic spread of its business, ING may be subject to tax audits, investigations and procedures in numerous jurisdictions at any point in time. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all our tax positions, the ultimate resolution of these audits, investigations and procedures may result in liabilities which are different from the amounts recognized. In addition, increased bank taxes in countries where the Group is active result in increased taxes on ING's banking operations, which could negatively impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\n## We may be subject to tax investigations under EU, US and local laws if we fail to comply with our obligations\n\nDue to the nature of its business, ING is subject to various provisions of EU, US, and other local tax laws in relation to its customers. These include amongst others the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ('FATCA'), which requires ING to provide certain information for the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Qualified Intermediary (QI) requirements, which require withholding tax on certain US-source payments, and the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) which requires ING to provide certain information to local tax authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements and regulations could harm our reputation and could subject the Group to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues, results, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## ING is exposed to the risk of claims from customers or stakeholders who feel misled or treated unfairly because of advice or information received.\n\nOur products and services, including banking products and advice services for third-party products are exposed to claims from customers who might allege that they have received insufficient advice or misleading information from advisers (both internal and external) as to which products were most appropriate for them, or that the terms and conditions of the products, the nature of the products or the circumstances under which the products were sold, were misrepresented to them. When new financial products are brought to the market, it is ING's policy to engage in a multidisciplinary product approval\n\nprocess in connection with the development and distribution of such products, including production of appropriate marketing and communication materials. Notwithstanding these processes, customers may make claims against ING if the products do not meet their expectations , either at the purchase/execution of the product and/or through the life of the product. Customer protection regulations, as well as changes in interpretation and perception by both the public at large and governmental authorities of acceptable market practices, influence customer expectations\n\nProducts distributed through person-to-person sales forces have a higher exposure to such claims as the sales forces may provide face-to-face financial planning and advisory services. Complaints may also arise if customers feel that they have not been treated reasonably or fairly, or that the duty of care has not been complied with. While a considerable amount of time and resources have been invested in reviewing and assessing historical sales practices and products that were sold in the past, and in the maintenance of risk management, legal and compliance procedures to monitor current sales practices, there can be no assurance that all of the issues associated with current and historical sales practices have been or will be identified, nor that any issues already identified will not be more widespread than presently estimated.\n\nThe negative publicity associated with any sales practices, any compensation payable in respect of any such issues and regulatory changes resulting from such issues, has had and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results, financial condition and prospects. For additional information regarding legal proceedings or claims, see Note 45 'Legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's business and operations\n\nING may be unable to meet internal or external aims or expectations or requirements with respect to ESG-related matters.\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is an area of significant and increased focus for governments and regulators, investors, ING's customers and employees, and other stakeholders or third parties (e.g., nongovernmental organisations or NGOs). As a result, an increasing number of laws, regulations and legislative actions have been introduced to address climate change, sustainability and other ESG-related matters, including in relation to the financial sector's operations and strategy. Such recent regulations include the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), EU Taxonomy regulation and EU Green Bond Standards, which broadly focus on disclosure obligations, standardized definitions and classification frameworks for environmentally sustainable activities, and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which requires certain companies, including us, to disclose information on what they see as the risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues, and on the impact of their activities on people and the environment. Third parties may pursue litigation against ING in connection with ESG-related matters, such as the recently announced potential claims by Friends of the Earth Netherlands",

ING may from time to time disclose ESG-related initiatives or aims in connection with the conduct of its business and operations. However, there is no guarantee that ING will be able to implement such initiatives or meet such aims within anticipated timeframes, or at all. ING may fail to fulfil internal or external ESG-related initiatives, aims or expectations, or may be perceived to fail to do so, or may fail to adequately or accurately report performance or developments with respect to such initiatives, aims or expectations. ING could therefore be criticised or held responsible for the scope of its initiatives or goals regarding such matters. In addition, ING might face requests for specific strategies, plans or commitments to address ESG-related matters, which may or may not be viewed as satisfactory to the relevant internal and external stakeholders (including NGOs). Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on ING's reputation and brand value, or on ING's business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n## ING may be unable to adapt its products and services to meet changing customer behaviour and demand, including as a result of ESG-related matters.\n\nCustomers or other counterparties may increasingly assess sustainability or other ESG-related matters in their economic decisions. For instance, customers may choose investment products or services based on sustainability or other ESG criteria, or may look at a financial institution's ESG-related lending strategy when choosing to make deposits. To remain competitive and to safeguard its reputation, ING is required to continuously adapt its business strategy, products and services to respond to emerging, increasing or changing sustainability and other ESG-related demands from customers, investors and other stakeholders. However, there is no guarantee that ING's current or future products or services will meet applicable ESGrelated regulatory requirements, customer preferences or investor expectations.\n\n## ING's business and operations are exposed to transition risks related to climate change .\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon or net-zero economy gives rise to risks and uncertainties associated with climate change-related laws, regulations and oversight, changing or new technologies, and shifting customer sentiment. For instance, ING may be required to change its lending portfolio to comply with new climate change-related regulations and other ESG-related demands from customers, investors and other stakeholders. As a result, it might be unable and unwilling to lend to certain prospective customers, or lead\n\nto the termination of certain existing relationships with certain customers. This could result in claims or legal challenges from such customers against ING. This transition may also adversely impact the business and operations of ING's customers and other counterparties. Further, there is a risk that changing community standards and market expectations could lead to a reduction in demand and a decline in valuations for certain assets, which may affect the value of collateral we hold or the financial strength of certain of our portfolios. If ING fails to adequately factor in such risks in its lending or other business decisions, ING could be exposed to losses.\n\nThe low carbon or net zero transition may also require ING to modify or implement new compliance systems, internal controls and procedures or governance frameworks. The integration and automation of internal governance, compliance, and disclosure and reporting frameworks across ING could lead to increased operational costs for ING and other execution and operational risks. The implementation cost of these systems may especially be higher in the near term as ING seeks to adapt its business, or address overlapping, duplicative or conflicting regulatory or other requirements in this fast-developing area. Furthermore, ING's ongoing implementation of appropriate systems, controls and frameworks increasingly requires ING to develop adequate climate change-related risk assessment and modelling capabilities (as there is currently no standard approach or methodology available), and to collect customer, third party or other data. There are significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of new risk modelling methodologies and the collection of data, potentially resulting in systems or frameworks that could be inadequate, inaccurate or susceptible to incorrect customer, third party or other data.\n\nAny delay or failure in developing, implementing or meeting ING's climate change-related commitments and regulatory requirements may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation, and lead to climate change or ESG-related investigations, enforcement proceedings or litigation.\n\n## ING's business and operations are exposed to physical risks, including as a direct result of climate change.\n\nING's business and operations may be exposed to the impacts of physical risks arising from climate and weather-related events, including heatwaves, droughts, flooding, storms, rising sea levels, other extreme weather events or natural disasters, and to the impacts of physical risks arising from the environmental degradation, including loss of biodiversity, water or resources scarcity, pollution or waste management. Such physical risks could disrupt ING's business continuity and operations or impact ING's premises or property portfolio, as well as its customers' property, business or other financial interests. These risks could potentially result in impairing asset values, financial losses, declining creditworthiness of customers and increased defaults, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in ING's portfolio, etc. In particular, changing climate patterns resulting in more frequent and extreme weather events, such as the severe flooding that occurred in Western Europe in July 2021, the long-lasting bushfires in Australia in February 2021 or the severe flooding in the eastern states of Australia in early 2022, could lead to unexpected business interruptions or losses for ING or its customers.",

Our clients depend on our ability to process and report a large number of transactions efficiently and accurately. In addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information electronically. Losses can result from inadequately trained or skilled personnel, IT failures (including due to a cyber attack), inadequate or failed internal control processes and systems (including, as the role of Artificial Intelligence in the finance industry and in our business increases, any errors as a result of incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed outputs from the algorithms and data sets utilized), regulatory breaches, human errors, employee misconduct, including fraud, or from natural disasters or other external events that interrupt normal business operations. Such losses may adversely affect our reputation, business and results.\n\nWe depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. The equipment and software used in our computer systems and networks may not always be capable of processing, storing or transmitting information as expected. Despite our business continuity plans and procedures, certain of our computer systems and networks may have insufficient recovery capabilities in the event of a malfunction or loss of data. We are consistently managing and monitoring our IT risk profile globally. ING is subject to increasing regulatory requirements including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and the new Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) which will enter into force in January 2025. Failure to appropriately manage and monitor our IT risk profile could affect our ability to comply with these regulatory requirements, to securely and efficiently serve our clients or to timely, completely or accurately process, store and transmit information, and may adversely impact our reputation, business and results. For further description of the particular risks associated with cybercrime, which is a specific risk to ING as a result of its strategic focus on technology and innovation, see 'We are subject to increasing risks related to cybercrime and compliance with cybersecurity regulation' below.\n\nIn addition, as finance industry participants are increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence into their processes and systems, the risk of data and information leaks is correspondingly increasing.  Our or our customers' sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our or our third-party providers' use of generative or other Artifical\n\nIntelligence technologies. Any such information that we input into a third-party generative or other Artificial Intelligence or machine learning platform could be revealed to others, including if information is used to train the third party's Artificial Intelligence models. Additionally, where an Artificial Intelligence model ingests personal information and makes connections using such data, those technologies may reveal other sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information generated by the model.\n\nWidespread outbreaks of communicable diseases may impact the health of our employees, increasing absenteeism, or may cause a significant increase in the utilisation of health benefits offered to our employees, either or both of which could adversely impact our business. Further, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our staff continue to work from home on a full- or part-time basis, which may raise operational risks, including with respect to information security, data protection, availability of key systems and infrastructure integrity. In addition, other events including unforeseeable and/or catastrophic events can lead to an abrupt interruption of activities, and our operations may be subject to losses resulting from such disruptions. Losses can result from destruction or impairment of property, financial assets, trading positions, and the loss of key personnel. If our business continuity plans are not able to be implemented, are not effective or do not sufficiently take such events into account, losses may increase further.\n\n## We are subject to increasing risks related to cybercrime and compliance with cybersecurity regulation.\n\nLike other financial institutions and global companies, we are regularly the target of cyber attacks, which is a specific risk to ING as a result of its strategic focus on technology and innovation. In particular, threats from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), targeted attacks (also called Advanced Persistent Threats) and ransomware have intensified worldwide, and attempts to gain unauthorised access and the sophistication of techniques used for such attacks is increasing. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and the techniques used in these attacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including the use of emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of Artificial Intelligence and quantum computing. The new cyber risks introduced by these changes in technology require us to devote significant attention to identification, assessment and analysis of the risks and implementation of corresponding preventative measures. We have faced, and expect to continue to face, an increasing number of cyber attacks (both successful and unsuccessful) as we have further digitalised. This includes the continuing expansion of our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage and reliance on cloud technology.\n\nCybersecurity, the use and safeguarding of customer data and data privacy have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The EU's second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), GDPR and DORA are examples of such regulations. The resilience of financial institutions against ransomware attacks is now subject of the yearly stress test executed by the ECB in 2024. In certain locations where ING is active, there are additional local regulatory requirements and legislation on top of EU regulations that must be followed for business conducted in that jurisdiction. Some of these legislations and regulations may be conflicting due to local regulatory interpretations. We may become subject to new EU and local legislation",

Failure to comply with new and existing legislation or regulation could harm our reputation and could subject the Group to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\n\nING may be exposed to the risks of misappropriation, unauthorised access, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other external attacks or internal breaches for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or impairing operational performance, each of which could have a security impact. These events could also jeopardise our confidential information or that of our clients or our counterparties. These events can potentially result in financial loss and harm to our reputation, hinder our operational effectiveness, result in regulatory censure, compensation costs or fines resulting from regulatory investigations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenues, results, financial condition and prospects. Even when we are successful in defending against cyber attacks, such defence may consume significant resources or impose significant additional costs on ING.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 pandemic has now largely subsided, there has been an increase in the digital behaviour of our customers leading to reduced traffic in branches. Over 95 percent of our customers now interact with us via digital channels only. This increased reliance on digital banking and remote working may increase the risk of cybersecurity breaches, loss of personal data and related reputational risk. If any of these risks were to materialise that may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\n\nBecause we operate in highly competitive markets, including our home market, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share, which may have an adverse effect on our results.\n\nThere is substantial competition in the Netherlands and the other countries in which we do business for the types of wholesale banking, retail banking, investment banking and other products and services we provide. Customer loyalty and retention can be influenced by several factors, including brand recognition, reputation, relative service levels, the prices and attributes of products and services, scope of distribution, credit ratings and actions taken by existing or new competitors (including non-bank or financial technology competitors). A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely impact our ability to maintain or further increase our market share, which would adversely affect our results. Such competition is most pronounced in our more mature markets of the Netherlands, Belgium, the rest of Western Europe and Australia. In recent years, however, competition in emerging markets, such as Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, has also increased as large financial services companies from more developed countries have sought to establish themselves in markets which are perceived to offer higher growth potential, and as local institutions have become more sophisticated and competitive and proceeded to form alliances, mergers or strategic relationships with some of our competitors. The Netherlands is our largest market. Our main competitors in the banking sector in the Netherlands are ABN AMRO Bank and Rabobank.\n\nCompetition could also increase due to new entrants (including non-bank and financial technology competitors) in the markets that may have new operating models that are not burdened by potentially costly legacy operations and that are subject to reduced regulation. New entrants may rely on new technologies, advanced data and analytic tools, lower cost to serve, less extensive oversight from regulators compared to the frameworks established in respect of traditional banks and/or faster processes to challenge traditional banks. Developments in technology have also accelerated the use of new business models, and ING may not be successful in adapting to this pace of change or may incur significant costs in adapting its business and operations to meet such changes. For example, new business models have been observed in retail payments, consumer and commercial lending (such as peer-to-peer lending), foreign exchange and low-cost investment advisory services. In particular, the emergence of disintermediation in the financial sector resulting from new banking, lending and payment solutions offered by rapidly evolving incumbents, challengers and new entrants, in particular with respect to payment services and products, and the introduction of disruptive technology may impede our ability to grow or retain our market share and impact our revenues and profitability.\n\nIncreasing competition in the markets in which we operate (including from non-banks and financial technology competitors) may significantly impact our results if we are unable to match the products and services offered by our competitors. Future economic turmoil may accelerate additional consolidation activity. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy. These developments could result in our competitors gaining greater access to capital and liquidity, expanding their ranges of products and services, or gaining geographic diversity. We may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors in the event that some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, results and financial condition.\n\nWe may not always be able to protect our intellectual property developed in our products and services and may be subject to infringement claims, which could adversely impact our core business, inhibit efforts to monetize our internal innovations and restrict our ability to capitalize on future opportunities.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, trade name, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property, which we develop in connection with our products and services. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. In that event, we may be required to incur significant costs, and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could have an adverse effect on our core business and our ability to compete, including through the monetisation of our internal innovations.",

Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right (including where we or a third party have used generative Artificial Intelligence outputs based on data for which the generative model may not have had consent), we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilising and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licences. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or to implement a costly workaround. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results and could restrict our ability to pursue future business opportunities.\n\nThe inability of counterparties to meet their financial obligations or our inability to fully enforce our rights against counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our results.\n\nThird parties that have an payment obligations to ING, or obligations to return money, securities or other assets, may not pay or perform under their obligations. These parties include the issuers and guarantors (including sovereigns) of securities we hold, borrowers under loans originated, reinsurers, customers, trading counterparties, securities lending and repurchase counterparties, counterparties under swaps, credit default and other derivative contracts, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries. Defaults by one or more of these parties on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, continuing low oil or other commodity prices, operational failure or other factors, or even rumours about potential defaults by one or more of these parties or regarding a severe distress of the financial services industry generally, could have a material adverse effect on our results, financial condition and liquidity. Given the high level of interdependence between financial institutions, we are and will continue to be subject to the risk of deterioration of the commercial and financial soundness, or perceived soundness, of sovereigns and other financial services institutions. This is particularly relevant to our franchise as an important and large counterparty in equity, fixed income and foreign exchange markets, including related derivatives.\n\nWe routinely execute a high volume of transactions, such as unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments with counterparties and customers in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, insurance companies, institutional clients, futures clearing merchants, swap dealers, and other institutions, resulting in large periodic settlement amounts, which may result in us having significant credit exposure to one or more of such counterparties or customers. As a result, we could face concentration risk with respect to liabilities or amounts we expect to collect from specific counterparties and customers. We are exposed to increased counterparty risk as a result of recent financial institution failures and weakness and will continue to be exposed to the risk of loss if counterparty financial institutions fail or are otherwise unable to meet their obligations. As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and related international response measures,\n\nincluding sanctions and capital controls, we may be exposed to increased risk of default of counterparties located in Russia and Ukraine, counterparties of which the ultimate parent is located in Russia or may be considered effectively controlled or influenced through Russian involvement, and other counterparties in sectors affected by the response measures. Also, liquidity or currency controls enforced by the Russian central bank may impact Russian companies' ability to pay. In addition, we have counterparty exposure to Russian entities in connection with foreign exchange derivatives for future receipt of foreign currencies against Russian rouble (RUB). Remaining at risk for ING at year-end 2023 is \u20ac0.4 billion local equity and \u20ac1.3 billion credit exposures booked outside of Russia, and \u20ac0.6 billion with clients in Ukraine. A default by, or even concerns about the creditworthiness of, one or more of these counterparties or customers or other financial services institutions could therefore have an adverse effect on our results or liquidity.\n\nWith respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to a number of financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and equity investments. For example, we hold certain hybrid regulatory capital instruments issued by financial institutions which permit the issuer to cancel coupon payments on the occurrence of certain events or at their option. The ECB has indicated that, in certain circumstances, it may require these financial institutions to cancel payment. If this were to happen, we expect that such instruments may experience ratings downgrades and/or a drop in value and we may have to treat them as impaired, which could result in significant losses. There is no assurance that losses on, or impairments to the carrying value of, these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business, results or financial condition.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. The deterioration or perceived deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and/ or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our income and risk weighting, leading to increased capital requirements. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. Also in this case, our credit risk may also be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us, which is most likely to occur during periods of illiquidity and depressed asset valuations, such as those experienced during the financial crisis of 2008. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims. Bankruptcies, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral tend to increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Any of these developments or losses could materially and adversely affect our business, results, financial condition, and/or prospects.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\nRatings are important to our business for a number of reasons, and a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our results and net results.\n\nCredit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity's ability to repay its indebtedness. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to raise capital and funding through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. In the event of a downgrade, the cost of issuing debt will increase, having an adverse effect on our net results. Certain institutional investors may also be obliged to withdraw their deposits from ING following a downgrade, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. They can also have lower risk appetite for our debt notes, leading to lower purchases of (newly issued) debt notes. We have credit ratings from S&P, Moody's Investor Service and Fitch Ratings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings and rating methodologies on a recurring basis and may decide on a downgrade at any time.\n\nAs rating agencies continue to evaluate the financial services industry, it is possible that rating agencies will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to financial institutions, increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, request additional information from the companies that they rate and potentially adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. It is possible that the outcome of any such review of us would have additional adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition. We may need to take actions in response to changing standards or capital requirements set by any of the rating agencies, which could cause our business and operations to suffer. We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies.\n\nFurthermore, ING's assets are risk-weighted. Downgrades of these assets could result in a higher riskweighting, which may result in higher capital requirements. This may impact net earnings and the return on capital, and may have an adverse impact on our competitive position.\n\n## An inability to retain or attract key personnel may affect our business and results.\n\nING Group relies to a considerable extent on the quality of its senior management, such as members of the executive committee, and management in the jurisdictions which are material to ING's business and operations. The success of ING Group's operations is dependent, among other things, on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for key personnel in most countries in which ING Group operates, and globally for senior management, is intense. ING Group's ability to attract and retain key personnel, in senior management and in particular areas such as technology and operational management, client relationship management, finance, risk and product development, is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent.\n\nThe increasing restrictions on, and public and political scrutiny of, remuneration (especially in the Netherlands), may continue to have an impact on existing ING Group remuneration policies and individual remuneration packages for personnel. For example, under the EU's amended Shareholder Rights Directive, known as SRD II, which came into effect on 10 June 2019, ING is required to hold a shareholder binding vote on ING's Executive Board remuneration policy and Supervisory Board remuneration policy at least every four years. Furthermore the shareholders have an advisory vote on ING's remuneration report annually. This may restrict our ability to offer competitive compensation compared with companies (financial and/or nonfinancial) that are not subject to such restrictions and it could adversely affect ING Group's ability to retain or attract key personnel, which, in turn, may affect our business and results.\n\nWe may incur further liabilities in respect of our defined benefit retirement plans if the value of plan assets is not sufficient to cover potential obligations, including as a result of differences between actual results and underlying actuarial assumptions and models.\n\nING Group companies operate various defined benefit retirement plans covering the post-employment benefits of a number of our employees. The liability recognised in our consolidated balance sheet in respect of our defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date, less the fair value of each plan's assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and unrecognised past service costs. We determine our defined benefit plan obligations based on internal and external actuarial models and calculations using the projected unit credit method. Inherent in these actuarial models are assumptions, including discount rates, rates of increase in future salary and benefit levels, mortality rates and consumer price index. These assumptions are based on available market data and are updated annually. Nevertheless, the actuarial assumptions may differ significantly from actual results due to changes in market conditions, economic and mortality trends and other assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our present and future liabilities and costs associated with our defined benefit plans.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's risk management practices\n\nRisks relating to our use of quantitative models or assumptions to model client behaviour for the purposes of our market calculations may adversely impact our reputation or results.\n\nWe use quantitative methods, systems or approaches that apply statistical, economic financial, or mathematical theories, techniques and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates. Errors in the development, implementation, use or interpretation of such models, or from incomplete or incorrect data, can lead to inaccurate, noncompliant or misinterpreted model outputs, which may adversely impact our reputation and results. In addition, we use assumptions in to model client behaviour for the risk calculations in our banking books. Assumptions are used to determine the interest rate risk profile of savings",

Assumptions based on past client behaviour may not always be a reliable indicator of future behaviour. The realisation or use of different assumptions to determine client behaviour could have a material adverse effect on the calculated risk figures and, ultimately, our future results or reputation. Furthermore, we may be subject to risks related to changes in the laws and regulations governing the risk management practices of financial institutions. For further information, see 'Risks related to the regulation and supervision of the Group - Changes in laws and/or regulations governing financial services or financial institutions or the application of such laws and/or regulations may increase our operating costs and limit our activities' above. As noted there, regulation of the industries in which we operates is becoming increasingly more extensive and complex, while also attracting supervisory scrutiny. Compliance failures may lead to changes in the laws and regulations governing the risk management practices and materially increase our operating costs.\n\n## We may be unable to manage our risks successfully through derivatives.\n\nWe employ various economic hedging strategies with the objective of mitigating the market risks that are inherent in our business and operations. These risks include currency fluctuations, changes in the fair value of our investments, the impact of interest rates, equity markets and credit spread changes, the occurrence of credit defaults and changes in client behaviour. We seek to control these risks by, among other things, entering into a number of derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forward contracts, including, from time to time, macro hedges for parts of our business, either directly as a counterparty or as a credit support provider to affiliate counterparties. Developing an effective strategy for dealing with these risks is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with those fluctuations. Our hedging strategies also rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, general market factors and the creditworthiness of our counterparties that may prove to be incorrect or prove to be inadequate. Accordingly, our hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results or financial condition. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risks and losses. Hedging strategies involve transaction costs and other costs, and if we terminate a hedging arrangement, we may also be required to pay additional costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs. There have been periods in the past, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we have incurred or may incur losses on transactions, possibly significant, after taking into account our hedging strategies. Further, the nature and timing of our hedging transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. Hedging instruments we use to manage product and other risks might not perform as intended or expected, which could result in higher realised or unrealised losses, such as credit value adjustment risks or unexpected P&L effects, and unanticipated cash needs to collateralise or settle such transactions. Adverse market conditions can limit the availability and increase the costs of hedging instruments, and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. In addition, hedging counterparties may fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralised. As such, our hedging strategies and the derivatives that we use or may use may not adequately mitigate or offset the risks they intend to cover, and our hedging transactions may result in losses.\n\nOur hedging strategy additionally relies on the assumption that hedging counterparties remain able and willing to provide the hedges required by our strategy. Increased regulation, market shocks, worsening market conditions, and/or other factors that affect or are perceived to affect the financial condition, liquidity and creditworthiness of ING may reduce the ability and/or willingness of such counterparties to engage in hedging contracts with us and/or other parties, affecting our overall ability to hedge our risks and adversely affecting our business, results and financial condition.\n\n## Risks related to the Group's liquidity and financing activities\n\nWe depend on the capital and credit markets, as well as customer deposits, to provide the liquidity and capital required to fund our operations, and adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets, or significant withdrawals of customer deposits, may impact our liquidity, borrowing and capital positions, as well as the cost of liquidity, borrowings and capital.\n\nAdverse capital market conditions have in the past affected, and may in the future affect, our cost of borrowed funds and our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis, thereby impacting our ability to support and/or grow our businesses. Furthermore, although interest rates are still relatively low by historical standards and have been since the financial crisis in 2008, interest rates are rising and we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased funding costs due in part due to the withdrawal of perceived government support of financial institutions in the event of future financial crises. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to new regulations.\n\nWe need liquidity to fund new and recurring business, to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, maintain our securities lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations and our business will suffer. The principal sources of our funding include a variety of short-and long-term instruments, including deposit fund, repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium- and long-term debt, subordinated debt securities, capital securities and shareholders' equity.\n\nIn addition, because we rely on customer deposits to fund our business and operations, the confidence of customers in financial institutions may be tested in a manner that may adversely impact our liquidity and capital position. Consumer confidence in financial institutions may, for example, decrease due to our or our competitors' failure to communicate to customers the terms of, and the benefits and risks to customers of, complex or high-fee financial products. Reduced confidence could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital position through withdrawal of deposits, in addition to our revenues and results. Because a significant percentage of our customer deposit base is originated via internet banking, a loss of customer confidence may result in a rapid withdrawal of deposits over the internet.",

        "page_content": "- > Risk factors\n\nIn the event that our current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may need to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Also see under the heading 'Ratings are important to our business for a number of reasons, and a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse impact on our results and net results'. Similarly, our access to funds may be limited if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If our internal sources of liquidity prove to be insufficient, there is a risk that we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favourable terms, or at all. Any actions we might take to access financing may, in turn, cause rating agencies to re-evaluate our ratings.\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital. Such market conditions may in the future limit our ability to raise additional capital to support business growth, or to counterbalance the consequences of losses or increased regulatory capital and rating agency capital requirements. This could force us to (i) delay raising capital, (ii) reduce, cancel or postpone payment of dividends on our shares, (iii) reduce, cancel or postpone interest payments on our other securities, (iv) issue capital of different types or under different terms than we would otherwise, or (v) incur a higher cost of capital than in a more stable market environment. This would have the potential to decrease both our profitability and our financial flexibility. Our results, financial condition, cash flows, regulatory capital and rating agency capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.\n\nFurthermore, regulatory liquidity requirements in certain jurisdictions in which we operate are remain stringent, undermining our efforts to maintain centralised management of our liquidity. These developments may cause trapped pools of liquidity and capital, resulting in inefficiencies in the cost of managing our liquidity and solvency, and hinder our efforts to integrate our balance sheet. An example of such trapped liquidity includes our operations in Germany where German regulations impose separate liquidity requirements that restrict ING's ability to move a liquidity surplus out of the German subsidiary.\n\nAs a holding company, ING Groep N.V. is dependent for liquidity on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to regulatory and other restrictions on their ability to transact with affiliates.\n\nING Groep N.V. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments to its shareholders and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt service obligations.\n\nING Groep N.V.'s ability to obtain funds to meet its obligations depends on legal and regulatory restrictions applicable to ING Groep N.V.'s subsidiaries. Many of ING Groep N.V.'s direct and indirect subsidiaries, including certain subsidiaries of ING Bank N.V., may be subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, as\n\nwell as requirements with respect to capital and liquidity levels. For example, certain local governments and regulators have taken steps and may take further steps to 'ring fence' or impose minimum internal total loss-absorbing capacity on the local affiliates of a foreign financial institution to protect clients and creditors of such affiliates in the event of financial difficulties involving such affiliates or the broader banking group. Increased local regulation and supervision have therefore limited and may in the future further limit the ability to move capital and liquidity among affiliated entities and between ING Groep N.V. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, limit the flexibility to structure intercompany and external activities of ING as otherwise deemed most operationally efficient, and increase in the overall level of capital and liquidity required by ING on a consolidated basis.\n\nLower earnings of a local entity may also reduce the ability of such local entity to make dividends and distributions to ING Groep N.V. Other restrictions, such as restrictions on payments from subsidiaries or limitations on the use of funds in client accounts, may also apply to distributions to ING Groep N.V. from its subsidiaries.\n\nING Groep N.V. has also in the past guaranteed and may in the future continue to guarantee the payment obligations of some of its subsidiaries, including ING Bank N.V. Any such guarantees may require ING Groep N.V. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or the creditors or counterparties of these subsidiaries at a time when the guaranteed subsidiary is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\n\nFinally, ING Groep N.V., as the resolution entity of ING, has an obligation to remove impediments to resolution and to improve resolvability. Regulatory authorities have required and may continue to require ING to increase capital or liquidity levels at the level of the resolution entity or at particular subsidiaries. This may result in, among other things, the issuance of additional long-term debt issuance at the level of ING Groep N.V. or particular subsidiaries.\n\n## Additional risks relating to ownership of ING shares\n\nHolders of ING shares may experience dilution of their holdings and may be impacted by any share buyback programme.\n\nING's AT1 Securities may, under certain circumstances, convert into equity securities. Such conversion would dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of ING shares and such dilution could be substantial. Additionally, any conversion, or the anticipation of the possibility of a conversion, could depress the market price of ING shares. Furthermore, we may undertake future equity offerings with or without subscription rights. In case of equity offerings without subscription rights, holders of ING shares may suffer dilutions. In case of equity offerings with subscription rights, holders of ING shares in certain jurisdictions, however, may not be entitled to exercise such rights unless the rights and the related shares are registered or qualified for sale under the relevant legislation or regulatory framework. Holders of ING shares in these jurisdictions may",

The existence of a share buyback programme could also cause the price of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a share buyback programme, and could potentially reduce the market liquidity of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities. There can be no assurance that any share buybacks will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our ordinary shares or ADSs may decline below the levels at which we repurchase any ordinary shares or ADSs.\n\nIn addition, ING cannot guarantee that any future share buyback programme will be fully consummated. The timing and amount of share repurchases pursuant to a share buyback programme will depend upon a number of factors, including market, business conditions, and the trading price of the our ordinary shares or ADSs. A share buyback programme may also be suspended or terminated at any time, and any such suspension or termination could negatively affect the trading price of, increase trading price volatility of or reduce the market liquidity of our ordinary shares, ADSs or other securities. Additionally, a share buyback programme could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities.\n\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and many of the members of our Supervisory and Executive Board and our officers reside outside of the United States, it may be difficult to enforce judgments against ING or the members of our Supervisory and Executive Boards or our officers.\n\nMost of our Supervisory Board members, our Executive Board members and some of the experts named in this Annual Report, as well as many of our officers are persons who are not residents of the United States, and most of our and their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, investors may not be able to serve process on those persons within the United States or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in US courts against us or those persons based on the civil liability provisions of the US securities laws.\n\nInvestors also may not be able to enforce judgments of US courts under the US federal securities laws in courts outside the United States, including the Netherlands. The United States and the Netherlands do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the US federal securities laws, would not be enforceable in the Netherlands unless the underlying claim is re-litigated before a Dutch court. However, under current practice, the courts of the Netherlands may be expected to render a judgment in accordance with the judgment of the relevant US\n\ncourt, provided that such judgment (i) is a final judgment and has been rendered by a court which has established its jurisdiction on the basis of internationally accepted grounds of jurisdictions, (ii) has not been rendered in violation of elementary principles of fair trial, (iii) is not contrary to the public policy of the Netherlands, and (iv) is not incompatible with (a) a prior judgment of a Netherlands court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, or (b) a prior judgment of a foreign court rendered in a dispute between the same parties, concerning the same subject matter and based on the same cause of action, provided that such prior judgment is not capable of being recognised in the Netherlands. It is uncertain whether this practice extends to default judgments as well.\n\nBased on the foregoing, there can be no assurance that US investors will be able to enforce against us or members of our board of directors, officers or certain experts named herein who are residents of the Netherlands or countries other than the United States any judgments obtained in US courts in civil and commercial matters, including judgments under the US federal securities laws.\n\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether a Dutch court would impose civil liability on us, the members of our board of directors, our officers or certain experts named herein in an original action predicated solely upon the US federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Netherlands against us or such members, officers or experts, respectively.",
