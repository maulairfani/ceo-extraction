The Company went public in November 1963 on the then Malayan Stock Exchange (now SGX). It completed its first housing project, Fresh Breezes in Johor Bahru in 1965, pioneering the 'show flat' concept. In 1966, CDL completed City Towers - its first high-rise residential development in Singapore, and developed Phase One of Clementi Park, its first full condominium concept project.\n\n## IN 1969:\n\nAs CDL was struggling financially, Mr Kwek Leng Beng proposed to his father, the late Mr Kwek Hong Png, Founder of the Hong Leong Group (HLG), to start building a stake in CDL. With the elder Kwek's belief that 'where there is land, there is wealth, and wealth opens many avenues', HLG invested in CDL, with Mr Kwek Leng Beng and two senior executives taking their positions on the CDL Board of Directors.\n\nCDL'S GROWTH JOURNEY\n\n1960s\n\n1970s\n\nSIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN SINGAPORE\n\n## IN 1972:\n\nHLG acquired a controlling stake in CDL and transformed it from a loss-making company into a profitable one. CDL started to grow from strength to strength through strategic diversification into investment properties. This began with the acquisition of Guan Realty (Private) Limited in 1972, which developed City Plaza, CDL's first mixed-use development.\n\n## IN 1974:\n\nThe late Mr Kwek Hong Png took over the Chairmanship and Mr Kwek Leng Beng was appointed CDL's Managing Director. Backed by the successful launch of City Plaza, CDL continued its trail-blazing acquisitions and soon gained recognition as a highly enterprising property developer and asset owner.\n\n## IN 1980:\n\nMr Kwek Hong Png's younger son, the late Mr Kwek Leng Joo, joined CDL to strengthen the management foundation.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, CDL launched 21 residential properties and completed 12 investment properties, including City House in the heart of Singapore's CBD. In 1987, a prime site at Ra/ffles Place was purchased, which gave rise to Republic Plaza, CDL's flagship and current headquarters. The late 1980s saw CDL grow to become the largest listed property developer in Singapore, with its market capitalisation crossing the $2 billion mark.\n\n## IN 1992:\n\nCDL started acquiring hotels in New Zealand and eventually established the Group as New Zealand's largest hotel chain.\n\n## IN 1996:\n\nCDL placed Singapore on the global map when Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc (M&C) was listed on the London Stock Exchange, a first for a Singaporecontrolled company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIN 1987:\n\nMID 1970s:\n\nSingapore established\n\na substantial industrial\n\nbase.\n\nSingapore's MRT system commenced operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SINCE 2010:\n\nCDL has embarked on a strategic diversification push to build its overseas property development and investment platforms - starting with China (since 2010 ) and expanding to include the UK (since 2013 ), Japan (since 2014 ) and Australia (since 2015 ). To future-proof its business, CDL has also expanded on initiatives to drive portfolio diversification and transformation. Since 2018 , it has been actively pursuing growth of its fund management business, as well as building a sizeable living sector portfolio, with expansion into the Private Rented Sector (PRS), senior housing and student accommodation segments.\n\n## IN 2019:\n\nCDL successfully completed the landmark privatisation of its Londonbased hospitality arm, based on a \u00a32.23 billion valuation. With Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary, the Group embarked on an integration process to drive synergies and leverage its core competencies in real estate development and asset management.\n\nSouth Beach\n\n2010s - 2020s\n\nEND 2000s:\n\nSingapore gained\n\nfirst world status.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToday, CDL's transformation from a fledging, loss-making company into a flourishing global conglomerate (one of the largest companies by market capitalisation) is nothing short of remarkable. Remembering its roots, CDL attributes its success to its founder, Mr Kwek Hong Png, who passed down sharp business acumen and a legacy of passion, commitment and perfectionism.\n\nWith illustrious achievements and having weathered many challenges over the decades, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, CDL has stayed focused on its growth journey, navigating headwinds while remaining steadfast in developing a brand synonymous with quality and excellence.\n\nIn Singapore, CDL continues to redefine the city skyline with numerous award-winning architectural icons, such as the sculptural SOM-designed New Futura and the SCDA-designed Amber Park .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIN 2022:\n\nSingapore overcame the COVID-19 pandemic and fully reopens its borders.\n\n## Conserving as We          Construct, Six Decades On...\n\n## FORMATIVE YEARS\n\n## GROWTH\n\n## TRANSFORMATION\n\nCity Square Mall, Singapore\n\n## SINCE 2000:\n\nDespite the challenging economic conditions with the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) slowing down the recovery of Asian economies, CDL continued to perform commendably. During this period, over 50 residential projects were completed, creating many firsts, including Singapore's tallest residences (The Sail @ Marina Bay) and Singapore's first branded residences (St. Regis Residences, Singapore) when the projects were launched in 2004 and 2006 respectively. City Square Mall, Singapore's first eco-mall, was opened in 2009.\n\nIN 2006:\n\nM&C announced the initial public o/ffering of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT). CDLHT is the first hotel Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in Singapore and is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality REIT and CDL Hospitality Business Trust. The same year, M&C also o/fficially opened the five-star Millennium Hongqiao Hotel Shanghai (now known as Grand Millennium Shanghai Hongqiao), its first hotel in China.\n\nThe Sail @ Marina Bay\n\n2000s\n\nIN 1965:\n\nSingapore\n\ngained\n\nindependence.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Together  with  our  hospitality arm, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C), our Group has also expanded to over 155 hotels globally.\n\nReflecting on our journey, much  has changed. From a struggling local residential developer,  we  are  recognised  today  as Singapore's  market  leader  with  a  strong development  pipeline.  Homeowners  and business communities rely on us for quality homes and o/ffices locally and abroad. Our global  portfolio  of  hotels  is  the  preferred choice for many esteemed guests.\n\nI  am  immensely  privileged  to  have  been intricately involved in the CDL Group's growth journey for the last six decades. Together, we have shaped global skylines with architectural icons,  achieved  business  milestones  and weathered  numerous  geopolitical  storms and cyclical challenges with resilience and grit. I am confident in our Group's ability to continually adapt, innovate and prosper in an ever-evolving landscape.\n\nAs we embark on the next phase of our growth story, the Board and Management will stay steadfast in advancing our strategy, anchored by financial discipline and prudence - the cornerstones of our business success.\n\nWe will pursue new growth engines and prospects through opportunistic acquisitions, portfolio  recalibration  and  optimisation initiatives. On the sustainability front, we will work towards achieving our ESG goals as set out in the CDL Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint.\n\n## Resilient Performance Amid Challenges\n\nIn this Diamond Jubilee Year, we are pleased to report a record revenue of $4.9 billion (FY 2022:  $3.3  billion)  -  the  highest  since  our inception in 1963.\n\nThe record revenue was driven by the stellar performance  of  our  property  development segment,  which  saw  a  50%  year-on-year (y-o-y)  increase  in  revenue,  primarily  due to  the  completed  and  fully  sold  Executive Condominium  (EC)  project  Piermont  Grand, as well as the revenue from the sale of a land site in Tokyo for JPY 50 billion ($495.0 million), which contributed $1.5 billion to revenue in total.  Our  investment  properties  and  hotel operations  segments  also  showed  strong performance, with a 31.8% and 8.5% increase in revenue respectively for FY 2023.\n\nHowever,  the  global  real  estate  sector  has faced significant macroeconomic headwinds in  the  past  year  due  to  a  high  interest rate environment, inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, and weak global economies. Singapore's property cooling measures in April 2023 further compounded the situation. As a result, the Group achieved a lower net profit of $317.3 million (FY 2022: $1.3 billion) due to the impact of higher financing costs in FY 2023 and the absence of substantial divestment gains recorded in the prior year arising  from  the  sale  of  Millennium  Hilton Seoul, the deconsolidation of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) as well as the completion of the collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex.\n\nExcluding  divestment  gains  and  impairment losses, the Group's net profit would have been $188.6  million  for  FY  2023  (FY  2022:  $47.0 million) on a like-for-like basis.\n\n## Prudent Capital Management\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group maintained a  robust  capital  position  with  cash  reserves (net of overdraft) of $2.2 billion, and cash and available  undrawn  committed  bank  facilities totalling $3.6 billion, ensuring su/fficient liquidity to  fulfil  our  working  capital  and  financial obligations.  After  factoring  in  fair  value  on investment properties, the Group's net gearing ratio stands at 61% (FY 2022: 51%), following the completion of various acquisitions in 2023, including St Katharine Docks, three hotels and several living sector assets.\n\nNet Asset Value (NAV) per share moderated to $10.12 (FY 2022: $10.16) as at 31 December 2023. The Group adopts the policy of stating our investment and hotel properties at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Had the Group factored in fair value gains on our investment properties, its Revalued NAV (RNAV) per share would have been $17.21 (FY 2022: $16.98). Had the revaluation surpluses of our hotels been included, the Group's RNAV per share would be $19.46 (FY 2022: $19.14).\n\nThe  Group  maintains  a  substantial  level  of natural  hedge  for  our  overseas  investments and will continue our proactive and disciplined approach  to  capital  management.  We  will continue to focus on strategic capital recycling initiatives to strengthen our financial metrics.\n\n## Strong Portfolio Resilience\n\nIn 2023, all our business segments achieved a strong operating performance. In Singapore, CDL,  together  with  our  joint  venture  (JV) associates, sold 730 units, including ECs, with a total sales value of $1.5 billion.\n\nThe  Group's  o/ffice portfolio reported  a healthy committed  occupancy  of  97.1%, above  the  island-wide  occupancy  of  90.1%. Our retail portfolio was also well-leased, with a  committed  occupancy  of  97.6%,  above the  island-wide  occupancy  of  93.5%.  Key properties  under  each  portfolio,  including Republic Plaza, City House, King's Centre, City Square Mall and Palais Renaissance, achieved positive rental reversions.\n\nOur  hotel  operations  segment  reported  a strong performance in FY 2023, with global RevPAR growth of 25.3% to $168.7 (FY 2022: $134.6), surpassing 2019's pre-pandemic levels by 22.0%, primarily fuelled by strong average room rate (ARR) growth. All regions recorded extraordinary RevPAR growth y-o-y especially Asia and Australasia.\n\n## BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE\n\nGrowth  opportunities  lie  amid  every  crisis. Taking this contrarian approach in 2023, we invested  in  undervalued  assets,  deploying our  dry  powder  from  significant  divestment initiatives  in  the  previous  year.  We  seized opportunities to expand our portfolio, optimise operational e/fficiencies, refurbish assets and strengthen synergies across the Group's business segments to enhance performance and drive value extraction.",

        "page_content": "## Expanding Hospitality Horizons\n\nOur  hospitality  arm,  led  by  M&C,  continues to  be  a  key  growth  driver  for  the  Group. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our hotel operations have bounced back in most markets, surpassing  pre-pandemic  levels,  indicating  a restored  confidence  in  global  travel.  In  line with  the  Group's  growth  objectives,  a  key focus of our hospitality portfolio will be on new acquisitions, asset optimisation and capital recycling opportunities. We are enhancing our hospitality o/fferings and revitalising our assets through asset enhancement initiatives (AEIs) and repositioning.\n\nTo capitalise on the rebound in global tourism, we acquired three major hotels in Brisbane, Seoul and Osaka, adding 1,080 keys to our hospitality portfolio. The acquisition of the 416-room Sofitel Brisbane Central and the 256-room Bespoke Hotel Osaka Shinsaibashi marks our entry into the Brisbane and Osaka hospitality sectors respectively. Additionally, we  re-entered  the  Seoul  hotel  market  by purchasing the 408-room Nine Tree Premier Hotel Myeongdong II following our divestment of Millennium Hilton Seoul in 2022.\n\nThese  recently  acquired  properties  have achieved strong performance. Driven by the robust recovery of Japan's tourism industry, the Bespoke Hotel Osaka Shinsaibashi, acquired in August, achieved an impressive occupancy of 91.0% and a remarkable gross operating profit (GOP) margin of 58.5%. Similarly, the Nine Tree Premier Hotel Myeongdong II, acquired in July, saw an 89.3% occupancy with a 29% increase in RevPAR y-o-y.\n\nThe Group opened three hotels in 2023 that were well-timed to tap into the recovery of the travel industry. These include M Social Suzhou in China (294 rooms), M Social Phuket (former Millennium Resort Patong Phuket) in Thailand (418  rooms)  and  The  Singapore  EDITION (204 rooms). Grand Copthorne Waterfront, our 574-room hotel by the iconic Singapore River, was also relaunched in August 2023 after a $30 million revamp of its guest rooms and conference centre.\n\nSince  the  M  Social  lifestyle  brand  made its  debut  in  Singapore  in  2016,  we  have continued to expand the brand's presence across the globe, through both new builds and conversions. Three M Social hotels are in the pipeline for London, New York and California. When completed, these will join the current stable of six operational M Social properties.\n\n## Developing our Pipeline\n\nThe  Group  has  strategically  focused  on replenishing  our  landbank  in  Singapore  by actively participating in the Government Land Sales programme and exploring redevelopment opportunities  within  our  portfolio  to  ensure a  diverse  range  of  projects  and  a  healthy residential pipeline. The Group's accelerated expansion  into  the  Living  Sector  portfolio through acquiring Private Rented Sector (PRS) and  Purpose-Built  Student  Accommodation (PBSA)  assets  overseas  is  a  complementary and  natural  progression.  These  new  asset classes  will  be  an  additional  growth  engine for the Group's asset and fund management capabilities.\n\nWhile  headwinds  persist,  we  will  embrace 2024 with cautious optimism, confident of our ability to navigate the changing landscape of the real estate sector.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nThe Board would like to express its gratitude to  our  shareholders  for  their  unwavering confidence and trust, and has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 8.0 cents per share. Together with the special interim dividend of 4.0 cents per share paid in September 2023, the total cash dividend for FY 2023 amounts to 12.0 cents per share (FY 2022: 28.0 cents per share), representing a dividend payout ratio of 36%.\n\nWe would also like to thank all our stakeholders -  investors,  customers,  business  associates and partners, for their continued support.\n\nTo my fellow directors, your wise counsel and adept navigation through today's challenging business terrain are appreciated as we scale new heights of excellence.\n\nFinally, to our Management and sta/ff, thank  you  for  your  steadfast  dedication and  invaluable  contributions.  Our  Group  is 60  years  young  and  we  look  forward  to your  collective  support  in  propelling  our company forward.\n\nKwek Leng Beng\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\n## GROUP CEO'S STATEMENT\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, capital management remains a key focus for the Group. We will adopt a prudent approach to new acquisitions to manage our gearing while proactively pursuing well-timed divestments to recycle capital and unlock value from our asset portfolio, which has been held at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nSherman Kwek Group CEO\n\n## G\u00b7E\u00b7T\n\n## GROWTH\n\nBuilding a development pipeline while strengthening recurring income\n\n## ENHANCEMENT\n\nEnhancing asset value and driving operational e/fficiency\n\n## TRANSFORMATION\n\nTransforming via strategic investments, fund management and innovation\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\n2023  was  a  memorable  year  for  the  CDL Group as we celebrated our 60th Anniversary a significant milestone.  The world and business landscapes have changed tremendously since the founding of the Company and the issues today are far more complex than before as we witness  intensified  geopolitical  tensions  and macroeconomic uncertainties.\n\nDespite the di/fficult operating environment, the company's core fundaments remain strong. To stay ahead of the curve, the Group continued to build on our G rowth, E nhancement, and T ransformation  ( GET )  strategy,  which  drives superior performance outcomes and lays the foundation for sustained growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApart from growing our core development and investment portfolios, one of the highlights of 2023 was our strategic decision to expand our living sector footprint. In FY 2023, we acquired 31  Private  Rented  Sector  (PRS)  assets  and developments in the UK and Japan.\n\nSince our first foray into the sector in 2019, our global living sector portfolio now has a total gross development value (GDV) of $2.6 billion, with 4,800 PRS units and 2,400 Purpose-Built Student  Accommodation  (PBSA)  beds.  By building scale in the living sector, which has proven to be one of the most resilient asset classes  emerging  from  the  pandemic,  the Group is strengthening our recurring income and growing a significant asset base that can be leveraged to create new platforms.\n\nBeyond portfolio expansion, the Group focussed on enhancing our existing commercial and hospitality assets through redevelopment and repositioning initiatives. We also made headway in driving enterprise transformation through portfolio  harmonisation  and  optimisation initiatives. We will continue to enhance our operational  efficiency,  sharpen  our  value proposition  and  strengthen  our  execution, charting a stronger growth trajectory into the future.",

We completed about $2.4 billion of strategic investments to grow our development pipeline, enlarge  our  living  sector  portfolio,  enhance our recurring income stream and expand our hospitality footprint.\n\nIn  Singapore,  we  secured  two  sites  via  the Government  Land  Sales  (GLS)  programme to  replenish  our  development  landbank.  In September, we acquired a site at Champions Way in Woodlands for $294.9 million, which will  be  developed  into  a  residential  project with  348  units  and  an  Early  Childhood Development Centre. In November, the Group and our JV partners clinched a prime GLS site at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh for $968 million, which will be developed into a 777-unit residential project.  Both  sites  are  strategically  located within minutes' walk to an MRT station and in established neighbourhoods with a healthy catchment.\n\nAlong  with  the  residential  components  of our  two  ongoing  mixed-use  redevelopment projects - the 246-unit Newport Residences (formerly Fuji Xerox Towers) and the 366-unit Union  Square  Residences  (formerly  Central Square) - we have a solid, diversified launch pipeline of around 1,800 units.\n\nAway  from  home,  we  acquired  the  iconic St Katharine Docks waterfront estate in London for \u00a3395 million (approximately $636 million), along  with  another  two  forward-funding PRS  developments,  1NQ  in  Manchester  and Morden Wharf in London, for \u00a3152.4 million (approximately  $255.3  million)  in  total.  We also  acquired  a  portfolio  of  25  high-quality residential  assets  in  Tokyo's  rental  housing market for JPY 35 billion (approximately $321.9 million) and invested in four residential assets in Osaka (two pending sale completions).\n\nWith the strong rebound in global tourism, the Group seized the opportunity to broaden our hospitality footprint in major gateway cities, acquiring  three  hotel  assets  with  a  total  of 1,080 keys in Brisbane, Seoul, and Osaka for approximately $381.6 million.\n\n## E    ELEVATING PORTFOLIO VALUE\n\nAsset rejuvenation and portfolio enhancement are  fundamental  to  our  GET  strategy.  We continuously explore avenues to derive more value from our asset portfolio through asset  enhancement  initiatives  (AEIs),  asset repositioning and redevelopment prospects.\n\nTo  unlock  value  from  our  asset  portfolio in  Singapore  and  realise  gross  floor  area (GFA)  uplift through  various  Government incentive  schemes,  we  have  progressed  on the redevelopment of our former Fuji Xerox Towers (into Newport Plaza) and the former Central  Mall  and  Central  Square  properties (into Union Square). When completed, these two mixed-use developments will bolster the Group's  commercial  portfolio  and  enhance our recurring income.\n\nIn  2023,  we  completed  a  sizeable  AEI  for Jungceylon Shopping Center, our retail mall in Patong, Phuket. Post-AEI, the property has achieved committed occupancy of 90.0% as at 31 December 2023.\n\nDuring the year, we also started a two-phase AEI  at  City  Square  Mall,  our  largest  mall  in Singapore  at  Farrer  Park.  The  AEI  will  add about 26,000 sq ft of net lettable area (NLA) to the mall via the Community/Sports Facilities Scheme. Upon completing the entire AEI by 1H 2025, the mall will feature a diverse mix of new-to-market  retailers  and  refreshed shopper touchpoints for an elevated shopping experience.\n\nSustainability  integration  and  alignment within  our  asset  portfolio  are  crucial  to our  enhancement  strategy.  By  embracing innovation,  collaboration  and  sustainable development practices, we can reduce our carbon footprint and achieve operational cost savings from resource e/fficiency initiatives. From 2012 to 2023, we realised energy savings of over $42 million from such initiatives across all our managed buildings in Singapore.\n\nTo accelerate decarbonisation, we continue to align our finance and ESG priorities. In December 2023, we marked a new sustainable financing milestone as the first corporate to obtain the OCBC 1.5\u00b0C loan, with interest rate incentives pegged to annual decarbonisation performance targets. The three-year \u00a3200 million  (approximately  $338.2  million)\n\naspirations, leveraging  our  expertise  and sizeable asset base to launch new initiatives.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, our assets under management  (AUM)  stood  at  US$3  billion. Through  a  three-pronged  approach,  which includes  forging  strategic  partnerships  to co-invest  or  manage  assets;  nurturing  our existing  platforms  such  as  CDL  Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), IREIT Global and HThree City; and  building  a  strong  performing  recurring income portfolio that provides the flexibility of asset injection into listed or unlisted platforms, we will continue to achieve AUM growth via organic and inorganic means.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, capital management remains a key focus for the Group. We will adopt a prudent approach to new acquisitions to  manage  our  gearing  while  proactively pursuing  well-timed  divestments  to  recycle capital  and  unlock  value  from  our  asset portfolio.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nI  would  like  to  thank  our  esteemed  Board of  Directors  for  their  invaluable  guidance and  wise  counsel.  Your  contributions  have sharpened our strategy, propelled our growth and managed our risks.\n\nTo the ExCo and Senior Management team, thank you for your tireless e/fforts in shaping our  Company's  future  trajectory.  Your leadership has been instrumental to our success.\n\nTo all my  dear  colleagues,  thank  you for embracing  collaboration  and  driving innovation, all the while upholding integrity. You are the ones who have truly turned our aspirations and visions into reality.\n\nOn behalf of the Group, I would like to express our  deep  gratitude  to  all  our  shareholders, investors, customers, business partners and stakeholders. Thank you for your trust, confidence and support. As we continue to build for the future, I look forward to writing the CDL story with you.\n\n## Sherman Kwek\n\nGroup Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nsustainability-linked loan is aligned with our commitment  to  achieving  operational  net zero by 2030 for our new and existing whollyowned assets and developments under our direct operational and management control, with the entire portfolio achieving operational net zero by 2050.\n\nWith this latest 1.5\u00b0C loan, CDL has secured around $6 billion of sustainable financing in the form of a green bond, various green loans and sustainability-linked loans to date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## T    THE NEXT LAP\n\nFor the year under review, the same market dynamics  that  were  favourable  from  an acquisition  standpoint  -  compressed  asset valuations and subdued investor sentiment worked against the Group's capital recycling plans.\n\nDespite  the  muted  climate,  we  recorded total  sale  proceeds  of  $632.5  million  from our strategic divestments in FY 2023. These include the sale of a small land plot located at Tanglin Shopping Centre, eight strata units at Citilink Warehouse in Singapore, an industrial property at Mina Parade in Brisbane, Australia, the Millennium Harvest House Boulder hotel in the US, and the freehold Shirokane land site in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nApart  from  achieving  capital  gains  through divestments,  we  continue  to  explore  ways to  optimise  financial  e/fficiency  and  unlock shareholder  value.  In  November  2023,  the Group launched an O/ff-Market Equal Access O/ffer to buy back up to 10% of the total issued Preference Shares at an o/ffer price of $0.78 per share. Through the o/ffer, the Group is able to exercise greater control over our share capital structure, while Preference Shareholders are provided a cash exit opportunity to partially monetise their holdings.\n\nThe  Group  completed  the  buyback  of  the maximum  allowable  amount  of  Preference Shares in December 2023. With the cancellation of the purchased Preference Shares, the Group was able to reduce the finance cost pertaining to the coupon payment obligation for these shares.\n\nIn  line  with  our  focus  on  transforming  our business through new platforms, the Group will continue to pursue our fund management",

Members of the ExCo also identified as the Company's Key Management Personnel (\"KMP\")  comprises  Mr  Sherman  Kwek,  the  Group  CEO (also a Director), Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, the Group General Manager (\"Group GM\"), Mr Kwek Eik Sheng, the Group Chief Operating O/fficer (\"Group COO\") and Ms Yiong Yim Ming, the Group Chief Financial O/fficer (\"Group CFO\").\n\nThe Board sets broad policies, provides guidance on and approves  strategic  objectives,  ensures  that  necessary financial, operational and human resources are in place for  the  Company  to  meet  its  objectives,  reviews  the performance of the Group and the ExCo, and satisfies itself as to the adequacy and e/ffectiveness of the framework and processes for internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology ('IT') controls) and risk management for the safeguarding of shareholders' interests and the Group's assets.\n\nThe Board also assumes responsibility for good corporate governance and is responsible for setting the right 'tone at the top' in its policies and decisions to ensure that the Company's  corporate  values  and  ethical  standards  are observed and there is proper accountability throughout the Group and obligations to its shareholders and other stakeholders are clearly understood and met.\n\nThe Board is also committed to the Company's strategic approach to integrating sustainability in key aspects of its business and operations and to advance the Company's sustainability e/fforts and achievements.\n\n## Directors' Objective Discharge of Duties and Declaration of Interests (Provision 1.1)\n\nAll Directors are fiduciaries who exercise due diligence and objectively discharge their duties and responsibilities in the best interests of the Company. This ability to exercise objectivity is one of the assessment criteria in the NC annual evaluation of the Directors.\n\nDirectors,  who  are  in  any  way,  directly  or  indirectly, interested  in  a  transaction  or  proposed  transaction, declare the nature of their interests in accordance with the Company's Constitution and provisions of the Companies Act 1967, and in the case of any conflicts of interest (actual or potential), recuse themselves from participating in the deliberation and abstain from decision-making on such transactions,  with  abstention  duly  recorded  within  the minutes and/or the resolutions of the Board and/or the Committees.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Accountability of the Board and Management (Provision 1.1)\n\nThe Board and Management are committed to conducting business with integrity, consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has established various  corporate  policies  as  necessary  which  provide a  communicable  and  understandable  framework  for employees to observe the Company's principles on honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in  their  relationships  with  the  Company's  stakeholders, including  customers,  suppliers  and  employees.  Further details of these policies are described in the segment entitled 'Corporate Values and Conduct of Business' at the end of this report.\n\n## Board Orientation and Training/Development (Provision 1.2)\n\nEach newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his/her general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislations and regulations. The new Director will also receive an electronic induction pack containing information and documents relating to the roles, duties and responsibilities of a director (and where applicable, as a member of the Committees), the Group's principal businesses, the Company's Board processes and corporate governance practices, relevant Company policies and procedures as well as a board meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting of the Board and where applicable, the Committees.\n\nThe Company also conducts a comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed Directors, and for existing Directors pursuant to their appointments to any of the Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group's principal businesses, the Company's governance practices  and  processes,  internal  controls  and  risk management systems, their responsibilities as directors and in the case of appointments to any of the Committees, the roles and areas of responsibilities of such Committees. The induction programme includes meetings with the chairmen of the Committees in the case of appointments to any of the Committees, on matters relevant to such Committees, various key executives of Management to allow the new Directors  to  be  acquainted  with  Management  and  to facilitate  their  independent  access  to  Management  in future. The programme also includes briefings by the Group CEO and other members of Management on key areas of the Company's operations.\n\nFor a first-time Director who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company, in addition to the induction as detailed above, he/she will be required to also attend certain specific modules of the Listed Entity Director ('LED') Programme conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors ('SID') to acquire relevant knowledge of what is expected of a listed company director, this being a mandatory requirement under Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ('SGXST') Listing Rules (the 'Mandatory Training'). Completion of the LED Programme, which focuses on comprehensive training of company directors on compliance, regulatory\n\nand corporate governance matters, should provide the firsttime Director with a broad understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company under the requirements of the Companies Act 1967, the Listing Manual and the CG Code. A first-time director need not attend the Mandatory Training if the NC, in assessing the relevant experience of the director, is satisfied that he/she possesses relevant experience comparable to that of a person who has served as a director of an issuer listed on SGX-ST. Where such an assessment is made by the NC, the reasons are disclosed in the announcement made on the appointment of the director.\n\nMr Tan Kian Seng, who has prior experience as a director of listed companies, was appointed as ID on 10 March 2023 and attended the induction programme conducted by the Company in April 2023. Mr Tan also attended the training on sustainability as required by SGX-ST on 12 October 2023.\n\nThe Board recognises that it is important for Directors to undergo continual training/development. From time to time, the Directors are provided with updates and/or briefings by professional advisers, auditors, Management and the Company Secretaries in areas such as directors' duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices, relevant legislations and regulations, risk management and financial reporting standards. They are also regularly kept informed by the Company Secretaries of the availability of relevant courses, conferences and seminars, including those conducted by the SID, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such training at the Company's expense. The NC and the Board are kept informed of the training sessions attended by the Directors during the year. As part of the NC's annual assessment of the skill set of the Board and the Committees, the NC will also recommend further training for the Directors in specific areas, if required, to supplement the regular updates/briefings provided to the Directors from time to time.\n\nDuring the year, training sessions attended by the Directors included the SID Audit and Risk Committee Seminar 2023, SID Directors Conference 2023, SID ARC Pit-Stop Series on  Climate  Risk  Reporting,  SID  Listed  Entity  Director Programme,  SID  Nominating  Committee  Programme, Current  Topics  Programme,  briefings  and  seminars organised by SID, Climate Governance Singapore, audit professionals, legal professionals, and other consultants in  relation  to  the  9  year  rule,  financial,  cybersecurity, sustainability  and  climate  reporting  matters,  Code  of Practice: Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' Duties, SGX Disclosure Obligations and Directors' Duties.\n\nIn-house  seminars  were  also  organised  in  2023  and conducted by invited external speakers on the following topics:\n\n- \u00b7  Sustainability Reporting - Value vs Investment; Challenges vs Opportunities\n- \u00b7  CDL Leadership Workplace Safety & Health Training\n- \u00b7  Navigating the New Frontier: Cybersecurity and Generative AI\n\n100% of the Board attended various training seminars and workshops in 2023\n\nAccounted for more than 206.5 training hours in aggregate\n\n=\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMembers  of  the  ARC  were  also  provided  with  regular briefings  from  the  Company's  external  auditors  on applicable Accounting Standards and tax updates, such as the Base Erosion and Profiting Shifting (BEPS) 2.0 during the year.\n\nFurther to the training courses/programmes and briefing updates,  Directors  are  also  at  liberty  to  approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company's operations.\n\n## Board Approval (Provision 1.3)\n\nKey matters which are specifically reserved for approval by  the  Board  include  the  decisions  over  the  strategic direction, plans and performance objectives of the Group (including its risk appetite); the Group's financial objectives and annual budget; decisions to commence, discontinue or modify significantly any business activity or to enter into or withdraw from a particular market sector which have or may have material impact on the profitability or performance of the Group; corporate or financial restructuring; decisions over  new  borrowings  or  amendments  to  the  terms and conditions of existing borrowings; adoption of key corporate policies and corporate governance practices and any other matters which require the Board's approval as prescribed under the relevant legislations and regulations as well as the provisions of the Company's Constitution. All issuance of the Group's financial results requires the approval of the Board, including decisions with regard to the Company's dividend policy and payouts.\n\nAligned  with  the  Group's  strategy  to  develop  growth platforms in Singapore and key international markets, the Board has put in place an approval matrix with established authority limits in connection with the Group's investments and divestments, including funds and corporate holdings. The approval matrix is revised and updated when necessary, in line with the Group's strategic objectives.\n\nManagement  is  fully  apprised  of  such  matters  which require the approval of the Board or the Committees. For operational e/fficiency, the Company also has a structured approval  limits  matrix  which  sets  out  the  delegated authority  to  various  levels  of  Management  to  approve operating expenditures up to pre-determined limits.\n\n## Delegation by the Board (Provision 1.4)\n\nThe primary functions of the Board are either carried out directly by the Board or delegated to the Committees with clear written terms of reference setting out their\n\ncompositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board. The Committees established by the Board are the ARC, the NC, the RC and the BSC.\n\nEach Committee reports key matters to the Board at Board Meetings and submits its report at least once on an annual basis.\n\nAll terms of reference for the Committees are approved by  the  Board  and  reviewed  annually  to  ensure  their continued relevance, taking into account the changes in the governance and regulatory environment.\n\nThe delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees enables the Board to achieve operational e/fficiency by empowering these Committees to decide, review and make recommendations on matters within their respective written terms of reference and/or limits of delegated authority, without abdicating the Board's overall responsibility.\n\nPlease refer to the sections on Principles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 in this report for further information on the activities of the NC, RC and ARC. Information on the activities of the BSC can be found under the 'Sustainability' segment towards the end of this report.\n\n## Board  and  Board  Committees  Meetings (Provision 1.5)\n\nMeetings of the Board and Committees are held regularly, with the Board meeting held at least four times a year. Four Board meetings were held in 2023. At the regular Board  meetings,  the  Board  agenda  includes  updates by  Management  on  the  Group's  strategic  initiatives and  implementation  status,  updates  on  the  Group's investments and developments, and the review of the Group's financial and operational performance. Of the four scheduled meetings, two were the half-year and full year Board meetings mainly to review and approve the Group's financial results, and two were scheduled to review the Group's quarterly operational performance, as well as review of the Company's strategic directions and initiatives.\n\nTwo meetings of the non-executive Directors ('NEDs'), including  IDs,  duly  chaired  by  the  Lead  Independent Director ('Lead ID'), were held in 2023. Meetings of the NEDs, including IDs are convened as often as may be warranted by circumstances. The IDs also meet regularly under the various Committees and the Lead ID is a member of some of these Committees.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe proposed meetings for the Board and all Committees for each new calendar year are set out in a schedule of meetings, which is notified to all Board members before the start of that calendar year. Additional meetings are convened as and when circumstances warrant. Records of  all  such  meetings,  including  discussions  on  key deliberations and decisions taken, are maintained by the Company Secretaries. The Company's Constitution allows for the meetings of its Board and the Committees to be held  via  teleconferencing  and  videoconferencing.  The Board and the Committees may also make decisions by way of circulating written resolutions.\n\nThe attendance (including via electronic means) of the Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Company ('AGM') and meetings of the Board, the Committees and the NEDs, as well as the frequency of such meetings in 2023,  is  disclosed  in  the  table  below.  Directors  who\n\nwere unable to attend any meetings of the Board or the Committees, were provided with the meeting materials and encouraged to raise discussion points or queries with the Board Chairman or respective Committee chairman or Management. Nonetheless, the Board is of the view that the contribution of each Director should not be focused solely on his/her attendance at meetings of the Board and/ or the Committees. A Director's contribution should also extend beyond the confines of the formal environment of such meetings, through the sharing of views, advice, experience and strategic networks which would further the interests of the Company. The Directors, whether individually or collectively, also engage with Management, heads of the Group's business units and departments and the Group's external consultants in order to better understand the challenges faced by the Group and the input of the Directors, through such engagements, provide invaluable perspective to Management.\n\n## Directors' Attendance (including via electronic means) at the AGM, and Meetings of the Board, the Committees and the NEDs in 2023 (Provision 1.5)\n\n|                                   | Board   | ARC                                 | NC                                  | RC                                  | BSC                                 | NEDs                                | AGM                                 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Number of meetings held in 2023   | 4       | 6                                   | 3                                   | 2                                   | 2                                   | 2                                   |                                     |\n| Name of Directors                 |         | Number of meetings attended in 2023 | Number of meetings attended in 2023 | Number of meetings attended in 2023 | Number of meetings attended in 2023 | Number of meetings attended in 2023 | Number of meetings attended in 2023 |\n| Kwek Leng Beng 1                  | 4/4     | N.A.                                | 3/3                                 | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                |                                     |\n| Sherman Kwek Eik Tse 1            | 4/4     | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 2/2 4                               | 2/2                                 | N.A.                                |                                     |\n| Lee Jee Cheng Philip 1            | 4/4     | 6/6                                 | 3/3                                 | 2/2                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 |                                     |\n| Philip Yeo Liat Kok               | 4/4     | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 1/2 3                               |                                     |\n| Ong Lian Jin Colin 1              | 4/4     | N.A.                                | 3/3                                 | 2/2                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 |                                     |\n| Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets | 4/4     | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | 2/2                                 | 2/2                                 |                                     |\n| Chong Yoon Chou                   | 4/4     | 6/6                                 | 3/3                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | 2/2                                 |                                     |\n| Chan Swee Liang Carolina 1        | 4/4     | 6/6                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 |                                     |\n| Tang Ai Ai Mrs Wong Ai Ai         | 4/4     | N.A.                                | 3/3                                 | N.A.                                | 2/2                                 | 1/2 3                               |                                     |\n| Tan Kian Seng 2                   | 3/3 2   | 4/4 2                               | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | N.A.                                | 0/1 2,3                             |                                     |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 All Directors, including Mr Kwek Leng Beng (the Chairman of the Board), Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip (the chairman of the ARC), Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin (the chairman of the NC), Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina (the chairman of the RC) and Mr Sherman Kwek Eik Tse (the Group CEO/the chairman of the BSC), were in attendance at the AGM in 2023 together with other members of the ExCo and the Company's external auditors. The AGM was held in-person and via electronic means.\n- 2 Mr Tan Kian Seng was appointed as a Director and member of ARC on 10 March 2023.\n- 3 Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok, Ms Tang Ai Ai Mrs Wong Ai Ai and Mr Tan Kian Seng were unable to attend one NED Meeting as they had prior engagement and travel arrangement respectively.\n- 4 Mr Sherman Kwek Eik Tse attended the RC Meetings by invitation.\n\n## Directors' Multiple Board Representations and Time Commitments (Provision 1.5)\n\nWhen considering the re-nomination of Directors for reelection, the NC also takes into account the competing time  commitments  faced  by  Directors  with  multiple listed  company  board  representations  and/or  other principal commitments. An analysis of the directorships (which includes directorships by groups and executive appointments) held by the Directors is reviewed annually by  the  NC.  Each  Director  is  also  required  to  confirm annually to the NC as to whether he/she has any issue with competing time commitments which may impact his/her ability to provide su/fficient time and attention to his/her duties as a Director of the Company. Based on the analysis, the  Directors'  annual  confirmation  and  the  Directors' commitments and contributions to the Company, which are also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Committee and IDs' meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nThe  NC  noted  that  including  the  directorship  held  in the  Company,  the  number  of  listed  company  board representations currently held by each of the Directors ranged  from  one  to  three  in  number  (including  the Company) and those held by Mr Kwek Leng Beng are on the boards of the related companies of the Company. The NC has recommended that the maximum number of listed company board representations which each Director of the Company may hold, be set at six (including the Company), to provide a guide to address potential competing time commitments that Directors may face serving on multiple listed company boards. The NC may review this guideline from time to time and will also consider the circumstances of individual Directors or potential candidates with multiple listed company directorships above the recommended number to determine their capacity to participate and contribute e/ffectively to the Board.\n\nIn addition to the current procedures for the review of the attendance records and analysis of directorships/principal commitments, a policy has also been put in place for Directors to consult the Board Chairman or the chairman of the NC prior to accepting any new listed company board appointment or principal commitment and to notify the Board of any changes in their external appointments. This  would  allow  the  Director  to  review  his/her  time commitments with the proposed new appointment, and in the case of an ID, to also ensure that his/her independence would not be a/ffected.\n\n## Complete, Adequate and Timely Information (Provision 1.6)\n\nPrior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by Management, containing complete,  adequate  and  timely  information  to  enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings. The ExCo is in attendance at such\n\nmeetings, whilst the Company's auditors and professional advisers who can provide additional insight into the matters for discussion are invited as required to attend the relevant meetings. Management also provides all Directors with monthly updates on the Company's financial performance including an analysis of the same, with material variances between the comparative periods disclosed and explained. Where the Board's or a Committee's approval is sought, relevant  background  and  explanatory  information  on the specific matter are provided to enable Directors to understand the issues and request further information, as necessary.\n\nDraft agendas for Board and Committee meetings are circulated  in  advance  to  the  Board  Chairman  and  the Committee  chairman  respectively,  for  them  to  review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and the Committees  are  also  furnished  routine  reports,  where applicable,  from  Management.  The  chairman  of  the ARC, NC, RC and BSC provides a report of the respective Committees' activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of meetings of the Committees are circulated to all Board members.\n\n## Access to Management, Company Secretaries and Independent Professional Advice (Provision 1.7)\n\nAll  Directors  have  direct  and  independent  access  to Management. To facilitate this access, all Directors are provided with the contact details of the ExCo and the Company Secretaries. The contact details of the heads of internal audit and risk management are also provided to the ARC.\n\nThe  Directors,  whether  as  a  group  or  individually,  are entitled to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and where circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek such independent professional advice.\n\nThe  Company  Secretaries,  whose  appointment  and removal are subject to the Board's approval, attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees to provide guidance  for  Board  procedures  to  be  followed.  The Company Secretaries, together with Management, also ensure  that  the  Company  complies  with  applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with Management, the Company Secretaries also advise the Board Chairman, the Board and the Committees on corporate governance matters  and  assist  in  implementing  and  strengthening corporate governance practices and processes, including ensuring good information flow within the Board and the Committees and between the Directors and Management, facilitating the induction for newly appointed Directors and newly appointed Committee members, and assisting in the continuing training and development programme for the Directors. On an ongoing basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance\n\n## Board Independence (Provisions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)\n\nThe Board currently comprises ten members. Based on the NC's recommendation, the Board has determined seven of them, being more than half of the Board, to be independent, thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board, capable of exercising objective judgement on the corporate a/ffairs of the Company. No individual or small group of individuals dominate the Board's decision-making. No alternate Directors have been appointed in respect of any of the Directors.\n\nThe non-independent Directors are the Board Chairman, the Group CEO, both holding executive appointments in the Company, and Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok who is an NED.\n\nWhen reviewing the independence of the IDs, the NC has considered the applicable Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and the guidelines for independence set out in Provision 2.1 of the CG Code and its accompanying Practice Guidance (collectively, the 'Independence Guidance'). As part of the consideration of the IDs' independence, the NC has also taken into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7  other directorships;\n- \u00b7  annual declarations regarding their independence;\n- \u00b7  disclosures of interest in transactions in which they have a direct/indirect interest;\n- \u00b7 their ability to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest especially  by  abstaining  from  deliberation  on  such transactions;\n- \u00b7 their ability to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company; and\n- \u00b7  their ability to objectively raise issues and seek clarification as  and  when  from  the  Board,  Management  and  the Company's external advisors on matters pertaining to their area of responsibilities whether on the Board or on the Committees.\n\nEach of the IDs on the NC recused himself/herself from the NC's deliberations on his/her own independence.\n\nMr Ong Lian Jin Colin, an ID, ceased as a director of Summervale  Properties  Pte.  Ltd.  ('Summervale')  on  23 November 2023. Summervale had previously entered into an  Asset  Management  and  Marketing  Agreement  with Trentwell  Management  Pte  Ltd  ('Trentwell'),  a  whollyowned subsidiary of the Company, for Trentwell to manage and market Summervale's residential units at Nouvel 18. Mr Ong was not involved in the daily operations of and did not hold any executive position in Summervale or its holding company, Green 18 Pte. Ltd., other than being a board member of both companies and a shareholder of Green 18 Pte. Ltd. holding less than 5% shareholding. The Board has concurred with the NC's determination that Mr Ong's independence was not a/ffected by this relationship between Trentwell and Summervale prior to his cessation as a director of Summervale.\n\nNone of the IDs are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years\n\nby the Company or any of its related corporations. They also do not have immediate family members who are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations, and whose remuneration is determined by the RC. For the purpose of determining independence, the IDs have also provided confirmation that they are not related to the Directors or to any shareholders holding 5% interest in the Company. The NC is satisfied that there is no other relationship which could a/ffect their independence. The Directors undertook a review of their independence, with each ID abstaining from participating in his/her own review by the Board and had concurred with the NC's determination of the independence of the IDs.\n\n## Board Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)\n\nSince 30 November 2017, the Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy ('BDP'), as amended on 29 August 2022, which sets out the framework for promoting diversity on the Board. The Company recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the  Company's  achievement  of  its  strategic  objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decisionmaking process of the Board through the perspectives derived from the various skills, business experience, industry discipline and other aspects of diversity (such as gender and age) of the Directors.\n\nThe BDP, which is available on the Company's corporate website, provides that the NC shall consider all aspects of diversity when reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board and when making recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors to arrive at an optimal balanced composition of the Board. The BDP also provides for the NC to discuss and recommend annually to the Board measurable targets and timelines for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board.\n\nThe NC has put in place a skills matrix to help identify gaps in the Board and Committees. The skills matrix classifies skills, experience and knowledge of the existing Directors into the broad categories such as industry knowledge, namely  real  estate  and  hospitality-related  businesses and management and fund management; management expertise for example strategic planning, leadership and customer-based experience; professional expertise or skills in specific areas for example, audit/finance, risk, digital/ information technology, sustainability and legal.\n\nWhen reviewing and assessing the size and composition of the Board and Committees and making recommendations to  the  Board  annually  including  the  appointment/reappointment of Directors, the NC will consider all aspects of diversity based on targets and timelines set for promoting and achieving diversity on the Board to arrive at an optimal balanced composition of the Board.

To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Company's businesses  and  performance  through  monthly  reports from  Management  and  have  unrestricted  access  to Management.  They  also  sit  on  various  Committees established  by  the  Board  to  provide  unbiased  and independent views, constructive input and the independent review and monitoring the performance of the Company and Management. Two meetings of the NEDs, chaired by the Lead ID, were held in 2023 without the presence of  Management.  The  NEDs  would  also  confer  among themselves without the presence of Management as and when the need arises. The Lead ID collates the views and feedback from the NEDs and communicates the same to the Board and/or the Board Chairman as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer Roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Group CEO\n\n## (Provisions 3.1 and 3.2)\n\nThe roles of Chairman of the Board and the Group CEO are separate to ensure a clear division of responsibilities and increased accountability.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, is also the Executive Chairman. Mr Kwek Leng Beng plays an instrumental role in providing the Company with strong leadership and vision, leading the Board in its review of the\n\n## Directors' Age Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' Skills Matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup's strategies for sustainable growth. As the Board Chairman with written terms of reference approved by the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng also promotes and leads the Group in its commitment to achieve and maintain high standards  of  corporate  governance.  He  bears  primary responsibility for the workings of the Board, by ensuring e/ffectiveness in all aspects of its role including setting the agenda for Board meetings with input from Management, ensuring  su/fficient  allocation  of  time  for  thorough discussion  of  key  agenda  items  at  Board  meetings, promoting an open environment within the Boardroom for constructive debate, encouraging the NEDs to speak freely and contribute e/ffectively, and exercising control over the quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management. At AGMs and other shareholders' meetings, he plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and Management.\n\nAs Executive Chairman, he is the most senior executive in the Company and bears overall executive responsibility for the Group's business. Mr Kwek Leng Beng is assisted by the Group CEO, Mr Sherman Kwek. The Group CEO leads the members of the ExCo and is responsible for implementing and reviewing the business direction and strategies for the Group as endorsed by the Board, and for operational performance and organisational excellence. He is the elder son of the Board Chairman.\n\nThe Board has considered Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Chairman and the strengths he brings to such a role by virtue of his stature and experience. Through\n\nthe appointment of the Lead ID (see more information below) and the establishment of various Committees with power and authority to perform key functions without the undue influence from the Board Chairman, and the putting in  place  of  internal  controls  for  proper  accountability and to allow for e/ffective oversight by the Board of the Company's business, the Board ensures that there is an appropriate balance of power which allows the Board to exercise objective decision-making in the best interests of the Company. The Board is of the view that Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Chairman would continue to facilitate the Group's decision-making and implementation process without diminishing the capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.\n\n## Lead Independent Director (Provision 3.3)\n\nCognisant that the Board Chairman is an Executive Director and thus not independent, the Board has designated a Lead ID who serves as a sounding board for the Board Chairman and as an intermediary between the NEDs/IDs and the Board Chairman. The current Lead ID is Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip.\n\nThe role of the Lead ID is set out in the written terms of reference for the Lead ID, which has been approved by the Board. The Lead ID is available to shareholders should they  have  concerns  which  cannot  be  resolved  or  are inappropriate to raise through the normal communication channels  of  the  Board  Chairman  or  Management.  No query or request on any matter which requires the Lead ID's attention was received from shareholders in 2023. Under the chairmanship of the Lead ID, two meetings of the NEDs were convened in 2023 without the presence of Management or the Board Chairman, and the views expressed by the NEDs at the meeting were communicated by the Lead ID to the Board Chairman and Management, as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 4: Board Membership\n\n## NC Composition and Role (Provisions 4.1 and 4.2)\n\nFour out of the five members of the NC, including the NC chairman, are IDs. The Lead ID is one of the independent members of the NC.\n\nThe key responsibilities of the NC as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  to examine Board size;\n- \u00b7 to review all Board and Committee composition and membership;\n- \u00b7 review the board diversity policy and recommend to the  Board  annually,  objectives  for  diversity  (whether qualitative  and  quantitative)  and  review  the  progress made  towards  achieving  the  Board's  objectives  for diversity;\n- \u00b7  to  review  board  succession  plans  for  the  Directors (including the Board Chairman and the Group CEO), and the KMP (who are not directors);\n- \u00b7  to determine each Director's independence annually and as and when circumstances require;\n- \u00b7 to evaluate the performance of the Board, the Board Chairman,  Committees  and  the  individual  Directors (including the Group CEO);\n- \u00b7  to review appointment and re-appointment of Directors (including  the  Board  Chairman  and  the  Group  CEO, and alternate directors, if any) and the reasons for their resignations;\n- \u00b7  to review appointments and the reasons for resignations and terminations of the KMP who are not Directors;\n- \u00b7 to review and confirm the induction programmes for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors in respect of their appointments to any of the Committees; and\n- \u00b7  to  review  the  training  and  continuous  professional development programme for the Directors.\n\nThree NC meetings were held in 2023. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all NC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the NC conducted a self-assessment of its own e/ffectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('NC Self-Assessment Checklist'). The NC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the NC under its terms of reference and also considered the contributions of NC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at NC meetings.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the NC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Nomination of Directors and Determination of Independence (Provisions 4.3 and 4.4)\n\nThe NC reviews the nomination of the relevant Directors for election/re-election as well as the independence of Directors  annually.  When  considering  the  nomination of Directors for election/re-election, the NC takes into account  their  contribution  to  the  e/ffectiveness  of  the Board  (which  includes  their  participation  and  candour at Board and Committee meetings) as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations and/or other principal commitments, and also reviews their independence with regard to the provisions  in  the  applicable  Listing  Rule  210(5)(d)  and Provision 2.1 of the CG Code. The recommendation of the NC on the annual nomination of the Directors for election/re-election is submitted to the Board for decision and thereafter tabled at the AGM of the Company for consideration and approval by shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Constitution of the Company provides that not less than one-third of the Directors for the time being shall retire as Directors at each AGM. All new Directors appointed by the Board shall hold o/ffice until the next AGM and are eligible for election at the said AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Company, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, Mr Sherman Kwek Eik Tse, Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip and Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina are due to retire by rotation at the 61st Annual General Meeting ('2024 AGM'), and being eligible, have o/ffered themselves for re-election at the 2024 AGM. The NC has considered their contribution and performance and recommended to the Board to nominate their re-election at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors (Provision 4.3)\n\nThe  NC  also  reviews  all  nominations  and  interviews candidates before formally considering and recommending them for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to  the  Committees.  Searches  for  potential  candidates generally take into account recommendations from the Directors and various other sources. Where necessary, the NC may consider the use of external search consultants to find appropriate candidates. Shortlisted candidates would be required to furnish their curriculum vitae containing information on their academic/professional qualification, work experience, employment history and experience (if any) as directors of listed companies.\n\nIn reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director  appointments,  including  appointments  to  the appropriate Committees, the NC considers the following as well as factors prescribed under the Company's BDP, details of which as set out under the sub-header 'Board Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)':\n\n- (a)  the candidate's track record, experience and capabilities or such other factors including age and gender, as may be determined by the NC to be relevant and which would contribute to the Board's collective skill set;\n- (b)  any competing time commitments if the candidate has multiple listed company board representations and/or other principal commitments;\n- (c)  the  candidate's  independence,  in  the  case  of  the appointment of an ID; and\n- (d)  the  composition  requirements  for  the  Board  and Committees after matching the candidate's skill set to the requirement of the relevant Committees (if the candidate is proposed to be appointed to any of the Committees).\n\n## Key Information on Directors (Provision 4.5)\n\nPlease refer to the 'Board of Directors' section in the AR for key information on the Directors, including the dates of their first appointment and last election/re-election to the Board (if applicable), their academic/professional qualifications, major appointments/principal commitments, directorships held in listed companies for both the current and in the\n\npreceding  five  years,  and  other  relevant  information; 'Additional Information on Directors seeking re-election'; and the 'Notice of Annual General Meeting' for information on Directors proposed for re-election at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Succession Planning for the Board, the Board Chairman, the Group CEO and the KMP (Provision 4.1)\n\nThe Board believes in carrying out succession planning for itself, the Board Chairman and the KMP (including the Group CEO) to ensure continuity of leadership. It has in place a formal Board and KMP succession plan which is reviewed annually. Board renewal is a continuous process and in this regard, the NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees, which includes size and mix, and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identify any gaps in the Board skill set taking into account the Group's strategy and business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding  any  resignation  or  retirement  of  any Director given the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.\n\nTo further strengthen the Board skill set in the areas of hospitality and finance, Mr Tan Kian Seng was appointed as an additional ID in March 2023.\n\n## Board Development (Provision 4.5)\n\nThe  NC  reviews  the  training  and  development  of  the Directors  to  ensure  that  Directors  receive  appropriate development on a continuing basis, to perform their roles on the Board and where applicable, the Committees. The Directors are provided with updates and/or briefings to assist them to properly discharge their duties. The briefings are  conducted  either  internally  with  invited  speakers, or  externally,  at  the  Company's  expense.  A  separate programme is established for new Directors, details of which together with details of the internal briefing and updates provided to the Directors in 2023 are set out in the paragraph under the subject heading 'Board Orientation and Training' in this report.\n\nThe Board is kept apprised twice yearly on the list of training programmes attended by the Directors during the year.\n\n## Principle 5: Board Performance\n\n## Board Evaluation Process (Provision 5.1)\n\nThe Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the e/ffectiveness of the Board as a whole, the various Committees  and  the  contribution  by  each  Director (including the Group CEO) and the Board Chairman to the e/ffectiveness of the Board and where applicable, of the Committees. No external facilitator has been used. The NC assesses the Board's performance as a whole annually, using objective and appropriate criteria which were  recommended  by  the  NC  and  approved  by  the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the feedback from individual\n\nDirectors on areas relating to the Board's role on strategy and performance, the Board's process and governance (including oversight  of  internal  controls  and  risk management), the Board's competencies and e/ffectiveness and the e/ffectiveness of the Board Chairman. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC, including its recommendation for improvements, if any, are presented to the Board.\n\nThe NC also undertook an evaluation of the performance of the Committees with the assistance of self-assessment checklists completed by these Committees.\n\nThe annual performance evaluation of the Board Chairman and of the respective Director's performance comprises two parts: (a) review of background information concerning the Director including his attendance records at Board, Committee and NEDs' (where applicable) meetings; and (b) NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters, which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board.\n\nWhen  deliberating  on  the  performance  of  a  particular Director who is also a member of the NC, that member abstains  from  the  discussions  to  avoid  any  conflict  of interest.\n\nThe results of the individual evaluation of the Directors are  also  used  by  the  NC,  in  its  consultation  with  the Board Chairman (who is also a member of the NC), to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the re-election of retiring Directors. The Board Chairman, as a member of the NC, is fully apprised of the results of the performance evaluation for the individual Directors and would take into consideration such evaluation and act as appropriate on the recommendations of the NC. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.\n\n## Board Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nThe qualitative criteria used by the NC to evaluate the Board covers five key areas relating to Board structure, the Board's review of the Company's strategy and performance, Board's oversight on the Company's governance, including risk management and internal controls, and the e/ffectiveness of the Board Chairman and Board processes.\n\nThe  quantitative  criteria  used  to  evaluate  the  overall Board  performance  comprises  performance  indicators which include a comparison of the Group's performance (including  segmental  performance)  for  the  financial period under review against the Group's performance for the corresponding period in previous years, and other indicators such as the Company's share price performance over a historical period.\n\n## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nFactors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance  include  their  abilities  and  competencies, their objectivity and the level of participation at Board and  Committee  meetings  including  their  knowledge and contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Group. The performance evaluation of each Director is taken into account in the NC's consideration with regard to his/her election/re-election as Director.\n\n## REMUNERATION MATTERS\n\n## Principle 6: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies\n\n## RC Composition and Role (Provisions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4)\n\nThe RC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the RC, are independent.\n\nThe key responsibilities of the RC, as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are to review and  recommend  for  endorsement  by  the  Board,  a framework of remuneration for the Directors, including the specific remuneration packages of the Executive Chairman and the ExCo members. Further, in consultation with the NC and Management, the RC also considers the talent management framework so as to align with its review of the overall remuneration framework.\n\nThe Company has in place a remuneration framework (which covers all aspects of remuneration) for the NEDs, Executive Chairman and the ExCo members. On an annual basis, the RC reviews and recommends the fees payable to the Directors for the Board's consideration before approval is sought from the shareholders at the AGM. The RC also reviews and recommends annually specific remuneration packages  for  the  Executive  Chairman  and  the  ExCo members, including the annual increments, short-term and long-term incentives, for approval by the Board. The RC also considers the termination terms in the contracts of employment of the ExCo members to ensure that they are not unfair or unreasonable.\n\nIn 2023,  Willis  Towers  Watson  and  Aon,  external remuneration consultants, provided total compensation benchmark  data  on  the  remuneration  for  the  ExCo members in Singapore based on regional listed real estate companies of comparable size to the Company as well as the benchmark data for Singapore listed companies across all industries to help the RC in its consideration and proposal of the appropriate level of remuneration for the ExCo members to attract, retain and motivate for sustained performance and value creation. The Company has  no  relationship  with  the  appointed  remuneration consultants other than their engagement in providing such benchmark data, which could a/ffect the said consultants' independence.",

The  RC  held  two meetings in 2023.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the RC conducted a self-assessment of its own e/ffectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('RC Self-Assessment Checklist'). The RC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the RC under its terms of reference and also considered the contribution of RC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at RC meetings.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the RC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Principle 7: Level and Mix of Remuneration of Directors and KMP (Provisions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3)\n\nThe  Company's  remuneration  policy  for  Directors comprises the following distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7  to ensure that the procedure for determining remuneration for Directors is formal and transparent;\n- \u00b7  to  ensure  that  the  level  of  remuneration  is  su/fficient (without being excessive) to attract and retain Directors to exercise oversight responsibility over the Company; and\n- \u00b7  to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding on his/ her own remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration packages for the Executive Chairman and the ExCo members comprise the following components:\n\n| Total Remuneration     | Total Remuneration                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed Compensation:    | Fixed Compensation:                                                         | Fixed Compensation:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                        | (i)   Base salary                                                           | This is benchmarked to market to ensure that the remuneration commensurate with  the position and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman and the ExCo members.                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                        | (ii)  Annual Wage Supplement  (AWS), fixed allowances and  benefits-in-kind | This is aligned with market practices and legislative requirements, and not linked  directly to performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                        |                                                                             | Fixed allowances and benefits-in-kind are also linked to the position and  responsibilities of the Executive Chairman and the ExCo members.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Variable Compensation: |                                                                             | Variable compensation is linked to performance and comprises Short and Long- Term Incentives.

Further details on the LTI are provided in the following paragraph.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\nIn reviewing the remuneration packages of the Executive Chairman  and  the  ExCo  members,  the  RC,  with  the assistance of external remuneration consultants, considers the  level  of  remuneration  based  on  the  Company's remuneration policy which comprises the following distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7  to  reward  employees  for  achieving  corporate  and individual performance targets in a fair and equitable way; and\n- \u00b7  to  ensure  that  the  remuneration  reflects  employees' duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe Company advocates a performance-based remuneration system that is flexible and responsive to the market, and the performance of the Group's business units and individual employees. In designing the compensation structure, the Company seeks to ensure that the level and  mix  of  remuneration  is  competitive,  relevant  and appropriate in finding a balance between the current and long-term objectives of the Company.\n\nThe LTI in the form of cash awards, has a three-year performance period, and aligns Management with longterm shareholder value creation. LTI payments are not guaranteed and are subject to Management achieving the performance conditions based on Board-approved targets and strategy. LTI payment will be made at the end of the three-year assessment period if performance conditions are met. Being a cash-based award, the LTI is not dilutive to current shareholders. Claw-back provisions are included within the LTI which would give the right to the Company to reclaim incentive components from the ExCo members in  exceptional  circumstances  such  as  misstatement  of financial results or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Group.\n\nThe  total  remuneration,  including  AWS,  STI  and  LTI, is  benchmarked  to  the  market,  to  ensure  that  it  is commensurate with the position and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman and the ExCo members. The RC also reviews and approves the Company's balanced scorecard which includes the performance targets set out in the GET (Growth, Enhancement and Transformation) strategy to be achieved by the Company based on its short and longterm  objectives,  and  includes  non-financial  measures on environmental, social and governance issues which are similarly cascaded down to the employees of various business units.\n\nThe  overall  level  of  remuneration  of  the  Executive Chairman and the ExCo members is not considered to be at a level which is likely to promote behaviour contrary to the Group's risk profile. The RC and the Board believe that the executive compensation framework is aligned with the short-term and long-term interests of the shareholders and stakeholders, and that it promotes the long-term success of the Company.\n\nWhen reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, which comprise the base director fee and additional fees for services rendered on Committees and fee for the Lead ID, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and responsibilities on the Board and Committees and the changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compares the Company's fee structure against industry practices annually. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review include the frequency of Board and Committee meetings and the interval since the last fee revision. The RC is mindful that the remuneration for IDs should not be excessive so as to compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise their independence. No Director is involved in deciding his/ her own remuneration.\n\nEach  of  the  Directors  receives  a  base  Director's  fee. The Lead ID also receives an additional fee to reflect his expanded responsibility. Directors who serve on the various Committees also receive additional fees in respect of each Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Committees receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairmen of the respective Committees. Attendance fee\n\nis payable for attendance in person or via teleconference or video conference at each meeting of the Board or Committee in consultation with the RC and the respective Committee chairman.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, shareholders had approved the payment of up to $2,000,000 as Directors' fees and meeting attendance fees  for  FY  2023.  The  aggregate  amount  paid  quarterly in  arrears  for  FY  2023  was  $1,709,723.  Approval  of  the shareholders will be sought at the 2024 AGM for an aggregate sum of up to $2,000,000 as Directors' fees and meeting attendance fees for FY 2024, for payment on a quarterly basis in arrears. The quantum of the proposed Directors' fees for FY 2024 is calculated based on the number of expected Board and Committee meetings and the number of Directors expected to hold o/ffice during the year.\n\nThe Company currently does not discourage Directors from holding shares in the Company but notes that there is no requirement under the Company's Constitution for Directors to hold shares in order to be qualified to act as a Director.\n\n## Directors' fee structure for FY 2023 and the proposed structure for FY 2024\n\n| Appointment                     | FY 2023 Per Annum   | FY 2024 (Proposed)   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Board of Directors              | $75,000             | $75,000              |\n| - Base fee                      |                     |                      |\n| Audit & Risk Committee          |                     |                      |\n| - ARC Chairman's fee            | $105,000            | $105,000             |\n| - ARC Member's fee              | $80,000             | $80,000              |\n| Nominating Committee            |                     |                      |\n| - NC Chairman's fee             | $30,000             | $30,000              |\n| - NC Member's fee               | $18,000             | $18,000              |\n| Remuneration Committee          |                     |                      |\n| - RC Chairman's fee             | $30,000             | $30,000              |\n| - RC Member's fee               | $18,000             | $18,000              |\n| Board Sustainability Committee  |                     |                      |\n| - BSC Chairman's fee            | $17,000             | $17,000              |\n| - BSC Member's fee              | $10,000             | $10,000              |\n| Lead Independent Director's fee | $15,000             | $15,000              |\n| Attendance fee                  | Per meeting         | Per meeting          |\n|                                 | $4,000*             | $4,000*              |\n\n- *   Payable in consultation with the RC and the respective Committee chairmen.\n\n## Principle 8: Disclosure of Remuneration\n\n## Disclosure of Remuneration (Provisions 8.1(a) and 8.3)\n\nThe  compensation  packages  for  employees  including the Executive Chairman and the ExCo members, based on the Company's Remuneration Framework, also take into  account  amongst  other  factors,  the  individual's performance, the performance of the Group and industry practices.\n\nDuring the year, there were no termination, retirement or post-employment benefits (other than CPF contributions) granted to any Director or any ExCo member.",

The final quantum of the LTI to be vested is contingent on the achievement of the pre-determined targets over a three-year performance period, starting from 2022, which will range from 0% to 200% of the award.\n\nThe  Board,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  RC,  has considered Provision 8.1 of the CG Code in the context of the Group and after careful consideration, believes that the disclosures provided above are su/fficiently transparent in giving an understanding of the remuneration of the KMP (who are not Directors or the Group CEO), the procedure for determining remuneration and the linkages between remuneration, performance and value creation.\n\n## Remuneration of Directors' Immediate Family Members for FY 2023 (Provision 8.2)\n\nThere are no other employees of the Company who are substantial shareholders of the Company or immediate family members of a Director or of the Group CEO, and whose remuneration exceeded $100,000 during the year.\n\n## Share Option Schemes (Provision 8.3)\n\nWhilst the Company currently does not have a share option scheme or an LTI in the form of a share awards plan, it is open to establishing such a scheme or plan to further promote alignment towards long-term objectives.\n\n## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT\n\n## Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls\n\nThe Company maintains an adequate and e/ffective system of  internal  controls  (including  financial,  operational, compliance and IT controls) and risk management systems to safeguard stakeholders' interests and the Group's assets. The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk, including determining the risk strategy, risk appetite and risk limits, as well as the risk policies.\n\n## Oversight of Risk Management (Provision 9.1)\n\nThe ARC assists the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibility of overseeing the Group's Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") framework and policies for the Group and ensuring that Management maintains a sound system of internal controls and risk management.\n\nThe  Management  Risk  Committee  (\"MRC\")  comprising Senior Management and relevant key executives, meets with the ExCo to discuss material risks and the adequacy and e/ffectiveness of mitigations on a regular, at least quarterly basis. The meeting is facilitated by the ERM function.\n\nThe ARC receives regular reports on the risk management activities  of  the  Company  and  updates  on  the  ERM framework. Key risks including Tier 1 risks are reviewed regularly or at least quarterly and refreshed to ensure that relevant emerging risks are being considered and included for proper assessment, monitoring and reporting as appropriate. Based on the reports of the MRC, the ARC is satisfied that significant  risks  identified  are  assessed,  managed  and monitored adequately within the Group's ERM Framework. The ERM Framework includes a periodic review of the risk appetite statements and risk appetite and tolerance limits for these key risks, which statements and limits are considered and endorsed by the ARC and the Board.\n\nHaving regard to the risks which the Group is exposed, the likelihood of such risks occurring and the risk tolerance accepted  by  the  Group,  a  system  of  internal  controls has been designed and put in place by Management to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, and transactions are authorised and properly recorded to enable the preparation of true and fair financial statements and maintain accountability of assets.\n\nThe  internal  and  external  auditors,  pursuant  to  their respective terms of reference and appointment, report to the ARC any audit findings relating to internal controls, and the ARC reviews the adequacy of the actions taken by Management to address the recommendations of the internal and external auditors.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe  ARC  also  receives  regular  reports,  briefings  and updates  from  the  RMC,  the  Chief  Technology  O/fficer, the internal and external auditors and Management team during its meetings to help the ARC review the adequacy and e/ffectiveness of the Group's material internal controls that address the Group's financial, operational, compliance and IT controls.\n\n## Assurances from the KMP (Provision 9.2)\n\nIn relation to Provision 9.2 of the CG Code and Listing Rule 1207(10), the ARC received:\n\n- (i) written assurance from the Group CEO and the Group CFO  that  the  Group's  financial  records  have  been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances; and\n- (ii)  written assurance from the KMP that the Group's risk management  and  internal  control  systems  in  place were adequate and e/ffective to address the principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations for FY 2023.\n\nThe  above  written  assurances  on  the  Group's  internal controls and risk management systems are provided halfyearly and are supported by similar written assurances provided  by  the  heads  of  the  Group's  key  operating divisions/functions and key operating subsidiaries.\n\nThe process of reviewing and strengthening the Group's control environment is an evolving process. When controls should be enhanced, the Board and Management take actions to rectify and strengthen the internal controls and risk management systems. The Board and Management will continue to devote resources and expertise towards improving the internal policies and procedures to maintain a high level of governance and internal controls. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against poor judgement in decision-making, human errors, losses, frauds and other irregularities.\n\nBased on the work performed by internal auditors, the external auditors and the periodic reports from the RMC and Management, as well as the written assurances from the KMP to support the opinion to be given by the ARC and the Board, the Board with the concurrence of the ARC, is of the opinion that the internal controls and risk management systems in place as at 31 December 2023 are adequate and e/ffective to address principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations.\n\nFurther details on the Group's Risk Management can be found on pages 64 to 72 of this annual report.\n\n## Principle 10: Audit & Risk Committee\n\n## Composition of the ARC (Provisions 10.2 and 10.3)\n\nThe ARC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the ARC are independent. The chairman of the ARC, Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, possesses the relevant audit, accounting and related financial management and risk management expertise and experience. Mr Tan Kian Seng has accounting, financial and business management experience  whilst  the  other  members  of  the  ARC,  Mr Chong Yoon Chou and Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina each has financial and risk management experience as well as experience in investment banking and the financial markets respectively.\n\nWith the current composition, the ARC is of the opinion that it has the relevant accounting and related financial management expertise and experience to discharge its functions within its written terms of reference which have been approved by the Board.\n\nBased on the terms of reference of the ARC, a former partner or director of the Company's existing auditing firm or auditing corporation should not act as a member of the ARC: (a) within a period of two years commencing on the date of his/her ceasing to be a partner of the auditing firm or director of the auditing corporation; and in any case, (b) for as long as he/she has any financial interest in the auditing firm or auditing corporation. Mr Lee ceased as a partner of KPMG LLP ('KPMG'), the Company's existing auditors, in September 2018 and does not have any financial interest in KPMG. The other ARC members do not have any relationship with KPMG.\n\n## Powers and Duties of the ARC (Provision 10.1)\n\nThe ARC is authorised by the Board to review or investigate any  matters  it  deems  appropriate  within  its  terms  of reference and has direct and unrestricted access to the external and internal auditors. It may invite any Director, Management, o/fficer or employee of the Company to attend its meetings. It is also authorised to engage any firm of accountants, lawyers or other professionals as it sees fit to provide independent counsel and advice to assist in the review or investigation on such matters within its terms of reference as it deems appropriate at the Company's expense.\n\nThe principal responsibility of the ARC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the adequacy  and  e/ffectiveness  of  the  Group's  financial reporting  process  (including  reviewing  the  accounting policies and practices of the Company and the Group on a consolidated basis) and key internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance, IT and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include:\n\n- \u00b7 to review with Management and, where appropriate, with the external auditors the significant financial reporting issues and judgements to ensure the integrity of the halfyear and full year financial statements of the Group to be issued by the Company before their submission to the Board and any other announcements relating to the Group's financial performance;\n- \u00b7 to review the scope annually and results of the external audit  and  the  independence  and  objectivity  of  the external auditors, and in this regard to also review the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group;\n- \u00b7 to  make  recommendations  to  the  Board  on  the nomination  for  the  appointment,  re-appointment and removal of external auditors, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;\n- \u00b7 to assess the role and e/ffectiveness of the internal audit ('IA') function in the overall context of the Group's internal controls and risk management systems, and to consider the results of their review and evaluation of the\n\nGroup's internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance  and  IT  controls,  and  risk  management policies and systems;\n\n- \u00b7 to approve the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the Head of IA;\n- \u00b7  to review interested person transactions falling within the scope of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual; and\n- \u00b7 to  oversee  the  establishment  and  operation  of  the Company's whistle-blowing policy and arrangements put  in  place  for  raising  concerns  about  possible improprieties on matters of financial reporting or any other matters.\n\nIn the review of the financial statements for the year ended 31  December  2023,  the  ARC  has  discussed  with  both Management and the external auditors, the accounting principles that were applied and their judgement of items that might a/ffect the integrity of the financial statements. The following significant matters impacting the financial statements  were  discussed  with  Management  and  the external auditors:\n\n## Significant Matters How the ARC reviewed these matters and what decisions were made\n\n| Valuation of  Development  Properties                                    | The ARC considered the approach and methodology applied in assessing the net realisable values of  development properties especially those with low margins. Where appropriate, the ARC had inquired  of Management on its basis and its strategy to sell the unsold units.                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                          | The ARC reviewed either Management's or the valuers' underlying assumptions on estimated future  selling prices by comparing them to recently transacted prices of comparable properties located  in the vicinity of the Group's development projects. The ARC also noted the historical accuracy of  Management's estimate of future selling prices in assessing the reasonableness of the estimated  future selling prices. |\n|                                                                          | The ARC was satisfied with the approach and assessment adopted by Management in arriving at the  net realisable values of the development properties as at 31 December 2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                                          | The valuation of the development properties was also an area of focus for the external auditors. The  external auditors have included this item as a key audit matter in their audit report for the financial  year ended 31 December 2023.

The ARC reviewed Management's approach and methodology in respect of the valuations of the hotel                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|                                                                          | The ARC was satisfied with the valuation process and the valuers are members of recognised professional  bodies for valuers and have considered their independence in carrying out their work. The valuation  methodologies used are in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions  used are generally comparable to currently observable market data.                                             |\n|                                                                          | The valuation of the hotel assets was also an area of focus for the external auditors.

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Internal Audit (Provisions 10.4 and 10.5)\n\nThe Internal Audit ('IA') function is independent of the activities it audits. The Head of IA's primary reporting line is to the ARC. The appointment, resignation and dismissal of the Head of IA is reviewed and/or approved by the ARC. The ARC also provides input on the annual performance appraisal of the Head of IA and reviews his compensation within the compensation policies of the Company. The ARC meets the Head of IA at least once annually without the presence of Management. The Head of IA has unfettered access to the ARC, the Board and Management as well as the Group's documents, records, properties and personnel relevant for the performance of audits.\n\nIA operates within the framework stated in its IA Charter which is approved and reviewed by the ARC on an annual basis. The standards of the IA Charter are consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (the Standards) set by the Institute of  Internal  Auditors  (IIA),  an  international  professional association with global headquarters in the United States of America.\n\nThe Head of IA, Mr Benson Seah, is a Certified Internal Auditor  and  a  member  of  various  professional  bodies, with over 20 years of experience. He has been with the Company since June 2019. All his team members have the relevant qualifications and experience and are members of The Institute of Internal Auditors of Singapore (IIAS) and/ or members of other relevant professional bodies. The IA function is a corporate member of IIAS, an a/ffiliate of the IIA. Processes are in place to ensure that the professional competence of IA sta/ff is maintained and upgraded through continuing  professional  education  programmes  which comprised technical and non-technical training for the development of the IA sta/ff.\n\n## Role and Activities of IA\n\nThe primary role of IA is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and e/ffectiveness of the internal controls and risk management processes of the Company, reviewing the internal controls of the Company to ensure prompt and accurate recording of transactions and proper safeguarding  of  assets  and  reviewing  the  Company's compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies of the Company.\n\nThe ARC approved the annual IA plan and received regular reports during 2023 on the progress of the audit work under the IA plan. All IA reports are given to the ARC, the ExCo and the Heads of the relevant business divisions, with a summary report of IA results presented at the ARC meetings. IA observations on internal control, operational and control lapses and recommendations to address them were also reviewed and discussed at ARC meetings. The ARC was satisfied that recommendations made were dealt\n\nwith by Management in a timely and appropriate manner, with outstanding exceptions or recommendations being closely monitored and reported back to the ARC.\n\nThe  ARC  reviewed  the  e/ffectiveness  and  adequacy  of the IA function including its resources through a review of the IA activities on a regular basis as well as its annual assessment  of  the  IA  function.  The  assessment  was facilitated through the use of an evaluation framework which covers IA organisation, resources and continuing professional development, audit plans, work scope, quality of reports and recommendations, IA Charter and IA selfassessment. Based on the assessment conducted for the year under review, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and e/ffectiveness of the IA function and that the IA function is  currently  adequately  resourced  and  has  appropriate independent standing within the Group to perform its functions e/ffectively.\n\nThe IA function has a Quality Assurance and Improvement Programme (QAIP) in place to ensure that its audit activities confirm to the IIA Standards. As part of the QAIP, internal Quality Assurance Reviews (QAR) are conducted at least once every three years, and an external QAR is carried out at least once every five years by qualified professionals from an external organisation. In 2023, Ernst & Young (EY) was appointed to conduct the external QAR. Based on EY's assessment, the IA function has been rated to have conformed with the IIA Standards.\n\n## Provision 10.5\n\nThe ARC held six meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all ARC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. The ARC meets with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of Management, at least once annually.\n\nThe ARC members continually keep themselves abreast of changes to accounting standards, risks and other issues which may have a material impact on financial statements.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the ARC conducted a self-assessment of its own e/ffectiveness in the discharge of  its  roles  and  responsibilities,  which  was  facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('ARC SelfAssessment Checklist').\n\nThe ARC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the ARC under its terms of reference and considered the contribution of the ARC members to the ARC's deliberation and decision-making process.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the ARC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## External Auditors (Provisions 10.1(d) and 10.1(e))\n\nCognisant that the external auditors should be free from any business or other relationships with the Group that could  materially  interfere  with  their  ability  to  act  with integrity and objectivity, the ARC undertook a review of the independence of KPMG and gave careful consideration to  the  Group's  relationships  with  them  during  2023. In  determining  the  independence  of  KPMG,  the  ARC reviewed all aspects of the Group's relationships with them including the policies, processes and safeguards adopted by the Group and KPMG to protect and preserve audit independence.\n\nThe  ARC  had  considered  the  guidance  from  the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants and adopted a Non-Assurance Services Pre-approval Policy to safeguard auditor independence. All non-prohibited nonassurance services require the approval of the ARC with the exception of non-prohibited pre-approved services below certain fee thresholds.\n\nThe ARC also considered the nature and volume of the provision of the non-audit services by KPMG in 2023 and the corresponding fees and noted that the fees for nonaudit services had not exceeded 50% of the aggregate amount of all fees paid/payable to KPMG in 2023. Based on the review, the ARC is of the opinion that KPMG is, and is perceived to be, independent for the purpose of the Group's statutory financial statements audit.\n\nDetails of the fees paid and/or payable by the Group in respect of audit and non-audit services for FY 2023 are set out below:\n\n|                                                                                           | $'million   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Audit fees paid to:                                                                       |             |\n| - auditors of the Company and other firms     a/ffiliated with KPMG International Limited | 6.9         |\n| - other auditors                                                                          | 0.3         |\n| Non-audit fees paid to:                                                                   |             |\n| - auditors of the Company and other firms     a/ffiliated with KPMG International Limited | 2.9         |\n| - other auditors                                                                          | 0.5         |\n\nIn reviewing the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment for  the  financial  year  ending  31  December  2024,  the ARC had considered the adequacy of the resources and experience of KPMG and the audit engagement partners assigned to the audit, the size and complexity of the audit engagement for the Group, and the number and experience of the supervisory and professional sta/ff assigned to the Group's audit through a review of the curriculum vitae of the KPMG audit team. The ARC also considered the quality of discussions with the findings raised by KPMG, including the Audit Quality Indicators presented.\n\nKPMG has confirmed that they are registered with ACRA. The Company is thus in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 (read with Rule 716) of the Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its auditors.\n\nBased on the above, the ARC has recommended to the Board the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment as external auditors at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Whistle-blowing Policy (Provision 10.1(f))\n\nCDL has in place a whistle-blowing policy and procedure where employees of the Company can in confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, raise concerns on possible  improprieties  relating  to  accounting,  financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters or other matters without fear of reprisals in any form. The ARC has the responsibility of overseeing this policy to ensure that it is properly administered with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining procedures for the confidential submission of reports and the identity of the whistle-blower concerned will not be disclosed if so requested by the whistle-blower who lodged the report. Investigations of such reports will be handled on a confidential basis to the extent permissible or deemed appropriate under the circumstances and involve persons who need to be involved in order to properly carry out the investigation and will, on a best-e/fforts basis, be carried out in a timely manner.",

The IPT Mandate is subject to annual renewal by the shareholders. Given that such Interested Person Transactions are expected to occur with some degree of frequency and may arise at any time, and to allow the Group to undertake such transactions in an expeditious manner, shareholders' approval will be sought at the 2024 AGM for the renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\nThe  ARC  has  confirmed  that  an  independent  financial adviser's opinion is not required for the renewal of the IPT Mandate as the methods or procedures for determining the transaction prices of the IPTs conducted under the IPT Mandate have remained appropriate since shareholders approved the renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2023 AGM, and the methods or procedures continue to be su/fficient to ensure that these IPTs will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders.\n\nParticulars of interested person transactions required to be disclosed under Rule 907 of the Listing Manual are as follows:\n\n| Name of  Interested  Person ('IP')                                                    | Nature of  Relationship                                                               | Aggregate value of all interested person transactions   conducted in FY2023 under the IPT Mandate pursuant to   Rule 920 (excluding transactions less than $100,000)                                                                                                                                                 | $          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Subsidiaries  and associates  of Hong Leong  Investment  Holdings Pte.

To facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights, the Company ensures  that  all  material  information  relating  to  the Company and its financial performance is disclosed in an accurate and timely manner via SGXNET and uploaded at the Company's corporate website.\n\n## General Meetings (Provisions 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3)\n\nShareholders are informed of general meetings through notice sent to them. All shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy or in the case of a corporate shareholder, through its appointed representative.  At  general  meetings  of  the  Company, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and are encouraged to ask the Directors and Management questions regarding matters a/ffecting the Company.\n\nThe  rules  for  the  appointment  of  proxies,  including information that voting will be conducted by way of poll, are set out in the notice of general meetings. In accordance with the Constitution of the Company, shareholders who are  not  relevant  intermediaries  may  appoint  not  more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings  in  their  absence,  and  shareholders  who  are relevant intermediaries may appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. The proxy forms must be deposited at such place or places specified in  the  notice  or  document  accompanying  the  notice convening the general meetings at least seventy-two hours before the time set for the general meetings.\n\nThe Company provides for separate resolutions at general meetings on each substantial issue, including treating the reelection of each Director as a separate resolution. Detailed information on each item in the AGM agenda is provided in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM in this report.\n\nAll Directors, including the Board Chairman, the Lead ID, the chairmen of the respective Committees, Management, the external auditors and legal advisors (where necessary) are present at general meetings to address queries from the shareholders. At each AGM, the Group CEO and the Group CFO deliver presentations to update shareholders on the Company's operations and financial performance in the preceding year.\n\n## 2023 AGM\n\nThe 2023 AGM was held on 26 April 2023 in a hybrid mode, with attendance of shareholders at the Orchard Hotel, Singapore and using virtual meeting technology. Shareholders who participated at the 2023 AGM whether physically or using virtual meeting technology, were able to vote in real-time. They were also able to submit questions in  advance  or  during  the  2023  AGM  and/or  appoint proxy(ies) to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at the 2023 AGM. All substantial and relevant questions submitted by shareholders prior to the 2023 AGM, as well as those received live, whether physically or using virtual meeting technology, were addressed by the Company. Responses to questions from shareholders submitted in advance of the 2023 AGM were released by the Company on SGXNet 5 days before the 2023 AGM.\n\nAll the Directors including the Board Chairman and the chairmen of the ARC, NC, RC and BSC, together with the KMP (who are not Directors) as well as the external auditors were in attendance at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Forthcoming 2024 AGM\n\nThe forthcoming 2024 AGM will continue to be held in a hybrid mode with physical attendance of shareholders at M Hotel, Singapore on 24 April 2024 and using virtual meeting technology. Shareholders will be informed of the 2024 AGM through a notification sent by post.\n\nShareholders will receive, via post, the Notice of the 2024 AGM together with a copy each of the detachable proxy form and AR request form for shareholders' use. These documents will also be made available on the Company's corporate website. The Notice of the 2024 AGM and the accompanying proxy form will be published on the SGX website.\n\nFurther, as part of the Company's commitment towards environmental sustainability, printed AR will only be sent to shareholders upon receipt of duly completed AR request forms. Arrangements relating to attendance at the 2024 AGM, either physically or using virtual meeting technology, submission of questions in advance of, or at the 2024 AGM and voting at the 2024 AGM by shareholders or their duly appointed proxy(ies) or representative(s) in the case of corporate shareholder(s), are set out in a separate announcement to be released by the Company on SGXNET.\n\n## Voting at General Meetings (Provision 11.4)\n\nShareholders are given the opportunity to vote at general meetings  either  in  person  or  in  absentia  by  way  of appointed proxy (proxies). However, as the authentication of  shareholder  identity  information  and  other  related integrity issues still remain a concern, the Company has decided, for the time being, not to implement voting in absentia by electronic means.\n\nPursuant  to  Listing  Rule  730A(2),  all  resolutions  to  be proposed at general meetings and at any adjournment thereof shall be put to the vote by way of poll.\n\nElectronic poll voting will be conducted at the 2024 AGM. In support of greater transparency and to allow for a more e/fficient voting system, the Company has been conducting electronic poll voting since the 2012 AGM (except the 2020 AGM and the 2021 AGM in view of the Covid-19 situation).  With  electronic  poll  voting,  shareholders present or represented by proxy (in person or using virtual meeting technology) at the meeting will be entitled to vote on a 'one-share, one-vote' basis. The voting results of all votes cast in respect of each resolution will also be instantaneously displayed on screen at the meeting. The detailed results setting out the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages will be announced via SGXNET after the AGM. An external firm is appointed as scrutineers for the AGM voting process, which is independent of the firm appointed to undertake the electronic poll voting process.\n\n## Minutes of General Meetings (Provision 11.5)\n\nThe  Company  also  maintains  minutes  of  its  general meetings, which include the key comments and queries raised by shareholders and the responses from the Board, Management and/or the external auditors. The minutes of the general meetings are available on the Company's corporate  website  and  the  SGX  website  as  soon  as practicable after the meetings.\n\n## Dividend Policy (Provision 11.6)\n\nThe Company has formalised its dividend policy which aims to provide a return to shareholders at least once a year through the payment of dividends, after taking into account  the  Group's  financial  performance,  short  and long-term capital requirements, future investment plans, general global and business economic conditions and any regulatory factors. The Board endeavours to maintain a balance between meeting shareholders' expectations and prudent capital management with a sustainable dividend policy. The Board will review the dividend policy from time to time and reserves the right to modify, amend and update the policy.\n\nIn line with the Company's dividend policy, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of $0.08 per share. This will bring the total dividends for FY 2023 to $0.12 per share. The dividend payouts in the current and past four years are set out in the 'Five Year Financial Summary' section of this annual report.\n\n## Principle 12: Engagement with Shareholders\n\nThe Company notifies its investors in advance of the date of release of its financial results via SGXNET. In 2023, results for the half-year were released via SGXNET within 45 days of the end of 30 June 2023 whilst the full year results were released within 60 days from the financial\n\nyear end. In presenting the Group's financial results, the Board  aims  to  provide  investors  with  a  balanced  and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and financial position with a commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industries in which it operates.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the Group CEO and the Group CFO provided assurance to the ARC and the Board on the integrity of the half-year unaudited financial statements and the Board in turn provided a negative assurance  confirmation  in  respect  of  the  unaudited financial statements for the half-year in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Company ensures that investors are notified of all material information in an accurate and timely manner. Should there be an inadvertent disclosure made to a select group, the Company will release the same information as  promptly  as  possible  via  SGXNET.  The  financial statements and other presentation materials presented at the Company's general meetings, including material and price-sensitive information, are disseminated and publicly released via SGXNET on a timely basis. All shareholders are notified of general meetings and the documents relating thereto  which  are  made  available  on  the  Company's corporate website and SGX website.\n\nIn 2023, the following documents were made available to shareholders solely by electronic means via publication on the (i) Company's corporate website and (ii) SGXNET:\n\n- \u00b7  Notice of the Company's 2023 AGM;\n- \u00b7  Proxy Form for 2023 AGM;\n- \u00b7  Annual Report 2022; and\n- \u00b7  Letter to Shareholders dated 28 March 2023, in relation to  the  (a)  proposed  renewal  of  the  share  purchase mandate; and (b) proposed renewal of the IPT mandate for interested person transactions.\n\n## Shareholder Communication (Provision 12.1)\n\nShareholders and investors can contact the Company or access information on the Company's corporate website at www.cdl.com.sg which has a dedicated 'Investor Relations' (IR) section that provides, inter alia , information on the Board of Directors, Management team, the Company's Corporate  Governance  Reports,  Sustainability  Reports, Annual Reports, Corporate Policies, Announcements, Press Releases and Financial Results as released by the Company on SGXNET, and other information which may be relevant to investors. In addition, the Company leverages other communication platforms such as its online newsroom (www.cdl.com.sg/newsroom) and social media channels, which includes LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, to provide the latest updates on the Group's business and performance milestones. Investors can subscribe to email alerts on the CDL corporate website or follow its social media channels to receive updates on its latest news.",

To provide investors with a better understanding of the Group's business and growth drivers, regular updates on the Group's strategies, operations and financial performance are provided across multiple platforms.\n\nFurther information on the Company's IR policy and activities can be found on pages 73 to 75 of this annual report.\n\n## Principle 13: Engagement with Stakeholders Sustainability\n\nSince 2014, the Company started conducting materiality assessments annually, which is facilitated by a third party, to  determine  the  key  Economic,  Environmental,  Social and Governance ('EESG') issues that are important to the Company's  stakeholders.  These  issues  are  foundational to the Company's  annual  sustainability  reporting. Corresponding  EESG  targets,  metrics,  initiatives,  and progress are reviewed by the ExCo, Senior Management and Heads of Departments (\"HODs\"), reported to the BSC and the Board for approval, before they are published annually in the Company's Integrated Sustainability Report ('ISR').\n\nLearning from the unprecedented disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company adopted a more dynamic approach to the assessment of key ESG issues from 2020 to 2023, addressing the fast-changing landscape and supply chain issues. The exercise determined the actual and potential impacts of these issues on CDL's long-term value creation, and conversely, CDL's impact on them.\n\nCDL  has  updated  its  materiality  assessment  to  align qualitatively  with  the  ISSB's  IFRS  S1  and  S2,  launched globally in June 2023. Endorsed by MAS, SGX and ACRA, the  ISSB  Standards  requires  companies  to  assess  the ESG issues that are considered material to the company, taking  into  account  both  financial  and  non-financial information, including the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities. To incorporate and understand financial materiality, CDL's ExCo and key executives from CDL's key subsidiaries assessed the potential financial impact of each ESG matter. As part of the study, online surveys were circulated to key stakeholder groups, including the BSC. Through interviews with ExCo, Senior Management and HODs of headquarters and key subsidiaries, regulators, industry and sustainability experts, tenants and suppliers, the Company obtained additional insights into working towards its net zero carbon commitment and strategically addressing risks and opportunities for its businesses, while continuing to deliver long-term value for its internal and external stakeholders. The preliminary material issues were validated by the Company's ExCo, Senior Management and HODs and approved by the BSC thereafter.\n\nWith the ever-evolving business landscape and externalities, the annual assessment of CDL's key material issues is critical to help the Company sharpen its sustainability strategy and focus resources on areas that are deemed most material to its business and future growth using a forward-looking lens.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, CDL publishes an online Sustainability Report on its microsite at www.cdlsustainability.com. Since 2017, this voluntary initiative updates stakeholders of CDL's progress towards key goals and targets set under its Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint, and sets benchmarks for the transparency and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\nThe BSC assists the Board in the review and consideration of the Company's sustainability issues and approach to sustainability reporting, complementing the Company's corporate  business  strategy.  The  BSC  comprises  four Directors, with the Group CEO in the chair and three other IDs. The BSC's terms of reference sets out, inter alia , the objectives, roles and responsibilities of the BSC. It also includes the BSC's purview over matters relating to the Company's ESG strategy, ESG targets, the sustainability reporting  framework  and  also  the  Company's  policies, practices and performance on its material ESG factors which are significant and contribute to the Company's performance, business activities and/or reputation as a global corporate citizen.\n\nThe  annual  ISR  is  dedicated  to  reporting  on  CDL's sustainability  e/fforts  and  performance  that  addresses the social and environmental impacts pertinent to the Company's  stakeholders  and  business.  Over  the  years,\n\nCDL's robust sustainability reporting has evolved into a unique blended model using the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') Standards as its core since 2008. To address the diverse expectations of stakeholders, CDL embraced CDP since 2010, Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark since  2013,  the  Integrated  Reporting  Framework  since 2015, Sustainable Development Goals ('SDG') Reporting since  2016,  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') framework since 2017, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') Standards for Real Estate Sector and the Climate Disclosure Standards Board ('CDSA') Framework since 2020. In September 2023, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (\"TNFD\") released its final recommendations, providing a framework for how organisations can address nature-related risks and opportunities. As biodiversity loss has been highlighted as an existential global threat, CDL has stepped up on its management of nature loss and is one of the pioneering companies in Singapore to report in alignment with the TNFD standards.\n\nCDL  supports  the  formation  of  the  International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in providing a unified sustainability reporting framework that aims to fulfil the needs of investors and various stakeholders for credible, consistent and comparable data. The Company combined the 10 components of its CDL blended reporting framework into two pillars - capturing the 'value' and the 'impact' its business creates. With the launch of the IFRS S1 and S2 in June 2023, CDL has worked with an external consultant on a comprehensive gap analysis to identify the areas for alignment for reporting against S1 and S2. Moving forward, this will allow the Company to work towards full alignment with the IFRS' standards, for eventual compliance.\n\nCDL's ISRs are available on both its corporate website and the dedicated sustainability microsite. To enhance data credibility and instill confidence in readers, external assurance of its report started since 2009. ISR 2022, 2023 and ISR 2024's external audit has been further elevated in its scope against the GRI Standards, SASB Standards, as well as the TCFD and CDSB frameworks.\n\n## Rights of Creditors\n\nThe rights of the CDL Group's creditors, comprising inter alia lending  banks,  contractors,  service  providers  and vendors, are protected with an e/ffective cash and liquidity management system. This includes processes to maintain an adequate level of cash and cash equivalents and available credit facilities, monitor debt maturity and financial metrics including gearing and interest cover ratios. Regular internal reviews are also conducted to ensure that the various capital  management  metrics  and  loan  covenants  are complied with.\n\nFurther  information  on  the  Company's  approach  to stakeholder engagement and its materiality assessment can be found on pages 76 to 92 of this annual report.\n\n## CORPORATE VALUES AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS\n\nThe Board and Management are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has in place an Internal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics crystallising the  Company's  business  principles  and  practices  with respect to matters which may have ethical implications.\n\nThe  code,  which  provides  a  communicable  and understandable  framework  for  employees  to  observe the  Company's  principles  such  as  honesty,  integrity, responsibility  and  accountability  at  all  levels  of  the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in their relationships with customers, suppliers and amongst employees, is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe code provides guidance on issues such as:\n\n- \u00b7 conflicts of interest and the appropriate disclosures to be made;\n- \u00b7 the Company's zero-tolerance stance against corruption and bribery;\n- \u00b7 compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations including  those  relating  to  the  protection  of  the environment and the conservation of energy and natural resources;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the Company's policies and procedures, including those on internal controls and accounting;\n- \u00b7  safeguarding and proper use of the Company's assets, confidential information and intellectual property rights, including the respect of the intellectual property rights of third parties; and\n- \u00b7 competition  and  fair  dealing  in  the  conduct  of  the Company's business, in its relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and towards its employees.\n\nIn line with the Board's commitment to maintain high ethical standards which are integral to its corporate identity and business, the Company has the following three key corporate policies in place:\n\n- (i) Anti-Corruption Policy & Guidelines which sets out the responsibilities of the Group companies and of each employee  in  observing  and  upholding  CDL's  'zerotolerance'  position  against  all  forms  of  corruption, bribery and extortion and provides information and guidance to employees on how to recognise, address, resolve,  avoid  and  prevent  instances  of  corruption, bribery and extortion which may arise in the course of their work.",

CDL  became  the  first  real  estate  conglomerate  in Southeast Asia to sign the World Green Building Council's ('WorldGBC') Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in February 2021. This is a global pledge to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030, covering new and existing wholly-owned assets under CDL's direct management and operational control. In November 2021, during COP26, CDL extended its pledge towards a  net  zero  whole  life  carbon  emissions  approach. Through this expanded commitment, the Company pledged to achieve maximum reduction of embodied carbon in new developments, compensating for any remaining residual operational and upfront embodied emissions via o/ffsetting for new developments by 2030 and advocating for all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050. In 2018, CDL was the first real estate company in Singapore to set Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi')-validated carbon reduction targets based on a 2\u00b0C warmer scenario with 2007 baseline year. CDL renewed its SBTi-validated targets in December 2021 by aligning with a more stringent 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario and 2016 baseline year.\n- \u00b7 Green  Building  Policy -  CDL  is  committed  to incorporating decarbonisation, innovation, inclusivity, health and well-being into the design and operation of its buildings. To provide a safe, healthy and inclusive environment for its employees, customers and workers, it is crucial to proactively adopt smart and sustainable building  technologies.  The  3S  Framework  built  on the three thrusts - Smart, Sustainable and Super Low Carbon  will  drive  CDL's  commitment  to  reduce  its carbon footprint and environmental impact in line with CDL's net zero whole life carbon buildings commitment and the Singapore Green Plan 2030.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity Policy - CDL supports Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision towards higher living standards while co-existing with flora and fauna. The Company aims to minimise and mitigate the impacts of its developments on natural habitats and to protect wildlife biodiversity.

The SIP is formulated in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact, and aligned with the global best practices laid out in the UN SDGs, UN Principles for Responsible Investment, TCFD and UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative. It also complements CDL's existing ESG policies and guidelines, including the Climate Change Policy, EHS Policy, Green Building Policy, Biodiversity Policy and Human Rights Policy.\n- \u00b7 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy - CDL Group is committed to ensuring a dignity-centred workplace where our employees are always mutually respected.

Every employee shall be treated with respect and dignity. No  employee  shall  be  subject  to  any  physical, psychological, verbal or sexual abuse. Employees should be culturally sensitive, tolerant and respectful towards each other, taking into consideration the workplace environment and multi-culturalism. This policy extends to dealing with incidents involving external customers/ stakeholders who conduct themselves in a manner that constitutes harassment of the employees, within and beyond company premises.\n\n## INTERNAL CODE ON DEALINGS IN SECURITIES\n\nThe Company has in place an internal code on securities trading which sets out the implications of insider trading and provides guidance and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the Company's securities by the Company, its  Directors  and  employees.  These  guidelines  prohibit dealing  in  the  Company's  securities  (a)  on  short-term considerations; (b) during the 'closed period', commencing one  month  before  the  date  of  announcement  of  the Company's half-year and full year financial results and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results; and (c) while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive information in relation to such securities.

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nManaging risk is an integral part of the Group's business and we continually strive towards best risk management practices. The Board is responsible for the governance of risk, sets the strategy for the Group and ensures that management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls. The Board is supported by the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) and other Board committees which  are  constituted  to  address  di/fferent  aspects  of the business. The ARC oversees financial reporting and audit matters, as well as the governance of risks. The\n\nARC considers the nature and extent of significant risks which the Group may undertake in achieving its strategic objectives, and guides management in the formulation and implementation of the risk management framework, policies and processes. This ensures that significant risks are  e/ffectively  identified,  evaluated  and  mitigated,  to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets, furthering corporate sustainability. The ARC also reports to the Board on crucial risk issues, material matters, findings, and recommendations.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThe Group maintains a robust risk management framework anchored on five key pillars which adopt principles and guidance from standards such as the International Organisation for Standardisation's 31000 Risk Management Standards, as well as relevant best practices and guidelines. The framework provides the principles and guidance for the Group's risk management activities.\n\n## CDL GROUP RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThe five key pillars serve as the foundation of ERM execution and implementation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK PROCESS\n\nA fit for purpose process for managing, monitoring and reporting risks\n\nThe Group's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function carries out periodical review to ensure that the framework remains  relevant  and  practical  to  facilitate  risk-informed decision-making.\n\nDuring the year, the Group's ERM function also undertook and implemented several initiatives targeted at strengthening internal  control  system  and  building  resilience  in  the ever-changing risk landscape. Some of the notable initiatives included:\n\n- \u00b7  Adopting  a  more  proactive  approach  to  asset-level readiness against geopolitical uncertainties and physical climate hazards.\n- \u00b7 Leveraging on loss modelling to optimise the balance between risk retention and risk transfer.\n- \u00b7  Enhancing policies, processes and training to deter and prepare internal stakeholders against cyber threats, data privacy and money laundering, and terrorism financing non-compliance threat.\n- \u00b7  Investing in resources strategically to strengthen governance, risk management and compliance activities\n- \u00b7  Refreshing of Control Self-Assessment (CSA).\n\n## RISK STRATEGY AND CULTURE\n\nOur risk strategy and culture are based on the belief that risk management is the responsibility of all employees and that it must be integrated into strategy formulation, capital allocation, decision-making and day-to-day operations. The fostering of strong and sustainable 'self-driven' risk culture is guided by defined guiding principles that underpin the ERM operating model.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\nLine managers are to own risks and be accountable\n\nRisk management activities are to hinge not only on processes and systems, but equally on a right mindset and attitude\n\nRisk management is to be benchmarked against global best practices\n\nManagement is fully committed to fostering a strong riskcentric culture by setting the appropriate tone at the top and demonstrating strong support for risk management. Risk awareness and accountability are embedded in our culture through our governance structure that ensures appropriate\n\noversight  and  accountability  for  e/ffective  management of risks throughout the Group, further supported by risk management  principles  that  are  embedded  in  all  our decision-making and business processes.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nThe risk appetite was set to define the extent of risks the Group is able and willing to take on to achieve our strategic and  business  objectives.  The  purpose  of  establishing  a risk appetite framework is not to limit risk-taking, but to ensure that the Group's risk profile remains within tolerable boundaries as opportunities are maximised. The risk appetite statements, along with the accompanying risk tolerance limits  in  both  quantitative  and/or  qualitative  terms,  are reviewed annually.\n\nThe  Board  has  approved  the  following  risk  appetite statements:\n\n- \u00b7  The Group will continue to focus on business activities in identified core markets. Apart from the core markets, the Group shall otherwise not be overly exposed to any other single country.\n- \u00b7  The Group is prepared to undertake new investment and innovation initiatives commensurate to expected returns, and/or are in line with the Group's core strength and strategic objectives. From acquisition to divestment, all investments undertaken should not have potential loss exposure  that  could  significantly  threaten  the  Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  The Group will avoid any situations and/or actions that may result in negative impact on our reputation and branding. Should  such  situations  arise,  they  will  be  managed aggressively to preserve our reputation and brand image.\n- \u00b7  The Group will maintain adequate liquid assets to cover planned  cash  outflows  and  shall  not  take  speculative positions on interest rates and foreign exchange.\n- \u00b7  The Group maintains a 'zero-tolerance' position in relation to environment, health and safety breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as criminally dishonest acts such as fraud, corruption, bribery and extortion.\n- \u00b7  The Group will minimise operational and IT risk, subject to the cost-benefit trade-o/ff.\n\nThe  ERM  function  reports  to  the  Management  Risk Committee (MRC). The MRC monitors the Group risk profiles and regulatory compliance status on a quarterly basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK STRATEGY\n\nClear objectives, focus and guiding principles\n\n## RISK CULTURE\n\nA desired risk culture and mindset\n\n## Material Risks are categorise into four key areas\n\nTools and Technique to support the Risk Management Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC\n\nExternal environment as well as emerging or evolving threats on business execution\n\nMarket concentration, liquidity, interest rate, foreign and internal financial management and control\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE\n\n## INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nPeople, Processes, Systems\n\nLoss of information, data security, service disruption of critical IT systems\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TREASURY AND FINANCIAL\n\nStakeholder engagements, scenario analysis incidents and loss modelling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nDefined risk appetite statements and tolerance limits\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE\n\nE/ffective risk governance structure",

This includes establishing adequate  managerial and supervisory controls  to ensure compliance with policies,  risk appetite, threshold limits and  e/ffective risk controls, and to highlight  gaps, inadequacy of processes and  unexpected risk events. | The ERM function is responsible for  designing, implementing and improving  the risk management framework as  part of the ERM and control assurance  programme.  It also provides independent  identification, assessment, monitoring,  and reporting of the Group's risk profiles  and material risk issues to the   MRC and ARC. | The MRC comprising Senior  Management and relevant key  executives, meets with the ExCo to  discuss material risks and the adequacy  and e/ffectiveness of mitigations on  a regular, at least quarterly, basis.  The meeting is facilitated by the ERM  function. The Internal Audit department provides  independent assurance on the adequacy  and e/ffectiveness of the internal controls  and risk management framework to   the ExCo and the ARC.  Significant risk issues are then surfaced |\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group adopts an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process that enables systematic identification and prioritisation of all material risks. An integral part of the process towards e/ffective risk management is continuous communication and consultation with internal and external stakeholders. This enables the Group to understand the importance of risk management, to appreciate the decisions that are taken within the Group, and to implement the best policies and practices necessary for the benefit of the Group.\n\n## MATERIAL RISKS TO THE GROUP\n\nThe  Group  categorises  its  risk  profiles  into  four  key areas: Strategic, Treasury and Financial, Operational and  Compliance,  and  Information  Technology.  These risks  vary  widely,  with  many  being  beyond  the  Group's control. The Group is committed to mitigate risk exposure through  appropriate  risk  management  strategies  and adequate internal controls. Close monitoring and control processes, including the use of appropriate key risk and key performance indicators, are implemented to ensure the risk profiles are managed within the Group's risk appetite and tolerance limits.\n\n## STRATEGIC RISK\n\nA large part of the Group's strategic risks comprises market-driven forces, evolving business landscapes, changing customer demands and disruptive innovations. The Group remains vulnerable to uncertainties in the major economies, implications from geopolitical developments, keen competition and pressure in the real estate and hospitality industry.\n\n## MARKET AND COMPETITION\n\nGiven the geographical diversity of our business, the Group is exposed to various levels of event risks in major economies, as well as in key financial and property markets in which we operate. The Group's principal business operations comprising property development, property investment and hotel operations, face significant competition across the diverse markets in which it operates, and the failure to compete e/ffectively in terms of price, market positioning, product quality, and levels of service could adversely a/ffect the Groups' financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring macroeconomic trends, market conditions, and developments, and formulating responses and pre-emptive strategies accordingly.\n- b) Leveraging our market analytics and project delivery expertise to introduce quality products and innovative solutions to meet the evolving consumer demands.\n- c) Strengthening our brand and competitiveness through product di/fferentiation, market positioning, operational e/fficiency, transformation through innovation and creating new revenue generating platforms, as well as leveraging a portfolio of distribution channel partners.\n- d) Diversifying of portfolio across geographies, focusing on core markets and cities where the Group has operational scale, and where underlying economic fundamentals are more robust.\n- e) Distinguishing the quality, value, and e/fficiency of our lodging products and services by focusing on delivering a seamless customer experience, including our Loyalty Programme, direct booking channels, and consumer-facing technology platforms and services, from those o/ffered by others.",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## BRAND AND REPUTATION\n\nThe Group's reputation is one of its most valuable assets, playing a major part in the continued success of the business. The assessment of reputational risk, due to its nature, is constantly evolving and dependent on numerous factors at any given point in time, and therefore not possible to define all matters and circumstances which may pose reputational risk, or to set out all the considerations which should be applied as part of the decision-making process.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe Group recognises that climate risks are business risks. A focal issue of the Paris Agreement and Singapore Green Plan 2030, climate change is one of the long-term key global risks that can potentially impact the Group's assets, revenue, operations, supply chain, product design, stakeholder engagement, and investor communication. Aside from physical risks arising from climate change, regulatory transition risks can result in stricter emission standards, increased carbon tax and water pricing, and stricter building design requirements. The Group prioritises ESG communication and reporting to proactively manage rising stakeholder capitalism, investor and consumer activism. In the face of climate change, climate-proofing its buildings for a low-carbon future is key to the Group's growth strategy.\n\n## REGULATORY CHANGES\n\nThe Group operates in many jurisdictions and is exposed to various levels of political and policy risks such as political uncertainties, introduction or change in public policies, statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\n## TREASURY AND FINANCIAL RISK\n\nGiven the Group's diversified global businesses, the Group is exposed to market concentration, liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks. We have established policies, guidelines and control procedures to manage and report exposure to such risks.\n\n## MARKET CONCENTRATION\n\nThe risk of a significant loss as a result of the poor performance of a single exposure (or Group or related exposure).\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\nThe Group's ability to meet short-term financial obligations.\n\n## INTEREST RATE\n\nThe interest rate risk carried by the Group relates primarily to interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations.\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations arising from sales, purchases and monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Group's entities.\n\n- We manage this risk by:\n- a) Monitoring and maintaining our geographical and asset concentration exposure in accordance with our risk appetite and tolerance.\n- b) Active management to ensure that our portfolio of assets, investments and businesses are diversified against the systemic risks of operating in a specific geography.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring and maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities.\n- b) Having in place Medium-Term Note (MTN) programmes to provide a further avenue to support planned growth and investment opportunities.\n- c) Maintaining a healthy gearing ratio.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\na) Maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates. b) Leveraging on interest rate derivatives to hedge against interest rate exposure for specific underlying debt obligations after considering prevailing market conditions.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Pursuing 'natural hedges' by matching receipts and payments and making asset purchases and borrowings in the respective foreign currency, where possible.\n- b) Leveraging forward foreign exchange contracts or cross-currency swaps to manage foreign exchange exposures.\n\nc) Monitoring foreign exchange risk on a continual basis.\n\nFor more information on the Group's Financial Risk Management, please refer to the Financial Risk Management section on page 217 of this annual report.\n\n## OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK\n\nThe Group's operations are exposed to a variety of operational risks relating to project management, environment, health and safety (EHS), human capital, data privacy, legal and compliance management.\n\n## PROJECT MANAGEMENT\n\nThough minimal risk has been encountered, the Group remains vigilant against project risks such as schedule delay, cost overrun, build quality, contractor's capability and performance, as well as contract disputes, that will a/ffect our reputation and sales.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Allocating appropriate attention to technically challenging and high-value projects.\n- b) Adopting a systematic assessment and monitoring process to identify and manage the key risks for each project. The Group adopts a rigorous project management process to ensure that project cost, build quality and time objectives are met and has put in place stringent pre-qualification and tendering procedures to appoint well-qualified vendors. Regular site visits are also conducted to closely monitor the progress of projects and manage potential risks of delays, poor workmanship and cost overruns.\n- c) Benchmarking our quality assurance processes against industry standards. We voluntarily subscribe to the BCA Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) and the Quality Mark (QM) Assessment System.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Undertaking active monitoring of both traditional and social media platforms, aggressively responding to and managing any undesirable situation(s) that may arise.\n- b) Raising the profile of our brands through marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships to build and enhance brand equity.\n- c) Focusing on a customer-centric approach, and monitoring customer satisfaction closely through surveys, gathering feedback, inspections and other forms of engagement.\n- d) Establishing brand standards that are designed to maintain a level of product consistency based on the brand collection to which a hotel belongs, whilst allowing flexibility in order to maintain the personality of the property.\n- e) Striving to avoid any situations and/or actions that could result in a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Pledging net zero whole life carbon for CDL's new developments and major renovations over which we have direct operational and management control in Singapore by 2030, in accordance with World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.\n- b) Implementing robust climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to accelerate e/fforts towards a low-carbon business model, such as setting carbon emissions reduction targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for a 1.5 o C warmer scenario.\n- c) Pushing the envelope in innovative green building technologies to enhance the resilience of its assets against physical and transition risks posed by climate change.\n- d) Measuring and disclosing CDL's management of climate-related risks using internationally recognised frameworks/ assessments, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) and CDP.\n- e) Conducting climate change scenario analyses as a means of testing the Group's strategic resilience against di/fferent plausible and science-based climate scenarios. The analysis also covered climate-related risks from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as emerging net-zero regulatory landscapes across five key CDL markets.\n- f)  Monitoring supply chain risks to better prepare for the increasing physical and social challenges impacting the Group's supplies of materials and workers.\n- g) Raising the bar on proactive, transparent and prompt ESG communication and reporting via digital platforms.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Actively engaging with regulatory bodies and professional firms on updates to laws and regulations.\n- b) Continuous monitoring and assessment of impact arising from regulatory changes, observing market reactions, and formulating our strategies accordingly.",

For more information on how we manage personal data, please refer to our data privacy policy on our websites.\n\n## Group Data Privacy Policy\n\nhttps://www.cdl.com.sg/index.php/privacy-policy\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Maintaining a zero-tolerance policy and 'tone from the top' towards compliance, including that of fraud, bribery and corruption.

Measures and considerations have also been taken to safeguard against loss of information, data security, and prolonged service disruption of critical IT systems.\n- b) Dedicating IT expertise to keep abreast of the latest developments, innovation and threats in technology and assessing their impact and risks.\n- c) Conducting Vulnerability and Penetration Testing (VAPT) and guided selfassessments to identify IT security gaps.\n- d) Leveraging threat intelligence and advanced security analytics to detect potential breaches.\n- e) Conducting training and assessment exercises, to educate users and heighten awareness to cyber threats.\n- f)  Maintaining a cyber threat incident response protocol and disaster recovery plan.

These sessions are open for investors and other stakeholders to join via 'live' webcasts, and a recording of the corporate presentation is made available on our website thereafter.\n\nIn 2023, with the easing of pandemic restrictions, we resumed in-person meetings and events, which we believe are vital for fostering engagement and building rapport with shareholders.\n\nHowever, to provide flexibility to shareholders who may have grown accustomed to virtual meetings, our 60th AGM on 26 April 2023 was held in a hybrid format, providing shareholders with the option to attend in-person or remotely. Virtual live voting and question-and-answer functions were implemented to facilitate remote participation.\n\nDuring the year, we engaged with over 60 institutional investors, hosted several local and overseas showflat and site tours, and our AGM and webcasts were attended by over 800 shareholders and stakeholders. During these meetings, our ExCo and Senior Management representatives shared insights on our performance and strategic priorities and gleaned valuable feedback on investors' perceptions.\n\nApart from facilitating corporate access for investors, the IR team proactively engages with sell-side equity research analysts, maintaining regular dialogue, to stay informed about market concerns. The ExCo and the Board are also updated on analysts' views, share price performance and shareholder analysis on a monthly and bi-annual basis respectively.\n\n## INVESTOR RELATIONS\n\nCDL is committed to maintaining high standards of disclosure and corporate transparency to foster accountability, confidence and trust among our valued investors.\n\nThe 'Investor Relations' (IR) section on CDL's website (cdl.com. sg) is the primary source of corporate and financial information.

The  World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Risks Report 2024 reported that 'extreme weather events' is the top global risk for humanity over the next 10 years. Similarly, 'biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse' is perceived as one of the fastest deteriorating global risks. With only 15% of the targets for the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals' (SDGs) on track and many going in reverse, there is much to be done. 1\n\nSustainability is undoubtedly a mainstream business priority now. According to Bloomberg, about 90% of investors anticipated more benefits from a focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. This has helped them to make more informed decisions.\n\nCDL's  corporate  ethos,  'Conserving  as  We  Construct', established since 1995, has steered the Company in the right direction to e/ffectively navigate through climate and business risks today.\n\nFor nearly three decades, the Group has been committed to  a  balanced  triple  bottom  line  that  integrates  ESG considerations into its business for long-term value creation. The Group has continually tracked its ESG performance to ensure business growth and profitability, while mitigating impact on planet and people. The Company's value-creation model is based on a two-pillar framework comprising 'impact' on planet and people, and 'value' focusing on connecting ESG to financial and investment materiality. Its sustainability initiatives continue to be anchored on four strategic pillars Integration, Innovation, Investment, and Impact to achieve three key deliverables - \"Decarbonisation\", \"Digitalisation & Innovation\", and \"Disclosure & Communication\" that are aligned with global best practices and standards.\n\nAs the world races to zero, the Group will continue to accelerate innovative and impactful climate action through collaborations with the public, private and people sectors. The Group will remain dedicated to ESG integration and focus on capturing growth opportunities, while mitigating ESG risks and creating value for all stakeholders.\n\nTo address the rising global concern about degradation to nature and biodiversity loss, CDL's Integrated Sustainability Report (ISR) 2024 is titled 'Zero in on Nature'. The Report proactively articulates the Group's ESG strategy and actions in embracing nature to enhance value and impact in the communities it operates in and charting its path towards a net-zero and nature-positive future.\n\n1\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the Company engages its BSC members on ESG-focused events such as the annual Hong LeongCDL Group Sustainability Forum since 2014, and the CSO communicates the latest global and local ESG trends and practices via emails. The CDL Sustainability Quarterly Report posted online on www.cdlsustainability.com o/ffers regular updates on the Group's sustainability initiatives and interim EHS performance to the BSC, Sustainability Committee and external audience. For more details on the BSC's roles and responsibilities for climate-related risks and opportunities, please refer to CDL's Annual Report 2023, page 37 .\n\nTo achieve e/ffective integration of sustainability throughout the company, the CSO chairs the Sustainability Committee, which comprises members across all departments and operational units. In 2021, the Company stepped up on strengthening the links between its ESG performance with the Management Executive Committee (ExCo) members' remuneration. 20% of the ExCo members' remuneration is linked to ESG targets, with a respective weightage of 5% each for Environmental and Governance targets and 10% for Social targets. With Heads of Departments (HODs) reporting to the respective ExCo members, the ESG Key Performance  Indicators  are  cascaded  down  to  every level in the organisation. HODs are held accountable for their ESG performances, which are then captured in their annual performance appraisals that correspond with their remuneration and promotions.\n\n## 2023 IN REVIEW - ZERO IN ON NATURE\n\n## Zero in on Nature in CDL's Sustainability Strategy\n\nIn September 2023, the Taskforce on Naturerelated  Financial  Disclosures  (TNFD)  released  its  final Recommendations, guiding corporates to act on evolving nature-related risks and opportunities. Having embraced the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in 2017, adopting TNFD is a natural progression for the Company. As one of the pioneering Singapore companies amongst 320 companies in the world to voluntarily report according to the TNFD Recommendations, the Company aims to e/ffectively assess, disclose and manage its naturerelated risks and opportunities, and provide consistent and comparable reporting to all its stakeholders.\n\nNature and biodiversity conservation have been part of the Company's longstanding commitment to minimising and mitigating the impact of its developments on natural habitats, as well as protecting biodiversity. Since 2010, the Company has made it a standard practice to conduct a Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) at greenfield sites located  within  or  adjacent  to  natural  habitats  before construction. In 2020, the Group launched a dedicated Biodiversity Policy, and aligned it with Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision in 2021. With increasing global focus on loss of biodiversity as a key business risk, and potential impacts brought on by property development and management activities, 'Biodiversity Conservation' has been added to the Group's list of top material ESG issues since 2021.\n\nThe Company is honoured that its CSO Ms Esther An has been newly appointed as a member of the WEF's Global Commission on Nature-Positive Cities set up in September 2023. The company is fully supportive of her role in raising awareness of the importance of healthy ecosystems for a resilient built environment through her sharing of Singapore and the Company's experience.\n\n## ACCELERATING TOWARDS THE GLOBAL RACE TO ZERO\n\nTo tackle the climate emergency, the Company is well placed to accelerate climate action and create positive ESG  and  business  impact.  Building  upon  its  corporate ethos  of  'Conserving  as  We  Construct',  established  in 1995,  the  Company's  Economic,  Environmental,  Social and Governance (EESG) strategy continues to guide its value  creation  model  to  achieve  its  three  deliverables with positive impact: 'Decarbonisation', 'Digitalisation & Innovation' and 'Disclosure & Communication'.\n\n## Decarbonisation - Expanding Scope and Managing Performance\n\nIn 2021, the Company became Southeast Asia's first real estate conglomerate to sign the World Green Building Council's (WorldGBC) Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment - a global pledge to achieve net-zero operational carbon by 2030. This was expanded to include maximum embodied\n\n## MAINTAINING SUSTAINABILITY LEADERSHIP & STRONG GOVERNANCE\n\n## Continued Recognition by Global Sustainability Rankings and Awards\n\nAs  a  testament  to  its  longstanding  commitment  to sustainable development and alignment of its deliverables with global best practices, the Company continues to lead in established global sustainability ratings and rankings:\n\n- \u00b7 Global  100  Most  Sustainable  Corporations  in  the World by Corporate Knights : Ranked 22nd in 2024 and maintained ranking as the world's most sustainable real estate management and development company for the sixth consecutive year as well as the only Singapore company listed for 15 consecutive years\n- \u00b7 CDP : The only company in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to remain on the CDP A List for six consecutive years; only Singapore company to score double 'A's for climate change (since 2018) and water security (since 2019). Top 2% amongst CDP Participants for Supplier Engagement on Climate Change\n- \u00b7 MSCI ESG Ratings : Maintained 'AAA' leader rating since 2010\n- \u00b7 Sustainalytics : ESG Regional Top Rated and Industry Top Rated in 2024\n- \u00b7 GRESB : 4th in Asia's Diversified - O/ffice/Retail/Listed Sector in 2023 (Standing Investments); GRESB 5-Star Rating\n- \u00b7 S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2024\n- \u00b7 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index : The only Singapore real estate company listed since 2018\n- \u00b7 The Edge Singapore Billion Dollar Club : Conferred the inaugural Best ESG Risk Ratings award\n- \u00b7 The Asset Triple A Sustainable Finance Awards 2024 : Conferred Best Sustainability-Linked Loan - Real Estate\n\nSince 2012, the Company's Corporate Social ResponsibilityCorporate Governance (CSR-CG) Committee was established to implement an integrated governance structure, ensuring commitment  across  hierarchical  levels  and  functions for  coordinating  ESG  e/fforts.  The  CSR-CG  Committee was renamed the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) in 2016.\n\nThe Chief Sustainability O/fficer (CSO) reports directly to the  BSC,  comprising  three  independent  directors,  and CDL's Executive Director and Group CEO. The BSC has direct advisory supervision of the Group's sustainability strategy and targets, including that of its major subsidiaries, Millennium & Copthorne (M&C) Hotels Limited and CBM Pte Ltd. The BSC also oversees the Group's sustainability strategy and is apprised of initiatives to address climate and sustainability-related risks and opportunities, sustainable investment plans, as well as sustainability reporting on material  ESG  issues,  work  plans,  performance  targets setting, tracking and reporting.\n\nTwo meetings are held annually, or more frequently as and when necessary, for the management to update BSC on the Group's sustainability plans and performance reviews.",

In December 2021, the Company revised its Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)validated GHG emissions intensity reduction targets (Scope 1, 2 and 3) to be aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario, with additional targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In 2022, the Company stepped up on operationalising and tracking its carbon reduction performance for Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions against these SBTi-validated targets.\n\nAs one of the first four companies in Singapore to adopt the TCFD Recommendations since 2017, the Company completed  its  third  Climate  Change  Scenario  Study  in December  2022. 2 This  study  focused  on  its  readiness for physical and transitional risks. The scope and region included  under  the  Group  were  expanded,  given  the rising urgency, scale and severity of climate change. The study considered the disruptions caused by the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly impacted business operations and financial performance.\n\nThe  International  Sustainability  Standards  Board  (ISSB) Standards, S1 and S2, launched in June 2023, will require additional disclosures in Scope 3, along with Scopes 1 and 2. In anticipation of this, the Group has continued to raise the bar in tackling Scope 3 emissions through closer strategic alignment and integration with its wider global value chain, including key subsidiaries such as M&C and CBM Pte Ltd. 3 The Group's SBTi-validated targets aligned with 1.5\u00b0C emissions reduction target of 58.8% under Scope 3 (category 15) will extend to all major subsidiaries. 4\n\nIn 2023, energy e/fficiency and adoption of renewables is the top material issue for the Group. It is crucial for businesses to manage their energy e/fficiency as it will have a significant impact on the bottom line in the long run. The Company has achieved approximately $42 million in energy savings from energy-e/fficient retrofitting and initiatives across all its locally managed buildings from 2012 to 2023.\n\nIn anticipation of Singapore's carbon tax being raised to $25/tCO 2 e from January 2024, the Company kickstarted an Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) study in 2023. Piloted at the Company's headquarters, Republic Plaza, a successful implementation of ICP will help the Company financially internalise the cost of environmental impacts by factoring such costs into its financial and investment decisions. The Company believes in eventually scaling and implementing ICP across its wider portfolio to help it to achieve its SBTi targets and net-zero ambitions.\n\nIn 2023, the Company successfully secured blue carbon credits for the first time. Purchased through an auction by Climate Impact X, the credits are generated from Pakistan's Delta Blue Carbon Project, the world's largest mangrove restoration  project  that  protects  and  restores  350,000 hectares of mangrove forests in Pakistan's Indus River Delta area. It is also expected to improve the well-being and livelihoods of over 42,000 people in the local communities, of which 70% live below the poverty line.\n\nTo gain better insight into its decarbonisation e/fforts using a life cycle approach, the Company conducted its first Whole Life Carbon Assessment (WLCA) in Singapore using five Group assets across di/fferent typologies - residential, retail, hotel and mixed development in 2H 2023. The WLCA provided valuable insights on the carbon emissions of its buildings during construction, maintenance and operation stages. By providing a useful breakdown of the carbon footprint of building components and life cycle stages, the Group can better identify challenges and opportunities for future projects of similar scale and building typologies, and work towards reduction of both embodied and operational carbon.\n\nIn 2023, eight of the Group's properties in Singapore Republic  Plaza,  City  Square  Mall,  King's  Centre,  Palais Renaissance, Quayside Isle, Grand Copthorne Waterfront, M Hotel, and JW Marriott South Beach - also successfully attained the internationally recognised WELL Health-Safety Rating. ^ The benefits of leasing a space in WELL HealthSafety  Rating  certified  buildings  include  assurance  of constant air and water quality monitoring and optimisation, access to integral health benefits and services, and frequent health and safety stakeholder engagements. The Group is committed to paving the way for more health and wellness designs and provisions in its buildings.\n\n## Digitalisation & Innovation - Building with Nature\n\nIntegrating its developments with nature has long been an important aspect of the Company's pioneering e/fforts in greening skylines in Singapore. More than a decade ago, the Company built the Tree House condominium with 77% of its site area dedicated to landscaping and communal facilities. The Tree House condominium achieved a Guinness World Record  in  2014  for  having  the  world's  largest  vertical garden. Since then, the Company has embarked on several other notable projects that exemplify its e/fforts to build with nature, such as Amber Park, where 65% of its site area is dedicated to facilities, lifestyle space and landscaping with native plant species. In the pipeline, the Company's Newport Residences (part of the former Fuji Xerox Towers) incorporates green features for higher energy e/fficiency that translates to annual cost savings of about $450,000. Construction  of  the  Newport  Plaza  development  has started and is expected to complete in 2027.\n\nIn the past year, the Company intensified its use of innovative and viable green building technology and decarbonisation solutions. At the new Irwell Hill Residences, it initiated the CarbonCure Concrete pilot, which embeds recycled carbon dioxide in fresh concrete to create sustainable concrete without compromising performance. Other decarbonisation solutions include a gradual replacement of belt-driven fans with electrically commutative (EC) fans for its local assets to improve energy e/fficiency.\n\nWith growing global emphasis on nature-positive solutions, managing the Company's biodiversity footprint has become more important than ever. As such, it has become the first and only Singaporean company to subscribe to Xylo Systems, a cloud-based AI platform that supports e/fforts to measure and manage biodiversity impact, conduct\n\n- 2 Based on the latest research and scenario analysis from global climate benchmarks such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, International Energy Agency, the Network for Greening the Financial System and the World Bank.\n- 3 In 2019, M&C announced its SBTi-validated 2 o C target for absolute emissions reduction by 27% for owned and managed hotels under Scopes 1 and 2.\n- 4 Based on publicly disclosed data from 2016 to 2020.\n\n^\n\n- WELL is an evidence-based, third-party verified rating that empowers owners and operators to prioritise the health and safety of building users.\n\n2008, the Company has consistently built upon its robust sustainability reporting framework to review and improve its strategy systematically.\n\nIn June 2023, the ISSB issued its inaugural standards International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2, to provide companies with a baseline reporting standard a common language - to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities in global capital markets. Complementing the  global  launch,  Singapore  set  up  the  Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC) to compile robust recommendations that prepare listed and large non-listed companies to report climate-related disclosures aligned with ISSB Standards from 2025 and 2027 respectively.\n\nRiding on 16 years of reporting experience, the Company pioneered  the  application  of  a  two-pillar  sustainability reporting framework in its previous ISR. The framework integrated ISSB Standards' focus on financial and business value with GRI's priority on impact on the planet and people. With the addition of the ISSB Standards into the Company's reporting framework, financial materiality of ESG was an added consideration. This is a continuation of the Company's double materiality approach in assessing sustainability-related risks and opportunities in a holistic manner.\n\nAs the Company aims to transition towards the adoption of IFRS S1 and S2 by FY2025, it has engaged an external consultant  to  conduct  a  comprehensive  gap  analysis and provide a roadmap to guide the Group towards full alignment. In addition, the Company has progressively expanded the scope of its ISR 2024 to include relevant and available Group ESG data towards a wider coverage of entities in alignment with CDL's annual reports.\n\nin-depth assessments, predict potential consequences of the Company's activities and make informed decisions backed by data.\n\n## Accelerating Super Low Carbon, Smart and Sustainable Buildings\n\nIn line with the Singapore Green Building Masterplan's \"8080-80\" goals, the Company has committed to enhancing its existing assets and achieving Super Low Energy Buildings (SLEB) for 80% of its owned and managed buildings by 2030. In 2023, the Company achieved three BCA Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy (SLE) 5 awards for its corporate headquarters, Republic Plaza, and residential developments, Tembusu Grand and Lumina Grand, and one BCA Green Mark Gold PLUS award for The Myst. Additionally, Tembusu Grand and Lumina Grand each earned a BCA Whole Life Carbon  Badge,  further  recognising  their  sustainability achievements beyond their Platinum status.\n\nThe Company is also proud to be a leading developer with a pioneering commitment to green buildings in Singapore, with 123 BCA Green Mark-certified developments since the  Green  Mark  scheme  became  mandatory  in  2008. Going  forward,  the  Company  remains  steadfast  in  its decarbonisation journey with continual improvements in energy e/fficiency.\n\n## Disclosures - Robust Sustainability Reporting to Unlock Financial Value to Grow, Enhance and Transform\n\n## CDL's Strategic Sustainability Reporting and Pioneering A Two-Pillar Approach\n\nIntegrating climate and nature conservation has long been an important aspect of the Company's business and green building strategy.

The Company's strong sustainability track record enables it to leverage sustainable financing solutions to advance action.\n\nSince the Company issued its first green bond in 2017, it has completed over $6.3 billion of sustainable finance including various green loans, a green revolving credit facility and sustainability-linked loans. In December 2023, the Company marked  a  new  sustainable  financing  milestone  with  a three-year  \u00a3200  million  (approximately  $338.2  million) sustainability-linked loan from OCBC aligned to a SBTi 1.5\u00b0C pathway. This reflects the Company's commitment to decarbonising its business via its initial net-zero carbon target  by  2030  for  new  and  existing  wholly-owned assets and developments under its direct operational and management control and aligning its capital management with its sustainability goals.\n\n## Amplifying Impact through Collaboration and Advocacy\n\nEngaging stakeholders and changing mindsets are essential in the global race to zero. This can only be achieved through multi-stakeholder collaborations to amplify social impact. The Company has continued its advocacy and training  aligned  with  the  SDGs  through  the  Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA), designed and built in 2017 as Singapore's first ground-up and zero-energy facility. In 2023, SSA hosted over 190 advocacy events and training classes.\n\nThe Company is proud to announce that the SSA is entering its next phase with the addition of a new SSA Annex (SSAA). As an expanded hub for capacity building and collaboration, the SSAA is a net-zero building with circularity in action.

A  first-of-its-kind  repurposed train  carriage,  it  will  focus  on  educating  and  raising eco-awareness amongst kids and youths on a broad range of sustainability topics and climate issues. A collaboration with  Just  Keep  Thinking,  Singapore's  biggest  science, nature and sustainability social media channel, the Eco Train is slated to open in 2024.\n\nThe Company's other key community initiatives included the 4th My Tree House 'We Love Our Planet' Storytelling Contest, the 13th CDL-GCNS Youth SDG Leaders Award, the 7th edition of its flagship Youth4Climate Festival with an expanded network of eco-partners, in support of the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment's Go Green SG initiative.\n\nThe  Company  has  also  been  invited  to  share  its  ESG integration  journey  and  business  case  on  local  and international platforms. In 2023, the Company's CSO spoke at over 90 local and international forums and conferences, covering topics such as green building, decarbonisation, nature-based solutions (NbS), SDGs, sustainability reporting and finance.\n\n## STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF TOP MATERIAL ESG ISSUES\n\nSince 2014, materiality assessments are conducted annually and facilitated by a third party to determine the key EESG issues  that  are  important  to  the  Group's  stakeholders. Identified by internal and external stakeholders, the top ESG  issues  are  foundational  to  the  Company's  annual sustainability  reporting.  Corresponding  EESG  targets, metrics,  initiatives  and  progress  are  reviewed  by  the management team, reported to the BSC and the Board for endorsement, before they are published annually in CDL's ISR. In 2023, the materiality assessment was updated to align qualitatively with the IFRS S1 and S2. Endorsed by  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore  (MAS),  Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), the ISSB Standards require companies to assess the ESG issues that are considered material to the  company,  taking  into  account  both  financial  and non-financial  information,  including  the  impact  of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nENHANCEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe table below outlines the Group's actions in addressing risks and opportunities that are related to the Group's top 18 material ESG issues identified. They are mapped to 15 relevant UN SDGs and the four pillars of the TCFD and TNFD frameworks.

The reduction value would be 25% when calculated on a comparable basis.\n- (5) Reduction value includes the RECs purchased and retired for the respective year. For 2023, RECs retired contribute to ~2.6% reduction.\n- (6) Water use and waste intensities include water use and waste disposed by the CDL Corporate O/ffice.\n- (7) Waste intensity figures are for non-recyclable waste.\n- (8) 2023 experienced higher tra/ffic that resulted in a higher cooling load.\n- (9) For CDL managed construction projects that obtained TOP status for the reporting year. The projects are Piermont Grand, Haus on Handy, Boulevard 88 / The Singapore EDITION and Amber Park. As of 2023, project targets set for energy/water/waste will be applied to projects commencing in that specified year and measured to whether the targets are met at their point of TOP.\n- (10) For energy use intensity, the targets were not met for Piermont Grand, Haus on Handy and Boulevard 88 / The Singapore EDITION namely due to the prolonged construction process caused by COVID-19. Projects' performances are measured against their specific targets set at the point of commencement of the construction.\n- (11) For water use intensity, the targets were not met for Haus on Handy and Boulevard 88 / The Singapore EDITION namely due to the prolonged construction process caused by COVID-19. Projects' performances are measured against their specific targets set at the point of commencement of the construction.\n- (12) For waste intensity, the targets were not met for Boulevard 88 / The Singapore EDITION due to a higher waste generation from interior design materials associated with a mixed development project that includes a hotel. Projects' performances are measured against their specific targets set at the point of commencement of the construction.\n- (13) These refer to vendors engaged for proprietary equipment service and maintenance, facility management, security and cleaning service appointed by Asset Management, and main contractors and key consultants (architects, civil and structural engineers, mechanical and electrical engineers) appointed by Property Development.\n- (14) Investment refers to the Group's six key subsidiaries: CBM Pte Ltd, CDL Hospitality Trusts (considered an associate of the Group from 2023 onwards), City Serviced O/ffices, Le Grove Serviced Residences, Tower Club Singapore, hotels owned and managed by M&C.\n- (15) The calculation is based on the best available information on emission factors for building materials and industry accepted approaches at the point of reporting. These changes could have also contributed to this reduction.\n- (16) There have been changes in our investment portfolio as well as emission factors applied between 2016 and 2023. The reduction would be 58.7% when calculated on a comparable basis.\n- (17) There was one reported fatality case that occurred during demolition phase at Newport Plaza construction site in Q2 2023. Investigation is still ongoing by MOM. Site specific corrective action had been implemented on site and reviewed based on preliminary investigation reports.\n- (18) Major and Minor IR refer to the number of major and minor workplace injuries per 100,000 persons employed, respectively. For the definition of Major and Minor IR, please refer to Ministry of Manpower's website.\n- (19) The 2030 goals for minor injury rates were adjusted to take into account the revised definition of minor injuries by Ministry of Manpower.\n- (20) Minor injury rate for construction sites in 2022 was restated to accurately account for the number of lost-time injury.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group achieved a lower net profit after tax and noncontrolling interest (PATMI) of $317.3 million (FY 2022: $1.3 billion), largely due to higher financing costs in FY 2023 and the absence of substantial divestment gains recorded in the prior year arising from the sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul, the deconsolidation of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) as well as the completion of the collective sales of Tanglin Shopping Centre and Golden Mile Complex.\n\nThe  record  revenue  is  underpinned  by  the  property development segment which increased its revenue by twofold, largely due to its fully sold Executive Condominium (EC) project Piermont Grand which obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) in 1H 2023, enabling its revenue and profit to be recognised in entirety upon completion under prevailing accounting policies for ECs. The Group also divested its freehold land site in Shirokane, Tokyo, in Q3 2023 for JPY 50 billion ($495.0 million).\n\nThe Group recorded a pre-tax profit of $472.6 million for FY 2023 (FY 2022: $1.9 billion). The significant decrease for the year was due to the absence of substantial divestment gains as described above. The property development segment was the lead contributor following the recognition of the profits from Piermont Grand and the sale of the Shirokane land site, as well as other strong-performing Singapore projects such as Amber Park, Boulevard 88 and Irwell Hill Residences.\n\nPropelled by the rebound in the hospitality sector, the Group's hotel operations segment continued to register performance improvements in FY 2023, with a reversal of $54.0 million in impairment losses of its hotels (FY 2022: $31.8 million).\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\nRevenue increased by $1,410.3 million to $2,792.6 million (FY 2022: $1,382.3 million) for FY 2023. Correspondingly, pre-tax  profit  for  the  segment  more  than  doubled  by $178.2 million to $339.5 million (FY 2022: $161.3 million) for the year.\n\nProjects that contributed to both revenue and profit in FY 2023 included the land site at Shirokane, Piermont Grand, Amber Park, Irwell Hill Residences, Haus on Handy, Hong Leong Technology Park Shenzhen, Hongqiao Royal Lake in Shanghai, Teddington Studio in the UK as well as New Zealand land sales. In accordance with the Group's policy of equity accounting for the results of its joint ventures (JV), whilst revenue from JV developments such as Boulevard 88, CanningHill Piers, Piccadilly Grand and Sengkang Grand Residences had not been consolidated into the Group's total revenue, the Group's share of profit arising from JV developments had been included in the pre-tax profit.\n\nThe increase in revenue for FY 2023 was attributable to full revenue recognition from Piermont Grand, which obtained TOP in 1H 2023 and the sale of land site at Shirokane.\n\nThe increase in pre-tax profit for FY 2023 was in-line with the higher revenue achieved, along with negative goodwill of $38.8 million recognised on acquisition of Summervale Properties Pte Ltd. The increase was partially o/ffset by allowance for foreseeable losses made on a development property in China.\n\n## HOTEL OPERATIONS\n\nRevenue for this segment increased by $117.8 million to $1,498.5 million (FY 2022: $1,380.7 million) while pre-tax profit decreased by $1,194.6 million to $188.6 million (FY 2022: $1,383.2 million) for FY 2023.\n\nThe increase in revenue was attributable to the continued recovery of the hospitality industry, which was backed by the improved occupancy and room rates achieved by the Group's hotel portfolio. The Group's hotel RevPAR grew 25.3% for FY 2023.\n\nThe  significant  decline  in  pre-tax  profit  was  due  to substantial  divestment  gains  recognised  in  1H  2022 including gains recognised from the disposal of Millennium Hilton Seoul and the deconsolidation of CDLHT, partially o/ffset by higher reversal of impairment losses made on the hotel properties, mainly located in the US, of $54.0 million (FY 2022: $31.8 million) and a gain of $80.0 million accounted in 2H 2023 from the disposal of Millennium Harvest House Boulder.\n\nExcluding  the  divestment  gains  and  impairment  losses reversed, on a like-for-like-basis, the Group would have registered pre-tax profits for this segment in FY 2023 of $54.6 million (FY 2022: $32.0 million).\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nFor FY 2023, although revenue for this segment increased by $108.3 million to $449.5 million (FY 2022: $341.2 million), a pre-tax loss of $40.8 million (FY 2022: pre-tax profit of $383.6 million) was recorded.\n\nThe increase in revenue was mainly due to the addition of several newly acquired investment properties to the Group's portfolio, including St Katharine Docks in the UK, and various living sector assets in our key overseas target markets.\n\nDespite  higher  revenue  achieved,  the  Group  reported pre-tax  losses  mainly  due  to  impairment  losses  made on two investment properties in the UK in 1H 2023 and an investment property in China in 2H 2023, as well as increased  interest  expenses  amidst  the  high-interest rate environment. The losses were partially mitigated by divestment gains recognised primarily from disposal of a",

The increase for FY 2023 was due to higher project management fees earned.\n\nPre-tax loss for this segment decreased by $56.6 million to $14.7 million (FY 2022: pre-tax loss of $71.3 million) for FY 2023. Included in pre-tax losses for FY 2022 were impairment loss of $62.7 million made on loans granted to Sincere Property Group and $18.0 million made on US denominated bonds issued by Sincere Property which the Group had subscribed to, totalling $80.7 million.\n\n## REVENUE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT ($ MILLION)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROFIT BEFORE TAX BY BUSINESS SEGMENT* ($ MILLION)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Includes share of after-tax profit of associates and joint ventures.\n\n## REVENUE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROFIT BEFORE TAX BY BUSINESS SEGMENT*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProperty Development\n\nHotel Operations\n\nInvestment Properties\n\nOthers\n\n## OPERATIONS AND MARKET REVIEW\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Singapore\n\nThe  property  market  remained  stable  in  2023  despite facing some headwinds. Private home prices rose by 6.7%, lower than the increase of 8.6% in 2022. Transactions also moderated as developers sold 6,421 units excluding Executive Condominiums (ECs), reflecting a 9.6% decline compared to 7,099 units sold in 2022. The transaction volume decreased mainly due to cautious buying sentiment caused by high interest rates, property cooling measures, geopolitical concerns and the challenging economy.\n\nFor FY 2023, the Group and its joint venture (JV) associates sold 730 units including ECs, with a total sales value of $1.5 billion (FY 2022: 1,487 units with a total sales value of $2.9 billion). The sales were mainly attributed to the launch of two projects during the year.\n\nTembusu  Grand,  located  in  the  heart  of  Katong,  was launched in April. To date, 381 units (60%) of the 638-unit JV project have been sold. 1 In July, the Group launched The Myst, a 408-unit residential development along Upper Bukit Timah Road.

In September, it secured a Government Land Sales (GLS) site at Champions Way for $294.9 million or $904 psf ppr. The site is within minutes' walk to Woodlands South MRT station and will comprise 348 residential units and an Early Childhood Development Centre.\n\nIn November, the Group clinched another prime GLS site at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh with JV partners Frasers Property and  Sekisui  House  for  $968  million.  The  expansive 169,458 square feet (sq ft) site is a short walk to Braddell MRT station. Subject to approvals, the plan is to develop 777 residential units, making it the first new residential development in Toa Payoh in eight years.\n\nIn January 2024, the Group launched the 512-unit EC project  Lumina  Grand  at  Bukit  Batok  West  Avenue  5. Located close to the Jurong Innovation and Lake Districts and  the  upcoming  Tengah  Town,  it  o/ffers  seamless connectivity with three MRT stations in the vicinity, as well as a bus interchange. Being the first and likely the only EC launch in 2024, it was well received with 269 units (53%) snapped up on the launch weekend. To date, the project is around 70% sold.\n\nIn the recent Budget 2024 announcement, the Government made  some  concessions  for  developers  on  the  land Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) by progressively reducing the amount of remissible ABSD payable once 90% sales have been achieved. In addition, ABSD payment a/ffecting singles was also relaxed for those downsizing to smaller units.\n\nIn 2H 2024, the Group is planning to launch two new residential projects.

This rare freehold project is situated on Anson Road, at the nexus of the CBD and the future Greater  Southern  Waterfront  District.  It  has  no  ABSD deadline. Newport Residences is part of the 45-storey Newport Plaza, a mixed-use development that includes o/ffices, serviced apartments and retail. Construction is in progress and expected to complete in 2027.\n\n## International Australia\n\nIn Melbourne, The Marker, a 198-unit completed JV project is fully sold, while the 61-unit Fitzroy Fitzroy JV project is 51% sold and expected to complete in Q2 2026.\n\nIn Brisbane, sales for Brickworks Park (175 units) and JV project Treetops at Kenmore (97 units) have been steady. To cater to the high demand for townhouses, the Group has fine-tuned the unit mix for Stage 3 of its Brickworks Park project, which will now comprise 17 townhouses instead of 57 apartment units, leading to a reduction in the total number of units from 215 to 175. This strategic change is expected to reduce the construction duration, mitigate development risks and improve margins for the overall  development.  To  date,  85%  of  Brickworks  Park and 84% of Treetops at Kenmore have been sold. The two projects are expected to complete in Q4 2025 and Q2 2024 respectively.\n\n## China\n\nIn FY 2023, the Group's wholly-owned subsidiary, CDL China Limited and its JV associates sold 45 residential, o/ffice and retail units, with a total sales value of RMB 228.5 million (approximately $42.3 million).\n\nThe  Group  has  sold  most  of  its  residential  inventory in China. To date, in Suzhou, Hong Leong City Center (HLCC), a mixed-use development in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), has sold 92% of the 1,813 residential and retail units. In Shanghai, Hongqiao Royal Lake, a luxury 85-villa development in the prime residential enclave of Qingpu District, is 91% sold. In Shenzhen, Hong Leong Technology Park Shenzhen has sold 420 units comprising apartments, o/ffice and retail units with a sales value of RMB 1.12 billion (approximately $207.4 million) since the Group acquired this project in March 2021.\n\nThrough  its  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Suzhou Longcheng  Development  Investment  Co.,  Ltd,  the Group acquired a 100% equity stake in Suzhou Gaoxin Properties Co., Ltd, which owns a rare waterfront mixeduse  development  site  in  Suzhou's  High-Speed  Railway New  Town  for  RMB  350  million  (approximately  $67.1\n\nmillion) in 1H 2023. The expansive site will be developed into a landmark project, comprising about 650 premium residences, a Grade A o/ffice, retail spaces and a 214room luxury hotel. Early works have commenced with an estimated completion of the residential and commercial components in 2028 and 2029, respectively.\n\n## UK\n\nIn Chelsea, London, the Group has sold eight of the nine apartments to date, while 31 & 33 Chesham Street and Teddington Riverside are also attracting healthy enquiries. The Group's four other development projects in London the former Stag Brewery site in Mortlake, Ransome's Wharf, 28 Pavilion Road and Development House - are currently in various stages of planning approval.\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\n## Singapore\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group's o/ffice portfolio 3 committed occupancy stood at 97.1%, higher than the island-wide o/ffice occupancy of 90.1% 4 .\n\nRepublic Plaza, the Group's flagship Grade A o/ffice building was 97.0% committed and reported a positive rental reversion of 7.3% 5 in 2023. Similarly, the Group's other wholly-owned assets, such as City House and King's Centre were 99.4% and 100% occupied and achieved rental reversion of 5.1% 5 and 13.3% 5 respectively for 2023.\n\nSingapore's o/ffice market remained resilient in 2023 despite the geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. This was mainly due to the tight supply pipeline, given the delay in new supply completion and tenants seeking good quality spaces within the CBD.\n\nTo unlock value from its portfolio and realise GFA uplift through  various  Government  incentive  schemes,  the Group has progressed on the redevelopment of its former Fuji Xerox Towers (into Newport Plaza) and the former Central Mall and Central Square properties (into Union Square). When completed, these two mixed-use integrated developments will bolster the Group's o/ffice portfolio and enhance its recurring income.\n\nIn the same period, the Group's retail portfolio 6 registered a  committed  occupancy  of  97.6%,  above  the  islandwide retail occupancy rate of 93.5% 4 . City Square Mall, currently  undergoing  asset  enhancement  works,  was 98.0% committed as at 31 December 2023, achieving a rental reversion of 7.9% 5 for 2023, while Palais Renaissance achieved a committed occupancy of 98.0% with a rental reversion of 10.6% 5 in 2023. Over the past year, the retail market  has  improved  steadily,  driven  by  a  recovering tourism industry.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 3 Includes South Beach (in accordance with CDL's proportionate ownership). Excludes assets planned for redevelopment.\n- 4 Based on Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)'s real estate statistic for Q4 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince Q3 2023, the Group started on its two-phase AEI at City Square Mall, which will add about 26,000 sq ft of NLA to the mall via the Community/Sports Facilities Scheme (CSFS). The AEI involves decanting mechanical and electrical facilities  and  optimising  the  existing  GFA  to  improve operational e/fficiency. The first phase is already underway in the basement floors and is scheduled to complete in Q2 2024. The entire AEI is expected to complete by 1H 2025.\n\nUpon completion of the AEI, shoppers will be greeted with a diverse mix of new-to-market retailers. These enhanced retail o/fferings and refreshed shopper touchpoints will provide a better shopping experience. As at 31 December 2023, the space under the first phase was already 95% leased.\n\nSingapore continues to be an attractive regional financial hub  amidst  ongoing  geopolitical  tension.  Property consultants expect core CBD Grade A o/ffice rents to post modest rental growth for 2024 amid a higher supply of new o/ffice space and cautious business sentiment.\n\nFull tourism recovery is expected in 2024, with Singapore's status as a business and transit hub attracting event and concert organisers, leading to a strong pipeline of MICE events and sell-out concerts. However, high inflation and a weak macroeconomic environment could make travellers more prudent with their spending and travel plans. With higher demand and limited retail supply, retail rents are poised to have modest growth in 2024.\n\n## International\n\n## China\n\nIn Shanghai, Hong Leong Plaza Hongqiao and Hong Leong Hongqiao Center are 92% and 65% leased respectively. HLCC's  Grade  A  o/ffice  tower  is  94%  occupied,  above market occupancy at the SIP district of 83% as of FY 2023, while HLCC mall is 85% occupied.\n\nWith  increased  support  from  the  Chinese  government towards  the  real  estate  sector,  the  Group  is  exploring opportunities in cities like Shanghai, Suzhou and other key cities in the Yangtze River Delta and Greater Bay Area. These regions are becoming focal points for the Group's strategic initiatives, aligning with the broader growth trajectory of the real estate market in China.\n\n## Thailand\n\nThe  Group's  Jungceylon  Shopping  Center  in  Patong, Phuket, has completed its comprehensive asset enhancement works in Q4 2023 and has achieved a 90.0% committed occupancy as at 31 December 2023. In tandem with the gradual re-opening of the mall, the mall's shopper tra/ffic has gradually increased over the year. However, shopper tra/ffic for FY 2023 was still 67.0% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Shopper tra/ffic at the mall during the Lunar New Year period in 2024 was nearly triple that of the same period in 2023.\n\n## UK\n\nIn March 2023, the Group acquired the iconic landmark St Katharine Docks in Central London for \u00a3395 million (approximately $636 million), increasing the total value of its prime UK commercial assets, which include Aldgate House, 125 Old Broad Street and Development House to over \u00a31 billion, strengthening the Group's recurring income portfolio.\n\nThe  Group's  Central  London  o/ffice  portfolio  has  seen growing demand for well-located Grade A space in an increasingly constricted market. As at 31 December 2023, the  Group's  UK  o/ffice  portfolio  reported  a  committed occupancy of 91.3%, with over 84,000 sq ft of renewals/ lettings  or  under  o/ffers.  The  growth  is  supported  by enhanced sustainability credentials and AEIs that the Group has done for its portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## OPERATIONS AND MARKET REVIEW\n\nIn Central London, demand for well-located Grade A o/ffice space is expected to strengthen. With limited new supply beyond 2025, occupier demand is expected to drive healthy rental growth for the rest of 2024.\n\n## THE LIVING SECTOR\n\n## UK\n\nThe Private Rented Sector (PRS) in UK remained buoyant due to several factors, such as structural demand and supply imbalances and demographic and lifestyle shifts. Sub-sectors such as build-to-rent, co-living and student accommodation have demonstrated resilient rental growth and defensive qualities, providing stability and opportunities for investors.\n\nThe Junction, the Group's first PRS project in the UK, achieved full practical completion in Q4 2023, providing 665  build-to-rent  apartments  across  five  towers  and 24,000 sq ft of commercial space within the site's attractive heritage arches beneath a viaduct. Construction of The Octagon, a 370-unit PRS project located in the heart of Birmingham is in progress, and expected to complete by 2025.\n\nThe Group maintains a positive outlook on the sector and  has  continued  to  expand  its  global  living  sector portfolio. In November 2023, the Group acquired 1NQ, a forward-funding PRS development in Manchester, for \u00a375.6 million (approximately $125.7 million). The 261-unit freehold project is in the Northern Quarter and is expected to  complete  by  2026.  The  Group  also  completed  the acquisition of the 56,500 sqm Morden Wharf development in the Royal Borough of Greenwich with its JV partner for \u00a376.8 million (approximately $129.6 million). The proposed scheme will comprise 12 blocks of up to 36 storeys, with around 1,500 residential units as well as commercial and retail space.\n\nIn February 2024, the Group acquired Yardhouse, its first PRS  development  in  Central  London  for  \u00a388.0  million (approximately $148.6 million). The 250-year leasehold site will be developed into a 17-storey apartment with 209 coliving units with a gross floor area of 102,600 sq ft. The Group will forward-fund this PRS project, which is expected to complete in 2026.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor its 2,368-bed Purpose-Built Student Accommodation (PBSA)  portfolio  across  six  properties,  the  Group  took proactive steps to mitigate costs by improving operational e/fficiency and hedging the portfolio's utility contracts. The portfolio achieved occupancy of 97% for the Academic Year 2023/2024.\n\n## Japan\n\nIn September 2023, the Group invested in a portfolio of 25  quality  residential  assets  in  Tokyo's  rental  housing market. The Group also invested in four residential assets in Osaka, with two pending sale completions. With these investments, the Group's total PRS portfolio in Japan now comprises 38 assets (including three in the development pipeline), yielding a total of 2,101 units. The operational assets have an average occupancy rate of around 95% and stable income. Japan's PRS market continues to exhibit strong appeal, fuelled by a recovering economy, rising wages and a resurgence in net migration, boosting rental demand in key cities.\n\n## Australia\n\nThe Group has two PRS developments in the pipeline, comprising a total of 563 units. Construction started in Q3 2023 for its Southbank project in Melbourne, while its  Toowong  development  in  Brisbane  is  targeted  to commence construction in 1H 2024.\n\n## HOSPITALITY\n\nDue to the ongoing recovery and renewed confidence in global travel spurred by the easing of travel restrictions and the reopening of borders, the Group's hotels achieved stellar performance in FY 2023. Global RevPAR for the Group's  hotels  grew  25.3%  to  $168.7  for  FY  2023  (FY 2022: $134.6), exceeding 2019's pre-pandemic levels by 22.0%, primarily fuelled by strong average room rate (ARR) growth. All regions reflected positive trends and recorded extraordinary  RevPAR  growth  year-on-year  (y-o-y), especially Asia and Australasia.\n\nIn  Singapore,  the  Group's  hotels  experienced  a  19.9% increase in RevPAR y-o-y, boosted by higher room rates and strong trading volume during the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix in September 2023. For the Rest of Asia region, the hotels experienced a surge in occupancy throughout FY 2023, following the lifting of travel restrictions in key markets in Q4 2022. In Australasia, the Group's hotels showed a significant improvement of 57.3% as compared to FY 2022 due to higher occupancy and ARR.\n\nIn Europe, the Group's hotels maintained strong momentum in FY 2023, achieving RevPAR of $193.1, which is 10.5% and 45.0% higher than FY 2022 and FY 2019 respectively. The Biltmore Mayfair and Grand Hotel Palace Rome led the region in RevPAR growth with over 20% increase in RevPAR compared to the previous year.\n\nThe Group's US hotels performed exceptionally as well, achieving a RevPAR of $203.1, which was 22.0% higher than FY 2022 and 20.7% above FY 2019. New York hotels\n\nrecorded strong performance with an ARR of $354.9 and a high occupancy of 89.5%, resulting in a 16.5% increase in RevPAR compared to FY 2022.\n\nAligned with the Group's strategy to actively drive growth and expand its footprint in key gateway cities, the Group made three hotel acquisitions in FY 2023.\n\nIn  March  2023,  the  Group,  through  its  wholly-owned subsidiary Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) and in a 50:50 JV with its NZ-listed subsidiary Millennium & Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited, entered into a  Purchase  Sale  Agreement  and  Business  Asset  Sale Agreement to acquire the 416-key 5-star Sofitel Brisbane Central hotel for A$177.7 million (approximately $159.2 million). The acquisition was completed in December 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the Group acquired the 408-room Nine Tree Premier Hotel Myeongdong II, Seoul in July 2023. The hotel demonstrated strong performance with occupancy of 89.3% from August to December 2023 and its RevPAR was 29% higher than the same period in FY 2022. Over at Japan, driven by the robust recovery of its tourism industry, the newly acquired 256-room Bespoke Hotel Osaka Shinsaibashi achieved an occupancy of 91.0% and a remarkable GOP margin of 58.5% since its acquisition in August 2023.\n\nWith an emphasis on revenue generation and maximising asset yield, the Group continues to expand its footprint and improve its hospitality o/fferings through new build properties in key cities and by revitalising its assets through AEIs and repositioning e/fforts.\n\nIn 2023, the Group marked several hotel openings in China, Thailand and Singapore. The 294-room five-star M Social Suzhou opened in April 2023. Marking the Group's first M Social property in China, the hotel is located in HLCC within SIP.\n\nThe  former  Millennium  Resort  Patong  Phuket  has completed Phase 1 of its AEI and has been reflagged as M  Social  Phuket  since  November  2023.  Phase  2  has commenced and the 418-room hotel is expected to fully open in 1H 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn November 2023, the 204-room The Singapore EDITION hotel soft opened, marking the first EDITION property in Singapore  and  Southeast  Asia.  Located  along  Orchard Boulevard, the 6-storey boutique hotel includes a curated collection of restaurants and bars, a signature spa and a rooftop pool.\n\nMillennium  Downtown  New  York  is  scheduled  to commence a major US$43 million ($56.9 million) AEI in 2H 2024. The 569-key hotel will be reflagged as M Social Downtown New York. The Group will also invest about US$115  million  (approximately  $152.2  million)  to  build M Social Sunnyvale in California, US. Foundation work commenced in December 2023. This 263-room hotel is expected to fully open in 2H 2026.\n\nThe 222-room Millennium Hotel London Knightsbridge will also undergo a major AEI in 2H 2024 and be reflagged as M Social Knightsbridge, the Group's first M Social in the UK. Both hotels will continue to operate throughout the AEI periods and refurbishments are expected to complete in 1H 2025.\n\nOn the back of the recovery in global tourism, the hospitality segment expects to continue trading positively for FY 2024. The recent announcement of a visa-free agreement for Chinese tourists to visit Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand will further boost the hospitality market in these countries.\n\n## FUND MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  Group  is  actively  pursuing  its  fund  management growth strategy through organic and inorganic growth. The Group also owns a sizeable UK commercial portfolio and an enlarged Japan PRS portfolio across Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohama, generating stable recurring income. This expanded portfolio provides the Group with the flexibility to inject these assets into listed or unlisted platforms to drive AUM growth.\n\n## STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO RECALIBRATION\n\nDespite  the  ongoing  macroeconomic  challenges  and uncertainties  in  the  new  year,  the  Group  is  cautiously optimistic that business conditions will improve, especially if interest rates trend down progressively in the later part of 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, the Group will continue to execute on its GET Strategy, taking a prudent approach with new acquisitions  while  identifying  suitable  divestments  to recycle capital. The Group will enhance its operational e/fficiencies, pursue its fund management aspirations and drive  value  extraction  to  better  navigate  the  changing landscape of the real estate sector.",

        "page_content": "FINANCIALS\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of City Developments Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2023, the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policy information as set out on pages 122 to 269.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2023 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements ' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nValuation of hotel assets\n\n(Refer to note 4 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant hotel assets classified as property, plant and equipment which are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are subject to an annual assessment for impairment indicators. In undertaking the impairment assessment, the Group takes into consideration several factors, including the economic outlook, the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations undertaken (where applicable) and the trading performance of the properties. The properties with indicators of impairment are then subjected to a detailed impairment review whereby their recoverable amounts are estimated.\n\nThe Group uses a combination of internal and external valuations to estimate the recoverable amount of its properties identified as at risk of being impaired, which is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-inuse of these properties. The valuations are sensitive to key assumptions applied and a change in the assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amounts.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures included challenging the Group's assessment of the properties at risk of being impaired. These include comparing the actual asset performance to previous forecasts and to market data, and assessing the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations. For a sample of properties selected for a detailed impairment review, we considered the valuation methods used against those applied by valuers for similar property types. We evaluated the key assumptions applied in the valuations, particularly those assumptions relating to occupancy rates, average room rate growth, discount rates and terminal rates, by comparing them to available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors.\n\n## Our findings\n\nThe Group has a structured process in identifying hotel assets with impairment indicators. We found that the valuation method used was in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions applied were generally comparable to currently observable market data.\n\nValuation of development properties\n\n(Refer to note 13 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant residential development properties held for sale in Singapore, China and the United Kingdom (UK). Development properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The determination of the estimated net realisable value is highly dependent on the Group's expectations of future selling prices of unsold development properties.\n\nIn estimating the future selling prices of unsold development properties, the Group has taken into account real estate price trends, local market conditions, its development plans and sale strategies for the properties and selling prices estimated by external valuers when necessary.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe focused our work on development properties with low margins.\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of the Group's estimated future selling prices for its development projects, we considered recently transacted prices of units under development sold and/or prices of comparable properties located in the vicinity of the development projects, taking into account the prevailing market trends and the Group's development and selling plans for the properties. Where applicable, we made enquiries of the external valuers to understand the approach adopted in estimating the future selling prices of the development properties and performed sensitivity analysis.\n\n## Our findings\n\nWe found the Group's estimated future selling prices, which are used in determining the net realisable values and the resultant allowance for foreseeable losses on its development projects, to be comparable to currently available market data and have taken into consideration prevailing market conditions.",

Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nWe have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nResponsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act, SFRS(I)s and IFRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls su/fficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\nAuditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulations precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Lo Mun Wai.\n\nKPMG LLP Public Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\n## Singapore\n\n22 March 2024",

Ltd., a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThe  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Singapore  Financial  Reporting  Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). SFRS(I)s, issued by the Accounting Standards Council (Accounting Standards Committee under Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority with effect from 1 April 2023), comprises standards and interpretations that are equivalents to IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). All references to SFRS(I)s and IFRSs are subsequently referred to as SFRS(I) in the financial statements.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise described in the notes below.\n\n## 2.3 Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Company's functional currency. All financial information has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgement\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.",

This includes a team that regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments and reports to the Group Chief Financial Officer who has overall responsibility for all significant fair value measurements. If third party information, such as broker quotes or independent valuers' report, is used to measure fair values, then the team assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of SFRS(I), including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.\n\nSignificant valuation issues are reported to the Group's Audit & Risk Committee and Board of Directors.\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n- \u2022 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u2022 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u2022 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable\n\ninputs).\n\nIf the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).\n\nThe Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgement (cont'd)\n\nFurther information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:\n\nNote 5\n\nInvestment properties\n\nNote 39\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n\nNote 41\n\nFinancial instruments\n\n## 2.5 Changes in material accounting policies\n\n## (i) Accounting for financial guarantee contracts\n\nOn 1 January 2023, the Group changed its accounting policy with respect to the accounting of financial guarantee contracts. Prior to 1 January 2023, the Group had regarded financial guarantee contracts as insurance contracts under SFRS(I) 4 Insurance Contracts . SFRS(I) 17 Insurance Contracts replaces SFRS(I) 4 for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. On transition to SFRS(I) 17, the Group made an irrevocable election to apply SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments , on a contract-by-contract basis, to all financial guarantee contracts. Following the change in accounting policy, the Group accounts for the financial guarantees by measuring and recognising them at fair value. Subsequently, these guarantees are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with SFRS(I) 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of SFRS(I) 15.\n\nThis change in accounting policy was applied retrospectively. There was no impact on the statement of financial position and the opening accumulated profits as at 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022 as the carrying amount of the financial guarantee contracts was assessed to be negligible.\n\n## (ii) New accounting standards and amendments\n\nThe Group has applied the following amendments to SFRS(I) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: Deferred tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n- \u00b7 Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules\n- \u00b7 Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n- \u00b7 Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-8: Definition of Accounting Estimates\n\nOther  than  as  described  below,  the  application  of  these  amendments  to  accounting  standards  and interpretations did not have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nDeferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction\n\nThe Group has adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction from 1 January 2023. The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences - e.g. leases and decommissioning liabilities.\n\nFor leases, an entity is required to recognise the associated deferred tax assets and liabilities from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with any cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to accumulated profits or other components of equity at that date. For all other transactions, an entity applies the amendments to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented.",

Following the amendments, the Group has recognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-of-use assets. However, there was no impact on the statement of financial position because the balances qualify for offset under paragraph 74 of SFRS(I) 1-12. There was also no impact on the opening accumulated profits as at 1 January 2022 as a result of the change. The key impact for the Group relates to the disclosure of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised (see note 29).\n\nGlobal minimum top-up tax\n\nThe Group has adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules upon their release on 23 May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax that may arise from the jurisdictional adoption of the Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD'), and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two tax exposure.\n\nThe mandatory exception is effective immediately and applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to implement the top-up tax was enacted or substantively enacted at 31 December 2022 in any jurisdiction in which the Group operates and no related deferred tax was recognised at that date, the retrospective application has no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Material accounting policy information\n\nThe Group adopted Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies for the first time in 2023. Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nThe amendments require the disclosure of 'material', rather than 'significant', accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity-specific accounting policy information that users need to understand other information in the financial statements.\n\nManagement reviewed the accounting policies and made updates to the information disclosed in Note 3 Material accounting policy information (2022: Significant accounting policies) in certain instances in line with the amendments.\n\nIn 2021, the Group early adopted the Amendments to SFRS(I) 1 - 1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants which is effective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The amendments as issued in 2020 and 2022 aim to clarify the requirements on determining whether a liability is current or non-current, and require new disclosures for non-current liabilities that are subject to future covenants.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities, except as explained in note 2.5, which addresses changes in accounting policies.\n\nIn addition, the Group adopted the Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-1 and SFRS(I) Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies from 1 January 2023. The amendments require the disclosure of 'material', rather than 'significant', accounting policies. Although the amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in note 3 in certain instances (see note 2.5 for further information).\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Business combinations\n\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\n\nThe Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\n## Acquisitions from 1 January 2017\n\nFor acquisitions from 1 January 2017, the consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nThe consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are exchanged for awards held by the acquiree's employees (acquiree's awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service.\n\nFor non-controlling interests (NCI) that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation, the Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure them at fair value, or at the NCI's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at acquisition-date fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another standard.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity investments, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.",

The adjustments to NCI are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the adjustment to NCI and the fair value of consideration paid is recognised directly in equity and presented as part of equity attributable to owners of the Company.\n\n## Acquisitions before 1 January 2017\n\nAs part of transition to SFRS(I), the Group elected not to restate those business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to SFRS(I), i.e. 1 January 2017. Goodwill arising from acquisitions before 1 January 2017 has been carried forward from the previous FRS framework as at the date of transition.\n\n## (ii) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the NCI in a subsidiary are allocated to the NCI even if doing so causes the NCI to have a deficit balance.\n\n## (iii) Loss of control\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\n## (iv) Investments in associates and joint ventures (equity-accounted investees)\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over their financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds its investment in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment, together with any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nCITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation (cont'd)\n\n## (v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investee are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## (vi) Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures in the separate financial statements\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated in the Company's statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## 3.2 Foreign currencies\n\n## (i) Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at that date.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the dates that the fair values were determined. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss. However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in OCI:\n\n- \u00b7 differences arising on the translation of monetary items that in substance form part of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation;\n- \u00b7 an investment in equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);\n- \u00b7 a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; or\n- \u00b7 qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe  assets  and  liabilities  of  foreign  operations,  including  goodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising on acquisition, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.",

However, if the foreign operation is a non wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the Group's net investment in the foreign operation are recognised in OCI, and are presented in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.\n\n## 3.3 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, which includes capitalised borrowing costs, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nPurchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\n\nBorrowing costs paid and capitalised is presented as part of financing cash flows in the statement of cash flows.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised net in profit or loss.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent costs\n\nThe cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.\n\nDepreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.3 Property, plant and equipment (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Depreciation (cont'd)\n\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land (including 999-year leasehold land). For freehold and leasehold properties under development and renovation-in-progress, no depreciation is provided until these items have been completed.\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:\n\nFreehold buildings and leasehold land and buildings\n\n- \u2022 Core component of hotel buildings\n- -  50 years, or lease term if shorter\n- \u2022 Surface, finishes and services of hotel buildings\n- -  30 years, or lease term if shorter\n- \u2022 Leasehold land\n- -  Lease term\n\nFurniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements\n\n- -  3 to 20 years\n\nResidual values ascribed to the core component of hotel buildings depend on the nature, location and tenure of each hotel property. No residual values are ascribed to surface, finishes and services of hotel buildings and right-of-use assets in respect of leases where the Group is a lessee.\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date.\n\n## 3.4 Investment properties\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nInvestment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nAny gain and loss on disposal of investment properties (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amounts of the investment properties) are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (ii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an investment property.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated under the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case, the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe Group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; and\n- \u00b7 the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.5 Leases (cont'd)\n\n## As a lessee (cont'd)\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\nWhere the basis for determining future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nAt inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nTo classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\nThe Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments to the net investment in the lease (see note 3.11(i)). The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.\n\nThe Group recognises lease payments received from investment property under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'revenue'.",

All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, or minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost; FVOCI - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all a/ffected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Debt investments at FVOCI\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Equity investments at FVOCI\n\nOn initial recognition of certain equity investments that are not held for trading, the Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\n\n## Financial assets at FVTPL\n\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above (e.g. financial assets held for trading and those that are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis) are measured at FVTPL.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n## (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)\n\n## Financial assets: Business model assessment\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management.\n\nThe business models of the group are as follows:\n\nHeld to collect\n\nThe Group holds financial assets which arise from its property development business, hotel operations and investment properties. The objective of the business model for these financial instruments is to collect the amounts due from the Group's receivables and to earn contractual interest income on the amounts collected.\n\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;\n- \u00b7 terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;\n- \u00b7 prepayment and extension features; and\n- \u00b7 terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).\n\nA prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.",

Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nOther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost under the e/ffective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nTransferred assets are not derecognised when the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets.\n\nCITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Derecognition (cont'd)\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or when they expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. No immediate gain or loss is recognised. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- -the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- -the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. After that, the Group applies the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.\n\n## (iv) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, restricted cash is excluded whilst bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## (v) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.\n\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value and any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships.",

A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- \u00b7 the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nFor this purpose, the hedge designation was amended only to make one or more of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 designating an alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 updating the description of hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; or\n- \u00b7 updating the description of the hedging instrument.\n\nThe Group amended the description of the hedging instrument only if the following conditions were met:\n\n- \u00b7 it makes a change required by interest rate benchmark reform by using an approach other than changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedging instrument;\n- \u00b7 the chosen approach is economically equivalent to changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the original hedging instrument; and\n- \u00b7 the original hedging instrument is not derecognised.\n\nThe Group amended the formal hedge documentation by the end of the reporting period during which a change required by interest rate benchmark reform is made to the hedged risk, hedged item or hedging instrument. These amendments in the formal hedge documentation do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging relationship or the designation of a new hedging relationship.\n\nIf changes were made in addition to those changes required by interest rate benchmark reform described above, then the Group first considered whether those additional changes result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship. If the additional changes did not result in discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship, then the Group amended the formal hedge documentation for changes required by interest rate benchmark reform as mentioned above.\n\nWhen the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows had been based was changed as required by interest rate benchmark reform, for the purpose of determining whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the Group deemed that the hedging reserve recognised in OCI for that hedging relationship is based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be based.\n\nCITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n- 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n- (v) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)\n\n## Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform (cont'd)\n\nPhase 2 amendments: Replacement of benchmark interest rates - when there is no longer uncertainty arising\n\nfrom interest rate benchmark reform (cont'd)\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve remains in equity until it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial liabilities as hedges of foreign exchange risk on a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nWhen a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, respectively.\n\n## (vi) Share capital\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.

Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity.\n\nWhen the Company purchases its own preference shares and cancels them upon purchase, the consideration paid including any directly attributable incremental cost is deducted against the share capital account if the shares are purchased out of capital of the Company, or against the accumulated profits of the Company if the shares are purchased out of earnings of the Company.\n\n## 3.7 Development properties\n\nDevelopment properties are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes acquisition costs, development expenditure, capitalised borrowing costs (applicable to construction of a development for which revenue is to be recognised at a point in time) and other costs directly attributable to the development activities.\n\n## 3.8 Contract costs\n\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract for the sale of a development property are capitalised as contract costs only if (a) these costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract which the Group can specifically identify; (b) these costs generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and (c) these costs are expected to be recovered. Otherwise, such costs are recognised as an expense immediately.\n\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently amortised on a systematic basis as the Group recognises the related revenue on the contract. An impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of capitalised contract costs exceeds the expected remaining consideration less any directly related costs not yet recognised as expenses.\n\n## 3.9 Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets primarily relate to the Group's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on construction of development properties. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group invoices the customer.\n\nContract liabilities primarily relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 advance consideration received from customers; and\n- \u00b7 progress billings issued in excess of the Group's rights to the consideration.\n\nCITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.10 Impairment\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets\n\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost  ('cash  and  cash  equivalents'  and  'trade  and  other receivables');\n- \u00b7 debt investments measured at FVOCI (disclosed as part of 'financial assets'; see note 10 for further details);\n- \u00b7 contract assets (as defined in SFRS(I) 15);\n- \u00b7 lease receivables; and\n- \u00b7 financial guarantee contracts ('FGCs').\n\nLoss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or\n- \u00b7 Lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument or contract asset.\n\n## Simplified approach\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to provide for ECL for all trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets. The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\n## General approach\n\nThe Group applies the general approach to provide for ECL on all other financial instruments and FGCs. Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at initial recognition.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen  determining  whether  the  credit  risk  of  a  financial  asset  has  increased  significantly  since  initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.\n\nIf credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.",

Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the debtor;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default;\n- \u00b7 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\n## Presentation of ECL in the statement of financial position\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.\n\nLoss allowances for FGCs are recognised as a financial liability to the extent that they exceed the initial carrying amount of the FGC less the cumulated income recognised.\n\n## Write-off\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.10 Impairment (cont'd)\n\n## (ii) Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of an associate or joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with the requirements for non-financial assets. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and only to the extent that the recoverable amount increases.\n\n## (iii) Non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than development properties, contract costs, contract assets, consumable stocks and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets' recoverable amounts are estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date, and as and when indicators of impairment are identified. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nGoodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate or a joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.",

Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter, the assets, or disposal group, classified as held for sale are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.\n\nAny impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to financial assets and deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale are not depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classified as held for sale or distribution.\n\n## 3.12 Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group recognises remeasurement gains or losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Other long-term service benefits\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than defined contribution and defined benefit plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\nA provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.12 Employee benefits (cont'd)\n\n## (iv) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## 3.13 Provisions\n\nProvisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.\n\n## 3.14 Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantees are financial instruments issued by the Group that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantees issued are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with SFRS(I) 9 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of SFRS(I) 15.\n\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. ECLs are measured for financial guarantees issued as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.\n\n## 3.15 Revenue recognition\n\n## (i) Development properties for sale\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential and mixed development projects to customers through fixed-price contracts. Revenue is recognised when the control over a development property has been transferred to the customer. At contract inception, the Group assesses whether the Group transfers control of the residential project over time or at a point in time by determining if (a) its performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group; and (b) the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nWhere a development property has no alternative use for the Group due to contractual restriction, and the Group has enforceable rights to payment for performance completed to date arising from the contractual terms, revenue is recognised over time by reference to the Group's progress towards completing the construction of the development property. The measure of progress is determined based on the stage of completion of construction certified by quantity surveyors. Costs incurred that are not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a performance obligation are excluded from the measure of progress and instead are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn respect of contracts where the Group does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognised only when the completed property is delivered to the customer and the customer has accepted it in accordance with the sales contract.",

In adjusting for the financing component, the Group uses a discount rate that would reflect that of a separate financing transaction between the Group and its customer at contract inception. A finance income or finance expense will be recognised depending on the arrangement. The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for the existence of significant financing component when the period between the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer and the payment date is 12 months or less.\n\nRevenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the contract entered into with customers. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.\n\nThe customer is invoiced based on a payment schedule which is typically triggered upon achievement of specified construction milestones. If the value of the goods transferred by the Group exceeds the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the value of the goods transferred, a contract liability is recognised. The accounting policy for contract assets and contract liabilities is set out in note 3.9.\n\n## (ii) Rental income\n\nRental income (net of any lease incentives) is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental, are recognised as income in the accounting period in which it is earned and the amount can be reliably measured.\n\n## (iii) Hotel income\n\nRevenue from hotel operations comprises mainly room revenue and revenue from food and beverages sales. Room revenue is recognised over the period of stay of the hotel guests. Revenue from food and beverages sales is recognised when food and beverages are delivered to the customer.\n\n## (iv) Management services, consultancy services and laundry services\n\nManagement and consultancy fees and laundry services are recognised at the point when such services are rendered.\n\n## (v) Dividends\n\nDividend income is recognised in profit or loss when the shareholder's right to receive payment is established.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.16 Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are initially recognised as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the conditions for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised. In this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.\n\n## 3.17 Finance income and costs\n\nThe Group's finance income and costs include:\n\n- \u00b7 interest income on amounts owing by associates and joint ventures and funds invested;\n- \u00b7 interest expense on borrowings, amounts owing to fellow subsidiaries and joint ventures, financial derivatives and lease liabilities;\n- \u00b7 amortisation of transaction costs on borrowings capitalised;\n- \u00b7 the fair value gains or losses on financial derivatives;\n- \u00b7 the net gains or losses on financial assets at FVTPL;\n- \u00b7 the foreign currency gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 unwinding of discount on non-current liabilities.\n\nInterest income or expense is recognised under the effective interest method.\n\nThe 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:\n\n- \u00b7 the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or\n- \u00b7 the amortised cost of the financial liability.\n\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.",

Tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised for:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that\n- -is not a business combination and\n- -at the time of the transaction (i) affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and (ii) does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nThe measurement of deferred taxes reflects the consequences that follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)\n\n## 3.18 Income tax (cont'd)\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n\nGlobal minimum top-up tax\n\nThe Group has determined that the global minimum top-up tax - which it is required to pay under Pillar Two legislation - is an income tax in the scope of SFRS(I) 1-12. The Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred.\n\n## 3.19 Earnings per share\n\nThe Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the dilutive effect arising from the conversion of the non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares.\n\n## 3.20 Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the Group's Board of Directors and Group CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly tax assets and liabilities.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets.\n\n## 3.21 New accounting standards and interpretations not adopted\n\nA number of new accounting standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2023 and earlier application is permitted. Except as disclosed in note 2.5, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the new accounting standards and amendments to standards on its financial statements.",

Under this methodology, the fair value measurement reflects current market expectations about an efficient third party operator's future cash flows. The discounted cash flows method involves estimating each hotel's future cash flows and discounting the cash flows with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value, taking into consideration the assumptions in respect of revenue growth (principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth) and major expense items for each hotel. The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area, as well as the internal business plan for the hotel in the relevant market. These plans and forecasts include management's most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group sought guidance on the fair values of the hotels from independent external valuers with appropriate professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued. In relying on the valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation method and estimates are reflective of current market conditions. Certain valuation reports obtained from the external valuers have highlighted that a combination of global inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions and tightened lending conditions, has heightened the potential for greater volatility in property markets over the short to medium term.\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.\n\nIn 2023, the Group recognised a reversal of impairment loss of $54,037,000 primarily attributable to six hotels in United States of America (US) and one hotel in Europe. The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were reversed during the year were $977,411,000 as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the Group recognised a net reversal of impairment loss of $28,113,000 on certain hotel properties, comprising reversal of impairment losses of $33,778,000 on four hotels in United States of America (US) and three hotels in Europe, net of impairment losses made of $5,665,000 in respect of one hotel in New Zealand and a club in Asia. The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located. The impairment loss recognised on the club in Asia was a result of its weak financial performance. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were reversed or impaired during the year were $615,980,000 as at 31 December 2022.\n\nImpairment losses recognised or reversed were included in 'other operating expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the hotel operations segment.",

An increase in occupancy rate and/or average room rate growth in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in discount rate, terminal rate or capitalisation rate in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 5 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\n|                                                          | Note   | Group $'000   | Company $'000   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                                                     |        |               |                 |\n| At 1 January 2022                                        |        | 6,215,033     | 605,950         |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries, including acquisition costs | 39     | 387,791       | -               |\n| Additions                                                |        | 532,671       | 4,973           |\n| Disposal/Written off                                     |        | (111,747)     | -               |\n| Transfers to development properties                      |        | (90,685)      | -               |\n| Transfers from development properties                    |        | 8,179         | -               |\n| Transfers from property, plant and equipment             | 4      | 5,884         | 2,570           |\n| Disposal of subsidiaries                                 | 39     | (496,882)     | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation                 |        | (312,865)     | -               |\n| At 31 December 2022                                      |        | 6,137,379     | 613,493         |\n| At 1 January 2023                                        |        | 6,137,379     | 613,493         |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries, including acquisition costs | 39     | 635,489       | -               |\n| Additions                                                |        | 858,528       | 14,724          |\n| Disposal/Written off                                     |        | (53,109)      | (543,655)       |\n| Translation differences on consolidation                 |        | (4,210)       | -               |\n| At 31 December 2023                                      |        | 7,574,077     | 84,562          |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses           |        |               |                 |\n| At 1 January 2022                                        |        | 1,232,187     | 192,798         |\n| Charge for the year                                      |        | 115,954       | 14,204          |\n| Disposal/Written off                                     |        | (91,924)      | -               |\n| Transfers to development properties                      |        | (38,758)      | -               |\n| Disposal of subsidiaries                                 | 39     | (63,561)      | -               |\n| Impairment loss recognised                               |        | 35,728        | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation                 |        | (19,261)      | -               |\n| At 31 December 2022                                      |        | 1,170,365     | 207,002         |\n| At 1 January 2023                                        |        | 1,170,365     | 207,002         |\n| Charge for the year                                      |        | 115,012       | 13,810          |\n| Disposal/Written off                                     |        | (42,283)      | (192,096)       |\n| Impairment loss recognised                               |        | 43,749        | -               |\n| Translation differences on consolidation                 |        | (3,810)       | -               |\n| At 31 December 2023                                      |        | 1,283,033     | 28,716          |\n| Carrying amounts                                         |        |               |                 |\n| At 1 January 2022                                        |        | 4,982,846     | 413,152         |\n| At 31 December 2022                                      |        | 4,967,014     | 406,491         |\n| At 31 December 2023                                      |        | 6,291,044     | 55,846          |\n| Fair value                                               |        |               |                 |\n| At 1 January 2022                                        |        | 10,966,900    | 1,662,892       |\n| At 31 December 2022                                      |        | 10,899,043    | 1,820,028       |\n| At 31 December 2023                                      |        | 12,435,975    | 363,418         |",

Generally, each of the leases is fixed for a period of 1 to 30 years (2022: 1 to 16 years), and subsequent renewals are negotiated at prevailing market rates and terms.\n- (b) During 2023, the Company disposed of certain investment properties of net carrying amount of $349.0 million to subsidiaries of the Group for consideration of $1,482.8 million.\n- (c) During 2022, the Group transferred a portion of an investment property to development properties for redevelopment as residential units for sale. In addition, the Group transferred a development property to investment properties arising from inception of an operating lease for the property. The Group also disposed of certain investment properties arising from the deconsolidation of CDLHT following the distribution in specie of CDLHT units during the year (note 39).\n- (d) As at 31 December 2023, investment properties of the Group with a total carrying amount of $1,526,975,000 (2022: $1,236,481,000) were mortagaed to (i) certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to notes 22 and 23 for more details of the facilities); and (ii) a lessee as collateral for security deposit held of $3,700,000 (2022: Nil) which will be discharged on termination of lease.\n- (e) The Group undertook its annual review of the carrying amounts of investment properties for indicators of impairment. Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken. The cash generating units (CGU) are individual properties.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the investment properties, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach, and were estimated using the income capitalisation, standardised land value adjustment and residual methods (2022: income capitalisation, standardised land value adjustment and residual methods).\n\nBased on the impairment assessment undertaken in 2023, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $43,749,000  on  two  commercial  properties  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  and  one  commercial  project under construction in China. The impairment loss recognised during the year was mainly due to the higher capitalisation rates applied to the said commercial properties in UK amidst evaluated interest rate environment and the downturn in real estate market in China which remained challenging, along with higher than expected development costs incurred on the project in China.\n\n- In 2022, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $35,728,000 on one commercial property in UK, one purpose-built student accommodation in UK and one commercial project under construction in China. The impairment loss recognised in 2022 was mainly due to the increase in capitalisation rates arising from higher interest rates in UK and the subdued real estate market in China, along with higher than expected development costs incurred on the project in China.\n\nThe  impairment  loss  recognised  was  recognised  in  'other  operating  expenses'  and  the  investment properties segment.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 5 INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONT'D)\n\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts are set out below:\n\n## 2023\n\n|                                | China        | UK           |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Capitalisation rate            | N/A          | 5.5% to 6.0% |\n| Gross development value        | $113 million | N/A          |\n| Estimated cost to completion   | $12 million  | N/A          |\n| Price per square metre ('psm') | $707 psm     | N/A          |\n\n## 2022\n\n|                                | China        | UK           |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Capitalisation rate            | N/A          | 5.6% to 9.0% |\n| Rental rate per bed            | N/A          | $290         |\n| Gross development value        | $119 million | N/A          |\n| Estimated cost to completion   | $22 million  | N/A          |\n| Price per square metre ('psm') | $777 psm     | N/A          |\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. An increase in rental rate per bed, price psm or gross development value in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in capitalisation rate or estimated cost to completion in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.",

The fair values of certain investment properties located in Singapore are based on in-house valuations conducted by a licensed valuer who is also an officer of the Company. The internal valuer has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued.\n\nThe fair values of the investment properties were estimated using the direct comparison, discounted cash flow, income capitalisation, standardised land value adjustment and residual methods. The direct comparison method involves an analysis of comparable sales of similar properties and adjusting the transacted prices to those reflective of the investment properties of the Group. The discounted cash flow method involves the estimation and projection of an income stream over a period and discounting the income stream with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value. The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates. The standardised land value adjustment method considers the price of standard land in the current situation of development and utilisation, under normal market conditions within legal maximum use term as at a special date, that is assessed and approved by the local government. The residual method involves deducting the estimated cost to complete as of valuation date and other relevant costs from gross development value of the proposed development assuming satisfactory completion and accounting for developer's profit.\n\nThe fair value disclosure for the investment properties for the Group and the Company has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.\n\n## 6 ASSETS HELD FOR SALE\n\n|                               | Group 2022   | Group 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                               | 2023 $'000   | $'000        |\n| Assets held for sale          |              |              |\n| Property, plant and equipment | -            | 14,417       |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, assets held for sale related to the proposed disposal by an indirect subsidiary of the Group, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C), of Millennium Harvest House Boulder (which is in the hotel operations segment), to a third party for a sale consideration of $94.4 million.

In 2022, based on the assessment, the Company recognised a net impairment loss of $10,277,000 on its investments in four wholly-owned subsidiaries, following a decline in their financial position. The recoverable amounts of the subsidiaries were estimated taking into consideration the fair values of the underlying assets and the liabilities of the subsidiaries. The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe non-trade amounts owing by and to subsidiaries are unsecured. In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, interest was charged at 1.00% to 6.61% (2022: 1.00% to 4.98%) per annum and at 1.00% to 3.76% (2022: 1.00% to 3.00%) per annum respectively, as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe non-trade balances with subsidiaries that are presented as receivable or repayable within one year are receivable or repayable on demand. The non-trade amounts owing by subsidiaries receivable after one year are loans to subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. These amounts are, in substance, a part of the Company's net investments in subsidiaries.\n\nInformation about the Company's exposure to credit risk on the amounts owing by subsidiaries is included in note 41.",

In respect of these associates, management had assessed the recoverable amounts of the investments and determined that as their net asset values based on the latest available audited financial statements of the associates are higher than the carrying amount as at the reporting date, no impairment loss for these investments is considered necessary.\n\nThe movements in impairment losses in respect of investments in associates and amounts owing by associates are as follows:\n\n|                                          |            |            | Amounts owing by associates  Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired   | Amounts owing by associates  Lifetime ECL - not credit-impaired   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2023 $'000                                                        | 2022 $'000                                                        |\n| Group                                    |            |            |                                                                   |                                                                   |\n| At 1 January                             | 12,655     | 15,399     | 320                                                               | -                                                                 |\n| Impairment loss recognised               | -          | -          | 57                                                                | 339                                                               |\n| Impairment loss utilised                 | (9,480)    | (1,703)    | -                                                                 | -                                                                 |\n| Translation differences on consolidation | (175)      | (1,041)    | (15)                                                              | (19)                                                              |\n| At 31 December                           | 3,000      | 12,655     | 362                                                               | 320                                                               |\n\n## Accounting for investment in CDLHT\n\nIn May 2022, the Company distributed 144,191,823 units in CDLHT ('CDLHT units') that it held to its ordinary shareholders, which resulted in CDLHT, which was then a subsidiary, becoming an associate of the Group thereafter (notes 39 and 44). The Group's retained interest in CDLHT was remeasured to fair value and accounted for as a business combination, which required the purchase price to be allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent liabilities (purchase price allocation or 'PPA'). A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to CDLHT's underlying property portfolio comprising property, plant and equipment and investment properties, based on the valuation amounts in the valuation reports undertaken by an internal valuer with appropriate recognised professional qualifications and experience in the location and category of the properties being valued.\n\nThe valuations of the property, plant and equipment and investment properties involve judgement in determining both the valuation methods to be used and the key assumptions to be applied. The valuations were sensitive to the key assumptions applied and a change in assumptions may have a significant impact on the valuations.",

As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the issuer remained under bankruptcy reorganisation, and the bond remained unpaid and was fully impaired. The Group has no collateral in respect of this investment.\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment for debt investments at amortised cost during the year was as follows:\n\n|                                          | Lifetime ECL credit-impaired   | Lifetime ECL credit-impaired   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2023 $'000                     | 2022 $'000                     |\n| Balance as at 1 January                  | 309,488                        | 293,769                        |\n| Impairment loss recognised               | -                              | 18,015                         |\n| Translation differences on consolidation | (5,083)                        | (2,296)                        |\n| Balance as at 31 December                | 304,405                        | 309,488                        |\n\nThe Group undertook an impairment assessment of the investment in the bond.\n\n## 2023\n\nDuring 2023, discussions between the bankruptcy administrator, creditors of Sincere Property Group and potential investors were held. As at 31 December 2023, Sincere Property Group remained under bankruptcy reorganisation and no concrete reorganisation plan has been approved by the Chongqing No 5 Intermediate People's Court.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group assessed that the investment in the bond continued to be credit-impaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into consideration the latest developments on bankruptcy reorganisation of Sincere Property Group based on available information, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers that face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the investment in the bond remained fully impaired as at 31 December 2023.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 10 FINANCIAL ASSETS (CONT'D)\n\n## 2022\n\nDuring  2022,  certain  subsidiaries  within  Sincere  Property  Group  entered  into  consolidated  bankruptcy reorganisation in addition to Sincere Property which entered into bankruptcy reorganisation in 2021. As at 31 December 2022, discussions between the bankruptcy administrator, creditors of Sincere Property Group and potential investors were ongoing. The Group had filed its claims against Sincere Property with the bankruptcy administrator.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group assessed that the investment in the bond continued to be credit-impaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into consideration the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on available information, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a loss given default ('LGD') of 100% which was estimated based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group. The Group also considered the increased uncertainty surrounding the complex bankruptcy reorganisation with the passage of time, which posed challenges to the recovery of the investment in the bond.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an additional impairment of $18 million on the investment in the bond during 2022. As at 31 December 2022, the investment in the bond was fully impaired.\n\nAs the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property Group is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the investment in the bond. The ECL on the investment in the bond is also sensitive to the assumptions used. As the investment in bond has been fully impaired, any decrease in LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.",

The estimated selling prices are based on recent selling prices for the development project or comparable projects and prevailing property market conditions.

The most significant funds are described below:\n\n## United Kingdom (UK)\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a pension scheme for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993. The plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan, both with different categories of membership. The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time, rights to a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) under the defined contribution scheme also ceased. The plan entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment.\n\nThe contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2020 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2023. The contributions of the Group during the year were about 36.30% (2022: 36.30%) of pensionable salary.\n\nAs the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONT'D)\n\n## Taiwan\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2023. The contributions of the Group were no less than 6% (2022: 6%) of the employees' earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group. The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.\n\nThese defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.\n\nThe above plans are substantially funded by the Group's subsidiary. The funding requirements are based on pension funds' actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.\n\nThe assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions:\n\n|                           | 2023 UK   | 2023 Taiwan   | 2022 UK   | 2022 Taiwan   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Inflation rate            | 3.2%      | -             | 3.3%      | -             |\n| Discount rate             | 4.7%      | 1.4%          | 4.9%      | 1.5%          |\n| Rate of salary increase   | 3.7%      | 3.0%          | 3.8%      | 3.0%          |\n| Rate of pension increases | 3.0%      | -             | 3.1%      | -             |\n| Rate of revaluation       | 2.8%      | -             | 2.8%      | -             |\n\nThe methodology for computing the discount rate is the yield range method.\n\nThe assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. The present values of the schemes' liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in one of the relevant actuarial assumptions by one percent, holding other assumptions consistent.\n\n|                         | Defined benefit obligation   | Defined benefit obligation   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                         | 1 percent  increase $'000    | 1 percent  decrease $'000    |\n| Group                   |                              |                              |\n| 2023                    |                              |                              |\n| Discount rate           | (8,941)                      | 10,677                       |\n| Rate of salary increase | 676                          | (614)                        |\n| 2022                    |                              |                              |\n| Discount rate           | (9,329)                      | 11,781                       |\n| Rate of salary increase | 912                          | (683)                        |",

The potential exposure, if any, to Pillar Two income taxes is currently not known or reasonably estimable. The Group continues to assess the impact of the Pillar Two legislation on its financial and has engaged tax consultants to assist the Group in the impact assessment.\n\nThe Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impact of the top-up tax and will accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred (see note 2.5).\n\n## 34 EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n## Basic earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated based on:\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | Group      | Group      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                                                                                   | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 |\n| Profit attributable to owners of the Company                                                                                      | 317,313    | 1,285,322  |\n| Less:                                                                                                                             |            |            |\n| Dividends on non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares                                                          | (12,254)   | (12,904)   |\n| Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders after adjustment for non-redeemable  convertible non-cumulative preference dividends | 305,059    | 1,272,418  |\n\n|                                                            | Group                  | Group                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                            | 2023 Number of  shares | 2022 Number of  shares |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares                 |                        |                        |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares during the year | 906,901,330            | 906,901,330            |\n| Basic earnings per share                                   | 33.6 cents             | 140.3 cents            |",

Some leases provide for additional rent payments that are based on changes in local price indices. For certain leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub-lease arrangements.\n\nThe leases for hotel properties were entered into many years ago as combined leases of land and buildings.\n\nThe Group also leases IT equipment and motor vehicles under a number of leases.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2023 $'000   | 2022 $'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                                     | 25,320       | 20,127       |\n| Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets presented in 'revenue'                                | -            | 4,015        |\n| Expenses relating to short-term leases                                                            | 2,650        | 5,305        |\n| Expenses relating to variable lease payments                                                      | 41,519       | 23,976       |\n| Expenses relating to leases of low-value assets, excluding short-term leases of low- value assets | 322          | 181          |\n\n## Amounts recognised in statement of cash flows\n\n|                               | 2023 $'000   | 2022 $'000   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Payment of lease liabilities  | 24,701       | 26,032       |\n| Interest expense              | 25,320       | 20,127       |\n| Total cash outflow for leases | 50,021       | 46,159       |",

Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\n\nThe Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension options, would result in an increase in lease liabilities of $37.8 million (2022: $32.5 million).\n\n## Leases as lessor\n\nThe Group leases out its investment properties consisting of its owned properties as well as leased properties (see note 5). All leases are classified as operating leases from a lessor perspective.\n\n## Operating lease\n\nThe Group and the Company lease out some of their investment properties and development properties. The Group has classified these leases as operating leases, because they do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. Note 5 sets out information about the operating leases of investment properties.\n\nRental income from investment properties and property subleases recognised by the Group during 2023 was $436,380,000 (2022: $328,830,000).\n\nContingent rents generally determined based on a percentage of tenants' revenue, of $14,760,000 (2022: $2,533,000) has been recognised as revenue by the Group, in profit or loss during the year.\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease rental receivables, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\n|                      | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 |\n| Less than one year   | 272,875    | 253,196    | 8,361      | 52,908     |\n| One to two years     | 193,978    | 189,243    | 4,974      | 35,071     |\n| Two to three years   | 128,925    | 125,151    | 1,993      | 14,159     |\n| Three to four years  | 82,308     | 79,738     | 317        | 2,171      |\n| Four to five years   | 62,975     | 55,657     | 44         | 499        |\n| More than five years | 149,164    | 117,699    | -          | -          |\n| Total                | 890,225    | 820,684    | 15,689     | 104,808    |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 36 LEASES (CONT'D)\n\n## Leases as lessor (cont'd)\n\nIncluded in the non-cancellable operating lease rental receivables above are commitments with related parties which are set out below.\n\n|                                                           | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                           | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 |\n| Non-cancellable operating lease rentals receivable  from: |            |            |            |            |\n| - associates                                              | 27,921     | 27,309     | -          | 333        |\n| - joint ventures                                          | 169        | 259        | -          | -          |\n| - a fellow subsidiary                                     | 277        | 625        | -          | 625        |\n| - subsidiaries                                            | -          | -          | -          | 1,294      |\n|                                                           | 28,367     | 28,193     | -          | 2,252      |\n\n## 37 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n## (i) Commitments\n\nThe Group and the Company have the following commitments as at the reporting date:\n\n|                                                                                                           | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                                                           | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 |\n| Development expenditure contracted but not  provided for in the financial statements                      | 743,324    | 578,002    | -          | -          |\n| Capital expenditure contracted but not  provided for in the financial statements                          | 608,868    | 59,860     | -          | -          |\n| Commitments in respect of purchase of  properties for which deposits have been  paid                      | 121,780    | 3,401      | -          | -          |\n| Commitments in respect of investments in a  joint venture and associates                                  | 95,810     | 114,881    | -          | -          |\n| Commitments in respect of capital  contribution to investments in financial  assets in: - related parties |            |            |            |            |\n|                                                                                                           | 21,758     | 88,799     | -          | -          |\n| - third parties                                                                                           | 16,628     | 19,969     | -          | -          |\n\n## (ii) Contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has claims arising in the ordinary course of business which are being contested, the outcome of which are not presently determinable.

Management is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. Management reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Group has a system of controls in place to maintain an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. Management continually monitors the Group's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial years, the Group's policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes except for its use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost efficient.\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers, amounts owing by associates and joint ventures, other receivables and debt investments.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $374.0 million (2022: $382.7 million) (note 16) and subscribed for a bond of $304.4 million (2022: $309.5 million) (note 10) issued by Sincere Property Group. As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the amounts owing by HCP Group and the investment in bond were fully impaired. In addition, the amounts owing by subsidiaries and joint ventures represent 93% (2022: 92%) of the Company's financial assets.\n\nExcept as disclosed, there is no significant concentration of credit risk for the Group and the Company. The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the Group's and the Company's maximum exposures to credit risk, before taking into account any collateral held.",

Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets.\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk from trade receivables by collecting deposits as collateral, where possible. For trade receivables and contract assets relating to sale of development properties, if a purchaser defaults on payments, the Group may enforce payments via legal proceedings or if the purchaser is assessed to be insolvent, the Group may take possession of the units, retain a portion of the sales consideration, and resell the property.\n\nIn monitoring customer credit risk, the Group considers the trade history of the customers with the Group, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.\n\n## Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables and contract assets at the reporting date by business segment is set out below:\n\n|                       | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                       | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 | 2023 $'000 | 2022 $'000 |\n| Property development  | 2,574,892  | 1,887,697  | 6,261,613  | 5,796,323  |\n| Hotel operations      | 150,784    | 212,276    | 1,468,348  | 2,176,094  |\n| Investment properties | 140,995    | 130,205    | 3,456,272  | 1,436,920  |\n| Others                | 59,213     | 48,327     | 3,155,365  | 3,494,252  |\n|                       | 2,925,884  | 2,278,505  | 14,341,598 | 12,903,589 |\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (i) Credit risk (cont'd)\n\n## Expected credit loss assessment on trade receivables\n\nThe Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from individual customers, which comprise a very large number of small balances.\n\nLoss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past 3 years (2022: 3 years). These rates are adjusted to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.\n\nThe following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables and accrued receivables as at reporting date:\n\n|                            | Group Gross carrying  amount $'000   | Impairment loss  allowance $'000   | Gross carrying  amount $'000   | Company Impairment loss  allowance $'000   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2023                       |                                      |                                    |                                |                                            |\n| Current (not past due)     | 199,178                              | 13,172                             | 196                            | -

As at 31 December 2023, Sincere Property Group remained under bankruptcy reorganisation and no concrete reorganisation plan has been approved by the Chongqing No 5 Intermediate People's Court.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group continued to be credit-impaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into consideration the latest developments on bankruptcy reorganisation of Sincere Property Group based on available information, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers that face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the amounts owing by HCP Group remained fully impaired as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## 2022\n\nDuring 2022, certain subsidiaries within Sincere Property Group entered into consolidated bankruptcy reorganisation in addition to Sincere Property which entered into bankruptcy reorganisation in 2021. As at 31 December 2022, discussions between the bankruptcy administrator, creditors of Sincere Property Group and potential investors were ongoing. The Group had filed its claims against Sincere Property with the bankruptcy administrator.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group continued to be credit-impaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into consideration the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on available information, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (i) Credit risk (cont'd)\n\nImpairment of amounts owing by HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n## 2022 (cont'd)\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a loss given default ('LGD') of 100% which was estimated based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group. The Group also considered the increased uncertainty surrounding the complex bankruptcy reorganisation with the passage of time, which posed challenges to the recovery of the amounts owing by HCP Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an additional impairment of $62.7 million on the amounts owing by HCP Group during 2022. As at 31 December 2022, the amounts owing by HCP Group was fully impaired.\n\nAs the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property Group is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group. As the amounts owing by HCP Group have been fully impaired, any decrease in LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.\n\n## Non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nThe Group and the Company held non-trade receivables from its associates and joint ventures which were lent to associates and joint ventures to meet their funding requirements. In addition, the Company held nontrade receivables from its subsidiaries which were lent to the subsidiaries to meet their funding requirements. Impairment on these balances has been measured on the 12-month and lifetime expected loss basis. Except as disclosed above, the Group uses an approach that is based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default, including but not limited to, financial statements of the entities, and applying credit judgement. The amount of allowance on the non-trade amounts due from associates was negligible. The amounts of the allowances on the non-trade amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are set out in notes 7, 8 and 9 respectively.\n\n## Debt investments\n\nThe exposure to credit risk for debt investments at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows:\n\n|           | Mandatorily  at FVTPL   | At amortised cost Lifetime   | At amortised cost Lifetime   | At amortised cost Lifetime   |\n|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|           | Carrying  amount $'000  | Gross   amount               | ECL (credit  impaired)       | Carrying  amount             |\n|           |                         | $'000                        | $'000                        | $'000                        |\n| 2023      |                         |                              |                              |                              |\n| China     | -                       | 304,405                      | (304,405)                    | -                            |\n| 2022      |                         |                              |                              |                              |\n| China     | -                       | 309,488                      | (309,488)                    | -                            |\n| Australia | 20,011                  | -                            | -                            | -                            |\n|           | 20,011                  | 309,488                      | (309,488)                    | -                            |",

These guarantees are subject to the impairment assessment under SFRS(I) 9. Management continually monitors credit risk and considers events such as default on instalment payments by buyers and performs credit evaluation on the associate. At the reporting date, the Group did not recognise any liabilities in respect of the financial guarantees granted in view of remote default risk.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are only entered into with bank and financial institution counterparties with sound credit ratings.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties with sound credit ratings.\n\nImpairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The amount of the allowance on cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 was negligible.\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's objective when managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed adequate by management to finance the Group's operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group has provided financial guarantees in favour of an associate and buyers of overseas development properties. At the reporting date, the maximum of the Group's exposure in respect of the financial guarantees issued was $22.7 million (2022: $51.1 million). As at 31 December 2022, the Company's maximum exposure to financial guarantees provided for borrowings of a subsidiary amounted to $231.0 million. The financial guarantee was discharged on 31 March 2023.\n\nThe Group has contractual commitments to incur capital expenditure on its property, plant and equipment and investment properties, purchase properties and to invest in joint ventures, associates and investees (see note 37).\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk (cont'd)\n\nThe following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities. The amounts are gross and undiscounted, and include contractual interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements:\n\n|                                         | Carrying  amount $'000   | Contractual  cash flows $'000   | Within  1 year $'000   | After 1 year  but within  5 years $'000   | After  5 years $'000   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Group                                   |                          |                                 |                        |                                           |                        |\n| 31 December 2023                        |                          |                                 |                        |                                           |                        |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities    |                          |                                 |                        |                                           |                        |\n| Interest-bearing borrowings             | 11,625,933               | (12,349,157)                    | (3,922,664)            | (8,262,401)                               | (164,092)              |\n| Lease liabilities                       | 670,940                  | (1,253,934)                     | (48,580)               | (171,705)                                 | (1,033,649)            |\n| Trade and other payables^               | 1,243,826                | (1,270,844)                     | (1,270,844)            | -

The cash inflows/(outflows) disclosed represent the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to derivative financial instruments held for risk management purposes and which are usually not closed out prior to contractual maturity. The disclosure shows net cash flow amounts for derivatives that are net cash-settled and gross cash inflow and outflow amounts for derivatives that have simultaneous gross cash settlement e.g. forward exchange contracts. Netsettled derivative financial assets are included in the maturity analyses as they are held to hedge the cash flow variability of the Group's floating rate loans.\n\nThe interest payments on variable interest rate loans and bonds and notes in the table above reflect market forward interest rates at the period end and these amounts may change as market interest rates changes. It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.\n\n## (iii) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations. The Group adopts a policy of managing its interest rate exposure by maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost of variable rate borrowings is considered to outweigh the benefits of their flexibility, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts.\n\nThe Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.",

The Group had exposures to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR on its financial instruments that have been replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. In 2023, the Group has undertaken amendments to its financial instruments with contractual terms indexed to USD LIBOR or SGD SOR such that they incorporate the new benchmark rates.\n\n## Non-derivative financial liabilities\n\nHistorically, the Group's IBOR exposures to non-derivative financial liabilities included secured and unsecured borrowings indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR. The Group has modified its non-derivative financial liabilities indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR to reference SOFR and SORA during the year ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 respectively.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group holds interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps for risk management purposes. The interest rate swaps have floating legs that are indexed to SORA and SONIA. The Group's derivative instrument are governed by contracts based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)'s master agreements.\n\n## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments\n\nThe Group has fixed rate debt instruments measured at FVTPL. A change in interest rates at the reporting date would not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points (bp) in interest rates on the variable rate instruments held by the Group and the Company at the reporting date would have decreased profit or loss (before any tax effect) by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant and does not take into account the effect of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation.\n\n|                                | Group                   | Group                   | Company                 | Company                 |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                | 31 December  2023 $'000 | 31 December  2022 $'000 | 31 December  2023 $'000 | 31 December  2022 $'000 |\n| 100 bp increase                |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| Reduction in profit before tax | (55,041)                | (48,872)                | (14,075)                | (19,778)                |\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)\n\n## (iii) Market risk (cont'd)\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Australian Dollar, Sterling Pound, Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Euro, Thai Baht and New Zealand Dollar.\n\nThe Group has a decentralised approach to the management of foreign currency risk. The Group manages its foreign currency exposure by adopting a natural hedge policy of matching receipts and payments, and asset purchases and borrowings, in the currency of the relevant entity, where possible. Entities in the Group may have different approaches to the identification and management of this risk. Entities in the Group may borrow in currencies other than their functional currencies to fund investments that are denominated in their borrowing currencies. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group's policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances. Where feasible, the Group may put in place certain financial derivative instruments including forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to minimise the Group's exposure to movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions.\n\nThe Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nIn these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; and\n- \u00b7 Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.",

The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Company's functional currency, which causes the amount of the net investments to vary in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The hedged risk in the net investment hedges is the risk of a weakening of the United States Dollar, Euro, Renminbi and Japanese Yen (2022: United States Dollar, Euro and Renminbi) against Singapore Dollar that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of the Group's net investments in subsidiaries. An economic relationship exists between the hedged net investment and hedging instrument due to the shared foreign currency risk exposure.",

When the hedging instrument is foreign currency-denominated debt, the Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in spot rate (the offset method). The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal. When the hedging instrument is a forward exchange contract or cross-currency swap, the Group establishes a hedge ratio where the notional on the forward foreign exchange contract and cross-currency swap matches the carrying amount of the designated net investment. The Group ensures that the foreign currency in which the hedging instrument is denominated is the same as the functional currency of the net investment. This qualitative assessment is supplemented quantitatively using the hypothetical derivative method for the purposes of assessing hedge effectiveness. The Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the fair value of the derivative with changes in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative is constructed to have the same critical terms as the net investment designated as the hedged item and a fair value of zero at inception.

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Property development - develops and purchases properties for sale\n- \u00b7 Hotel operations - owns and manages hotels\n- \u00b7 Investment properties develops and purchases investment properties for lease\n\nOthers comprises mainly investment in shares, management and consultancy services, and provision of laundry services. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2023 and 2022.\n\nInformation regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n\n## Information about reportable segments\n\n|                                                   | Property  development $'000   | Hotel  operations $'000   | Investment properties $'000   | Total $'000   | Others $'000   | Total $'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 2023                                              |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| Total revenue (including   inter-segment revenue) | 2,792,570                     | 1,498,700                 | 460,057                       | 4,751,327     | 234,001        | 4,985,328     |\n| Inter-segment revenue                             | -                             | (185)                     | (10,569)                      | (10,754)      | (33,453)       | (44,207)      |\n| External revenue                                  | 2,792,570                     | 1,498,515^                | 449,488                       | 4,740,573     | 200,548        | 4,941,121     |\n| Profit from operating activities                  | 382,327                       | 302,979                   | 113,286                       | 798,592       | 19,936         | 818,528       |\n| Share of after-tax profit/                        |                               |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| (loss) of associates and joint  ventures          | 78,467                        | 2,074                     | (27,808)                      | 52,733        | (5,085)        | 47,648        |\n| Finance income                                    | 50,284                        | 27,663                    | 17,679                        | 95,626        | 2,344          | 97,970        |\n| Finance costs                                     | (171,546)                     | (144,152)                 | (143,936)                     | (459,634)     | (31,944)       | (491,578)     |\n| Net finance costs                                 | (121,262)                     | (116,489)                 | (126,257)                     | (364,008)     | (29,600)       | (393,608)     |\n| Reportable segment profit/ (loss) before tax      | 339,532                       | 188,564                   | (40,779)                      | 487,317       | (14,749)       | 472,568       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                     | 5,004                         | 111,176                   | 118,456                       | 234,636       | 19,394         | 254,030       |",

Ltd. (Cityview), the Group has determined that it does not have control over Cityview upon the sale of cash flows in Cityview in 2014 as described below. The Group has significant influence in Cityview through Sunbright Holdings Limited (Sunbright). Accordingly, Cityview is classified as an associate of the Group.\n\nOn 15 December 2014, Baynes Investment Pte. Ltd. (Baynes), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, sold the Dividends (as defined in the sale and purchase agreement) in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cityview, to Sunbright.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria Holdings Limited (Astoria), subscribed for 37.5% interest in a capital instrument called profit participation securities (PPS) issued by Sunbright (comprising 33.3% interest in residential component (Residential Component) and 49% interest in non residential component (Non-Residential Component)). The Group will receive from Sunbright the cash flows purchased from Baynes (after satisfying certain senior ranking liabilities, including capital contributions from the other third party investors (the Third Party Investors) in accordance with a pre-agreed order of priority as set out under the terms of the PPS. In addition, shares of Baynes with an investment amount of $1,502,000 (2022: $1,502,000) was pledged to Sunbright.\n\nUnder the Investors' Agreement between Astoria, Third Party Investors and Sunbright, the management of the affairs of Sunbright and its subsidiaries are delegated to the Residential Investment Committee and Non-Residential Investment Committee. The Group had determined that it had significant influence over Sunbright because of its representation on the Investment Committees. Accordingly, Sunbright was considered an associate of the Group.\n\nIn April 2019, the Group, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria, acquired the remaining PPS units in the Non-Residential component of Sunbright, which held W Hotel and Quayside Isle. Following the acquisition, the Group has power over the relevant activities of the Non-Residential Component, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group.\n\nIn October 2023, Astoria subscribed for 20% of shareholding in Lion Heritage 2 (B.V.I) Limited (LH2), along with a third party investor subscribing for the remaining 80% interest in LH2. LH2 is classified as an associate of the Group. LH2, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Lion Heritage 3 (B.V.I.) Limited (LH3), acquired the remaining PPS units in the Residential Component that the Group does not own from the then-existing third party investor. Following the acquisition, the Group continues to have an interest in the Residential Component from Astoria's 33.3% direct interest in the Residential Component, and has an indirect interest in the Residential Component from Astoria's 20% interest in LH2. The Group continues to have significant influence over the Residential Component through its representation in the Residential Component's Investment Committee, which has not changed. Accordingly, the Residential Component remains as an associate of the Group.\n\n- (b) CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (H-REIT), a real estate investment trust, and CDL Hospitality Business Trust (HBT), a business trust. H-REIT has an investment strategy of investing directly or indirectly, in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate which is primarily used for hospitality, hospitality-related and other accommodation and/or lodging purposes, whether wholly or partially, and real-estate related assets in relation to the foregoing.\n\nHBT is a business trust which currently acts as master lessee, asset owner and hotel operator. HBT may also undertake certain hospitality, hospitality-related and other accommodation and/or lodging development projects, acquisition and investments which may not be suitable for H-REIT.\n\nPrior to 26 May 2022, although the Group owned less than half of the ownership interest and voting power in CDLHT, management had determined that the Group had control over CDLHT. The activities of H-REIT and HBT are managed by the Group's subsidiaries, M & C REIT Management Limited (H-REIT Manager) and M & C Business Trust Management Limited (HBT Trustee-Manager), respectively. The H-REIT Manager has decision-making authority over H-REIT, subject to oversight by the trustee of H-REIT. The HBT Trustee-Manager has dual responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the HBT unitholders and decision-making authority over HBT. The Group's overall exposure to variable returns, both from H-REIT Manager's and HBT Trustee-Manager's remuneration from H-REIT and HBT, respectively, together with its interest in CDLHT, was significant and any decisions made by H-REIT Manager and HBT Trustee-Manager affect the Group's overall exposure.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the Group distributed in specie part of the CDLHT units that it held, to the Company's ordinary shareholders (notes 35 and 39) thereby reducing its interest in CDLHT to 27% . The Group has assessed that the reduction in interest in CDLHT has resulted in the Group no longer having control of CDLHT. Accordingly, CDLHT was deconsolidated and accounted for as an associate thereafter.\n\nBritish Virgin Islands\n\n50\n\n50\n\n- (c) Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in the investee, pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the investee. Accordingly, the investee is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (d) Although the Group holds less than 50% voting interest in the IREIT Global Group Pte. Ltd. (IREIT Manager), pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in the IREIT Manager, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the IREIT Manager. Accordingly, the IREIT Manager is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n\nThe Group does not consider the above associates and joint ventures to be individually material to the Group under the context of SFRS(I) 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities .\n\n## 45 SUBSEQUENT EVENT\n\nOn 6 February 2024, the Group, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, White City Investments Limited, entered into a development funding agreement to acquire Yardhouse, a private rented sector development in Central London, for $148.6 million (\u00a388.0 million), comprising land purchase and construction in staged payments as construction progress. The Group will fund the land purchase and construction in staged payments as construction progresses through internal cash resources and bank loans.\n\nFINANCIALS\n\n## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nYEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023",

Ms Chan is considered independent for the purposes of Rule 704(8) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST.\n- 7. The Ordinary Resolution set out in item 6 of the Special Business above, if passed, will empower the Directors of the Company from the date of the Meeting until the next AGM (unless such authority is previously revoked or varied at a general meeting), to issue Ordinary Shares and/or make or grant Instruments that might require new Ordinary Shares to be issued up to a number not exceeding 50% of the total number of issued Ordinary Shares, excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings, of the Company, of which up to 10% may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders. The aggregate number of Ordinary Shares which may be issued under this Ordinary Resolution will be calculated based on the total number of issued Ordinary Shares, excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings, of the Company at the time that this Ordinary Resolution is passed, after adjusting for new Ordinary Shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which are outstanding or subsisting at the time this Ordinary Resolution is passed and any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of Ordinary Shares.\n- 8. The Ordinary Resolution set out in item 7 of the Special Business above, if passed, will empower the Directors of the Company to make purchases or otherwise acquire the Company's issued Ordinary Shares and/or Preference Shares (collectively, the 'Shares') from time to time subject to and in accordance with the guidelines set out in Annexure I of the Letter to Shareholders. This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, unless previously revoked or varied at a general meeting or when such purchases or acquisitions are carried out to the full extent mandated.\n\nThe Company intends to use internal resources and/or external borrowings to finance purchases or acquisitions of its Shares under the Share Purchase Mandate. The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits of the Company, the aggregate number of Shares purchased or acquired, the consideration paid at the relevant time and whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.\n\nBased on the existing number of issued Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares of the Company as at 29 February 2024 (the 'Latest Practicable Date') (disregarding the Ordinary Shares held in treasury), the exercise in full of the Share Purchase Mandate would result in the purchase of 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares (representing 10% of the total number of issued Ordinary Shares of the Company, disregarding the Ordinary Shares held in treasury) and 29,778,683 Preference Shares (representing 10% of the total number of issued Preference Shares of the Company).\n\nIn the case of Market Purchases and Off-Market Purchases by the Company and assuming that the Company purchases or acquires 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price of $6.28 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 105% of the Average Closing Price as at the Latest Practicable Date) and 29,778,683 Preference Shares at the Maximum Price of $1.04 for one Preference Share (being the price equivalent to 105% of the Average Closing Price as at the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required for the purchase or acquisition of 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares and 29,778,683 Preference Shares is approximately $569.5 million and $31.0 million respectively.\n\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Shares pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 based on these assumptions are set out in paragraph 3.5 of Annexure I of the Letter to Shareholders.\n\n- 9.

The IPT Mandate will continue in force until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, unless previously revoked or varied at a general meeting.\n\nVoting restriction pursuant to Rule 921(7) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST\n\nHong Leong Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries, the Directors of the Company and their associates, who are also shareholders of the Company and being Interested Persons under the IPT Mandate, are required to abstain from voting at the Meeting in respect of the Ordinary Resolution set out in item 8 in relation to the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\n## IMPORTANT INFORMATION:\n\n## Format of Meeting\n\nAttendees are required to bring along their NRIC/Passport so as to enable the Company to verify their identities.\n\n- 1.
