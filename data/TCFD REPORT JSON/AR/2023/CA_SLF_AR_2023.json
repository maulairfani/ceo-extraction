Through DentaQuest's case management program, William and his wife were identified as high-risk members in their underserved community.\n\nWhen case manager Kerri contacted them, they both urgently needed dental care, while also dealing with other health complications. William was focused on his ailing wife and had neglected his own well-being.\n\nIn her role, Kerri routinely coordinates oral health care and other medical needs for members. She helped William get the right services for pain management when his wife's diagnosis became terminal, and provided a kind yet persistent reminder that his own health was also important.\n\nLosing his wife was devastating. Kerri's compassion and outreach helped William address his own health and wellbeing, enabling access to the medical and oral health services he needed and providing encouragement to take an active role to live a healthier life.\n\n'Kerri is more than our case manager. She's my friend and she stuck with me. I had to get all my other health issues sorted first, and she helped with all of it, so that we could then treat my dental problems.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

It spurs our economy forward, fuels innovation, supports technology development, enables meaningful Client experiences, contributes to purposeful work, and supports investment. Bottom line - business growth creates a positive impact for all Sun Life stakeholders.\n\nThis theme was Sun Life's 2023 story as we delivered solid results, ending the year with strong performance.\n\nFollowing the adoption of IFRS 17/9 financial standards, Sun Life's diversified business model contributed to solid performance against our medium-term financial objectives. Underlying earnings per share (EPS) growth was above target at 11% in 2023. And on a two-year basis, underlying return on equity (ROE) was 17.4%, nearing our 18%+ target, and dividend payout ratio was 48%, on the higher end of our target range.\n\nThrough prudent risk management and financial discipline, our balance sheet and capital position remain strong. This enhances our capabilities to further invest in our businesses while remaining resilient against economic uncertainty, geopolitical risks and climate change.\n\n'We're dedicated to growth that benefits our Clients through new capabilities, innovative solutions and provides broader and easier access to health and financial advice.'\n\n## Message from the Chair\n\n## Scott F. Powers\n\nChair of the Board\n\nGrowth is not only measured in our financial results, but also improving the impact we have on our Clients - particularly how we're delivering on our Purpose to help them achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives.\n\nOur company grew organically and through disciplined acquisitions and strategic partnerships including Advisors Asset Management, Dialogue Health Technologies Inc. and our partnerships with Dah Sing Bank in Hong Kong and Pillway 12 in Canada.\n\nWe're dedicated to growth that benefits our Clients through new capabilities, innovative solutions and provides broader and easier access to health and financial advice. We're also future-focused, finding new ways to reach Clients, including through digitization.\n\nOur Canada and U.S. businesses continue to be growth engines and we see a runway of opportunities in asset management and in Asia. This includes demand for alternative investments, a growing Asian middle class, increased demand for preventative health and wellness solutions, and the transfer of wealth between generations.\n\nShareholders tell us they appreciate our stability and strength. They see the rewards through growth in the marketplace, our stock price and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance of 10.4% over a 10-year period, placing us in the top quartile of our global peers.\n\nOn a personal note, I'm proud to lead our Board of Directors who bring a depth of experience and expertise to their role at Sun Life, providing strong governance, disciplined risk management and strategic oversight, and ensuring management is accountable for the delivery of strong business results.\n\nOn behalf of our Board and everyone at Sun Life, thank you to our Clients for your ongoing trust in our capabilities and to our shareholders and policyholders for your confidence and commitment.\n\nSun Life was built on a foundation of strong values, a meaningful Purpose and an ambition to be the best. It's this foundation that supports our thoughtful and disciplined approach to everything we do.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Living healthy lives and achieving financial security are two powerful goals which can shape or reshape the future for individuals, families and communities.\n\nOur Purpose and the positive impact we have reminds me of the times people or companies have impacted me. My grandmother comes to mind. She helped me finance my first years of university. Little did either of us know at the time the tremendous impact of that action. It's moments like these that can help shape the course of one's life and career, having impact on others, just like my grandmother did for me.\n\nAs a company, we can, and do, have this type of impact on our Clients; helping them with their financial security and health and helping them create their own impact for their families, friends, and communities. Whether that's building a financial nest egg or protecting your loved ones, we support Clients through actions that can have a ripple effect well beyond themselves, helping create opportunities that can have a lasting impact for them, their children and even their grandchildren.\n\n## 'At Sun Life, focusing on Purpose and measuring impact is everything to us.'\n\nSometimes in today's fast changing and complicated world we can lose sight of what our role is, why we are here, what is our Purpose.

And this focus on Client impact drives\n\n## Message from the CEO\n\n## Kevin Strain\n\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\n\nbusiness growth and business growth creates a positive impact for all Sun Life stakeholders.\n\nAs I reflect on 2023, I'm filled with pride at the remarkable accomplishments we've achieved, the resilience we've shown and the impact our Employees and advisors have had on our 85 million Clients worldwide.\n\n## Client Impact Strategy\n\nTwo years ago, we introduced our Client Impact strategy with a commitment to make a difference in the lives of others. Our strategy focuses on what matters most to our Clients with a clear commitment to deliver bolder outcomes for our Clients' financial, mental and physical health including accessing, navigating and paying for health care and providing innovative solutions and services .\n\nWe are also focused on being a great employer and fostering an engaging work culture. Our culture is our superpower as we deliver on our Purpose and we are proud to be part of a caring company with a caring culture . Ultimately living our Purpose, being a great place to work and contributing to our communities creates value for our shareholders and we are proud of the impact we have.\n\n## Accessing, navigating and paying for health care\n\nWe believe everyone deserves to live a healthy life. Accessing care is essential for promoting health, reducing disparities and improving quality of life for individuals and communities alike. It's critical to our strategy and part of our Purpose, with a focus on four key areas:\n\n- \u00b7     Acting as a payor of health benefits and claims in Canada, the U.S. and Asia;\n- \u00b7     Helping Clients navigate complex healthcare systems with the help of PinnacleCare and Dialogue;\n- \u00b7     Providing wellness programs and information including Lumino  Health  and  our  Mental  Health  Coach  in  Canada;  and\n- \u00b7     Helping to ensure access to care for all.",

In addition, our minority investment in Pillway 12 brings the convenience of virtual pharmacy consultations and medication delivery right to our Clients' doorsteps in Canada.\n\nWe know oral health is critical to overall health and wellness, and we've invested to grow our depth and scope in this important area over the past few years.\n\nDentaQuest, which is dedicated to improving the oral health of all, is a great example of how we provide access to care. Our U.S. dental business now has approximately 36 million members, many of them in underserved communities - like William, who experienced compassionate and personalized care from our DentaQuest team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWilliam had neglected his own health while caring for his terminally ill wife. Our DentaQuest case management team helped them access oral health care and pain management to make William's wife more comfortable. After his wife passed away, William's case manager encouraged him to take care of himself and his oral health. Thanks to this support, William is getting the medical and dental care he needs and taking an active role to live a healthier life.\n\nIn Canada, we finalized a contract with the Federal Government to be the administrator of the Canadian Dental Care Plan, which will provide access to dental care for up to nine million additional Canadians in need.\n\nWe're taking similar steps in Asia to leverage our digital capabilities and product innovation to help Clients live healthier lives. In Hong Kong, we introduced eSunPro, a new digital health care platform that offers one-stop, comprehensive care where Clients have access to advanced treatment and support throughout their recovery process.\n\nThrough all of these actions and countless others, we're making a real impact on society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They want their interactions to be effortless. And they want us to be there when and where they want. That's why we're focused on digital leadership to help us deliver on our Purpose.\n\nWe're transforming the way we serve our Clients through digital leadership, acquisitions and partnerships. By thinking and acting more like a digital company, we're creating innovative solutions and services for our Clients, now and into the future.\n\nWe're investing in and harnessing the potential of Generative AI. In the U.S., GenAI is helping our call centres analyze calls and deliver Client insights so we can create more exceptional and personalized Client experiences. It's also helping us improve workplace productivity, freeing up our teams so they can focus on strategic work.\n\nDistribution capabilities through strategic partnerships and investments have supported deepening Sun Life's impact. In Asia, we're working with Bowtie, Hong Kong's first virtual insurer, to make insurance more affordable and accessible. Last year we increased our investment in Bowtie, and since our partnership began five years ago, Bowtie has grown in digital distribution and sales, with a leading market share of approximately 30% in Hong Kong's direct sales channel. 13\n\nOur 15-year bancassurance partnership with Dah Sing Bank in Hong Kong has contributed to record sales and elevated our position in a highly competitive market. This partnership is a win for Clients who now have access to Sun Life's innovative products and solutions to support their financial well-being and security.\n\nIn our asset management business, SLC Management is extending our world class alternative investment capabilities to more Clients through acquisitions and partnerships. They completed a majority acquisition of Advisors Asset Management (AAM), a leading independent U.S. retail distribution firm and in Canada, increased distribution through a strategic relationship with Scotiabank.\n\nAnd MFS announced plans to launch its first active exchange traded funds (ETFs), adding more choice and options for Clients to access long-term value. This complements their mutual fund business, which will be celebrating its centennial anniversary in 2024.\n\n## A caring company with a caring culture\n\nWe're working to deliver meaningful positive impact for our Clients, colleagues and communities. We want to be known as a company that cares for our Clients, each other and the future of our society.\n\nCompany culture matters and has a direct impact on how we execute on our strategy. It is something that's unique to Sun Life and can't be easily replicated. The way we work, our behaviours, how we treat one another, how we make decisions and the actions we take to nurture a caring culture will allow us to deliver on our strategy and differentiate us as an employer of choice.\n\nOur leaders play an important role in guiding our culture. We announced some important changes to the executive team, including Manjit Singh becoming President of Sun Life Asia, leading one of our fastest growing business pillars. I am proud",

It brings the best thinking from around the world to our strategies and execution.\n\nWe're also finding ways to have a greater impact beyond Sun Life. Along with a focus on climate change, our Sustainability strategy highlights how we can make a difference to society in the areas we know best - financial security, healthier lives and sustainable investing.\n\nAreas like the fight against diabetes. Almost 100 years ago Sun Life was one of the first companies to make a donation to the Banting Research Foundation for the support of medical research. Since 2012 we've committed more than $50 million globally focused on research, prevention and promoting healthy living. Within the business, we've piloted Diabetes Signature Solutions, a first of its kind, end-to-end insurance solution tailored to meet the needs of Canadians with diabetes.\n\nOur sustainable investments have also had a tremendous impact. One of many stories is SLC Management co-investing to build a 200-bed women's shelter in the U.S. This shelter will provide onsite medical services, mental health assessments, case work and housing support with the ultimate goal to connect people with treatment facilities, family, or long-term housing.\n\nWhen it comes to culture and sustainability, this work is important and it takes time and care. We're listening, learning and innovating so that we can accelerate the positive impact we can have across our entire global footprint.\n\nSun Life delivered solid results in 2023, finishing the year with strong performance. Our results show the strength of our balanced and diversified business model and our capital strength across geographies, across our four pillars, and across our businesses of Wealth and Asset Management, Group Health and Protection, and Individual - Protection.\n\n2023 marked Sun Life's first year reporting under the new IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 financial standards. Underlying net income increased 11% to $3.7 billion, supported by growth across all four business pillars. Reported net income was also up 7% for the full year, to just over $3 billion.\n\nWe performed well against our medium-term financial objectives. On a yearly basis, underlying earnings per share growth was above our medium-term objective at 11%, underlying dividend payout ratio was within range at 47%, and underlying ROE was also strong at 17.8%. Total assets under management of $1.4 trillion was up 6% from 2022, even in a challenging external environment.\n\nThese numbers tell the story that our strategy is good for business, good for our shareholders and good for our Clients. We're growing our business, our capabilities and creating value. We're unique in that our asset management business and our insurance and protection businesses are equally world class. It's a position that very few global financial services organizations find themselves in.",

How We Report Our Results\n\nSun Life is a leading international financial services organization providing asset management, wealth, insurance and health solutions to individual and institutional Clients. Sun Life has operations in a number of markets worldwide, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, India, China, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bermuda. As of December 31, 2023, Sun Life had total assets under management (\"AUM\") of $1.40 trillion. For more information please visit www.sunlife.com.\n\nSun Life Financial Inc. trades on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges under the ticker symbol SLF.\n\nSun Life Financial Inc. (\"SLF Inc.\") is a publicly traded company domiciled in Canada and is the holding company of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (\"Sun Life Assurance\"). In this management's discussion and analysis (\"MD&A\"), SLF Inc., its subsidiaries and, where applicable, its joint ventures and associates are collectively referred to as \"the Company\", \"Sun Life\", \"we\", \"our\", and \"us\". Unless otherwise indicated, all information in this MD&A is presented as at and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the information contained in this document is in Canadian dollars. Amounts in this document are impacted by rounding.\n\nWhere information at and for the year ended December 31, 2023 is not available, information available for the latest period before December 31, 2023 is used. Except where otherwise noted, financial information is presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") and the accounting requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (\"OSFI\"). Reported net income (loss) refers to Common shareholders' net income (loss) determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nWe manage our operations and report our financial results in five business segments: Asset Management, Canada, United States (\"U.S.\"), Asia, and Corporate. Information concerning these segments is included in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes (\"Annual Consolidated Financial Statements\" and \"Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\", respectively, and \"Consolidated Financial Statements\" collectively), and this MD&A document.\n\nOn January 1, 2023 we adopted IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 17\"), which replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 4\"). IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. On January 1, 2023, we also adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (\"IFRS 9\"), which replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (\"IAS 39\"). The nature and effects of the key changes in our critical accounting policies and estimated impacts from the adoption of the new standards are summarized in section N - Accounting and Control Matters in this document. For more information including the measurement and classification of opening balances, refer to Note 2 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Note to Readers: 2022 Restated Results on Adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9\n\n2022 results have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 17 and the related IFRS 9 classification overlay ('the new standards'). The restated results may not be fully representative of our future earnings profile, as we were not managing our asset and liability portfolios under the new standards. The majority of the actions taken to re-balance asset portfolios and transition asset-liability management execution to an IFRS 17 basis occurred in Q1'23. Accordingly, analysis based on 2022 comparative results may not necessarily be indicative of future trends, and should be interpreted with this context. Using sensitivities to analyze the outlook for market risk and related impacts (e.g., interest rate sensitivities) will be more representative starting with the sensitivities disclosed for Q1'23 and onward in section K - Risk Management in this document and section I - Risk Management in each quarter's respective interim MD&A document. Certain 2022 restated results and 2023 interim results in the Drivers of Earnings and CSM Movement Analysis were refined to more accurately reflect how management views the business.",

The products generally have shorter-term coverage periods, and more frequent repricing. The revenues are driven by premiums for coverage provided as well as fee-based earnings (i.e., Administrative Services Only plans, and dental fees).\n- \u00b7 Individual - Protection: Generally, individual protection businesses have a longer-term profitability profile and are more sensitive to experience trends. The premiums include a margin for providing protection and are invested to earn a return over the expected amounts required to fulfill insurance liabilities.\n\nThe following provides an overview of the business types in Sun Life's business segments/business groups:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.

Additional information concerning acquisitions and dispositions is provided in Note 3 in our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of a 51% (1) interest in Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (\"AAM\"), a leading independent U.S. retail distribution firm. AAM's strong U.S. retail distribution capabilities provides an attractive opportunity for SLC Management to meet the growing demand for alternative assets among U.S. HNW investors. AAM provides a range of solutions and products to financial advisors at wirehouses, registered investment advisors and independent broker-dealers, overseeing US$41.4 billion (approximately C$54.9 billion) in assets as at December 31, 2023, with 10 offices across nine U.S. states. Sun Life has the option to acquire the remaining interest in AAM starting in 2028. As a result of the transaction, total shareholders' equity was reduced by $156 million, primarily driven by the establishment of financial liabilities associated with the anticipated increase of our future ownership in AAM.\n\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of the sponsored markets business (2) from Sun Life Assurance to Canadian Premier Life Insurance Company (re-branded to Securian Canada).\n\nOn April 3, 2023 we completed the sale of SLF of Canada UK Limited (\"Sun Life UK\") to Phoenix Group Holdings plc (\"Phoenix Group\") for approximately $418 million. Sun Life UK managed life and pension policies as well as payout annuities for UK Clients, was closed to new sales and operated as a run-off business since 2001. Under the agreement, we will retain our economic interest in the payout annuities business through a reinsurance treaty, which, effective Q2'23, is recorded in In-force Management within the U.S. business group. Phoenix Group is the UK's largest long-term savings and retirement business, with \u00a3269 billion (3) of assets under administration and approximately 12 million customers (3) . As part of the sale, we will establish a long-term partnership to become a strategic asset management partner to Phoenix Group. Our asset management companies, MFS and SLC Management, will continue to manage approximately $8 billion of Sun Life UK's general account. In addition, Phoenix Group has set a goal to invest approximately US$25 billion in North American public and private fixed income and alternative investments over the next five years. MFS and SLC Management will be material partners to Phoenix Group in achieving this goal. In Q3'22, we recognized an impairment charge pertaining to the attributed goodwill that was not expected to be recovered through the sale. In Q2'23, we recognized a gain of $19 million in reported net income.\n\nEffective July 1, 2023 we commenced our 15-year exclusive bancassurance partnership with Dah Sing Bank (\"Dah Sing\"). Under this partnership, Sun Life will be the exclusive provider of life insurance solutions to Dah Sing's approximately 570,000 retail banking customers, helping to fulfill their savings and protection needs at different life stages. This is Sun Life's first exclusive bancassurance partnership in Hong Kong and will be a valuable complement to our existing network of over 2,500 expert insurance advisors.\n\nOn October 3, 2023, we acquired Dialogue Health Technologies Inc. (\"Dialogue\"). As a result of this acquisition, our ownership interest increased from 23% to 95% for cash proceeds of $272 million (for equity not previously owned by Sun Life or rolled by certain members of Dialogue's executive management). Dialogue is a Canadian based health and wellness virtual care platform.",

Market-related impacts\n\nMarket-related impacts represent the difference between actual versus expected market movements (7) . Market-related impacts resulted in a decrease of $454 million to reported net income, primarily reflecting unfavourable real estate experience.\n\n## 2. Assumption changes and management actions\n\nThe net impact of assumption changes and management actions was an increase of $36 million to reported net income and includes methods and assumptions changes on insurance contracts as well as related impacts. These included favourable impacts from modelling enhancements in Asia and financial-related assumptions, which were partially offset by unfavourable policyholder behaviour updates in Asia, mortality updates in the U.S., and refinements to Sun Life Health in Canada. For additional details refer to \"Assumption Changes and Management Actions by Type\" in section F - Contractual Service Margin in this document.\n\n## 3. Other adjustments\n\nOther adjustments decreased reported net income $224 million, reflecting DentaQuest integration costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, and SLC Management acquisition-related costs (8) , partially offset by gains on the sale of the sponsored markets business in Canada (1) and the sale of Sun Life UK (5) , and the impact of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Change (2) .\n\n## 4.   Experience-related items\n\nNotable experience items in the current year included:\n\n- \u00b7 Favourable morbidity experience largely in Canada and in U.S. medical stop-loss;\n- \u00b7 Unfavourable expense experience largely in Canada, U.S. Dental, and Asia;\n- \u00b7 Unfavourable credit experience that impacted Canada results; and\n- \u00b7 Other experience was favourable reflecting various smaller items.\n\n## 5. Income taxes\n\nThe statutory tax rate is impacted by various items, such as lower taxes on income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions, tax-exempt investment income, and other sustainable tax benefits.\n\nOn December 27, 2023, Bermuda enacted its Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, which will apply a 15% income tax beginning on January 1, 2025. Bermuda Corporate Income Taxes are expected to be a covered tax and will reduce Pillar Two top-up taxes which would otherwise be payable to other jurisdictions. The enacted legislation provides an economic transition adjustment that aligns an entity's starting point for the tax regime more closely with its economic position prior to the application of the Corporate Income Tax 2023. The benefit of this economic transition adjustment has been recognized in 2023. As a result, total Company reported net income increased by $51 million, reflected in Other adjustments. The Bermuda Corporate Income Tax is not expected to have a material impact on Sun Life's consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective in 2025. Refer to Note 19 in the 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\nThe effective income tax rate (9) on underlying net income and reported net income was 17.3% and 11.7%, respectively.\n\n(5)\n\nOn April 3, 2023 we completed the sale of SLF of Canada UK Limited to Phoenix Group Holdings plc (\"the sale of Sun Life UK\"). In Q3'22, we\n\nrecognized an impairment charge of $170 million pertaining to the attributed goodwill that was not expected to be recovered through the sale.\n\n- (9) Our effective income tax rate on reported net income is calculated using Total income (loss) before income taxes, as detailed in Note 19 in our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Our effective income tax rate on underlying net income is calculated using pre-tax underlying net income, as detailed in section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document, and the associated income tax expense.",

Impacts of foreign exchange translation\n\nWe operate in many markets worldwide, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, India, China, Australia, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bermuda, and generate revenues and incur expenses in local currencies in these jurisdictions, which are translated to Canadian dollars.\n\nItems impacting a reporting period, such as Revenue, Expenses, and Reported net income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as underlying net income (loss), and sales, are translated into Canadian dollars using average exchange rates for the appropriate daily, monthly, or quarterly period. For Assets and Liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, as well as the AUM and certain components of the Drivers of Earnings disclosure, period-end rates are used for currency translation purposes.\n\nThe following table provides the foreign exchange rates for the U.S. dollar, which generates the most significant impact of foreign exchange translation, over the past four quarters and two years.\n\n| Exchange rate            | Quarterly results   | Quarterly results   | Quarterly results   | Full year   |   Full year |   Full year |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                          | Q4'23               | Q3'23               | Q2'23               | Q1'23       |    2023     |    2022     |\n| U.S. Dollar - Average    | 1.361               | 1.341               | 1.343               | 1.352       |       1.35  |       1.301 |\n| U.S. Dollar - Period end | 1.325               | 1.358               | 1.324               | 1.352       |       1.325 |       1.355 |\n\nThe relative impacts of foreign exchange translation in any given period are driven by the movement of foreign exchange rates as well as the proportion of earnings generated in our foreign operations. In general, net income benefits from a weakening Canadian dollar and is adversely affected by a strengthening Canadian dollar as net income from the Company's international operations is translated back to Canadian dollars. Conversely, in a period of losses, the weakening of the Canadian dollar has the effect of increasing losses in foreign jurisdictions. We generally express the impacts of foreign exchange translation on net income on a year-over-year basis.\n\nForeign exchange translation led to an increase of $77 million and $73 million in underlying net income and reported net income, respectively.",

Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has developed the regulatory capital framework referred to as the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test for Canada. LICAT measures the capital adequacy of an insurer using a risk-based approach and includes elements that contribute to financial strength through periods when an insurer is under stress as well as elements that contribute to policyholder and creditor protection wind-up.\n\nSLF Inc. is a non-operating insurance company and is subject to the LICAT guideline. Sun Life Assurance, SLF Inc.'s principal operating life insurance subsidiary, is also subject to the LICAT guideline.\n\nSLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio of 142% and Sun Life Assurance's LICAT ratio of 139% as at January 1, 2023 increased 12 percentage points compared to December 31, 2022, from the transition to IFRS 17. The largest driver of change was the reduction in the LICAT base solvency buffer (\"BSB\") scalar from 1.05 to 1.0 which contributed seven percentage points.\n\nSLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio of 149% as at December 31, 2023 increased seven percentage points compared to January 1, 2023, driven by reported net income, capital optimization and market movements, partially offset by shareholder dividend payments, subordinated debt redemption, M&A activity, and share buybacks.\n\nSun Life Assurance's LICAT ratio of 141% as at December 31, 2023 increased two percentage points compared to January 1, 2023, driven by reported net income, capital optimization, and market movements, largely offset by dividend payments to SLF Inc. and M&A activity.\n\nThe Sun Life Assurance LICAT ratios in both periods are well above OSFI's supervisory ratio of 100% and regulatory minimum ratio of 90%.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Capital\n\nOn transition to the new standards, total capital of $40.6 billion as at January 1, 2023 increased $4.4 billion compared to December 31, 2022 driven by the establishment of the CSM, which includes transfers from Common shareholders' equity and equity in the participating account to the CSM.\n\nOur total capital consists of subordinated debt and other capital instruments, CSM, equity in the participating account and total shareholders' equity which includes common shareholders' equity, preferred shares and other equity instruments, and non-controlling interests. As at December 31, 2023, our total capital was $42.4 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion compared to January 1, 2023. The increase to total capital included reported net income of $3,086 million, an increase of $921 million in CSM, the issuance of $500 million principal amount of Series 2023-1 Subordinated Unsecured 5.50% Fixed/Floating Debentures, which is detailed below, and net unrealized gains on FVOCI assets of $485 million. This was partially offset by the payment of $1,762 million of dividends on common shares of SLF Inc. (\"common shares\"), the redemption of $1 billion principal amount of Series 2016-2 Subordinated Unsecured 3.05% Fixed/Floating Debentures, which is detailed below, the unfavourable impacts of foreign exchange translation of $344 million included in other comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\"), a decrease of $186 million from the repurchase and cancellation of common shares, and the impact related to the acquisition of AAM of $156 million (1) .\n\nOur capital and liquidity positions remain strong with a LICAT ratio of 149% at SLF Inc., a financial leverage ratio of 21.5% (2) and $1.6 billion in cash and other liquid assets (2) as at December 31, 2023 in SLF Inc. (3) (December 31, 2022 - $1.1 billion).\n\n## Capital Transactions\n\nOn July 4, 2023, SLF Inc. issued $500 million principal amount of Series 2023-1 Subordinated Unsecured 5.50% Fixed/Floating Debentures due 2035. Sun Life intends to use an amount equal to the net proceeds from the offering to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, eligible assets as defined in our Sustainability Bond Framework.\n\nOn September 19, 2023, SLF Inc. redeemed all of the outstanding $1 billion principal amount of Series 2016-2 Subordinated Unsecured 3.05% Fixed/Floating Debentures, in accordance with the redemption terms attached to such debentures. The redemptions were funded from existing cash and liquid assets in SLF Inc.\n\n## Normal Course Issuer Bids\n\nOn August 24, 2023, SLF inc. announced that OSFI and the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") had approved its previously announced normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 17 million of its common shares (the \"NCIB'). The NCIB commenced on August 29, 2023 and continues until August 28, 2024, such earlier date as SLF Inc. may determine, or such date as SLF Inc. completes its purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. Purchases under the NCIB may be made through the facilities of the TSX, other Canadian stock exchanges and/or alternative Canadian trading platforms, at prevailing market rates. Subject to regulatory approval, purchases under the NCIB may also be made by way of private agreements or share repurchase programs under issuer bid exemption orders issued by securities regulatory authorities. Any purchases made under an exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority will generally be at a discount to the prevailing market price. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, and the timing of such purchases (if any), will be determined by SLF Inc. Any common shares purchased by SLF Inc. pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled or used in connection with certain equity settled incentive arrangements. The NCIB will provide the Company with the flexibility to acquire common shares in order to return capital to shareholders as part of its overall capital management strategy.\n\nIn 2023, SLF Inc. purchased approximately 2.8 million common shares at a total cost of $186 million pursuant to the NCIB. All of the common shares purchased under SLF Inc.'s NCIB were subsequently cancelled.\n\n## Financial Strength Ratings\n\nIndependent rating agencies assign credit ratings to securities issued by companies and assign financial strength ratings to financial institutions such as Sun Life Assurance.\n\nThe financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies are intended to provide an independent view of the creditworthiness and financial strength of a financial institution. Each rating agency has developed its own methodology for the assessment and subsequent rating of life insurance companies.\n\nRating agencies do not assign a financial strength rating for SLF Inc., however, credit ratings are assigned to the securities issued by SLF Inc. and its subsidiaries and are described in SLF Inc.'s AIF under the heading Security Ratings.\n\nThe following table summarizes the financial strength ratings for Sun Life Assurance as at January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023.\n\n|                  | A.M.

SLC Management is a global asset manager with capabilities across fixed income and alternative asset classes including public and private fixed income, real estate equity and debt, and infrastructure equity, and manages assets on behalf of institutional investors and HNW Clients around the world.\n\n## 2023 Highlights\n\n- \u00b7 We ended 2023 with $1,015.9 billion in assets under management consisting of $792.8 billion (US$598.6 billion) in MFS and $223.1 billion in SLC Management.\n- \u00b7 Total Asset Management net outflows of $26.4 billion reflected net outflows of $38.9 billion (US$28.8 billion) from MFS partially offset by SLC Management net inflows of $12.5 billion.\n\n## MFS\n\n- \u00b7 MFS generated solid net income and sustained a strong pre-tax net operating profit margin (1) , despite challenging market conditions.\n- \u00b7 Delivered strong long-term investment performance with 97%, 95% and 30% of MFS' U.S. retail mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their Morningstar categories based on ten-, five- and three-year performance, respectively, as at December 31, 2023.\n- (2) \u00b7 During the year, MFS became the 9 th largest fund group for the U.S. retail mutual fund industry based on AUM.\n- \u00b7 MFS is preparing to go to market with active exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\") over the next year, continuing to expand the diverse range of investment products offered to Clients.\n\n## SLC Management\n\n- \u00b7 On February 1, we completed the acquisition of a 51% interest in Advisors Asset Management, Inc. ('AAM'), a leading independent U.S. retail distribution firm, with the option to acquire the remaining interest starting in 2028. We also entered into a strategic partnership with Scotiabank in Q3'23 to distribute alternative investment capabilities to the Canadian retail market. AAM's strong U.S. retail distribution capabilities, coupled with the strategic partnership with Scotiabank, provides an attractive opportunity for SLC Management to meet the growing demand for alternative assets among HNW investors. (3)\n- \u00b7 AAM announced it will distribute BGO IREIT (4) , a non-traded real estate investment trust launched by BentallGreenOak ('BGO'), and Crescent Private BDC, a non-traded closed-end fund launched by Crescent Capital Group LP (\"Crescent\"), in early 2023, highlighting the strategic benefit of adding this distribution channel.\n- \u00b7 BGO achieved a successful final close of its third UK Secured Lending Fund, with a total of \u00a31.4 billion in commitments from over 25 global institutional investors. The fund surpassed its initial target and has become one of the largest European fundraises for a debt strategy entirely focused on the UK.\n- \u00b7 Crescent achieved a successful final close of its eighth private credit solutions fund (5) , raising US$8 billion in investable capital. The fund exceeded its initial target and has become the largest capital raise in Crescent's history.\n- \u00b7 SLC Management continued to demonstrate its commitment to sustainable investing with BGO winning a number of awards including the 2023 ENERGY STAR\u00ae Partner of The Year - Sustained Excellence Award by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy for the 13 th consecutive year, and with InfraRed Capital Partners ('InfraRed') continuing to invest capital in companies helping to build a sustainable future.",

        "page_content": "## Strategy and Outlook\n\nOur strategy is to provide investment products through MFS and SLC Management that will deliver long-term value to our Clients in active asset management as well as fixed income and alternative asset classes. MFS competes primarily in the global institutional, U.S. retail and select non-U.S. retail markets. SLC Management competes primarily in the global institutional market, offering a broad and deep fixed income and real assets platform through affiliate managers. SLC Management leverages Sun Life's long-standing expertise in private asset class investments, augmented by the specialized alternative capabilities of SLC Management's affiliate managers, to offer customized investment solutions to investors. In addition, with the acquisition of a majority interest in AAM and the partnership with Scotia Global Wealth Management, SLC Management will also deliver solutions to the retail HNW market in North America.\n\n## MFS: Continue to deliver superior investment performance while allocating capital responsibly for our Clients\n\nMFS' active management strategy focuses on delivering value to our Clients over the long-term. Our relative performance provides us with a strong competitive position:\n\n- \u00b7 MFS is well-positioned to attract flows from all Client sectors that are seeking risk-managed capital appreciation over the long-term based on our disciplined, long-term approach. We are engaging Clients to align with MFS to focus on longer investment horizons, to leverage our proven ability to deliver over benchmark performance through a market cycle.\n- \u00b7 Our strong leadership on ESG is embedded in our overall investment approach of allocating capital responsibly on behalf of our Clients.\n- \u00b7 Our continued strategic focus to build out institutional fixed income product and sales capabilities and broaden our non-U.S. retail initiatives enables us to meet Clients' unique and local needs.\n- \u00b7 MFS strives to maintain margins in the top quartile of active managers while maintaining our commitment to provide long-term value to Clients.\n- \u00b7 We continue to focus on diversity at all levels and promoting an inclusive culture.\n\n## SLC Management: Help investors meet their investment objectives by offering a broad suite of alternative asset classes and fixed income strategies\n\nWe are well-positioned to take advantage of key trends in our target markets:\n\n- \u00b7 Institutional investors continue to increase allocations to alternative investments and fixed income.\n- \u00b7 Growing demand for alternative investments, including demand among North American HNW retail investors.\n- \u00b7 Consolidation of investment manager relationships by institutional investors.\n- \u00b7 Realizing the synergies from alternative asset management and insurance capabilities.\n- \u00b7 An increasing focus by some investors on ESG and sustainable investing.\n\nOur strategy is to continue to deliver superior investment performance, expand and deepen our distribution relationships, and build out our product lineup, while retaining our top talent. SLC Management is positioned for growth over the medium-term; our objectives (1) are to achieve AUM of $225 billion, operating margin of 30%-35%, and underlying net income of $235 million by 2025. We offer our Clients a compelling suite of investment capabilities to meet their needs, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Leading public and private fixed income capabilities, spanning both investment grade and alternative credit\n- \u00b7 Global real estate expertise across both equity and debt investments, and\n- \u00b7 Global infrastructure capabilities.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## MFS\n\nThe potential for a global recession remains. We are in an environment of slowing growth with capital and labour costs remaining high, which creates the need for more companies to recapitalize at higher rates in the face of softer revenue growth. This will continue to create a more challenging environment to generate value in the short to medium-term. Companies who can operate successfully in this more challenging, higher cost environment will be rewarded by investors. This could create greater opportunities for active managers to outperform benchmarks that have not been present. MFS employs an investment philosophy that involves a long-term approach and looks across the complete business cycle. Our scale, proven long-term track record and broad product portfolios, coupled with our investment philosophy, position us well to deliver strong results over a market cycle. Our expense structure leverages significant variable costs based on assets, sales or profitability, and as a result a majority of our expense base adjusts with market dynamics. In addition, we will continue to be diligent with discretionary spending while investing in strategic initiatives that help grow the business over the long-term.\n\n## SLC Management\n\nWith current economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we expect to see more volatility in equity markets driven by higher-for-longer interest rates and continued uncertainty on stabilization of rates. These macroeconomic headwinds are expected to moderate our ability to raise capital as investors rebalance their portfolios, or defer committing further capital, as well as to deploy capital given the challenging environment for transactions. However, we expect to see continued demand for yield-orientated fixed income and alternative assets classes, as these asset types continue to provide an opportunity for portfolio diversification, a potential hedge against inflation, and a reduction in overall risk exposure across investments. We believe that we are well positioned to meet this demand with our platform of world-class investment capabilities, complimentary businesses that drive product and distribution opportunities, and our ability to leverage global resources. The acquisition of a majority stake in AAM and partnership with Scotia Global Wealth Management provides further momentum to SLC Management to grow and expand our retail HNW business in North America. The investment capabilities we use for our Clients are the same capabilities that we use in managing the general account of Sun Life; this facilitates co-investment opportunities that result in an alignment of interest with our Clients and enables SLC Management's speed to market for products.",

Fee-related earnings margin (1) and pre-tax net operating profit margin (1) for 2023 were 24% and 22%, respectively (2022 - 24% and 23%, respectively).\n\nReported net income of $1,067 million decreased $81 million or 7%, reflecting fair value changes in management's ownership of MFS shares and a decline in value of real estate investments held in the SLC Management surplus account, partially offset by a lower increase in SLC Management's acquisition-related liabilities (3) compared to the prior year.\n\nForeign exchange translation led to an increase of $37 million and $35 million in underlying net income and reported net income, respectively.\n\n## Growth\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nAsset Management AUM of $1,015.9 billion increased $63.9 billion or 7% driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Net asset value changes of $91.6 billion; and\n- \u00b7 AUM driven by the AAM acquisition of $5.2 billion; partially offset by\n- \u00b7 Net outflows of $26.4 billion; and\n- \u00b7 Client distributions of $6.5 billion.\n\nMFS' AUM increased US$50.7 billion or 9%, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Increase in asset values from higher equity markets of US$79.5 billion, partially offset by net outflows of US$28.8 billion.\n\nIn Q4'23, 97%, 95%, and 30% of MFS' U.S. retail mutual fund assets ranked in the top half of their Morningstar categories based on ten-, fiveand three-year performance, respectively.\n\nSLC Management's AUM increased $13.5 billion or 6% driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Net inflows of $12.5 billion, the AAM acquisition of $5.2 billion, and asset value changes of $2.3 billion, partially offset by Client distributions of $6.5 billion.\n- \u00b7 Net inflows were comprised of capital raising and Client contributions, totaling $24.6 billion, partially offset by outflows of $12.2 billion.\n\nSLC Management's FE AUM increased $12.4 billion or 8% driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Net inflows of $14.2 billion, the AAM acquisition of $5.2 billion, and asset value changes of $0.2 billion, partially offset by Client distributions of $7.2 billion.\n- \u00b7 Net inflows were comprised of capital deployment and Client contributions, totaling $24.6 billion, partially offset by outflows of $10.4 billion.\n\n## Acquisition of Advisors Asset Management, Inc.\n\nOn February 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of a 51% (4) interest in Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (\"AAM\"), a leading independent U.S. retail distribution firm. AAM's strong U.S. retail distribution capabilities provides an attractive opportunity for SLC Management to meet the growing demand for alternative assets among U.S. HNW investors. AAM provides a range of solutions and products to financial advisors at wirehouses, registered investment advisors and independent broker-dealers, overseeing US$41.4 billion (approximately C$54.9 billion) in assets as at December 31, 2023, with 10 offices across nine U.S. states. Sun Life has the option to acquire the remaining interest in AAM starting in 2028. As a result of the transaction, total shareholders' equity was reduced by $156 million, primarily driven by the establishment of financial liabilities associated with the anticipated increase of our future ownership in AAM.

        "page_content": "## Acquisition of Dialogue Health Technologies Inc.\n\nOn October 3, 2023, we acquired Dialogue Health Technologies Inc. (\"Dialogue\"). As a result of this acquisition, our ownership interest increased from 23% to 95% for cash proceeds of $272 million (for equity not previously owned by Sun Life or rolled by certain members of Dialogue's executive management). Dialogue is a Canadian-based health and wellness virtual care platform. For additional information, refer to Note 3 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3. U.S.\n\nSun Life U.S. is one of the largest providers of employee and government benefits in the U.S., serving more than 50 million Americans with disability, life, supplemental health, medical stop-loss insurance, dental and vision benefits through employers, industry partners and government programs such as Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\"). Services include absence management, dental care, and healthcare navigation. In addition, our U.S. business manages an in-force block of approximately 225,000 individual life insurance and annuity policies as well as a block of run-off reinsurance.\n\n## 2023 Highlights\n\n## Growing our business\n\n- \u00b7 Sun Life U.S. delivered strong double-digit growth in underlying earnings, sales, and revenue again in 2023, driven by the successful execution of our strategy to help Clients access the health care and coverage they need as well as contributions from the DentaQuest acquisition.\n- \u00b7 Recorded more than US$650 million in total new dental sales since closing the DentaQuest acquisition on June 1, 2022, including the largest Medicare Advantage sale in DentaQuest history in 2023. Commercial dental sales also increased 55% in 2023 as we leverage our combined strengths from the DentaQuest acquisition.\n- \u00b7 Employee Benefits revenue increased 14% compared to 2022, reflecting strong sales and persistency results, supported by investments in products and technology, higher average premiums per case and disciplined pricing.\n- \u00b7 Increased supplemental health premiums by 34% year-over-year and recognized in 2023 as the Voluntary Sales Growth Leader in the large carrier category by Eastbridge Consulting (1) . Voluntary benefits include supplemental health benefits that help members pay for costs that may not be covered by their medical plans.\n\n## Helping Clients access the health care and coverage they need\n\n- \u00b7 PinnacleCare's personalized care navigation solutions helped members get timely access to high quality healthcare and provided them with the knowledge to make confident decisions about their health.

        "page_content": "## Strategy and Outlook\n\nOur strategy is to be a leader in health and benefits in the U.S. that helps members access the care and coverage they need. The US$4.5 trillion and growing health and benefits ecosystem is complex and rapidly changing. Health care staffing shortages and increasing demand are reducing capacity in the U.S. health care system, making accessing care more challenging. Over 85%, or $7.2 billion, of our revenue now comes from health care products and services, and we are serving a key role as a connector in the health care system by helping our members get the right diagnoses, treatments, and benefits. We have significantly advanced our capabilities with our DentaQuest and PinnacleCare acquisitions, and the addition of clinical support initiatives in our disability business. We are a differentiated provider whose offerings complement core health insurance offerings from large U.S. health insurers. Our medical stop-loss and dental benefits businesses are leaders in their industry sectors, and our group life and disability benefits business is a top-10 provider. Through our dental business, we are also part of the large and growing government programs market that covers more than 160 million Americans.\n\nOur digital tools and support services also make it easier to do business with us and close coverage gaps. We also continue to leverage our unique partnership capabilities to drive growth by delivering solutions to our more than 100 health plan and insurance industry partners to support their members.\n\n## Helping Clients access the health care and coverage they need\n\n- \u00b7 Extend our leadership position in medical stop-loss and innovative risk management solutions for self-funded employers by continuing to deliver complementary health-adjacent offerings, including Health Navigator powered by PinnacleCare, to help members with serious conditions get the care they need, achieve better health outcomes, and reduce costs.\n- \u00b7 Leverage DentaQuest's scale and expertise to provide quality oral health to all and help Americans live healthier lives, continue to grow in government programs, and become a leader in commercial dental through our leading capabilities.\n- \u00b7 Focus employee benefits offerings on health and productivity through expanded and enhanced offerings across disability, absence, life, and supplemental health to provide income protection, fill gaps in coverage, and help Clients get the care they need so they can recover and get back to work and to their lives.\n- \u00b7 Help employers comply with complex regulations and provide more Americans with access to paid family and medical leave.\n- \u00b7 Drive growth in FullscopeRMS by leveraging our expertise, scale, and suite of turnkey solutions for insurance and health plan partners, to improve coverage for members.\n\n## Making care and benefits easier through digital solutions\n\n- \u00b7 Expand our ability to integrate with other major platforms in the health and benefits ecosystem, delivering a better Client experience.\n- \u00b7 Drive digital expansion through new capabilities and partnerships while leveraging existing assets to deliver predictive and personalized analytics to help Clients make decisions that are right for them.\n- \u00b7 Leverage digital tools to increase Client interactions and virtual engagement, helping to better serve more members and deliver deeper insights for brokers and employers.\n\n## Help In-force Management policy-owners achieve lifetime financial security, while effectively managing our operations\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to provide excellent service to our individual insurance and annuity policy owners.\n- \u00b7 Optimize the value of the business by implementing opportunities to improve profitability, including expense efficiencies and alternative investment strategies.\n- \u00b7 Effectively manage risk and capital through reinsurance and via product offerings for converting or maturing policies.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe U.S. health and employee benefits ecosystem is large and growing, with Clients becoming increasingly aware of the value of protection products and services. These markets remain competitive, and we are committed to growing profitably by leveraging our leadership positions, deep expertise, and new capabilities to extend further into the health benefits and services space in order to help Americans live healthier lives.\n\nThe strength of our U.S. business is reflected by the growth of our sales, revenues, and underlying net income in 2023. Significant enhancements to our products, systems, and digital capabilities over the past several years have contributed to our growth, in addition to our recent acquisitions.\n\nWe have a diversified business that served us well during the pandemic and is well-positioned for growth. While we have some short-term headwinds in Dental due to the state Medicaid redetermination process following the end of the federally declared Public Health Emergency, the business is growing, we have a strong new business pipeline, and the fundamentals remain strong. The DentaQuest integration remains on schedule, and we are on track to achieve our synergy targets. Health and Risk Solutions results have begun to moderate from pandemicrelated performance but remain strong as we price our products responsibility, invest in health capabilities and leverage data analytics to differentiate our product and service offerings; this will enable us to continue to grow the business with strong profit margins. We are seeing significant improvements in Employee Benefits as COVID-19 impacts subside and the business benefits from ongoing pricing discipline, a strong focus on disability claims management, and investments in technology that have improved the Client experience and driven sales and strong persistency.\n\nWe continue to work with state and federal officials to increase access to benefits for our Clients. In addition to our focus on paid family and medical leave, we have increased our advocacy to expand dental coverage for beneficiaries of Medicaid and other government programs, and to keep employer-sponsored dental benefits affordable. We are also supporting the ERISA Advisory Council's recommendation that Congress pass legislation to ensure mental health parity in long-term disability insurance, which is already required for health insurance. We continue to monitor possible legislative and regulatory changes to key areas that impact our business, such as data security and privacy, minimum loss ratios for employer-sponsored dental insurance plans, and state government contractor requirements.",

High-Net-Worth markets provides individual protection solutions to High-Net-Worth families and individuals, with operations in Singapore and Bermuda. Regional Office represents Asia's headquarters based in Hong Kong.\n\n## 2023 Highlights\n\n## Leverage distribution excellence to diversify our mix, build scale and deliver Client Impact\n\n- \u00b7 Strong protection sales momentum with growth of 44% (1) and total weighted premium income (\"TWPI\") of $6.0 billion up 23% over prior year reflecting increased demand as pandemic-related travel restrictions were lifted in early 2023, continued contribution from High-Net-Worth through our selected origination strategy, and investment in a well-balanced distribution mix.\n- \u00b7 In Hong Kong, we opened Sun Gateway prestige Client center, which offers High-Net-Worth Clients professional insurance consultancy and one-stop financial products and services, with a dedicated team of onsite financial advisors and client service representatives catering to their wealth management and protection needs as they evolve through different life stages.\n- \u00b7 In the Philippines, we maintained our leadership position ranking first for new business premiums and total premiums in 2022, reflecting our strong product offering and exceptional service to Clients. Our focus on making a difference in the lives of our Clients was recognized by our Platinum award (2) for most trusted brand in the life insurance industry in the Philippines for the 14 th consecutive year.\n- \u00b7 We continue to execute our growth strategy through strategic investments. In Hong Kong, we increased our strategic investment in Bowtie Life Insurance Company Limited ('Bowtie'), Hong Kong's first virtual insurer with a leading market share of approximately 30% (3) in Hong Kong's direct sales channel.\n- \u00b7 Bancassurance is an essential distribution channel in Asia to deliver on our Purpose. We entered into a 15-year exclusive bancassurance partnership in Hong Kong with Dah Sing Bank ('Dah Sing'). Under this partnership, Sun Life will be the exclusive provider of life insurance solutions to Dah Sing's approximately 570,000 retail banking customers, helping to fulfill their savings and protection needs at different life stages. This is Sun Life's first exclusive bancassurance partnership in Hong Kong and will be a valuable complement to our existing network of over 2,500 expert insurance advisors. Sales started in July 2023 and we saw good sales momentum from this partnership in the second half of the year.\n\n## Be a digital leader, enhancing the digital experience to transform the Client and advisor experience, and enable greater efficiency and scalability\n\n- \u00b7 As part of our aspiration to deliver meaningful impact to Clients through their life journey, we are continuing to improve the digital service experience to make it easier for them to do business with us. We made substantial progress in 2023, with 87% of policy applications and 48% of claims submitted digitally, up four and ten percentage points from prior year, respectively.\n- \u00b7 In Malaysia and Indonesia, Client satisfaction scores (4) increased substantially, up eleven and three percentage points, respectively, from prior year. Enhancing our digital capabilities, promoting digital awareness, driving Client centricity through enhancing products, process and solutions, as well as building trusted Client and advisor relationships, contributed to this improvement.\n- \u00b7 Developed and launched Sun Life's first digital direct channel for Tax Deductible Voluntary Contributions (\"TVC\") for MPF Clients in Hong Kong, resulting in a 28% increase in overall TVC applications from prior year. This also creates an opportunity to apply direct selling capabilities to other products across our business in Hong Kong.\n- \u00b7 In Vietnam, we launched a new Point of Sale solution creating a seamless, integrated advisor and Client experience, and established product configuration capabilities to reduce time to market.",

We are confident that our position among the global leaders in the HNW space will continue to generate value and positive outcomes for Clients.\n\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as intense competition, equity market downturn, rise in interest rates and inflation continue to pose challenges to our businesses. However, our steadfast dedication to our Purpose and our Clients, strengthening market positions, key strategic relationships, investments in digital and analytics, and our ability to leverage Sun Life's global expertise position us well for the future.

Sun Life UK managed life and pension policies as well as payout annuities for UK Clients, was closed to new sales and operated as a run-off business since 2001. Under the agreement, we will retain our economic interest in the payout annuities business through a reinsurance treaty, which, effective Q2'23, is recorded in In-force Management within the U.S. business group. Phoenix Group is the UK's largest long-term savings and retirement business, with \u00a3269 billion (2) of assets under administration and approximately 12 million customers (2) . As part of the sale, we will establish a long-term partnership to become a strategic asset management partner to Phoenix Group. Our asset management companies, MFS and SLC Management, will continue to manage approximately $8 billion of Sun Life UK's general account. In addition, Phoenix Group has set a goal to invest approximately US$25 billion in North American public and private fixed income and alternative investments over the next five years. MFS and SLC Management will be material partners to Phoenix Group in achieving this goal. In Q3'22, we recognized an impairment charge pertaining to the attributed goodwill that was not expected to be recovered through the sale. In Q2'23, we recognized a gain of $19 million in reported net income. For additional information, refer to Note 3 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Investments\n\nThe Company strives to ensure that general fund investments are aligned with business objectives including meeting policyholder obligations and maintaining adequate liquidity at all times. Consideration is given to a wide range of factors in our investment process, including ensuring attractive risk and return profiles, appropriate diversification by asset type, credit exposure and sector, financial condition and ESG profile of issuers and borrowers, quality and value of underlying security and macro- and micro-economic developments and trends including prospects for specific industry sectors. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Risk Committee\") approves policies that contain prudent standards and procedures for the investment of our general fund assets. These policies include requirements, restrictions and limitations for interest rate, credit, equity market, real estate market, liquidity, concentration, currency, and derivative risks. Compliance with these policies is monitored on a regular basis and reported annually to the Risk Committee. The Governance, Investment & Conduct Review Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the Company's Investment Plan and investment performance, oversees practices, procedures and controls related to the management of the general fund investment portfolio, and reviews corporate governance guidelines and processes.\n\n## 1. Investment Profile\n\nTotal general fund invested assets of $174.3 billion as at December 31, 2023, were up $5.5 billion from December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to net fair value growth from declining interest rates. Our general fund invested assets are well-diversified across investment types, geographies and sectors with the majority of our portfolio invested in high quality fixed income assets.\n\nThe following table sets out the composition of our general fund invested assets: (1)\n\n|                                                  | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023          | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022          |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                     | Carrying value      | % of Total  carrying value | Carrying value      | % of Total  carrying value |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities | 13,173              | 8%                         | 11,219              | 7%                         |\n| Debt securities                                  | 75,493              | 43%                        | 75,902              | 45%                        |\n| Equity securities                                | 7,138               | 4%                         | 7,148               | 4%                         |\n| Mortgages and loans                              | 54,600              | 31%                        | 51,253              | 30%                        |\n| Derivative assets                                | 2,183               | 1%                         | 2,095               | 1%                         |\n| Other invested assets                            | 12,018              | 7%                         | 11,070              | 7%                         |\n| Investment properties                            | 9,723               | 6%                         | 10,102              | 6%                         |\n| Total invested assets                            | 174,328             | 100%                       | 168,789             | 100%                       |\n\n## 2. Debt Securities\n\nThe debt securities portfolio is actively managed through a regular program of purchases and sales aimed at optimizing yield, quality, and liquidity, while ensuring that it remains well-diversified and duration-matched to insurance contract liabilities. As at December 31, 2023, with the exception of certain countries where we have business operations, including Canada, the United States and the Philippines, our exposure to debt securities from any single country did not exceed 1% of total invested assets.",

As at December 31, 2023, 34% of our commercial mortgage portfolio consisted of multi-family residential mortgages; there are no single-family residential mortgages. Our uninsured commercial portfolio had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of approximately 52% as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - 53%). While we generally limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio to 75% at issuance, we may invest in mortgages with a higher loan-to-value ratio in Canada if the mortgage is insured by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (\"CMHC\"). The estimated weighted average debt service coverage for our uninsured commercial portfolio is 1.75 times. Of the $3.8 billion of multi-family residential mortgages in the Canadian commercial mortgage portfolio, 93% were insured by the CMHC.\n\nThe following tables summarize our mortgages by credit quality indicator:\n\n| ($ millions)                | December 31, 2023   | As % of Total Mortgages   | December 31, 2022   | As % of Total Mortgages   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Mortgages by credit rating: |                     |                           |                     |                           |\n| Insured                     | 4,023               | 28%                       | 4,035               | 28%                       |\n| AAA                         | 7                   | -%                        | -                   | -%                        |\n| AA                          | 1,990               | 14%                       | 1,665               | 12%                       |\n| A                           | 5,158               | 37%                       | 5,483               | 37%                       |\n| BBB                         | 2,425               | 17%                       | 2,686               | 19%                       |\n| BB and lower                | 530                 | 4%                        | 538                 | 4%                        |\n| Impaired                    | 12                  | -%                        | 14                  | -%                        |\n| Total mortgages             | 14,145              | 100%                      | 14,421              | 100%                      |\n\n## Loan Portfolio\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we held $40.5 billion of loans (December 31, 2022 - $36.8 billion). Private placement loans provide diversification by type of loan, industry segment and borrower credit quality. The private placement loan portfolio consists of senior secured and unsecured loans to large- and mid-market corporate borrowers, securitized lease/loan obligations secured by a variety of assets, and project finance loans in sectors such as power and infrastructure.\n\nThe credit risk ratings in the following table were established in accordance with the internal rating process described in this MD&A under the heading K - Risk Management - 9 - Risk Categories - Credit Risk Management Governance and Control. As at December 31, 2023, 95% of our total loan portfolio is investment grade (December 31, 2022 - 95%).\n\n| ($ millions)            | December 31, 2023   | As % of Total  Loans   | December 31, 2022   | As % of Total  Loans   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Loans by credit rating: |                     |                        |                     |                        |\n| AAA                     | 180                 | -%                     | 285                 | 1%                     |\n| AA                      | 5,815               | 14%                    | 5,101               | 14%                    |\n| A                       | 16,507              | 42%                    | 15,257              | 41%                    |\n| BBB                     | 15,896              | 39%                    | 14,284              | 39%                    |\n| BB and lower            | 1,950               | 5%                     | 1,872               | 5%                     |\n| Impaired                | 107                 | -%                     | 33                  | -%                     |\n| Total loans             | 40,455              | 100%                   | 36,832              | 100%                   |",

Derivatives\n\nThe fair value of derivative assets held by the Company was $2,183 million, while the fair value of derivative liabilities was $1,311 million as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $2,095 million and $2,351 million, respectively).\n\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rate, equity market and currency fluctuations and in replication strategies to reproduce permissible investments. Use of derivatives in these risk mitigation strategies does not mitigate all risk exposure; rather, they are used to keep us within our risk tolerance limits.\n\nIn addition to the general policies and monitoring, we use a variety of tools in counterparty risk management. Over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivative transactions are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (\"ISDA\") Master Agreements. A Credit Support Annex accompanies most of the ISDAs, which establish requirements for collateral.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe values associated with our derivative instruments are presented in the following table. Notional amounts serve as the basis for payments calculated under derivatives contracts and are generally not exchanged.\n\n| ($ millions)                               | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Net fair value asset (liability)           | 872                 | (256)               |\n| Total notional amount                      | 70,421              | 69,768              |\n| Credit equivalent amount (1)               | 1,594               | 1,173               |\n| Risk-weighted credit equivalent amount (1) | 34                  | 26                  |\n\nThe net fair value of derivatives was an asset of $872 million as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - liability of $256 million). The increase in net fair value was driven by an increase in interest rate contracts due to downward shifts in yield curves and an increase in foreign exchange contracts due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against U.S. dollar.\n\nThe total notional amount of our derivatives increased to $70.4 billion as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $69.8 billion). The change in notional amount is mainly attributable to an increase in foreign exchange contracts used for hedging foreign currency assets.\n\nCertain of our derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships for accounting purposes, and represented $1.0 billion, or 1.5% of the total notional amount. Derivatives are designated in hedging relationships for accounting purposes to minimize accounting mismatches. These hedging relationships are documented at inception and hedge effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis.\n\nDerivatives designated in qualifying hedging relationships for accounting purposes include foreign exchange agreements and equity forwards. We designate certain foreign exchange agreements in cash flow hedging relationships to manage foreign currency fluctuations associated with FVOCI assets. Additionally, we designate certain equity forwards in cash flow hedging relationships for anticipated payments of awards under certain stock-based compensation plans.\n\n## Credit Equivalent Amount\n\nAs the regulator of the Canadian insurance industry, OSFI provides guidelines to quantify the use of derivatives. The credit equivalent amount (\"CEA\"), a measure used to approximate the potential credit exposure, is determined as the replacement cost of the derivative contracts with a positive fair value plus an amount representing the potential future credit exposure.",

The purchaser receives protection against the decline in the value of the referenced financial instrument as a result of specified credit events such as default or bankruptcy. The Company sells credit protection through CDS to replicate credit exposure of an underlying reference security and enhance investment returns. The credit risk ratings of the underlying reference securities for single name contracts were established in accordance with the internal rating process described in section K - Risk Management - 9 Risk Categories - Credit Risk Management Governance and Control.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the credit default swap protection sold by credit rating of the underlying reference security.\n\n|                                                 | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                    | Notional amount     | Fair value          | Notional amount     | Fair value          |\n| Single name credit default swap contracts       |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| AA                                              | -                   | -                   | 20                  | -                   |\n| A                                               | 491                 | 5                   | 587                 | 4                   |\n| BBB                                             | 540                 | 15                  | 706                 | 5                   |\n| BB                                              | -                   | -                   | 47                  | 7                   |\n| Total single name credit default swap contracts | 1,031               | 20                  | 1,360               | 16                  |\n| Credit default swap index contracts             | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Total credit default swap contracts sold        | 1,031               | 20                  | 1,360               | 16                  |\n\nAdditional detail on our derivative portfolio by derivative type is provided in Note 6.A.v of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 6. Investment Properties\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we held $9.7 billion of investment properties (December 31, 2022 - $10.1 billion). The decrease in our investment property portfolio is predominantly driven by declines in market value, mainly in the office sector, and property sales in the industrial sector.\n\n## Investment Properties by Type and Geography\n\n|                    | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023        | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023        |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| ($ millions)       | Office              | Industrial          | Retail              | Multi-family residential | Other               | Total               | % of Total by  Geography |\n| Canada             | 1,558               | 3,318               | 921                 | 1,468                    | 668                 | 7,933               | 82%                      |\n| United States      | 476                 | 1,046               | 232                 | 34                       | 2                   | 1,790               | 18%                      |\n| Total              | 2,034               | 4,364               | 1,153               | 1,502                    | 670                 | 9,723               | 100%                     |\n| % of Total by Type | 21%                 | 45%                 | 12%                 | 15%                      | 7%                  | 100%                |                          |\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\n| ($ millions)       | Office   | Industrial   | Retail   | Multi-family residential   | Other   | Total   | % of Total by  Geography   |\n|--------------------|----------|--------------|----------|----------------------------|---------|---------|----------------------------|\n| Canada             | 1,747    | 3,434        | 926      | 1,322                      | 612     | 8,041   | 79%                        |\n| United States      | 647      | 1,105        | 263      | -                          | 1       | 2,016   | 20%                        |\n| Europe             | 12       | 16           | 17       | -                          | -       | 45      | 1%                         |\n| Total              | 2,406    | 4,555        | 1,206    | 1,322                      | 613     | 10,102  | 100%                       |\n| % of Total by Type | 24%      | 45%          | 12%      | 13%                        | 6%      | 100%    |                            |",

Loss Allowance and Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe balance of the total loss allowance was $89 million as at December 31, 2023 (January 1, 2023 (1) - $75 million) and the provision for credit losses was $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## J.  Capital and Liquidity Management\n\nCapital and liquidity management is core to our business as an insurance company. We ensure adequate capital for the protection of our policyholders, Clients and creditors, while managing capital adequacy and allocation across our businesses for the benefit of our shareholders. In addition, we maintain strong financial flexibility by ensuring that sufficient liquid assets are available to cover our anticipated payment obligations and funding requirements. We invest in various types of assets with a view to matching them with liabilities of various durations.\n\nThe regulatory environments in which we operate are expected to evolve as governments and regulators work to develop the appropriate level of financial regulation required to ensure that capital, liquidity and risk management practices are sufficient to withstand severe economic downturns.\n\n## 1. Capital\n\nWe have a capital risk policy designed to maintain a strong capital position and to provide the flexibility necessary to take advantage of growth opportunities, to support the risk associated with our businesses and to optimize shareholder return. Our capital risk policy is also intended to provide an appropriate level of risk management over capital adequacy risk, which is defined as the risk that capital is not or will not be sufficient to withstand adverse economic conditions, to maintain financial strength, or to allow the Company and its subsidiaries to take advantage of opportunities for expansion. Our capital base is structured to exceed minimum regulatory and internal capital targets and to maintain strong credit and financial strength ratings, while maintaining a capital-efficient structure. Capital is managed both on a consolidated basis under principles that consider all the risks associated with the business as well as at the business group level under the principles appropriate to the jurisdictions in which we operate. The capital of our foreign subsidiaries is managed on a local statutory basis in a manner commensurate with their individual risk profiles.\n\nSun Life, including all of its business groups, engages in a capital planning process annually in which capital deployment options, capital raising and dividend recommendations are presented to the Board of Directors (\"Board\"). Capital reviews are regularly conducted which consider the potential impacts under various business, interest rate and equity market scenarios. Relevant components of these capital reviews, including dividend recommendations, are presented to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. The Board is responsible for the approval of our annual capital plan and quarterly shareholder dividends.\n\nThe Company's capital risk policy establishes policies, operating guidelines and procedures that govern the management of capital. The capital risk policy is reviewed annually by the Risk Committee and any changes are approved by the Board. Our Corporate Capital and Risk Management functions are responsible for the development and implementation of the capital risk policy.\n\nThe Company's capital base consists mainly of common shareholders' equity. Other sources of capital include preferred shares and other equity instruments, non-controlling interests, equity in the participating account, CSM, subordinated debt issued by SLF Inc. and Sun Life Assurance, and certain other capital securities that qualify as regulatory capital. For Canadian regulatory purposes, our capital also includes innovative capital instruments issued by Sun Life Capital Trust.",

For dividend reinvestments, we may, at our option, issue common shares of SLF Inc. from treasury at a discount of up to 5% to the volume-weighted average trading price or direct that common shares be purchased on behalf of participants on the open market through the TSX and alternative Canadian trading platforms (collectively, the \"Exchanges\") at the market price. Common shares of SLF Inc. acquired by participants through optional cash purchases may also be issued from treasury or purchased through the Exchanges at SLF Inc.'s option, in either case at no discount. Commencing with the dividends payable on March 31, 2016 and until further notice, common shares purchased under the Plan were purchased on the open market. There are no applicable discounts because the common shares are being purchased on the open market and are not being issued from treasury.\n\nSLF Inc. grants stock options to certain employees. These options are granted at the closing price of SLF Inc.'s common shares on the TSX on the grant date.\n\nAs at January 26, 2024, SLF Inc. had 584,631,371 common shares, 3,428,382 options to acquire SLF Inc. common shares, and 52,200,000 Class A Shares outstanding.\n\n## 2. Capital Adequacy\n\nOSFI has indicated that it will review the effectiveness of the LICAT guideline and update it to keep abreast of development in the life insurance industry and evolving risk measurement and management practices.\n\n## SLF Inc.\n\nSLF Inc. is a non-operating insurance company and was subject to OSFI's LICAT guideline as at December 31, 2023. In accordance with this guideline, SLF Inc. manages its capital in a manner commensurate with its risk profile and control environment, and SLF Inc.'s regulated subsidiaries comply with the capital adequacy requirements imposed in the jurisdictions in which they operate. SLF Inc.'s consolidated capital position is above its internal target. As at December 31, 2023, SLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio was 149%. For additional information, refer to section G Financial Strength in this document.\n\n## Sun Life Assurance\n\nSun Life Assurance, SLF Inc.'s principal operating life insurance subsidiary in Canada, was subject to OSFI's LICAT guideline as at December 31, 2023. With a LICAT ratio of 141% as at December 31, 2023, Sun Life Assurance's capital ratio is well above OSFI's supervisory ratio of 100% and regulatory minimum ratio of 90%. The LICAT guideline uses a risk-based approach for measuring specific life insurer risks and for aggregating the results to calculate the amount of a life insurer's regulatory required capital to support these risks. Certain of these risk components, along with available capital, are sensitive to changes in equity markets and interest rates as outlined in the section K - Risk Management of this document. For additional information, refer to section G - Financial Strength in this document.",

Our operations maintained capital levels above the minimum local regulatory requirements during 2023 and 2022. Additional information on capital and regulatory requirements for our foreign subsidiaries and foreign operations is provided in SLF Inc.'s AIF under the heading Regulatory Matters.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we have two internal reinsurance arrangements with affiliated reinsurance companies, in Delaware and Michigan, relating to our closed block of individual universal life insurance products with no-lapse guarantee benefits issued in the U.S. The Delaware reinsurance structure was established in 2013 and finances excess U.S. statutory reserves for certain universal life policies issued between January 2000 and February 2006. The financing of U.S. statutory reserve requirements in excess of those required under IFRS for the Delaware reinsurance company is supported by a guarantee from SLF Inc. The Michigan reinsurance structure was established in 2007 for certain policies issued between March 2006 and December 2008. The entity was redomesticated from Vermont to Michigan in 2020. Under the Michigan reinsurance structure, the related excess U.S. statutory reserve requirements are similarly supported by a guarantee from SLF Inc.\n\n## 3. Shareholder Dividends\n\nThe declaration, amount and payment of dividends by SLF Inc. is subject to the approval of our Board and is dependent on our results of operations, our reported net income, financial condition, cash requirements and contractual restrictions. Capital management activities, as well as regulatory considerations and macro-economic factors including the economic outlook for the jurisdictions in which we do business, are also considered along with other factors. The Board reviews the level of dividends on a quarterly basis.\n\nA regular and appropriate level of dividend payout and growth provides a stable source of return to common shareholders.\n\nWe target an underlying dividend payout ratio of between 40% and 50% based on underlying EPS.\n\nDuring 2023, our dividend payout ratio to common shareholders based on our underlying EPS basis was 47% and on reported EPS was 57%.\n\nTotal common shareholder dividends declared in 2023 were $3.00 per share, compared to $2.76 in 2022.",

Principal Sources and Uses of Funds\n\nOur primary source of funds is cash provided by operating activities, including premiums, investment management fees and net investment income. These funds are used primarily to pay policy benefits, dividends to policyholders, claims, commissions, operating expenses, interest expenses and shareholder dividends. Excess cash flows generated from operating activities are generally invested to support future payment requirements. We also raise funds from time to time, through borrowing and issuing of securities, to finance growth, acquisitions or other needs.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, we maintained net cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities totaling $13.2 billion. In addition to providing for near-term funding commitments, cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities include amounts that support short-term payment obligations.\n\nNet cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities increased $2.0 billion. The table below outlines our principal sources and uses of cash.\n\n| ($ millions)                                                        | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Net cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period                  | 9,372   | 7,693   |\n| Cash flows provided by (used in):                                   |         |         |\n| Operating activities                                                | 5,612   | 4,311   |\n| Investing activities                                                | (559)   | (2,863) |\n| Financing activities                                                | (3,086) | (71)    |\n| Changes due to fluctuations in exchange rates                       | (169)   | 302     |\n| Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents                    | 1,798   | 1,679   |\n| Net cash and cash equivalents, end of period                        | 11,170  | 9,372   |\n| Short-term securities, end of period                                | 2,003   | 1,841   |\n| Net cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities, end of period | 13,173  | 11,213  |",

Liquidity\n\nWe generally maintain an overall asset liquidity profile that exceeds requirements to fund insurance contract liabilities under prescribed adverse liability demand scenarios. To strengthen our liquidity further, we actively manage and monitor our:\n\n- \u00b7 Capital levels\n- \u00b7 Asset levels\n- \u00b7 Matching position\n- \u00b7 Diversification and credit quality of investments\n- \u00b7 Cash forecasts and actual amounts against established targets\n\nWe are subject to various regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ability of SLF Inc.'s subsidiaries to pay dividends and transfer funds is regulated in certain jurisdictions and may require local regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of specific conditions in certain circumstances. Through effective cash management and capital planning, SLF Inc. ensures that its subsidiaries, as a whole and on a stand-alone basis, are properly funded and maintain adequate liquidity to meet obligations, both individually and in aggregate.\n\nSLF Inc.

These covenants include, but are not limited to, the maintenance of total equity by SLF Inc. of at least $12 billion, tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. SLF Inc.'s total equity was $24.2 billion as at December 31, 2023.\n\nOur failure to comply with the covenants under the committed credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. This could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize letters of credit under the facility. A failure by SLF Inc. (or any of its subsidiaries) to pay an obligation due for an amount exceeding $250 million would also result in an event of default under the committed credit facility described above.\n\nBased on our historical cash flows and liquidity management processes, we believe that the cash flows from our operating activities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for us to satisfy debt service obligations and to pay other expenses as they fall due.",

Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Company has an established Risk Management Framework (\"Risk Framework\") approved by the Board that prescribes a comprehensive set of protocols and programs that need to be followed in conducting business activities. The risks that arise when providing products and services to Clients, which are in line with our Purpose to help our Clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives, are managed within these protocols and programs. Effective risk management is critical to the overall profitability, competitive market positioning and long-term financial viability of the Company. While all risks cannot necessarily be eliminated or known with certainty, the Risk Framework seeks to ensure that risks to a business undertaking are appropriately managed to achieve the Company's business objectives over time and are not expected to exceed pre-established boundaries for risk taking. The Risk Framework, corporate strategy and business objectives are all aligned and risk management protocols and programs are embedded within every business segment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These governance requirements are summarized below.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring the governance of all risks across the enterprise and has primary responsibility for taking action to ensure risk management policies, programs and practices are in place. By approving our Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Policy and providing ongoing oversight of the risk management programs, the Board monitors that significant risks are appropriately identified and managed. The Board oversees business and strategic risk through review and approval of the Business and Strategic Plans, and regularly discusses key themes, issues and risks arising in connection with the design or implementation of these plans.\n\nThe Risk Committee is a standing committee of the Board whose primary functions are to assist the Board with oversight of the management of current and emerging risks enterprise-wide, and of the Risk Management function to ensure that management has in place programs, policies, processes and controls designed to identify and effectively manage the significant risks to which the Company is exposed and has sufficient capital to underpin those risks. It reviews and approves all risk management policies and reviews compliance with those policies. In addition, where the Board has delegated risk oversight to other committees of the Board (\"Board Committees\"), the Risk Committee provides the Board with an integrated view of oversight of risk management across all Board committees. The Risk Committee regularly monitors the Company's risk profile to ensure it is within the agreed risk appetite and that the Company's capital position exceeds regulatory capital requirements, and monitors and recommends to the Board for approval, the specific risk limits allocated to the businesses and the annual Capital Plan. The Risk Committee also oversees risk management activities of our subsidiaries and joint ventures under the Company's management control and risks posed to the Company through its other joint ventures.\n\nThe Governance, Investment & Sustainability Committee ('GISC') of the Board is responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing (i) the development of effective corporate governance guidelines and processes, including those addressing the effectiveness of the Board and its committees and director succession planning and recruitment; (ii) the Company's Investment Plan and investment performance, including investment practices, procedures and controls related to the management of the general fund investment portfolio; (iii) sustainability matters including the Company's Sustainability Policy, Sustainability Report and Sustainability Plan; and (iv) compliance and compliance management programs, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the identification and management of compliance risk, and the",

It reviews the implications of key enterprise risks, including people and culture risks pertaining to compensation design and human resources practices. In addition, the Committee reviews compensation matters, including the remuneration of executives who have a material impact on the risk exposure of the Company.\n\n## Senior Management Committees\n\nThe Executive Risk Committee (\"ERC\") provides executive management oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management activities. This includes the review and articulation of the risk appetite, overseeing that the risk profile is within the agreed risk appetite, and overseeing that there are policies, processes and controls are in place to identify and effectively manage the significant risks, in accordance with the risk appetite and the overall objective of promoting a balanced business and product model to achieve agreed upon risk-adjusted returns and allocate capital accordingly.\n\nThe Investment & Credit Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing critical matters related to the on-going management of the Company's General Fund. Accordingly, the Committee is responsible for overseeing, monitoring and reviewing current and potential credit and investment risk exposures, other credit and investment risk management issues and future credit and investment risk management strategies.\n\nThe Corporate Asset Liability Management Committee is responsible for providing oversight and input on the Asset Liability Management framework, policies, guidelines, limits, measurement and performance assessment applicable to the management of market and liquidity risks, as well as providing oversight of asset liability management and hedging strategy changes.\n\nThe Operational Risk & Compliance Committee is responsible for providing oversight of the Company's operational and compliance risk management practices, current and emerging operational risk exposures, and the processes to ensure ongoing identification of major operational and compliance risks facing the Company.\n\nThe Insurance Risk Committee is responsible for providing oversight and direction on insurance risk exposures facing the Company and to ensure that effective insurance risk management practices and controls are in place. This includes reviewing the current and emerging insurance risk profile; engaging in review of topical insurance, reinsurance and underwriting risk issues; and reviewing and recommending changes to the insurance risk measurement methodology.\n\n## Accountabilities\n\nPrimary accountability for risk management is delegated by the Board to our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). The CEO further delegates responsibilities throughout the Company through management authorities and responsibilities. The CEO delegates accountability for the various classes of risk management to our executive officers, who are accountable for ensuring that the management of risk in the scope of their business accountability is in accordance with the Board approved Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Policy and risk management policies.\n\n## 3. Risk Universe\n\nAs a large financial services organization operating in a complex industry, the Company encounters a variety of risks and uncertainties. We face risks in formulating our business strategy and business objectives, in carrying on our business activities in the pursuit of our strategy and objectives, and from external factors such as changes in the economic, geopolitical, environmental, social and regulatory landscape. We are subject to financial and insurance risks that are connected to our liabilities and with the management and performance of our assets, including how we match returns from assets with the payment of liabilities to our Clients. Each of these risks is also considered from the perspective of different types of uncertainties under which either the outcomes and/or their probabilities of occurrence are unknown. The Risk Framework covers all risks and these have been grouped into six major categories: business and strategic, credit, market, liquidity, insurance and operational risks. The Risk Framework sets out the key risk management processes in the areas of risk: appetite, identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting. The Risk Framework sets out both qualitative and quantitative measures and processes to control the risk the Company will bear in respect of each of these categories of risk and in aggregate.\n\n## 4. Risk Appetite\n\nOur Risk Appetite Policy defines the amount and type of risk we are willing to accept in pursuit of our business objectives, and is approved by the Board. It is forward-looking and our Strategic Plan, Capital Plan, Business Plan and business objectives are established within its boundaries.\n\nThe Company's risk appetite seeks to balance the various needs, expectations, risk and reward perspectives and investment horizons of all stakeholders. In particular, our risk appetite supports the pursuit of shareholder value while ensuring that the Company's ability to pay claims and fulfill policyholder commitments is not compromised.\n\nThe Company's risk appetite is the primary mechanism to operationalize its risk philosophy and the boundaries of permissible risk-taking across the enterprise. It ensures that business activities are assessed against performance criteria that are appropriately risk-adjusted. Our risk appetite supports the objective of maintaining adequate capital, managing earnings volatility, managing operational risk and managing",

        "page_content": "liquidity. To accomplish this, our risk appetite includes a wide array of qualitative and quantitative standards that reflect the Company's overall risk management principles and values.\n\nWe are generally comfortable accepting diversifiable risks where we are capable of using risk pooling to create liability portfolios with relatively low volatility. We take risk where we have internal expertise such as actuarial, underwriting, claims management, investment, risk management and distribution or where reinsurance partners are able to supplement our internal expertise. We prefer risks that arise across various dimensions, including products, geographies (intra-national and international), distribution channels and asset classes in order to maximize diversification opportunities.\n\nOur Risk Appetite Policy sets out specific constraints which define the aggregate level of risk that the Company is willing to accept. We translate our risk appetite constraints into specific risk limits by risk class and business segment. Our risk profile is measured, managed and monitored regularly to ensure that we operate within our risk appetite. Our risk appetite limits are reviewed periodically to reflect the risks and opportunities inherent in our evolving business strategies and operating environment.\n\n## 5. Risk Management Policies\n\nIn order to support the effective communication, implementation and governance of our Risk Framework, we have codified our processes and operational requirements in a comprehensive series of risk management frameworks, policies and operating guidelines. These frameworks, policies and guidelines promote the application of a consistent approach to managing risk exposures across our global business platform. The Board and Board Committees regularly review and approve significant changes to the risk management framework and policies and regularly review management's reporting and attestation on compliance to these policies.\n\n## 6. Risk Management Process\n\nThe risk management process as set out in our Risk Framework is described below:\n\n## Risk Identification and Measurement\n\nAll business segments employ a common approach to identify and measure risks. Business segments have accountability for identifying and managing risks facing their business. We have a process to identify and monitor key and emerging risks that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation. We evaluate potential correlations and inter-connections between various risk events and categories, and monitor key and emerging risks, emerging regulatory and rating agency requirements, or industry developments and various research reports.\n\nRisk measurement involves determining and evaluating potential risk exposures and includes a number of techniques, such as monitoring key risk indicators, probability-severity assessments, stress testing (including sensitivity and scenario analysis), reverse stress testing and stochastic modelling. Risk measures are expressed in quantitative and qualitative terms.\n\nA robust stress testing program is an essential component of the Company's Risk Framework used to measure, monitor, understand and mitigate the Company's risk exposures and to ensure ongoing capital adequacy under plausible stress events. Stress testing is performed on key metrics such as earnings, regulatory capital ratios and liquidity to identify and monitor potential vulnerabilities to key risk drivers and ensure that the Company is operating within its risk appetite.\n\nWe develop and test a range of scenarios based on our internal assessment and regulatory guidance. Emerging risks are one of the inputs to determine stress test scenarios. Sensitivity testing is conducted on a regular basis and measures the earnings and regulatory capital and liquidity impacts from changes in underlying risk factors, assuming that there are no changes to any of the other risk factors. Sensitivity testing is performed for individual risks and for consolidated risk exposures at different levels of stress and at various levels of aggregation. Scenario testing involves changes to a number of risk factors to assess the impact of and interaction between these risk factors. These scenarios include integrated scenario testing, reverse scenario testing and key assumption sensitivity testing. We also use the Financial Condition Testing (\"FCT\") process, as prescribed by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, to satisfy requirements under the Canadian insurance Company Act, and OSFI regulations, to annually stress test capital.\n\n## Risk Management, Monitoring and Reporting\n\nRisk management decisions are formed by evaluating whether the assessed risk for a business activity aligns to our risk appetite and meets the objective of risk-adjusted returns.\n\nMonitoring processes include oversight by the Board, which is exercised through Board Committees and Senior Management committees described in the Risk Governance and Accountabilities section in this document.\n\nAt least on a quarterly basis, the Senior Management committees, Board Committees and the Board review reports that summarize our risk profile against the Board approved risk appetite, including the exposures across our principal risks, any changes in risk trends, forwardlooking view of risks and emerging risks. These committees also review the effectiveness of the risk management strategies presented in the reports. On a regular basis, the Board and the Board Committees review and approve any significant changes to risk management frameworks and policies for the management of risk and review compliance with these frameworks and policies.\n\n## 7. Three Lines of Defence\n\nThe Company has adopted the Three Lines of Defence (\"LOD\") model to provide a consistent, transparent and clearly documented allocation of accountability and segregation of functional responsibilities. This segregation of responsibility helps to establish a robust control framework that promotes transparent and independent challenge of all risk taking activities, and that encourages all functions to engage in self-critical examination to foster continuous improvement of the management of risk in our business.",

        "page_content": "The first line of defence is represented by the business segment management who own the risks that are intrinsic to the business and have the primary responsibility to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report these risks. Some of the first LOD risk related responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Identification of key and emerging risks;\n- \u00b7 Manage, measure, monitor and report on risk within their business operations;\n- \u00b7 Accountability for business results and the risks taken to achieve business results and the resulting impact of those risks; and\n- \u00b7 Operating within risk appetite and according to risk management policies.\n\nThe second line of defence includes the Chief Risk Officer (\"CRO\") and heads of the oversight functions who are responsible for providing independent oversight of our Company-wide risk management programs. The CRO is responsible for developing our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Policy, and for overseeing the development and implementation of risk management strategies aimed at optimizing the riskreturn profile of the Company. The CRO is supported by a network of business segment risk officers. The functional heads support the CRO in the implementation and communication of our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Policy. Some of the key second LOD risk related responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Establishment of the risk management framework and policies;\n- \u00b7 Providing oversight and effective independent challenge of first line; and\n- \u00b7 Independent reporting to Senior Management committees and the Board of Directors on the level of risk against risk appetite.\n\nThe third line of defence responsibilities are distinct from first and second LOD responsibilities. The Internal Audit function is the third LOD and is responsible for providing independent assurance to Senior Management and the Board and/or Board Committees on the design and operational effectiveness of the risk management practices and internal controls carried out by first LOD and second LOD. Internal Audit provides a quarterly opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls, risk management and governance processes to the Audit Committee of the Board. In addition, the Risk Committee may engage third-party independent reviews to supplement the third LOD review of the effectiveness of the Company's risk management programs.\n\n## 8. Risk Culture and Philosophy\n\nWe have built a strong corporate culture on a foundation of ethical behaviour, high business standards, integrity and respect. The Board establishes the \"tone from the top\" and is accountable to ensure that the CEO and Senior Management create and sustain a culture of integrity throughout the organization. We work together through our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion and sustainability to fulfill our Purpose of helping our Clients to achieve lifetime financial security and to live healthier lives.\n\nRisk culture relates to how we behave and respond, in addition to the requirements we set. It enables and rewards taking the right risks in an informed manner. It enables effective challenge and transparency regarding risks and outcomes without fear of reprisal. It drives us to understand Client needs and preferences so that we can act in their best interests. In order to support employees in fulfilling their role, we have taken action to ensure our risk protocols and procedures are well defined and embedded in our day-to-day business activities, assess that appropriate resources and training are provided, establish and communicate a common risk philosophy and a high bar for integrity and conduct, and encourage every employee to openly identify risk exposures and communicate escalating risk concerns. The following seven elements support our Risk Culture:\n\n- \u00b7 Establishing tone from the top;\n- \u00b7 Encouraging transparency in risk-taking;\n- \u00b7 Performing effective challenge in conducting business decisions;\n- \u00b7 Aligning incentives and risk management practices;\n- \u00b7 Effectively communicating the risk culture expectations;\n- \u00b7 Establishing clear accountabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Promoting ongoing resiliency\n\nA key premise of our culture is that all employees have an important role to play in managing the Company's risks. Risk Management is embedded in the enterprise's culture, which encourages ownership and responsibility for risk management at all levels. Our compensation programs are aligned to the organization's risk management practices through our governance structure for the design and approval of incentive compensation plans and processes used to support the alignment of compensation and risk management. We continuously reinforce and embed the culture through communication and training on risk culture elements at various forums and across various levels through training on the Code of Conduct annually, reinforcing accountability through performance reviews and compensation, continually monitoring processes and outcomes that drive expected behaviours, and through defining roles, responsibilities and expectations in the risk management policies.\n\nThe Company's risk philosophy includes the following core principles:\n\n## Strategic Alignment\n\nOur corporate strategy and business objectives are required to be established within the boundaries and prescriptions set out in the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Policy. This requires us to consider whether a business activity, intended to achieve the business and financial objectives, will result in a risk profile that we are willing to accept and which we are prepared to manage. We have established a range of explicit risk appetite constraints for credit, market, insurance, operational and liquidity risks. Business and strategic risk is managed through our strategic and business planning process and through controls over the implementation of these Strategic and Business Plans. Risks associated with activities outside our risk appetite or outside the acceptable defined risks are avoided.\n\n## Client and Other Stakeholder Interests\n\nOur Risk Appetite Policy considers the interests of a large number of key stakeholders, including Clients, shareholders, debt-holders, employees, regulators, distributors, rating agencies and other capital markets participants. The policy prescribes how to balance the needs, expectations, risk and reward perspectives, and investment horizons of these different stakeholders.\n\nEffective risk management requires that objectives and incentives be aligned to ensure management's decisions are consistent with the Company's risk philosophy and risk appetite. To ensure this, the Business Plans and strategies are independently tested to ensure that they",

Compensation programs for employees are approved by the Board and the Board Committees and are aligned with the Company's risk philosophy, values, business and risk management strategies, and the long-term interests of stakeholders. In establishing annual performance objectives, we consider risk management goals to ensure that business decisions are consistent with the desired risk and return profile of the Company.\n\n## Capability Alignment\n\nWe seek out profitable risk-taking opportunities in those areas where we have established risk management skills and capabilities. Conversely, we endeavour to avoid or transfer risks that are beyond our risk-taking capability. Our ability to measure and evaluate risks, the quality of our risk governance and control environment, the depth and quality of our risk responses and the robustness of our pricing strategies are particularly important capabilities that we assess.\n\n## Portfolio Perspective\n\nIn evaluating a particular risk, consideration is given to a portfolio perspective of risk and return including the explicit recognition of the impacts of diversification and concentration and how different risks interact with each other. This perspective is extended to the development of risk mitigation and pricing strategies, recognizing that often the most cost-effective way of managing risk involves utilizing available relationships already inherent in our businesses.\n\n## Risk-Adjusted Returns\n\nFinancial return metrics used to assess business activities are developed in consideration of the constraints set out in the Risk Appetite Policy, and reflect the expected costs of mitigation and the cost of risk capital required to support the risk taking activity.\n\n## Culture\n\nCulture is the sum of the shared assumptions, values and beliefs that create the unique character of an organization. Our culture encourages behaviour aligned with goals for long-term value creation. It defines the appropriate behaviour for any given situation, governs the interaction with Clients and affects how employees identify with the organization. Our culture has significant potential to impact our risk profile. An organization's culture impacts its ability to create value and to protect value. Maintaining the right balance of risk-taking and risk control activities is a key organizational capability and fundamental to our long-term sustainable success.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability addresses the Company's material economic, environmental and social impacts, and the opportunities and risks they present in delivering long-term value to all key stakeholders for the Company. Our sustainability ambition is to help our Clients achieve lifetime financial security, foster healthier lives and advance sustainable investing. Policies, processes and controls are in place to identify and effectively manage significant risks, including sustainability-related risks, to which we are exposed while operating within the Risk Appetite Policy. Sustainability is considered essential to long-term business success and as a result, is a priority for Sun Life in order to maximize our impact on society and create competitive advantage and differentiation for our business.\n\n## 9. Risk Categories\n\nThe text and tables in the following section of this MD&A include our disclosure on credit, market and liquidity risks in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments - Disclosures (\"IFRS 7\") and IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts , as well as a discussion on how we measure risk and our objectives, policies and methodologies for managing these risks. Disclosures in accordance with IFRS 7 and IFRS 17 are identified by a vertical line in the left margin of the page. The identified text and tables represent an integral part of our audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The fact that certain text and tables are identified with a vertical line does not imply that these disclosures are of any greater importance than any other text or tables, and the Risk Management disclosure should be read in its entirely.\n\nThe disclosures in the Risk Management section of this document should be considered carefully together with other information in this MD&A and in the 2023 AIF, our Consolidated Financial Statements and other reports and materials that we file with securities regulators.\n\nIn this section, segregated funds include segregated fund guarantees, variable annuities and investment products, and includes Run-off reinsurance in U.S. In-force Management.\n\nOur Risk Framework groups all risks into six major risk categories: market, insurance, credit, business and strategic, operational and liquidity risks.\n\n## i. Market Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWe are exposed to market risk, which is defined as the risk that the value or future cash flows of insurance and investment contract liabilities or financial assets will fluctuate because of changes or volatility in market prices. Market risk includes equity, interest rate and spread, real estate, foreign currency, and inflation risks.\n\n## Market Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe employ a wide range of market risk management practices and controls as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Income and regulatory capital sensitivities are monitored, managed, and reported against pre-established risk appetite limits for equity, interest rate, credit spread, real estate and foreign currency risks.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive asset-liability management and hedging policies, programs and practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory solvency requirements include risk-based capital requirements and are monitored regularly.\n- \u00b7 Product Design and Pricing Policy requires a detailed risk assessment and pricing provisions for material risks.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as FCT, are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse market movements.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contract liabilities are established in accordance with Canadian actuarial standards of practice and International Financial Reporting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n\nSpecific market risks and our risk management strategies are discussed below in further detail.\n\n## Equity Risk\n\nEquity risk is the potential for financial loss arising from declines or volatility in equity market prices. We are exposed to equity risk from a number of sources.\n\nWe generate revenue in our asset management businesses and from certain insurance and annuity contracts where fees are levied on account balances that are affected directly by equity market levels. Accordingly, we have further exposure to equity risk as adverse fluctuations in the market value of such assets will result in corresponding adverse impacts on revenue, income, and the contractual service margin. In addition, declining and volatile equity markets may have a negative impact on sales and redemptions (surrenders) in these businesses, and this may result in further adverse impacts on net income, the contractual service margin, and capital.\n\nA portion of our exposure to equity risk arises in connection with benefit guarantees on segregated fund products, some participating insurance contracts, some adjustable insurance contracts, and some universal life contracts. These benefit guarantees may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. The cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors, including general capital market conditions, our hedging strategies, policyholder behaviour and mortality experience, each of which may result in negative impacts on net income, the contractual service margin, and capital.\n\nWe also have direct exposure to equity markets from the investments supporting other general account liabilities, surplus, and employee benefit plans. These exposures fall within our risk-taking philosophy and appetite, and are therefore generally not hedged.\n\n## Interest Rate and Spread Risk\n\nInterest rate and spread risk includes the potential for financial loss arising from changes in the value of insurance and investment contract liabilities and financial assets due to changes or volatility in interest rates or spreads. In practice, when asset cash flows and the policy obligations they support are not matched, this may result in the need to either sell assets to meet policy payments and expenses or reinvest excess asset cash flows in unfavourable interest rate or credit spread environments. This risk is managed in our asset-liability management program. Details of the asset-liability management program are discussed under the heading \"Market Risk Management Governance and Control\" in section K - Risk Management in this document.\n\nOur primary exposure to interest rate and spread risk arises from insurance and investment contracts that contain guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates, maximum premium rates, settlement options, guaranteed annuitization options and minimum benefits. If investment returns fall below guaranteed levels, we may be required to increase liabilities or capital in respect of these contracts. The guarantees attached to these products may be applicable to both past premiums collected and future premiums not yet received. Segregated fund contracts provide benefit guarantees that are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. Exposure to guarantees is managed within our risk appetite limits through our asset-liability management program, which may include the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors, swaps, futures and swaptions. The impact of these guarantees on net income, contractual service margin, and capital are included in the disclosed market risk sensitivities.\n\nSignificant changes or volatility in interest rates or spreads could have a negative impact on sales of certain insurance and annuity products, and adversely impact the expected pattern of redemptions (surrenders) on existing policies. Increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads may increase the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts, potentially forcing us to liquidate assets at a loss. While we have established hedging programs in place and our insurance and annuity products often contain surrender mitigation features, these may not be sufficient to fully offset the adverse impact of changes in interest rates or spreads. Declines in interest rates or narrowing spreads can result in compression of the net spread between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders. Declines in interest rates or narrowing spreads can also result in increased asset calls, mortgage prepayments, and net reinvestment of positive cash flows at lower yields, and therefore adversely impact our profitability and financial position. Negative interest rates may additionally result in losses on our cash and short-term deposits and low or negative returns on our fixed income assets impacting our profitability.\n\nWe also have direct exposure to interest rates and spreads from investments supporting other general account liabilities, surplus and employee benefit plans. Higher interest rates or wider spreads will reduce the value of our existing assets. Conversely, lower interest rates or a narrowing of spreads will result in reduced investment income on new fixed income asset purchases. These exposures fall within our risktaking philosophy and appetite and are therefore generally not hedged.\n\nA sustained low interest rate environment may additionally adversely impact our net income, CSM, capital, and our ability to implement our business strategy and plans. This may be realized through lower sales, less profitable new business, changes in the pattern of redemptions on existing policies, among other impacts.",

We are exposed to real estate risk and may experience financial losses resulting from the direct ownership of real estate investments or indirectly through fixed income investments secured by real estate property, leasehold interests, ground rents, and purchase and leaseback transactions. Real estate price risk may arise from external market conditions, inadequate property analysis, inadequate insurance coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals, or from environmental risk exposures. We hold real estate investments that support general account liabilities and surplus, and fluctuations in value will affect our net income, CSM, and capital. A material and sustained increase in interest rates may lead to deterioration in real estate values.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the result of mismatches in the currency of our assets and liabilities (inclusive of capital), and cash flows. This risk may arise from a variety of sources such as foreign currency transactions and services, foreign currency hedging, investments denominated in foreign currencies, investments in foreign subsidiaries and net income from foreign operations. Changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates, including a change to currencies that are fixed in value to another currency, could adversely affect our net income, contractual service margin and capital.\n\nAs an international provider of financial services, we operate in a number of countries, with revenues and expenses denominated in several local currencies. In each country in which we operate, we generally maintain the currency profile of assets to match the currency of liabilities and required capital. This approach provides an operational hedge against disruptions in local operations caused by currency fluctuations. Foreign currency derivative contracts such as currency swaps and forwards are used as a risk management tool to manage the currency exposure in accordance with our Asset Liability Management Policy. As at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have a material foreign currency risk exposure.\n\nChanges in exchange rates can affect our net income and surplus when financial results in functional currencies are translated into Canadian dollars. Net income earned outside of Canada is generally not currency hedged and a weakening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the Canadian dollar can have a negative impact on our net income reported in Canadian currency. A strengthening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the Canadian dollar would have the opposite effect. Regulatory capital ratios could also be impacted by changes in exchange rates.\n\n## Inflation Risk\n\nInflation risk is the potential for financial loss arising from changes in inflation rates. This risk results from insurance contract liabilities that are linked to market measures of inflation such as the Consumer Price Index. The primary sources for this risk exposure are from certain group and retail annuity contracts and group long term disability contracts. In these contracts, the annuity and disability benefit payments may be linked to an indexing formula containing an inflation price index. Benefit payments linked to inflation indices may also include various caps, floors and averaging mechanisms that vary across product designs.\n\nExposure to inflation risk is managed within our asset-liability management program, primarily by investing in inflation linked assets to match liability exposures.\n\n## Market Risk Sensitivities\n\nWe use a variety of methods and measures to manage and quantify our market risk exposures. These include duration and key rate duration management, convexity measures, cash flow gap analysis, scenario testing, and sensitivity testing of earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe measurement of liabilities and assets are affected by the level of equity market performance, interest rates, credit and swap spreads and other market risk variables. The following sections set out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income (1) , contractual service margin, OCI and SLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio to certain instantaneous changes in market variables as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (2) .",

Net income sensitivities to interest rates and spreads are driven by the net impact on liabilities and the assets backing them. Lower interest rates or a narrowing of spreads will result in increased liabilities for insurance contracts, offset by increased values of the assets backing general account liabilities. Higher interest rates or a widening of spreads will result in decreased liabilities for insurance contracts, offset by decreased values of the assets backing general account liabilities. Further detail on the impact of changes or volatility in market prices on assets and liabilities is provided under the headings \"Equity Risk\", \"Interest Rate and Spread Risk\", and \"Real Estate Risk\" above.\n\nOCI sensitivities are impacted by changes in the market value of assets classified as FVOCI. The market value of FVOCI fixed income assets, which are held primarily in our surplus and investment contract segments, increases with lower interest rates or a narrowing of spreads, and decreases with higher interest rates or a widening of spreads.\n\nAs these market risk sensitivities reflect an instantaneous impact on net income, CSM, OCI and SLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio, they do not include impacts over time such as the effect on fee income in our asset management businesses.\n\nRefer to Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to Sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates.\n\n## Equity Market Sensitivities\n\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income, CSM, OCI and SLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio to certain instantaneous changes in equity market prices as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (1) .\n\n| ($ millions, unless otherwise noted)                                                                                                                                                                                   |                     |                     | As at December 31, 2023   | As at December 31, 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Change in Equity Markets (2)(3)(4)                                                                                                                                                                                     | 25% decrease        | 10% decrease        | 10% increase              | 25% increase              |\n| Potential impact on net income  (after-tax)                                                                                                                                                                            | (400)               | (175)               | 175                       | 425                       |\n| Potential impact on CSM (pre-tax)                                                                                                                                                                                      | (625)               | (250)               | 250                       | 600                       |\n| Potential impact on LICAT ratio (5)                                                                                                                                                                                    | 3.0% point decrease | 1.0% point decrease | 1.0% point increase       | 2.5% point increase       |\n| ($ millions, unless otherwise noted)                                                                                                                                                           As at December 31, 2022 |                     |                     | (1)                       | (1)                       |\n| Change in Equity Markets (2)(3)(4)                                                                                                                                                                                     | 25% decrease        | 10% decrease        | 10% increase              | 25% increase              |\n| Potential impact on net income  (after-tax)                                                                                                                                                                            | (300)               | (125)               | 125                       | 325                       |\n| Potential impact on CSM (pre-tax)                                                                                                                                                                                      | (650)               | (250)               | 250                       | 625                       |\n| Potential impact on LICAT ratio (5)                                                                                                                                                                                    | 3.5% point decrease | 1.0% point decrease | 0.5% point increase       | 2.0% point increase       |",

Significant changes in market variables may result in other than proportionate impacts on our sensitivities.\n\n## Potential Impact of Change in Ultimate Risk-Free Rate\n\nInterest rate sensitivities do not include any impact from changes to the ultimate risk-free rate. Our estimated sensitivity to a 10 basis point decrease in the ultimate risk-free rate assumed in our insurance contract liabilities is a decrease in reported net income of approximately $50 million after-tax, and a decrease in CSM of approximately $25 million.\n\n## Credit Spread and Swap Sensitivities\n\nCredit spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in credit spreads on our asset and liability values (including provincial government bonds, corporate bonds, and other fixed income assets).

Changes and interaction between the level and term movements in interest rates and credit spreads can shift the interest rate scenario applied in the LICAT calculation causing a discontinuity where capital requirements change materially. In 2020, OSFI updated the LICAT guideline for interest rate risk requirements for participating businesses to be smoothed over six quarters. As a result, the actual impact to the LICAT ratio from participating businesses in any quarter will reflect the scenarios from current quarter as well as the prior five quarters and switching between the scenarios would have the effect of offsetting the previous impacts over time. It should be noted that switching of the scenario can also change the direction of our sensitivities.\n\nIn Q4'23, SLF Inc. experienced a scenario switch, resulting in no change in the LICAT ratio. For SLF Inc., assuming no further scenario switches, the remaining impact of one percentage point is expected to decrease the LICAT ratio over the next five quarters.\n\nIn Q4'23, Sun Life Assurance experienced a scenario switch, resulting in one-and-a-half percentage change to the LICAT ratio. For Sun Life Assurance, assuming no further scenario switches, the remaining impact of four-and-a-half percentage points is expected to decrease the LICAT ratio over the next five quarters.\n\n## Market Risk Management Strategies\n\nMarket risk is managed at all stages during the product life cycle including product design and development, ongoing review and positioning of our suite of products, and ongoing asset-liability management and hedge re-balancing. Our market risk management strategies are developed based on policies and operating guidelines at the enterprise level, business segment level and product level. Liabilities having a similar risk profile are grouped together and a customized investment and hedging strategy is developed and implemented to optimize return within our risk appetite limits.\n\nWe have implemented asset-liability management and hedging programs involving regular monitoring and adjustment of market risk exposures using assets, derivative instruments and repurchase agreements to maintain market risk exposures within our risk appetite. The general availability and cost of these hedging instruments may be adversely impacted by a number of factors including changes in interest rates, increased volatility in capital markets, and changes in the general market and regulatory environment within which these hedging programs operate. In particular, regulations for derivatives could impose additional costs and could affect our hedging strategy. In addition, these programs may themselves expose us to other risks.\n\nIn general, market risk exposure is mitigated by the assets supporting our products. This includes holdings of fixed income assets such as bonds and mortgages. Derivative instruments may supplement these assets to reduce the risk from cash flow mismatches and mitigate the market risk associated with liability features and optionality.",

        "page_content": "## General Account Insurance and Annuity Products\n\nMost of our expected net income sensitivity to changes in interest rates and equity markets is derived from our general account insurance and annuity products. We have implemented market risk management strategies to mitigate a portion of the market risk related to our general account insurance and annuity products.\n\nIndividual insurance products include universal life and other long-term life and health insurance products. Major sources of market risk exposure for individual insurance products include the reinvestment risk related to future premiums on regular premium policies, asset reinvestment risk on both regular premium and single premium policies and the guaranteed cost of insurance. Interest rate risk for individual insurance products is typically managed on a duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment policy or guidelines. Targets and limits are established so that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and assets are re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of assets and derivative instruments. A portion of the longer-term cash flows are backed with equities and real estate.\n\nFor participating insurance products and other insurance products with adjustable features, the investment strategy objective is to provide a total rate of return given a constant risk profile over the long term.\n\nFixed annuity products generally provide the policyholder with a guaranteed investment return or crediting rate. Interest rate risk for these products is typically managed on a duration basis, within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment guidelines. Targets and limits are established so that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite. Exposures are monitored frequently, and assets are re-balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of fixed income assets and derivative instruments.\n\nCertain insurance and annuity products contain minimum interest rate guarantees. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit potential financial loss due to reductions in asset earned rates relative to contract guarantees. These typically involve the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors, swaps and swaptions.\n\nCertain insurance and annuity products contain features which allow the policyholders to surrender their policy at book value. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss due to changes in interest rate levels and policyholder behaviour. These typically involve the use of dynamic hedging strategies and the purchase of interest rate swaptions.\n\nCertain products have guaranteed minimum annuitization rates. Market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss and typically involve the use of fixed income assets, interest rate swaps, and swaptions.\n\n## Segregated Funds Products\n\nCertain segregated fund products provide benefit guarantees, which are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. The cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors including general capital market conditions, our hedging activities, policyholder behaviour and mortality experience, each of which may result in negative impacts on net income, the contractual service margin and capital.\n\nOur hedging programs use derivative instruments and fixed income assets to mitigate the interest rate, equity market, and foreign currency exposure of our segregated fund contracts. As at December 31, 2023, over 90% of our segregated fund contracts, as measured by fund values, were included in a hedging program. While a large percentage of contracts are included in the hedging program, not all of our market risk exposure related to these contracts is hedged. For those segregated fund contracts included in the hedging program, we generally hedge the value of expected future net claims costs and associated risk adjustments for non-financial risk.\n\nOur hedging strategy is applied both at the line of business or product level and at the total company level using a combination of hedging techniques such as re-balancing of short-dated interest rate and equity derivative contracts and longer-dated put options. We actively monitor our overall market exposure and may implement tactical hedge overlay strategies in order to align sensitivities with risk management objectives.\n\nThe impact of segregated fund guarantees and associated hedging programs on net income, contractual service margin and capital are included in the disclosed market risk sensitivities.",

These sensitivities are calculated independently for each risk factor, generally assuming that all other risk variables stay constant. The sensitivities do not take into account indirect effects such as potential impacts on goodwill impairment or valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\nWe have provided measures of our net income sensitivity to instantaneous changes in equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads, swap spreads, real estate price levels, and capital sensitivities to changes in equity price levels, interest rates and credit spreads. The LICAT ratio and CSM sensitivities are non-IFRS financial measures, and for additional information, see section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in this document. The cautionary language which appears in this section is applicable to all net income, CSM, OCI and LICAT ratio sensitivities.\n\nActual results can differ materially from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including differences in the pattern or distribution of the market shocks, the interaction between these risk factors, model error, or changes in other assumptions such as business mix, effective tax rates, policyholder behaviour, currency exchange rates and other market variables relative to those underlying the calculation of these sensitivities. The extent to which actual results may differ from the indicative ranges will generally increase with larger movements in risk variables. Our sensitivities as at December 31, 2022 (1) have been included for comparative purposes only.\n\nSensitivities to interest rates and credit spreads assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve or a parallel shift in the indicated spreads across the entire term structure, with no change to the ultimate risk-free rate or ultimate liquidity premium. Realized sensitivities may be significantly differently from those illustrated based on factors such as different terms to maturity, geographies, asset classes and derivative types, and ratings.\n\nThe sensitivities reflect the composition of our assets and liabilities as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (1) , respectively. Changes in these positions due to new sales or maturities, asset purchases/sales, or other management actions could result in material changes to these reported sensitivities. In particular, these sensitivities reflect the expected impact of hedging activities based on the hedging programs in place as at the respective calculation dates. The actual impact of hedging activity can differ materially from that assumed in the estimated sensitivities due to ongoing hedge re-balancing activities, changes in the scale or scope of hedging activities, changes in the cost or general availability of hedging instruments, basis risk (i.e., the risk that hedges do not exactly replicate the underlying portfolio experience), model risk, and other operational risks in the ongoing management of the hedge programs or the potential failure of hedge counterparties to perform in accordance with expectations.\n\nOur hedging programs may themselves expose us to other risks, including basis risk, volatility risk, and increased levels of derivative counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, model risk and other operational risks. These factors may adversely impact the net effectiveness, costs, and financial viability of maintaining these hedging programs and therefore adversely impact our profitability and financial position. While our hedging programs are intended to mitigate these effects (e.g., hedge counterparty credit risk is managed by maintaining broad diversification, dealing primarily with highly-rated counterparties, and transacting through over-the-counter (\"OTC\") contracts cleared through central clearing houses, exchange-traded contracts or bilateral OTC contracts negotiated directly between counterparties that include credit support annexes), residual risk, potential reported earnings and capital volatility remain.",

        "page_content": "The sensitivities are based on methods and assumptions in effect as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (1) , as applicable. Changes in the regulatory environment, assumptions or methods used to measure assets and liabilities after those dates could result in material changes to the estimated sensitivities. Changes in market risk variables in excess of the changes illustrated may result in other than proportionate impacts.\n\nThe sensitivities reflect the CSM as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (1) . For insurance contracts measured using the VFA, where the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risk not arising from the underlying items adjusts the CSM, changes in the CSM balance will affect the sensitivity of income to changes in market risk variables.\n\nOur LICAT sensitivities may be non-linear and can change due to the interrelationship between market rates and spreads, actuarial assumptions and our LICAT calculations.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, our sensitivities should only be viewed as indicative estimates of the underlying sensitivities of each factor under these specialized assumptions, and should not be viewed as predictors of our future income, OCI, CSM or capital. Given the nature of these calculations, we cannot provide assurance that actual impacts will be consistent with the estimates provided.\n\nInformation related to market risk sensitivities should be read in conjunction with the information contained in section N - Accounting and Control Matters - 1 - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in this document. Additional information on market risk can be found in Note 2 and Note 6 of the 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the Risk Factors section in the 2023 AIF.\n\n## ii. Insurance Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nInsurance risk is the uncertainty of product performance due to actual experience emerging differently than expected in the areas of mortality, morbidity and longevity. In addition, policyholder behaviour, product design and pricing, expense and reinsurance risks impact multiple risk categories, including insurance risk.\n\n## Insurance Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe employ a wide range of insurance risk management practices and controls, as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Income and regulatory capital sensitivities are monitored, managed and reported against pre-established risk appetite limits for policyholder behaviour, mortality, morbidity and longevity risks.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive Insurance Risk Policy, guidelines and practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 The global underwriting manual aligns underwriting practices with our corporate risk management standards and ensures a consistent approach in insurance underwriting.\n- \u00b7 Board-approved maximum retention limits are in place. Amounts issued in excess of these limits are reinsured.\n- \u00b7 Detailed procedures, including criteria for approval of risks and for claims adjudication are established and monitored for each business segment.\n- \u00b7 Underwriting and risk selection standards and procedures are established and overseen by the corporate underwriting and claims risk management function.\n- \u00b7 Diversification and risk pooling is managed by aggregation of exposures across product lines, geography and distribution channels.\n- \u00b7 We use reinsurance to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks and to provide additional capacity for growth.\n- \u00b7 The Insurance Risk Policy and Investment & Credit Risk Policy establish acceptance criteria and protocols to monitor the level of reinsurance ceded to any single reinsurer or group of reinsurers.\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance counterparty risk is monitored, including annual reporting of reinsurance exposure to the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Various limits, restrictions and fee structures are introduced into plan designs in order to establish a more homogeneous policy risk profile and limit potential for anti-selection.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory solvency requirements include risk-based capital requirements and are monitored regularly.\n- \u00b7 The Product Design and Pricing Policy requires detailed risk assessment and pricing provision for material risks.\n- \u00b7 Company specific and industry level experience studies and drivers of earnings analysis are monitored and factored into valuation, renewal and new business pricing processes.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as FCT, are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse movements in insurance risk factors.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels.\n\nThe concentration for insurance risks is monitored geographically and its adverse effect is mitigated through a diversified product portfolio, product design, underwriting standards and practices, utilizing reinsurance as well as the Company's global operation. Specific to the reinsurance risk, the concentration is measured by aggregating the exposure to each reinsurance counterparty across all Business Groups to ensure it does not exceed a predefined risk level.\n\nSpecific insurance risks and our risk management strategies are discussed below in further detail.",

        "page_content": "## Policyholder Behaviour Risk\n\nWe can incur losses due to adverse policyholder behaviour relative to the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products regarding lapse of policies or exercise of other embedded policy options.\n\nUncertainty in policyholder behaviour can arise from several sources including unexpected events in the policyholder's life circumstances, the general level of economic activity (whether higher or lower than expected), changes in the financial and capital markets, changes in pricing and availability of current products, the introduction of new products, changes in underwriting technology and standards, as well as changes in our financial strength or reputation. Uncertainty in future cash flows affected by policyholder behaviour can be further exacerbated by unexpected behaviour during times of economic turbulence or at key option exercise points in the life of an insurance contract.\n\nVarious types of provisions are built into many of our products to reduce the impact of uncertain policyholder behaviour. These provisions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Surrender charges that adjust the payout to the policyholder by taking into account prevailing market conditions.\n- \u00b7 Limits on the amount that policyholders can surrender or borrow.\n- \u00b7 Restrictions on the timing of policyholders' ability to exercise certain options.\n- \u00b7 Restrictions on both the types of funds policyholders can select and the frequency with which they can change funds.\n- \u00b7 Policyholder behaviour risk is also mitigated through reinsurance on some insurance contracts.\n\nInternal experience studies are used to monitor, review and update policyholder behaviour assumptions as needed, which could result in updates to policy liabilities.\n\n## Mortality and Morbidity Risk\n\nMortality and morbidity risk is the risk that future experience could be unfavourable relative to the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products. Mortality and morbidity risk can arise in the normal course of business through random fluctuation in realized experience, through catastrophes, as a result of a pandemic, or in association with other risk factors such as product development and pricing risk. Adverse mortality and morbidity experience could also occur through systemic anti-selection, which could arise due to poor plan design, or underwriting process failure or the development of investor-owned and secondary markets for life insurance policies.\n\nExternal factors could adversely affect our life insurance, health insurance, critical illness, disability, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses. Morbidity experience could be unfavourably impacted by external events, such as pandemics, increases in disability claims during economic slowdowns and increases in high medical treatment costs and growth in utilization of specialty drugs. This introduces the potential for adverse financial results.\n\nDetailed uniform underwriting procedures have been established to determine the insurability of applicants and to manage exposure to large claims. These underwriting requirements are regularly scrutinized against industry guidelines and oversight is provided through a corporate underwriting and claim management function.\n\nThe Insurance Risk Policy, which is approved by the Risk Committee, sets out limits on the maximum amount of insurance risk per life that may be retained. Amounts in excess of the Board-approved maximum retention limits are reinsured. On a single life or joint-first-to-die basis our retention limit is $40 in Canada and US$40 outside of Canada. For survivorship life insurance, our maximum global retention limit is $50 in Canada and US$50 outside of Canada. In certain markets and jurisdictions, retention levels below the maximum are applied. Reinsurance is utilized for numerous products in most business segments, and placement is done on an automatic basis for defined insurance portfolios and on a facultative basis for individual risks with certain characteristics.\n\nConcentration risk exposure is monitored on group policies in a single location. We do not have a high degree of concentration risk to single individuals or groups due to our well-diversified geographic and business mix. The largest portion of mortality risk within the Company is in North America. Individual and group insurance policies are underwritten prior to initial issue and renewals, based on risk selection, plan design, and rating techniques.\n\nRetention limits per life vary by geographic region and amounts in excess of limits are reinsured to ensure there is no exposure to unreasonable concentration of risk.\n\n## Longevity Risk\n\nLongevity risk is the potential for losses arising from adverse changes in rates of mortality improvement relative to the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products. This risk can manifest itself slowly over time as socioeconomic conditions improve and medical advances continue. It could also manifest itself more quickly, for example, due to medical breakthroughs that significantly extend life expectancy. Longevity risk affects contracts where benefits or costs are based upon the likelihood of survival and higher than expected improvements in insured life expectancy could therefore increase the ultimate cost of these benefits (for example, annuities, pensions, pure endowments, some segregated funds, and specific types of health contracts).\n\nTo improve management of longevity risk, we monitor research in the fields that could result in a change in expected mortality improvement. Stress-testing techniques are used to measure and monitor the impact of extreme mortality improvement on the aggregate portfolio of insurance and annuity products.\n\n## Product Design and Pricing Risk\n\nProduct design and pricing risk is the risk a product does not perform as expected, causing adverse financial consequences. This risk may arise from deviations in realized experience versus assumptions used in the pricing of products. Risk factors include uncertainty concerning future investment yields, policyholder behaviour, mortality and morbidity experience, sales levels, mix of business, expenses and taxes. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the terms of these policies or contracts may not allow for sufficient adjustments to maintain expected profitability. This could have an adverse effect on our profitability and capital position.",

        "page_content": "Our Product Design and Pricing Policy, approved by the Risk Committee, establishes the framework governing our product design and pricing practices and is designed to align our product offerings with our strategic objectives and risk-taking philosophy. Consistent with this policy, product development, design and pricing processes have been implemented throughout the Company. New products follow a stage-gate process with defined management approvals based on the significance of the initiative. Each initiative is subject to a risk assessment process to identify key risks and risk mitigation requirements and is reviewed by multiple stakeholders. Additional governance and control procedures are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Pricing models, methods, and assumptions are subject to periodic internal peer reviews.\n- \u00b7 Experience studies, drivers of earnings analysis, and product dashboards are used to monitor actual experience against those assumed in pricing and valuation.\n- \u00b7 On experience rated, participating, and adjustable products, emerging experience is reflected through changes in policyholder dividend scales as well as other policy adjustment mechanisms such as premium and benefit levels.\n- \u00b7 Limits and restrictions may be introduced into the design of products to mitigate adverse policyholder behaviour or apply upper thresholds on certain benefits.\n\n## Expense Risk\n\nExpense risk is the risk that future expenses are higher than the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products. This risk can arise from general economic conditions, unexpected increases in inflation, slower than anticipated growth, or reduction in productivity leading to increases in unit expenses. Expense risk occurs in products where we cannot or will not pass increased costs onto the policyholder and will manifest itself in the form of a liability increase or a reduction in expected future profits.\n\nWe closely monitor expenses through an annual budgeting process and ongoing monitoring of any expense gaps between unit expenses assumed in pricing and actual expenses.\n\n## Reinsurance Risk\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various insurance businesses. Reinsurance risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse developments in reinsurance markets (for example, discontinuance or diminution of reinsurance capacity, or an increase in the cost of reinsurance), insolvency of a reinsurer or inadequate reinsurance coverage. While reinsurance arrangements provide for the recovery of claims arising from the liabilities ceded, we retain primary responsibility to the policyholders.\n\nRates for our in-force reinsurance treaties can be either guaranteed or adjustable for the life of the ceded policy. Changes in reinsurance market conditions, including actions taken by reinsurers to increase rates on existing and new coverage and our ability to obtain appropriate reinsurance, may adversely impact the availability or cost of maintaining existing or securing new reinsurance capacity, with adverse impacts on our business strategies, profitability and financial position. There is a possibility of rate increases or renegotiation of some of the legacy reinsurance contracts by our reinsurers, as the global reinsurance industry continues to review and optimize their business models. In addition, changes to the regulatory treatment of reinsurance arrangements could have an adverse impact on our capital position.\n\nWe have an Insurance Risk Policy approved by the Risk Committee and an Investment & Credit Risk Policy approved by the Governance, Investment & Sustainability Committee, which set acceptance criteria and processes to monitor and manage the level of reinsurance ceded to any single reinsurer. These policies are regularly reviewed and approved by the relevant Board Committee to ensure the alignment with our risk appetite levels and reinsurance risk guidelines.\n\nThe policies set the acceptance criteria which verify if a reinsurer qualifies as a suitable reinsurance counterparty, having the capability, expertise, governance practices and financial capacity to assume the risks being considered. In addition, a periodic due diligence is performed on the existing reinsurance counterparties, including an internal credit assessment for reinsurance counterparties with whom we have material exposure.\n\nThe exposure to each reinsurance counterparty is monitored closely to ensure that no single reinsurance counterparty represents an undue level of credit risk and does not exceed the predefined limits. In order to diversify our reinsurance risk, there is generally more than one reinsurance counterparty supporting a reinsurance pool. A summary of the reinsurance counterparty credit risk exposures is reported annually to the Risk Committee.\n\nTo further increase the reinsurance risk control, our reinsurance agreements include provisions to allow actions to be taken, such as recapture of ceded risk (at a potential cost to the Company), in the event that the reinsurance counterparty loses its legal ability to carry on business through insolvency or regulatory action.\n\nIn case of unfavourable developments in the reinsurance markets, we also have an option to discontinue or implement changes to the new sales of our products to better manage the associated risks.\n\nAdditional information on insurance risk can be found in Note 7 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Risk Factors section in the AIF.\n\n## iii. Credit Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nCredit risk is the possibility of loss from amounts owed by our borrowers or financial counterparties. We are subject to credit risk in connection with issuers of securities held in our investment portfolio, debtors, structured securities, reinsurers, counterparties (including derivative, repurchase agreement and securities lending counterparties), other financial institutions and other entities. Losses may occur when a counterparty fails to make timely payments pursuant to the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement or when the counterparty's credit rating or risk profile otherwise deteriorates. Credit risk can also arise in connection with deterioration in the value of, or ability to realize, any underlying security that may be used as collateral for the debt obligation. Credit risk can occur as a result of broad economic conditions, challenges within specific sectors of the economy, or from issues affecting individual companies. Events that result in",

These internal rating decisions for new fixed income investments and ongoing review of existing rating decisions are independently adjudicated by Corporate Risk Management.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive due diligence processes and ongoing credit analyses are conducted.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory solvency requirements include risk-based capital requirements and are monitored regularly.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive compliance monitoring practices and procedures including reporting against pre-established investment limits are in place.\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance exposures are monitored to ensure that no single reinsurer represents an undue level of credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as FCT, are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse credit developments.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contract liabilities are established in accordance with Canadian actuarial standards of practice.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n\nOur core principles of credit risk management include asset diversification, fundamental research and analysis of cash flows, proactive and continuous risk monitoring, active management and relative value assessment, all with the objective of optimizing risk-adjusted returns, with due consideration for the impacts of capital and taxation.\n\nWe rate fixed income investments primarily through the use of internally developed scorecards which combine an estimated probability of default and loss given default to determine an expected loss and credit risk rating. This rating is expressed using a 22-point scale that is generally consistent with those used by external rating agencies, and is based on detailed examination of the borrower's, or issuer's, credit quality and the characteristics of the specific instrument. The probability of default assessment is based on borrower-level or issuer-level analysis, which encompasses an assessment of industry risk, business strategy, competitiveness, strength of management and other financial information. The loss given default assessment is based on instrument-level analysis, which considers the impact of guarantees, covenants, liquidity and other structural features. These scorecards provide input to stochastic value-at-risk models and are used to stress test the portfolio, which provide insight into the distribution and characteristics of credit risk within our portfolios. In accordance with our policies and under normal circumstances, our ratings cannot be higher than the highest rating provided by certain Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\"NRSROs\"). Certain assets, including those in our sovereign debt and asset-backed securities portfolios, are assigned a rating based on ratings provided by NRSROs using a priority sequence order of Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS Limited.\n\nAdditional information on credit risk can be found in Note 6 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Risk Factors section in the AIF.\n\n## iv. Business and Strategic Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nBusiness and strategic risk is the risk of loss from the inability to adequately identify, plan or implement an appropriate strategy to achieve strategic and business objectives or adapt to changes in Client behaviours, the external business, economic, geopolitical, regulatory or environmental and social landscape or when assumptions made in strategy are not realized as expected.\n\n## Business and Strategic Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe employ a wide range of business and strategic risk management practices and controls, as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Business and strategic risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring, review and reporting to Senior Management, the Board and the Board Committees.\n- \u00b7 Business and strategic risk is managed through our strategic and business planning process and controls over the implementation of these plans. These plans are reviewed and discussed at the executive level and the key themes, issues and risks emerging are discussed by the Board and the Board Committees.\n- \u00b7 Our Business and Strategic Plans are subject to approval by the Board, which also receives regular reviews of implementation progress against key Business Plan objectives.\n- Comprehensive policies including the Risk Management Framework, Risk Appetite Policy, Product Design and Pricing Policy, Mergers\n- \u00b7 and Acquisition Policy, Capital and Liquidity Management Framework and Capital Risk Policy are in place.\n\n\u00b7\n\nOur corporate strategy and business objectives are established within the boundaries of the Risk Appetite Policy. Our business\n\nstrategies and plans are designed to align with our risk appetite, our capital position and our financial performance objectives.\n\n- \u00b7 Our risk appetite is periodically assessed, taking into consideration the economic and regulatory environments in which we operate.\n- \u00b7 Merger, acquisition, strategic investments and divestiture transactions are governed by a Board-approved Merger and Acquisition Risk Management Policy and significant transactions require the approval of the Board.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as FCT, are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Key and emerging risks are identified, monitored and reported, including emerging regulatory changes that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n\nWe regularly review and adapt our business strategies and plans to take account of changes in the external business, economic, geopolitical and regulatory environments in which we operate. Our business strategies and plans are designed to align with our risk appetite, our capital position and our financial performance objectives. We periodically reassess our risk appetite taking into consideration the economic, regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate.\n\nSpecific business and strategic risks are discussed below in further detail.\n\n## Geopolitical Risk\n\nGeopolitical risk is the wide array of risks associated with conflict or tensions between states as well as events or trends with global or international dimensions that increase risks for the operations of companies. We operate in various geographies and our business and financial operations are susceptible to regional and global economic, geopolitical and regulatory changes.  Geopolitical risk may lead to increased volatility in the global capital and energy markets, difficulty in conducting business in certain geographies, an increased threat of targeted cyber-attacks, and has the potential to introduce reputational risk.\n\n## Economic Risk\n\nWe may be affected by economic and capital markets conditions and economic shocks around the globe as a result of increasingly connected global markets. Factors such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, market volatility, housing prices, consumer spending, saving and debt, business investment and inflation around the globe can affect the business and economic environments in which we operate. In addition, adverse economic conditions often arise in conjunction with volatile and deteriorating capital markets conditions, which can have an adverse impact on Client behaviour, our sales and profitability, credit and financial strength ratings, and capital and liquidity positions.\n\n## Execution Risk\n\nOur business strategies and plans are dependent on the successful execution of organizational and strategic initiatives designed to support the growth of our business. Our ability to manage the execution of these initiatives effectively and prioritize initiatives directly affects our ability to execute our strategies. Identifying and implementing the right set of initiatives is critical to achieving our Business Plan targets. Failure to identify and implement the right set of initiatives could also lead to cost structure challenges and inability to achieve our growth objectives.\n\n## Distribution Risk\n\nFailure to achieve planned distribution scale could materially impact our financial and strategic objectives. This includes the inability to attract and retain intermediaries and agents at a cost that is financially feasible to the Company, or to develop online sales and Client support capabilities and technologies. Distribution risk may also be influenced where our distribution or product strategy and related services (including online sales and Client support capabilities and technologies) are not developed, modified or executed in line with our strategic objectives or in consideration of the changes in Client behaviour or our regulatory environment. In addition, the lack of a well-diversified distribution model in the jurisdictions in which we do business may cause over-reliance on agency channel or key partners.\n\n## Risks Relating to Mergers, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Investments\n\nWe regularly explore opportunities to selectively acquire other businesses or to divest ourselves of all or part of certain businesses, in support of our growth and strategic objectives. Any transaction carries risks associated with economic, operational, strategic, financial, tax, legal, regulatory, compliance, environmental and social, and other factors.\n\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to make an appropriate acquisition in a desired market or business line or unable to realize the financial and strategic benefits of the transactions due to competitive factors, regulatory requirements or other aspects. There is a risk that the capital utilized to finance any transaction may limit our ability to deploy further capital to pursue other opportunities and initiatives. These risks could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial and strategic objectives.\n\nOur ability to realize the contemplated economic, financial, and strategic benefit of any transaction that we enter into is contingent on several factors. These include the effective separation and/or integration of the transferred businesses, restructure and/or reorganization of related businesses, and retention of key personnel to effectively execute these transactions. In addition, post-closing activities and the harmonization of any differences in organizational culture may require the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract management's attention from our day-to-day business. Further, anticipated synergies and other benefits may not materialize due to a failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Any of these risks, if realized, could prevent us from achieving the expected outcomes from a transaction and impact our financial and strategic objectives.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, we have established procedures to govern the evaluation, execution and integration of mergers and acquisitions transactions. Regular updates on execution and integration risks relating to these transactions are provided to the Board, its Committees and senior management teams, as appropriate, along with any mitigants developed to address such risks.\n\n## Competitive Environment\n\nCompetition from insurance companies, banks, asset managers, mutual fund companies, financial planners and other service providers (including new entrants and non-traditional financial services companies) is intense, and could adversely affect our business in certain countries.\n\nThe businesses in which we engage are highly competitive and our ability to sell our products is dependent on many factors, including scale, price and yields offered, distribution channels, digital capabilities, financial strength ratings, range of product lines and product and service quality, brand strength, investment performance, historical dividend levels and the ability to provide value added services to distributors and Clients. In certain markets, some of our competitors may be superior to us on one or more of these factors. Our competitors have significant",

        "page_content": "potential to disrupt our business through targeted strategies to reduce our market share which may include targeting our key people or bancassurance partners and other distributors or aggressively pricing their products. Our ability to achieve our Business Plans and strategies depends significantly upon our capacity to anticipate and respond quickly to these competitive pressures.\n\nTechnology is driving rapid change in the financial services sector and is enabling new entrants to compete or offer services to our competitors to enhance their ability to compete in certain segments of the insurance, wealth and asset management markets. The emergence of new technologies such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced analytics may have an impact on the financial services sector and how companies interact with their stakeholders. Our current competitors or new entrants may use these or other new technologies to provide services in various areas such as customized pricing, proactive outreach to Clients and targeted marketing in order to strengthen their Client relationships and influence Client behaviour. The impact of disruption from changing technology and innovation by traditional and non-traditional competitors who may offer a better user experience, functionality or lower priced products and may have lower distribution costs will require us to adapt at a more rapid pace and may create margin pressures. The risk of disruption may also impact our distribution models as new and low cost digital-based business models emerge in connection with the distribution of financial services and products, such as insurtechs and robo-advisors. These risks are evolving rapidly with an increasing number of digital users and are difficult to anticipate and respond to proactively, and may adversely impact our profitability and financial position.\n\n## Investment Performance\n\nInvestment performance risk is the possibility that we fail to achieve the desired return objectives on our investment portfolio, or that our asset management businesses fail to design or execute investment strategies in order to achieve competitive returns on the products and managed accounts offered by these businesses. Failure to achieve investment objectives may adversely affect our revenue and profitability through slower growth prospects and adverse impacts on policyholder or Client behaviour.\n\n## Changes in Legal and Regulatory Environment\n\nMost of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Changes to legislation, regulations or government policies, or the manner in which they are interpreted or enforced, may require that we make significant changes to our strategy and may result in increased implementation costs and diversion of resources to manage the change. These changes could impact financial reporting, accounting processes, capital requirements, the regulatory framework for our products and services, the regulation of selling practices, sales intermediaries and product offerings, solvency requirements, executive compensation, and corporate governance practices and could impose restrictions on our foreign operations (such as limits on foreign ownership of local companies). All of these changes could have an adverse effect on our business and operations. Our failure to comply with existing and evolving regulatory requirements could also result in regulatory sanctions and could affect our relationships with regulatory authorities and our ability to execute our business strategies and plans.\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk\n\nOur financial performance, operations, and reputation may be adversely affected if we do not adequately prepare for the direct or indirect impacts of environmental and social risks. Environmental and social risks include but are not limited to environmental damage on properties owned or managed by us, climate change-related physical and transition risks, as well as issues of public health and inequality. These risks may occur in our direct operations, investing activities or other areas of our value chain.\n\nBusiness units in our Asset Management pillar integrate ESG considerations in their investment decision-making for Sun Life assets and Client assets, where applicable. Existing ESG risks are considered, subject to data availability and materiality, in initial and ongoing reviews and assessments of public equities, public fixed income, private fixed income, real estate, infrastructure and commercial mortgage investments, among others. In addition, we monitor our third-party managers in the asset management, general account and fund platform businesses through our International Investment Centre ('IIC'). In the due diligence and monitoring of third-party managers, the IIC, functioning as an investment research and consulting group, assesses each manager's consideration of ESG risks in its investment processes, as well as other relevant sustainability factors, and monitors them on an ongoing basis. These activities may be undertaken on behalf of, or in partnership with, the relevant Sun Life businesses. These businesses may also undertake their own due diligence activities.\n\nWe engage in and monitor environmental, social and broader sustainability developments in part through our participation as a signatory to the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (\"PRI\"), United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (\"UNEP FI\"), including the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, and CDP.\n\nIn line with our strategy and our Purpose, Sun Life aims to drive further actions that create a cleaner, more inclusive, and sustainable future. Strong governance will help us deliver on our commitments and remain accountable to our stakeholders:\n\n- \u00b7 Our Chief Sustainability Officer ('CSO') leads enterprise-wide efforts to embed sustainable practices across our businesses.\n- \u00b7 Our Executive Sustainability and Climate Change Council ('ESC'), chaired by our CSO, is composed of senior executives from Sun Life's Global Leadership Team. The ESC is the decision-making body for the approval of cross-enterprise sustainability programs and issues management (e.g., human rights), as well as external commitments and targets including related progress oversight (e.g., net zero, sustainable investing, diverse supplier spend). ESC members also provide oversight on the company's implementation of OSFI Guideline B-15: Climate Risk Management and development of the enterprise climate transition plan.\n- \u00b7 Our Global Sustainability Leadership Team ('GSLT') is composed of senior executives from each of our business groups and key functions. The GSLT advises on and implements our Sustainability Strategy.\n\nWe report on sustainability performance, including reporting related to climate change and other environmental and social issues, in our annual Sustainability Report, which is published in tandem with our Annual Report and is available at sunlife.com/sustainability.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change is one of the defining issues of our time. Governments, regulators, investors, Clients and other stakeholders are rapidly increasing efforts to tackle this global issue. We believe that it is incumbent upon us to respond and to take actions that support the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the global temperature increase in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.",

        "page_content": "The commitments we make to our Clients can often extend decades into the future. For this reason, we must account for climate-related risks across our operations and investments. These risks are likely to intensify and spread as climate-related impacts escalate in frequency and severity.\n\nMeaningful climate action is essential to delivering on our Purpose of helping our Clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives. Our Purpose can best be realized through the integration of this mindset across our businesses, and through working collaboratively with other stakeholders towards a common goal of mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change. Sun Life is doing its part to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and to ensure our organization is resilient to climate change. We set an enterprise-wide goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions by 2050 as well as multiple interim targets across our businesses (refer to Metrics and Targets for additional details).\n\nOur approach to climate change includes the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 We recognize that as a long-term investor, we have the opportunity to be part of the solution to this global challenge and invest proactively in assets and businesses that support the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- \u00b7 We are committed to advocacy and collaboration with governments, regulators, investors and industry leaders to develop supportive net-zero programs and policies that pave a path towards decarbonization.\n- \u00b7 We assess climate-related impacts on our businesses and investments with the aim of prudently managing the associated risks. We acknowledge the challenges of uncertainty and imperfect data to inform decision making.\n- \u00b7 We advocate for better data and disclosures, so we can make better-informed assessments of climate-related risks. We support the actions of regulators, including OSFI, to align their reporting requirements to the International Sustainability Standards Board's IFRS S1 and S2, and welcome ongoing efforts to improve disclosure standards.\n- \u00b7 We commit to continuously improving our climate-related measurement, monitoring and reporting.\n- \u00b7 We are focused on driving climate action and strengthening the resilience of our own operations around the world, as well as the properties that we own in our investment portfolio.\n\nWe commit to working together across industries, with our Clients, investees and other stakeholders to all do our part in addressing the climate crisis. We are working to understand the solutions to this complex, global challenge. Our approach to climate change will evolve over time, as we continue to build our internal expertise, obtain high-quality and industry-relevant data, and further align to external developments and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe following sets out our climate-related disclosures in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') recommendations, which are structured around four themes that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board uses reports from the Board Committee Chairs (detailed below) and other presentations by management and external experts, to decide on the nature and extent of its input and to provide challenge, advice and guidance to senior management on the enterprise approach to climate change. In 2023, climate-related topics were reviewed by the Board or a Committee of the Board at each of the quarterly meetings as well as the annual board strategy meeting either as part of dedicated agenda topics on Sun Life's Business and Strategic Plans, including Sun Life's Sustainability Strategy, or as part of various committee, officer and business group reports. The Board has received climate change training and education focused on sustainability-related matters, including board oversight on the impact of climate-related risks on asset management and insurance and on the impact of ESG on board governance and compensation.\n\nThree Board Committees have oversight over aspects of climate change:\n\n- \u00b7 The Governance, Investment & Sustainability Committee of the Board (\"GISC\") assists the Board with oversight of sustainability matters, including those related to climate. The GISC is responsible for reviewing and approving Sun Life's Sustainability Policy, overseeing progress against Sun Life's Sustainability Strategy and commitments (including decarbonization targets), reviewing and recommending Board approval of the annual Sustainability Report and the annual CSO plan, and overseeing the development and implementation of Sun Life's Climate Transition Plan. In addition, the GISC reviews any material issues related to sustainability raised by management throughout the year, including climate-related matters.\n- \u00b7 The Risk Committee of the Board assists the Board with enterprise-wide oversight of the management of current and emerging risks, which may include climate-related risks and, broadly, environmental risks.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee reviews ESG disclosures (including climate-related disclosures) required to be included in Sun Life's financial disclosure documents, and reviews management's quarterly reports on the effectiveness of Sun Life's internal controls over financial reporting, including any evolving standards over ESG disclosures.\n\nAt the management level, the CSO, Chief Risk Officer ('CRO'), and Chief Investment Officer ('CIO') play key roles in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Additional committees are in place at SLC Management and MFS to support these activities.\n\n- \u00b7 Our CSO has overall accountability for sustainability, including climate change, across the enterprise. This accountability includes setting the strategy and governance framework for our organization. The CSO chairs our ESC and GSLT. Sun Life's Vice President of Climate Change and Environmental Impact reports directly to the CSO and oversees the development and implementation of the enterprise-wide climate change strategy, climate risk and decarbonization performance and reporting functions.\n- \u00b7 Our CRO is responsible for leading the Risk Management function (as noted above in Risk Management sections 2 and 7). Key and emerging risks are monitored and reported to the Risk Committee of the Board.\n- \u00b7 Our CIO chairs the Sustainability Committee and Sustainable Investment Council within SLC Fixed Income. The Sustainability Committee is responsible for overseeing the direction, priorities and implementation of sustainable investing initiatives across SLC Fixed Income. The Sustainable Investment Council, composed of investment team leaders, is a sub-committee of the Sustainability Committee. It is the steering body for ESG integration in SLC Fixed Income's investment processes, representing and working across asset class teams.\n- \u00b7 The SLC Risk Committee provides oversight of SLC Management's investment advisors (which includes SLC Fixed Income, InfraRed, BGO, Crescent, and AAM), operational, investment, business and strategic risks, including those relating to ESG.\n- \u00b7 MFS has oversight committees to provide strategic leadership and support the effective integration of sustainability across MFS. The MFS Sustainability Executive Group provides strategic leadership concerning MFS' sustainability strategy. It includes various senior leaders responsible for the integration of sustainability across the firm. MFS also has committees that are a part of its",

These committees are devoted to the implementation of specific aspects of MFS' sustainability strategy, including ESG integration strategy and policies, engagement, proxy voting and ESG Client and corporate strategies and policies.\n\n## Strategy\n\nAs part of our updated enterprise Sustainability Strategy, climate change has been elevated as a cross-cutting lens connected to our Purpose and our core pillars of Financial Security, Healthier Lives, Sustainable Investing and foundation as a Trusted and Responsible Business. Meaningful climate action is essential to achieving our Purpose and we are committed to doing our part to support the transition to a lowcarbon economy and ensure we are an organization resilient to climate change. The strategy sets the foundation for how we will do this while creating competitive advantage and differentiation for our business.\n\nClimate change has a variety of implications for our business as an asset management and insurance company, especially when considering the impacts of climate change on human health. As an organization that provides life and health insurance products to Clients across the globe, we are keenly aware of the vast implications of climate change on our Clients' well-being. The increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events and the chronic shift towards higher temperatures have significant impacts on health. Heat-related deaths and hospitalizations have increased over the last decade and will continue to increase as temperatures rise. Lower air quality from pollutants, rising temperatures and wildfires can have long-term implications on respiratory health. Emotional distress, anxiety and trauma caused by these extreme weather events can also negatively impact mental health.\n\nChanging precipitation and ensuing floods, droughts and wildfires directly impact food crops and can lead to food insecurity and malnutrition. Changing precipitation and warming temperatures also increase the proliferation of pests, causing direct damage to food crops, while also increasing the transmission of vector-borne disease like dengue fever and Zika virus.\n\nFrom an investment perspective, climate change presents both risks and opportunities. A transition to a low-carbon economy could affect asset values over time. Among other impacts, portfolio investments in coal, conventional oil and oil sands producers, utilities and related fossil fuel industries, railways and pipelines, as well as markets that depend on these industries, may be subject to additional financial risk as a result of changes in regulation, cost of capital, consumer preferences, technological or business model disruption, etc. This may lead to lower overall profitability and/or stranded assets (assets for which the investment costs cannot be recovered as intended).\n\nPhysical climate impacts could affect investments in real assets such as real estate, commercial mortgages, and infrastructure, as well as our own operations, and operations and revenues of our Clients and businesses across our portfolios. Risks may result from increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events and from longer-term shifts in climate patterns, leading to declining asset values, increasing insurance costs or uninsurability.\n\nFor further discussion of potential climate-related risks, please refer to Environmental and Social Risk in Sun Life's 2023 Annual Information Form ('AIF') under Risk Factors - Business and Strategic Risk.\n\nClimate-related opportunities include those related to sustainability and green bonds, investments in developing resilient and adaptive real estate and infrastructure as well as renewable energy and other assets and businesses that support or benefit from a transition to a lowcarbon economy. Many companies and industries are benefiting from climate change-related tailwinds, such as mobility (vehicle electrification), energy efficiency services, battery technology and renewables. Through our asset managers' ESG integration efforts, we seek to identify these investment opportunities in both public and private markets, including opportunities in securitized investments and direct investments (real estate, traditional public infrastructure, and other types of public infrastructure such as sustainable agriculture).\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are considered in our asset management businesses' investment processes and in our financing activities. In 2019, we were the first life insurer globally to issue a sustainability bond and in 2023, we issued our second sustainability bond. Issuing sustainability bonds demonstrates our commitment to embedding sustainability into our business while contributing positively to society and advancing technologies that enable the transition to a low-carbon economy. Through our Asset Management pillar, we believe we are well-positioned to support Clients who want to invest in the net-zero transition. Asset management is delivered by MFS as well as the businesses that operate under the SLC Management brand: SLC Fixed Income, InfraRed, BGO, Crescent, and AAM. Climate-related investment strategies for our asset managers are highlighted below:\n\n- \u00b7 MFS, as a long-term investor in public issuers seeking to understand the duration and stability of financial returns, assesses climate change at both the issuer level and portfolio level. As with all risks and opportunities, MFS' assessment of environmental issues such as climate change begins with in-depth fundamental issuer and industry analysis. Climate change and regulations associated with climate change are materially impacting many businesses' revenue growth, margins and returns, cash flows, capital expenditures and valuation. As long-term investors seeking to allocate capital responsibly, MFS can use a variety of tools to increase the rate of change, which MFS believes will improve investment results and create value for Clients. MFS also regularly engages with issuers to encourage better disclosure and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. MFS' Strategic Climate Action Plan sets forth its investment philosophy with regard to the risks and opportunities associated with climate change, along with its expectations for issuers to have a climate plan to reduce or eliminate their emissions toward a goal of achieving net zero.\n- \u00b7 SLC Fixed Income offers its institutional Clients opportunities to invest in sustainable infrastructure through its private fixed income investments. Sustainable infrastructure categories include renewable energy, energy efficiency and clean transportation. SLC Fixed Income engages with certain portfolio companies, where relevant, to help inform its understanding and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. SLC Fixed Income's Climate Report sets forth its investment philosophy and associated disclosures with regard to risks, strategies and targets associated with climate change.\n- \u00b7 InfraRed invests in and manages social infrastructure, low-carbon generation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy enabling infrastructure projects, which advances its sustainable investment options for institutional Clients while complementing its focus on sustainable investing and climate change. InfraRed also actively assesses the physical-related climate risks associated with its existing and new investments in order to actively manage the climate resilience of the essential infrastructure projects it manages.\n- \u00b7 BGO analyzes climate-related risks for activities that are in scope using the following tools and programs. To help identify exposure to physical climate risks for certain new acquisitions, BGO utilizes Moody's ESG Solutions as a Climate Risk Provider. Included in the assessment are projections of exposure to floods from extreme precipitation, hurricane-force winds, sea level rise, water stress,",

        "page_content": "heat stress, wildfires, and earthquakes. Risks identified in this assessment are included in underwriting with details of what may be causing this risk and mitigation actions. As part of BGO's ESG Risk Matrix for new acquisitions, assets are scanned for indicators that may impact transition risk, such as energy performance, GHG emissions, and the existence of any local regulations. Transition risk metrics such as utility price impacts and government regulations are continually monitored for certain assets at the property level through its sustainability data management systems.\n\n- \u00b7 Crescent's investment decisions are guided by Clients' long-term interests, which are served through the incorporation of ESG considerations, including those related to climate change. Where possible, Crescent seeks to engage collaboratively with portfolio companies on topics such as understanding climate change risks and emissions intensity.\n\nAs longer-term investors, we believe that integrating climate change as a key element of our investment objectives can be a source of competitive advantage as it should lead to stronger risk-adjusted returns over time. The integration of climate change risks and opportunities may also result in stronger ESG investment ratings from groups such as PRI, Morningstar, GRESB and others, which can be key decision factors for Clients. Our asset managers may take the approach of active engagement and education to work with investee companies in their transition to net zero. SLC Fixed Income is a member of the Climate Engagement Canada and Climate Action 100+ investor initiatives. Through those initiatives and in its capacity as Sun Life's primary general account asset manager, SLC Fixed Income engages with some of the world's largest corporate GHG emitters with whom Sun Life has investments to support best practices around sustainability disclosures, and to better understand their management of climate-related risks and opportunities. MFS and Crescent are also signatories to Climate Action 100+.\n\nFor investment funds offered by the Sun Life Canada businesses, we recognize that our Clients are increasingly seeking a sustainable investment lens from our solutions. Our GRS business' proprietary ESG integration evaluation framework helps sponsors of group retirement plans make informed decisions about the investment options they make available to their employees in their workplace plans. The evaluation framework uses detailed criteria in three key areas: firm policies, investment process and active ownership. SLGI evaluates its investment managers using similar criteria. This approach provides deeper insights into its investment managers' direction on ESG matters and their ability to embed these considerations across all aspects of the investment decision process.\n\nSun Life's general account, where Sun Life is the asset owner, is comprised of assets from proceeds of insurance policies. A series of publiclydisclosed climate-related investment beliefs and principles guide the investment decisions of the general account in-scope asset classes which have net-zero interim targets. When evaluating in-scope general account investments in carbon-intensive sectors, Sun Life will consider credible GHG reduction plans and alignment or commitment to alignment with net zero. Our in-scope general account investments prioritize companies that are either categorized as net zero aligned, aligning, or committed to aligning, informed by the Net Zero Investment Framework. We also regularly review the financial performance of our investments and incorporate non-financial metrics. Performance against GHG reduction targets, where material, are a part of this fundamental investment analysis and will inform our general account investment decisions. For more information, refer to Sun Life's Net Zero by 2050: Sun Life's Climate Journey report.\n\nIn addition to the asset management and investment activities above, our experience with climate scenario analysis also includes enterprisewide testing as part of FCT (1) . A focus of our FCT has been climate-related investment risks, which we believe are a larger and more immediate concern. More broadly, we continue to monitor emerging research on the scope and scale of climate-related life and health impacts as they remain a significant longer-term concern to our business. We expect to continue to build on our climate scenario testing in 2024. In addition to using climate scenarios in FCT, we continue to leverage learnings from our experience with climate scenario analysis including our participation in the pilot project between the Bank of Canada, OSFI, and a small group of Canadian financial institutions in 2021.\n\nWe engage on emerging climate regulation and policy impacting our business directly and through industry associations, such as the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, the American Council of Life Insurers and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. We have advocated for improved climate-related financial disclosure and data, harmonization of emerging standards and regulations, and investments in data and scientific research on the link between climate change and life and health outcomes. Better and more consistent data across industries would allow for improved decision making and ultimately for capital to flow to those companies that are working to develop credible solutions for the transition to a low-carbon economy. In addition, we advocate for improving Canada's sustainable finance market and expanding opportunities to invest in green buildings and sustainable infrastructure. We disclose our lobbying activities in compliance with regulatory obligations as determined by each jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition to the engagements above, our actuarial and sustainability teams, as well as our asset managers actively participate in industry consultations and working groups focused on scenario analysis and stress testing. We will continue to mature our climate scenario analysis capabilities as industry guidance, best practices, tools and our internal expertise grow.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nClimate risk management is integrated into our Risk Framework, Governance, and supporting processes (as noted in preceding sections 1 through 8 and under Governance above). We continue to mature our climate risk management practices to ensure climate resiliency.\n\nOur definition of climate risk includes physical impacts of climate change and impacts of the transition to a low-carbon economy. These impacts can include, but are not limited to, damage to owned and operated real assets including real estate and infrastructure, a reduction in the values of investments in public and private fixed income and non-fixed income assets tied to fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries, litigation risk to a company or sector in which we invest, health impacts to affected populations (which can affect long-term morbidity and mortality assumptions), and socio-economic, geopolitical and regulatory changes. We also include an assessment of climate change risk as part of our broader assessment of the risks associated with operating in various markets.",

They incorporate a number of different analyses into their assessment of climate risks through both stand-alone analysis of physical risks by geographic region and through the assessment of business model and carbon transition risks. Climate-related risk categories monitored may include acute and chronic physical risks and transition risks related to current and emerging laws and regulation, changing technology, market and reputation risks or consumer preferences.\n\nEach of our asset managers takes its own approach to identifying, assessing, monitoring and responding to climate-related risks and opportunities, based on the asset classes it invests in. Approaches are refined periodically. Examples of approaches include:\n\n- \u00b7 Proprietary climate risk surveys to identify, assess and respond to climate-related risks and opportunities\n- \u00b7 Portfolio and asset level risk analysis to inform investment decisions and resilience plans\n- \u00b7 Scoring methodologies that look to standardize the assessment of transition risks\n- \u00b7 Emissions data analysis\n- \u00b7 Stranded asset modeling\n- \u00b7 Real assets physical risk exposure assessment\n- \u00b7 Carbon intensity monitoring and benchmarking\n- \u00b7 Individual as well as collaborative engagements on topics such as decarbonization\n\nAdditionally, an environmental issue, whether caused by climate change or other factors, on a property owned or operated by us could have financial or reputational impacts. Our real estate asset manager maintains an environmental risk management program to help monitor and manage real estate investment assets from losses due to environmental issues and to ensure compliance with applicable laws. Where feasible, we maintain insurance policies to cover certain environmental risks on owned assets. We have implemented a business continuity program to facilitate the recovery of critical business operations if an environmental issue affects a location where we conduct operations. The Company's corporate real estate group, together with our building owners and property managers, assesses the potential effects of climate change-related hazards and examines ways to improve the ability of our buildings to withstand these hazards. These hazards include tornadoes, flash floods, ice storms and coastline flooding.\n\nClimate-related disclosure standards and regulatory requirements continue to be issued and evolve in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Potential divergence in expectations among regulators, as well as the pace of regulatory change in the area of climate change, could lead to additional risks. We continue to monitor our risk management practices and disclosures as new regulations and standards are implemented and as the external landscape continues to evolve. In addition, we participate in consultations with policymakers and regulators on policy and regulatory developments regarding climate-related disclosures.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nSun Life has set a goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 for both its investments and operations. As an asset owner, Sun Life plans to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 for investments in its general account. Our approach for achieving net-zero emissions in the general account focuses on asset classes where we have access to quality data, established net-zero emissions methodologies and where we believe we can have the biggest real-world impact in reducing emissions. We use the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials ('PCAF') Part A (Financed Emissions) methodology to calculate our financed emissions. In 2023, we set interim targets for the general account for 2030 (1) for asset classes where there is industry guidance and we have the ability to have an immediate impact; this means our investments in listed corporate bonds (intensity and alignment targets), directly managed listed equities (intensity target), and commercial real estate (intensity target), which collectively cover 29% of Sun Life's general account AUM (2) . Our asset managers that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers ('NZAM') initiative have also set respective interim targets for the assets they manage. The NZAM initiative is an international group of asset managers committed to supporting the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. NZAM members include MFS, SLGI, and SLC Management asset managers: SLC Fixed Income, InfraRed and BGO. Updated interim targets and a summary of our other commitments and progress towards net-zero GHG emissions are available in our Net Zero by 2050: Sun Life's Climate Journey report.\n\nFor our operations, we have set an interim target of a 50% absolute reduction of GHG emissions by 2030, relative to 2019 (3) . While we continue our efforts to reduce our operational GHG emissions, we purchase high-quality carbon offsets that are verified and additional (according to carbon standards) to compensate for the remaining emissions in our operations that we have yet to reduce. This approach of purchasing offsets is not part of our enterprise decarbonization strategy, but is one way to help manage the climate impact of our operations today while we work towards our interim 2030 operational target and enterprise-wide goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\n\nSun Life is continuing progress towards its target of $20 billion in new sustainable investments from 2021 to 2025 across its general account and Client investments, which are managed by SLC Management. Investments include, but are not limited to, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable buildings, clean transportation, water management, and social infrastructure projects.\n\nWe report our progress on our operational emissions reduction targets and sustainable investment targets in our annual Sustainability Report available at www.sunlife.com/sustainability.\n\nIn 2023, the Board approved the addition of a Sustainability modifier to the Senior Executive Sun Share Unit Plan, which assesses performance over three years against four goals aligned to two of our Sustainability Pillars. Climate-related goals include sustainable investment and GHG emissions reduction in our operations.",

        "page_content": "Sun Life and majority-owned affiliate companies report global Scope 1 and 2 emissions from company-occupied real estate, data centres and real estate investments under our financial control (as defined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard) as well as Scope 3 emissions (where data is available) (1) associated with business travel, real estate-related sources, and select asset classes within our general account in our annual Sustainability Report. We continue to advance the quality and availability of emissions data across our enterprise emissions inventory. All emissions reporting is aligned to the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard using the financial control approach. Additional information on GHG emissions calculations can be found in Sun Life's Financial GHG Reporting Methodology.\n\nPlease refer to Environmental and Social Risk in our AIF for additional climate-related risk discussion.\n\n## v. Operational Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss (financial and non-financial) resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk is present in all of our business activities and encompasses a broad range of risks as described below. Operational risk is embedded in the practices utilized to manage other risks and, therefore, if not managed effectively, operational risk can impact our ability to manage other key risks.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe employ a wide range of operational risk management practices and controls, as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Operational risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Board Committees.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limits have been established in Operational Risk.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework, Policies, guidelines and practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 Our governance practices, corporate values, Code of Conduct and Company-wide approach to managing risk set the foundation for mitigating operational risks.\n- \u00b7 Our Code of Conduct sets the tone for a strong ethical culture, and we regularly review and update the Code of Conduct to ensure that it continues to meet the expectations of regulators and other stakeholders. All our directors and employees must reconfirm annually their understanding of and commitment to comply with the Code of Conduct.\n- \u00b7 We have established appropriate internal controls and systems for talent acquisition, rewards and development programs that attract, build and retain top talent and create strong succession plans as well as compensation programs, and we provide ongoing training to our people.\n- \u00b7 We conduct regular monitoring of employee engagement to ensure we create and maintain a work environment where all employees are welcome and able to contribute effectively.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as FCT, are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse scenarios.\n- \u00b7 We mitigate a portion of our operational risk exposure through our corporate insurance program by purchasing insurance coverage that seeks to provide insurance against unexpected material losses resulting from events such as criminal activity, property loss or damage and liability exposures, or that satisfies legal requirements and contractual obligations.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n\nSpecific operational risks and our risk management strategies are discussed below in further detail and in the Risk Factor section in the AIF.\n\n## Information Security and Privacy Risks\n\nInformation and technology are used in almost all aspects of our business and operations. As part of our Client strategy, we continue to enhance the digital side of our business to support and enable new business models and processes, that are more personal, proactive and predictive.\n\nOur business and the successful implementation of our digital strategy are dependent on various factors including maintaining a secure environment for our Clients, employees and other parties' information. This requires the effective and secure use, management and oversight of information and physical assets. We engage with various stakeholders and leverage emerging technologies, including digital, mobile applications, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation. These technologies are used to collect, process and maintain information relating to business transactions and financial reporting, as well as the personal information of our Clients and employees. We also obtain services from a wide range of third-party service providers and have outsourced some business and information technology functions in various jurisdictions.\n\nThere continues to be an increasing number of information security compromises and privacy breaches across industry sectors, governments and individuals. The increasing scope and complexity of malicious activity poses a significant risk to our systems and these risks may be exacerbated by the breadth of our operations, our geographic footprint and the complexity of our technology systems. A serious security or privacy breach of either an internal or third-party service provider's computer system that contains sensitive business, Client and/or employee information may result in business interruption, theft or misuse of confidential information, regulatory penalties and scrutiny, litigation, reputational damage and may have an adverse impact on current and future business opportunities with our Clients, employees and business relationships. We continue to actively monitor for increases in malicious activity due to escalating geopolitical tensions across the globe.",

        "page_content": "We continue investing in people, processes and technology to strengthen our abilities to respond to the evolving threat landscape. Our Information Security framework is overseen by the Chief Information Security Officer, supported by senior leadership and by our Operational Risk Management Framework. Our information security framework and governance controls (policies, procedures, training) are aligned with recognized industry standards and are compliant with applicable laws and regulations. Our Chief Privacy Officer oversees the global privacy program and sets direction for privacy compliance across the enterprise. Over 30 Privacy Officers across the enterprise help our businesses make privacy-related decisions.\n\nOur well-established security controls and processes are intent on protecting our information and computer systems and the information entrusted to us by our Clients and employees. Our protection strategy leverages information security risk assessments and privacy impact assessments to evaluate potential risks. The security framework also includes technology and process safeguards and regularly promotes secure behavioural practices. As part of our layered security approach, we deliver general security awareness training sessions to all employees every year that is reinforced with regular awareness resources and activities.\n\nMany jurisdictions in which we do business are developing and implementing cyber security reporting requirements and more stringent consumer privacy legislation, many with greater enforcement powers for regulators and higher fines and penalties. Our global privacy program monitors adherence to our global privacy commitments, local laws and local privacy policies. We have also established a network of privacy officers across the Company who monitor emerging privacy legislation and provide guidance on handling personal information and help manage, report and resolve any privacy incidents that may occur. We also conduct privacy training, provide regular monitoring and reporting and carry cyber risk insurance to help mitigate the impact of privacy incidents.\n\n## Human Resources Risk\n\nOur ability to achieve business objectives can be adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain or effectively deploy resources with the in-depth knowledge and necessary skills required, or are unable to design compensation and talent programs that effectively drive employee behaviour and shape corporate culture. Failure to manage Human Resources risk can also lead to direct financial and reputational loss including losses arising from activity that is inconsistent with Human Rights or employment laws or health and safety regulations.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we have comprehensive Human Resource policies, practices and programs in place to ensure compliance with employment legislation, minimize the risk of employee misconduct, and proactively develop employee skills, capabilities and behaviours to meet future business needs.\n\n## Regulatory Compliance, Legal and Conduct Risk\n\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory oversight by financial services regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Failure to comply with applicable laws or to conduct our business consistent with changing regulatory or public expectations could adversely impact our reputation and may lead to regulatory investigations, examinations, proceedings, settlements, penalties, fines, restrictions on our business, litigation or an inability to carry out our business strategy.\n\nOur Chief Compliance Officer oversees our comprehensive Enterprise-wide compliance framework, which is aligned with guidance from OSFI and other regulators. This framework promotes proactive, risk-based management of compliance and regulatory risk, and includes Enterprise and business segment policies and operating guidelines, programs to promote awareness of laws and regulations that impact us, ongoing monitoring of emerging legal issues and regulatory changes and training programs. The employee training programs include anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing, anti-bribery and corruption, fraud, privacy and information security risk management. Effective governance, oversight and implementation is a coordinated effort between first and second lines of defence functions. Second line oversight and effective challenge relies on a network of compliance officers. The Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board and Board Committees on the health of the compliance program, key compliance risks, emerging regulatory trends, escalation of significant issues and key risk indicators.\n\n## Information Technology Risk\n\nThe use of technology and computer systems is essential in supporting and maintaining business operations. We use technology to support virtually all aspects of our business and operations. The rapidly changing business environment increases the risk of our technology strategy not being agile enough to adapt to new business demands in a timely manner leading to financial losses, increased costs and the inability to meet Client needs.\n\nInitiatives supporting our business strategy rely on developing innovative information technology solutions and upgrading our existing systems on a timely basis to meet business needs. Although every reasonable precaution is taken to ensure information technology systems remain available, stable and current, it is not possible to fully eliminate all risk. Some changes and upgrades are extremely complex and there is a chance that an undetected technical flaw may exist, which, when implemented, stops or disrupts critical information technology systems or business applications.\n\n## Third-Party Risk\n\nWe engage in a variety of third-party relationships, including with distributors, independent contractors, outsourcing service providers and suppliers. Our profitability or reputation could be impacted if these third parties are unable to meet their ongoing service commitments or fail to perform to expected standards.\n\nTo manage these risks, we have established Company-wide policies and guidelines which are consistent with OSFI's and other local regulatory requirements, and which set out our requirements to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on third-party risks. Our program includes third-party risk assessments and enhanced due diligence if a supplier will have access to any personal data and/or confidential information or access to non-public systems. The key elements and risks associated with the third party are documented in the form of a written agreement, and the company monitors performance of its third parties in a manner that is commensurate to the size, risk, scope and complexity of the third-party relationship.",

        "page_content": "## Business Disruption Risk\n\nTo conduct operations, our businesses are dependent on the availability of trained employees, physical locations and access to technology. A significant business disruption to our operations can result if one or more of these key elements are negatively impacted. System disruptions as well as unanticipated events, including pandemics, can negatively affect staff, preventing them from getting to work or from operating business processes.\n\nTo manage this risk, we have implemented a business continuity program to facilitate the recovery of critical business operations. This program encompasses business continuity, crisis management and disaster recovery planning. Our policy, guidelines and operating procedures establish consistent processes designed to ensure that key business functions can continue and normal operations can resume effectively and efficiently should a major disruption occur. In addition, to regularly update and test business continuity plans for critical business operations, we conduct mandatory business continuity awareness training for all employees annually and have off-site backup facilities and failover capability designed to minimize downtime and accelerate recovery time in the event of a major disruption.\n\n## Model Risk\n\nWe use complex models to support many business functions including product development and pricing, capital management, valuation, financial reporting, planning, hedging, asset-liability management, risk management and advanced analytics (such as artificial intelligence, predictive modeling and decision making algorithms). Model risk is the risk of loss, either in the form of financial loss, inappropriate or poor business decisions, damage to reputation, or other adverse impact, arising from inaccurate model outputs or incorrect use or interpretation of model outputs.\n\nTo manage model risk, we have established robust, Company-wide model risk management procedures over the models' life cycle with respect to building, using, changing and retiring models. The policy and operating guidelines set out minimum, risk-based requirements to ensure that models are effectively controlled, maintained and appropriately understood by users.\n\n## Information Management Risk\n\nAs an international provider of financial services, we deal with extensive information across a number of countries. Information management risk is the a) inability to capture, manage, retain and appropriately dispose of business records, b) the inability to provide data that is valid, complete, accurate, consistent, unique, or timely to support business decisions, and c) the inability to manage data location and cross-border access appropriately. Failure to manage these risks could have financial or reputational impacts, and may lead to regulatory proceedings, penalties and litigation. To manage and monitor information management risk, we have a data governance framework, which includes a records management program, data quality best practices, and data residency controls.\n\nWe continue to evolve our risk management best practices to manage risks associated with Generative-AI as we identify use cases and run experiments designed to identify opportunities.\n\n## vi. Liquidity Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will not be able to fund all cash outflow commitments and collateral requirements as they fall due. This includes the risk of being forced to sell assets at depressed prices resulting in realized losses on sale. This risk also includes restrictions on our ability to efficiently allocate capital among our subsidiaries due to various market and regulatory constraints on the movement of funds. Our funding obligations arise in connection with the payment of policyholder benefits, expenses, reinsurance settlements, asset purchases, investment commitments, interest on debt, and dividends on common and preferred shares. Sources of available cash flow include general fund premiums and deposits, investment related inflows (such as maturities, principal repayments, investment income and proceeds of asset sales), proceeds generated from financing activities, and dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries. We have various financing transactions and derivative contracts under which we may be required to pledge collateral or to make payments to our counterparties for the decline in market value of specified assets. The amount of collateral or payments required may increase under certain circumstances (such as changes to interest rates, credit spreads, equity markets or foreign exchange rates), which could adversely affect our liquidity.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe generally maintain a conservative liquidity position and employ a wide range of liquidity risk management practices and controls, which are described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity is managed in accordance with our Asset Liability Management Policy and operating guidelines.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity contingency plans are maintained for the management of liquidity in a liquidity event.\n- \u00b7 Stress testing is performed by comparing liquidity coverage risk metrics under a one-month stress scenario to our policy thresholds.\n\nThese liquidity coverage risk metrics are measured and managed at the enterprise and legal entity levels.\n\n- \u00b7 Stress testing of our collateral is performed by comparing collateral coverage ratios to our policy thresholds.\n- \u00b7 Cash Management and asset-liability management programs support our ability to maintain our financial position by ensuring that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to cover potential funding requirements. We invest in various types of assets with a view of matching them to our liabilities of various durations.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n- \u00b7 We actively manage and monitor our capital and asset levels, and the diversification and credit quality of our investments.\n- \u00b7 Various credit facilities for general corporate purposes are maintained.",

The ability of SLF Inc.'s subsidiaries to pay dividends and transfer funds is regulated in certain jurisdictions and may require local regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of specific conditions in certain circumstances. Through effective cash management and capital planning, SLF Inc. ensures that its subsidiaries, as a whole and on a stand-alone basis, are properly funded and maintain adequate liquidity to meet obligations, both individually and in aggregate.\n\nBased on our historical cash flows and liquidity management processes, we believe that the cash flows from our operating activities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for us to satisfy debt service obligations and to pay other expenses as they fall due.\n\n## Maturity Analysis for Insurance Contracts\n\nThe following tables present the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of insurance contract and reinsurance contract held assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. These cash flows include estimates related to the timing and payment of death and disability claims, policy surrenders, policy maturities, annuity payments, minimum guarantees on segregated fund products, policyholder dividends, amounts on deposit, commissions and premium taxes offset by contractual future premiums and fees on in-force contracts. These estimated cash flows are based on the best estimated assumptions used in the determination of insurance contract and reinsurance contract held assets and liabilities. Due to the use of assumptions, actual cash flows will differ from these estimates. Amounts payable on demand, which includes amounts on deposit, dividends on deposit, outstanding claims and policyholder account values, are included in the 1 year or less time band. The amounts included in the table differ from the carrying value of the portfolio due to discounting, risk adjustments, and liability for remaining coverage for contracts using the premium allocation approach.\n\nAmounts in this table include the liability for incurred claims for contracts measured using the PAA, but exclude the liability for remaining coverage for contracts measured using the PAA.\n\n| As at December 31,                     | 2023           | 2022           |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Insurance contract liabilities:        |                |                |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $  11,428      | $  11,980      |\n| 1-2 years                              | 3,670          | 4,111          |\n| 2-3 years                              | 3,887          | 4,018          |\n| 3-4 years                              | 4,128          | 4,278          |\n| 4-5 years                              | 4,451          | 4,511          |\n| Over 5 years                           | 556,052        | 469,366        |\n| Total                                  | $ 583,616      | $ 498,264      |\n| Insurance contract assets:             |                |                |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $      (463)   | $       (324)  |\n| 1-2 years                              | (323)          | (341)          |\n| 2-3 years                              | (276)          | (287)          |\n| 3-4 years                              | (248)          | (254)          |\n| 4-5 years                              | (225)          | (234)          |\n| Over 5 years                           | (3,305)        | (3,753)        |\n| Total                                  | $  (4,840)     | $    (5,193)   |\n| Reinsurance contract held liabilities: |                |                |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $          140 | $          132 |\n| 1-2 years                              | 83             | 80             |\n| 2-3 years                              | 88             | 86             |\n| 3-4 years                              | 91             | 89             |\n| 4-5 years                              | 95             | 94             |\n| Over 5 years                           | 5,036          | 5,085          |\n| Total                                  | $      5,533   | $      5,566   |\n| Reinsurance contract held assets:      |                |                |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $      (520)   | $      (684)   |\n| 1-2 years                              | (54)           | (20)           |\n| 2-3 years                              | (69)           | (31)           |\n| 3-4 years                              | (105)          | (66)           |\n| 4-5 years                              | (130)          | (104)          |\n| Over 5 years                           | (11,330)       | (12,102)       |\n| Total                                  | $ (12,208)     | $ (13,007)     |",

Other Risks\n\n## Risks relating to Pandemics\n\nPandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease could have an adverse impact on our results, business, financial condition or liquidity, and could result in changes to the way we operate. Pandemics and measures imposed by governments around the world could disrupt the global economy, financial markets, supply chains, business activity and productivity. The potential worsening of the economic and market conditions caused by pandemics, and impact on Clients, industries and individual countries could have a material adverse effect on our businesses including sales, fee income, investment performance, expenses, results of operations, corporate reputation and financial condition. Sustained adverse effects could negatively impact profitability and also make it difficult for us to access capital markets, could impact our liquidity and capital position, or may result in downgrades in our credit ratings. These actions may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors section in our AIF and section K - Risk Management in this document. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risks, such as equity, interest rates and spread, real estate, and foreign currency risks, including impact on fee income;\n- \u00b7 Insurance risk, including higher than expected mortality and, morbidity claims and adverse policyholder behaviour including but not limited to higher than expected policy lapses, withdrawals, and surrenders;\n- \u00b7 Credit risk, including defaults, impairments and downgrades;\n- \u00b7 Business and strategic risk including economic and geopolitical risk, business strategy implementation risk, distribution risk, expense risk, changes in Client behaviour, sales, investment performance, and changes in legal and regulatory environment;\n- \u00b7 Operational risk, including information security and privacy risk, human resources risks, regulatory compliance, legal and conduct risk, information technology risk, processing risk, third-party risk, and business disruption risk, and change management risk with the need to quickly implement and execute new programs and procedures to support Clients, advisors, employees, products, and services; and\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk including collateral, and payment deferrals on invested assets or policyholder insurance premium impacts.\n\nConsistent with the protocols and programs established in our Risk Management Framework, we continue to manage the risks that arise when providing products and services to Clients, which are in line with our Purpose to help Client achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives.\n\n## L.

Total revenue excludes investment result for insurance contracts for account of segregated fund holders.\n\nInsurance revenue is comprised of the portion of premiums that cover expected claims and directly attributable expenses in the period, as well as the release of risk adjustment and the amortization of CSM for the period. Insurance revenue excludes the portion of premiums that cover repayment of investment components.\n\nNet investment income is comprised of interest income, dividends, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and other investment income earned on general fund assets. Net investment income, such as net rental income, fair value changes, and foreign exchange gains (losses) are also earned from non-financial instruments.

        "page_content": "value of FVTPL assets and foreign currency changes on assets and liabilities, which may in turn affect the comparability of revenue from period to period. The change in fair value of FVTPL assets is driven largely by market-related factors such as interest rates, credit spreads and equity returns. The debt and equity securities that support insurance contract liabilities are generally designated or classified as FVTPL and changes in fair values of these assets are recorded in net investment income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair values of the FVTPL assets supporting insurance contract liabilities are largely offset by a corresponding change in the liabilities excluding those for account of segregated fund holders.\n\nFee income includes distribution fees, fund management and other asset-based fees, primarily earned in the Asset Management segment. Fee income also includes administrative service and other fees primarily earned in the Canada and U.S. segments. Premium and deposit equivalents from administrative services only (\"ASO\"), as well as deposits received by the Company on investment contracts such as segregated funds, mutual funds and managed funds are not included in revenue; however, the Company does receive fee income from these contracts, which is included in revenue. Fee income and ASO premium and deposit equivalents are an important part of our business and as a result, revenue does not fully represent sales and other activity taking place during the respective periods.\n\n| ($ millions)                 | 2023   | 2022     |\n|------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Insurance revenue            |        |          |\n| Annuities                    | 2,258  | 2,244    |\n| Life insurance               | 5,356  | 5,220    |\n| Health insurance             | 13,742 | 11,438   |\n| Total insurance revenue      | 21,356 | 18,902   |\n| Net Investment income (loss) | 11,586 | (20,580) |\n| Fee income                   | 7,832  | 7,447    |\n| Total revenue                | 40,774 | 5,769    |\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\nTotal revenue increased by $35.0 billion, primarily driven by higher net investment income from fair value changes of invested asset and higher insurance revenue.

The MFS pre-tax net operating profit margin (2) was 39% for Q4'23, compared to 40% in the prior year.\n- \u00b7 SLC Management up $22 million: The increase in underlying net income was driven by higher fee-related earnings and higher net seed investment income. Fee-related earnings (2) increased 26% driven by higher AUM, reflecting strong capital raising and deployment across the platform and the AAM acquisition (3) . Fee-related earnings margin (2) and pre-tax net operating profit margin (2) for Q4'23 were 24% and 22%, respectively (Q4'22 - 24% and 23%, respectively).\n\nAsset Management reported net income of $297 million decreased $24 million or 7%, largely reflecting fair value changes in management's ownership of MFS shares.\n\n## Canada\n\nUnderlying net income of $350 million increased $85 million or 32%, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 Wealth & asset management up $20 million: Increase in investment income driven by higher volume and yields.\n- \u00b7 Group - Health & Protection up $57 million: Business premium growth and improved disability experience reflecting higher margins, lower claims volumes, and shorter claims durations.\n- \u00b7 Individual - Protection up $8 million: Higher investment contributions partially offset by unfavourable mortality experience.\n- \u00b7 Higher earnings on surplus, primarily driven by realized gains in the current year.\n\nReported net income of $348 million decreased $105 million or 23%, driven by market-related impacts primarily from interest rates and real estate experience, and the prior year impact of the Canada Tax Rate Change (4) , partially offset by ACMA impacts and the increase in underlying net income.",

In Group Benefits, strong revenue growth, higher net investment results and favourable mortality experience was partially offset by less favourable morbidity experience.\n- \u00b7 Individual - Protection up US$21 million : The inclusion of the UK payout annuity business (1) and improved mortality experience.\n\nReported net income of US$77 million decreased US$74 million or 49%, driven by ACMA impacts, and market-related impacts largely from interest rates and real estate experience, partially offset by lower DentaQuest integration costs and the increase in underlying net income.\n\n## Asia\n\nUnderlying net income of $143 million increased $8 million or 6%, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 Individual - Protection up $20 million: Business growth reflecting good sales momentum, partially offset by lower earnings on surplus.\n- \u00b7 Regional office expenses & other $(12) million increased net loss primarily reflecting continued pan Asia investments in the business.\n\nReported net income of $44 million decreased $48 million or 52%, driven by ACMA impacts, partially offset by the impact of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Change (2) .\n\n## Corporate\n\nUnderlying net loss was $94 million compared to underlying net loss of $62 million in the prior year, driven by the sale of Sun Life UK (1) and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.\n\nReported net loss was $41 million compared to $97 million reported net income in the prior year, reflecting the impacts from the sale of Sun Life UK (1) , the prior year impact of tax-related matters (3) , and the change in underlying net loss.\n\n## 5. Fourth Quarter 2023 Growth\n\nRevenue of $18.7 billion increased $10.2 billion compared to the same period in 2022, primarily reflecting fair value changes in invested assets driven by declining interest rates.

DentaQuest results also contributed to the increase.\n- \u00b7 Individual - Protection up $42 million : Higher premiums reflecting good sales momentum during the past year, and improved mortality in Asia.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Support & other $(36) million increased net loss: Higher operating expenses including long-term incentive compensation and IFRS 17 project spend, as well as an increase in debt financing costs.\n- \u00b7 Higher investment income reflecting an increase in realized gains from surplus assets and net interest income from higher rates.\n\nReported net income of $806 million increased $141 million or 21%, driven by the increase in underlying net income and gain on the sale of the sponsored markets business in Canada, partially offset by market-related impacts, and DentaQuest integration and SLC Management acquisition-related costs.\n\n## Fourth Quarter 2022 (1)\n\nReported net income of $951 million decreased $127 million or 12%, primarily reflecting unfavourable market-related impacts and DentaQuest integration costs, partially offset by the impact of the Canada Tax Rate Change, fair value changes on MFS' share-based payment awards and ACMA. Prior year reported net income included a gain on the initial public offering (\"IPO\") of our India asset management joint venture partially offset by an increase to SLC Management's acquisition-related liabilities. Underlying net income of $990 million increased $92 million or 10%, driven by business growth and experience in protection and health and contribution from the DentaQuest acquisition. This was partially offset by lower wealth and asset management earnings reflecting declines in global equity markets, and a higher effective tax rate compared to prior year.\n\n## Third Quarter 2022 (1)\n\nReported net income of $466 million decreased $553 million or 54% from prior year, primarily reflecting unfavourable market-related impacts, a $170 million charge related to the sale of Sun Life UK, less favourable ACMA impacts, and an increase in SLC Management's acquisition-related liabilities, partially offset by fair value changes on MFS' share-based payment awards. Underlying net income of $949 million increased $47 million or 5%, driven by business growth and experience in protection and health including a strong contribution from the DentaQuest acquisition. This was partially offset by lower fee-based income in wealth and asset management, mainly driven by declines in global equity markets.\n\n## Second Quarter 2022 (1)\n\nQ2'22 reported net income of $785 million decreased $115 million or 13%, reflecting unfavourable market-related impacts and DentaQuest acquisition costs, partially offset by fair value changes on MFS' share-based payment awards and a gain on the sale-leaseback of our Wellesley office in the U.S. Underlying net income of $892 million was up slightly driven by business growth, new business gains, contribution from the DentaQuest acquisition, and lower incentive compensation expenses. This was largely offset by Asset Management results reflecting a decline in global equity markets driving lower average net assets, lower available-for-sale gains and morbidity experience in the U.S. Foreign exchange translation led to an increase of $16 million and $12 million in reported net income and underlying net income, respectively.\n\n## First Quarter 2022 (1)\n\nQ1'22 reported net income of $858 million decreased $79 million or 8%, driven by less favourable market-related impacts, partially offset by a Q1'21 restructuring charge and lower fair value changes on MFS' share-based payment awards. Underlying net income of $843 million was down slightly, driven by broad-based business growth, favourable expense experience and investment gains, offset by unfavourable mortality and morbidity experience, and lower AFS gains.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Underlying Net Income and Underlying EPS\n\nUnderlying net income is a non-IFRS financial measure that assists in understanding Sun Life's business performance by making certain adjustments to IFRS income. Underlying net income, along with common shareholders' net income (Reported net income), is used as a basis for management planning, and is also a key measure in our employee incentive compensation programs. This measure reflects management's view of the underlying business performance of the company and long-term earnings potential. For example, due to the longer term nature of our individual protection businesses, market movements related to interest rates, equity markets and investment properties can have a significant impact on reported net income in the reporting period. However, these impacts are not necessarily realized, and may never be realized, if markets move in the opposite direction in subsequent periods or in the case of interest rates, the fixed income investment is held to maturity.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, we refined the definition of underlying net income as follows, and have updated prior period comparative figures to reflect these changes: (i) Market-related impacts was updated to reflect the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9; (ii) The adjustment for management's ownership of MFS shares were updated to better reflect Sun Life's interest in MFS' earnings; and (iii) Removal of intangible asset amortization on acquired finite-life intangibles. Additional detail on these adjustments is provided below.\n\nUnderlying net income removes the impact of the following items from reported net income:\n\n- \u00b7 Market-related impacts reflecting the after-tax difference in actual versus expected market movements, including:\n- i) Net interest impact from risk-free rate, credit spread, and swap spread movements, reflecting accounting mismatches between assets and liabilities:\n- a. Differences arising from fair value changes (1) of fixed income assets (including derivatives) measured at FVTPL supporting insurance contracts, compared to fair value changes of the liabilities (2) ;\n- b. Fair value changes of fixed income assets (including derivatives) measured at FVTPL supporting our investment contract liability and surplus portfolios (3) ; and\n- c. Tax-exempt investment income above or below expected long-term tax savings relating to our Canadian multi-national insurance operations.\n- ii) Non-fixed income investments where the weighted average expected return is approximately 2% per quarter, including:\n- a. Equity investments (including derivatives) supporting insurance contracts and surplus portfolios; and\n- b. Investment properties supporting insurance contracts and surplus portfolios.\n- \u00b7 ACMA - captures the impact of method and assumption changes, and management actions on insurance and reinsurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments:\n- i) Management's ownership of MFS shares - this adjustment removes the change in fair value and other activity related to MFS common shares owned by management.\n- ii) Acquisition, integration, and restructuring - expense and income related to acquisition or disposal of a business. Also includes expenses related to restructuring activities.\n- iii) Intangible asset amortization - removes the amortization expense associated with finite life intangible assets arising from acquisitions or business combinations excluding amortization of software and distribution agreements.\n- iv) Other - represents items that are unusual or exceptional in nature which management believes are not representative of the longterm performance of the Company.\n\nUnderlying EPS (diluted). This measure is used in comparing the profitability across multiple periods and is calculated by dividing underlying net income by weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted EPS, excluding the dilutive impact of convertible instruments. For additional information about the underlying net income, see above. For additional information about the composition of the EPS, please refer to Note 25 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023.

Additional Non-IFRS Financial Measures\n\nManagement also uses the following non-IFRS financial measures:\n\nAfter-tax profit margin for U.S. Group Benefits. This ratio expresses U.S. Group Benefits underlying net income as a percentage of net premiums. It assists in explaining our results from period to period and measures profitability. This ratio is calculated by dividing underlying net income (loss) by net premiums for the trailing four quarters. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nAssets under administration (in SLC Management). AUA represents Client assets for which Sun Life provides administrative services. In Asset Management, AUA includes assets distributed by SLC Management's affiliate, Advisors Asset Management, Inc. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nAssets under management. AUM is a non-IFRS financial measure that indicates the size of our Company's assets across asset management, wealth, and insurance. There is no standardized financial measure under IFRS. In addition to the most directly comparable IFRS measures, which are the balance of General funds and Segregated funds on our Statements of Financial Position, AUM also includes Third-party AUM and Consolidation adjustments. Effective January 1, 2023, \"Other AUM\" was renamed to \"Third Party AUM\", and \"Consolidation adjustments\" is presented separately as consolidation adjustments apply to all components of total AUM.\n\nAUM not yet earning fees. This measure represents the committed uninvested capital portion of total AUM not currently earning management fees. The amount depends on the specific terms and conditions of each fund. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nCapital raising. This measure consists of increases in SLC Management's commitments from fund raising activities for all real estate, infrastructure and alternative credit Clients excluding leverage. Investment-grade fixed income capital raising consists of sales made to new Clients. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nCash and other liquid assets. This measure is comprised of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and publicly traded securities, net of loans related to acquisitions that are held at SLF Inc. (the ultimate parent company), and its wholly owned holding companies. This measure is a key consideration of available funds for capital re-deployment to support business growth.\n\n| ($ millions)                                                                                   | As at December 31, 2023   | As at December 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Cash and other liquid assets (held at SLF Inc. and its wholly owned holding  companies):       |                           |                           |\n| Cash, cash equivalents & short-term securities                                                 | 712                       | 423                       |\n| Debt securities (1)                                                                            | 1,228                     | 1,408                     |\n| Equity securities (2)                                                                          | 102                       | 102                       |\n| Sub-total                                                                                      | 2,042                     | 1,933                     |\n| Less: Loans related to acquisitions (held at SLF Inc. and its wholly owned holding  companies) | (411)                     | (883)                     |\n| Cash and other liquid assets (held at SLF Inc. and its wholly owned holding  companies)        | 1,631                     | 1,050                     |",

The impacts of foreign exchange translation is approximated by using the foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparative period, using the average or period end foreign exchange rates, as appropriate.\n\nCSM Movement Analysis includes certain non-IFRS financial measures, detailed below, and also presents certain measures on a net basis to reflect how management views the business, compared to a gross basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples include i) The impacts of insurance contracts issued is presented net of reinsurance; ii) Impact of new business is presented net of acquisition expense gain/ loss; and iii) Certain methodology changes are presented as an impact of change in assumptions, whereas the Consolidated Financial Statement presentation is a contract modification.\n\n- \u00b7 Organic CSM Movement is comprised of the Impact of new insurance business, Expected movements from asset returns & locked-in rates, Insurance experience gains/losses, and CSM recognized for services provided.\n- \u00b7 Impact of new insurance business on CSM , also referred to as \"new business CSM\", represents growth from sales activity in the period, including individual protection sales (excluding joint ventures), and defined benefit solutions and segregated fund wealth sales in Canada. New business CSM is presented net of acquisition expense gain/loss.\n- \u00b7 Expected movements from asset returns & locked-in rates applies to variable fee approach (\"VFA\") and general measurement approach (\"GMA\") contracts. For VFA contracts, this component of the CSM movement analysis is comprised of two factors: (i) the expected return on underlying assets and (ii) the measurement of financial guarantees. The difference between actual and expected results are reported as the impact of markets. For GMA contracts, this component of the CSM includes the accretion of the CSM balance at locked-in rates, which refer to the term structure associated with locked-in discount rates, set when the insurance contract was sold or on transition to IFRS 17. Average locked-in rates increase with the passage of time on in-force business and new business added at current rates.\n- \u00b7 Impact of markets & other includes the difference between actual and expected movement for VFA contracts for: (i) the return on underlying assets and (ii) the measurement of financial guarantees. Also includes other amounts excluded from Organic CSM Movement.\n- \u00b7 Insurance experience gains/losses represents the current period impacts of insurance experience, resulting in a change in future cash flows that adjust CSM.\n- \u00b7 Impact of change in assumptions represents the future period impacts of changes in fulfilment cash flows that adjust CSM.\n- \u00b7 CSM market sensitivities. CSM market sensitivities are non-IFRS financial measures for which there are no directly comparable measures under IFRS so it is not possible to provide a reconciliation of these amounts to the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nDeployment. This measure represents the amount of capital that has been invested in the period, including leverage where applicable. Deployment also includes capital committed in infrastructure deals to be invested in specific assets. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nDrivers of Earnings. The Drivers of Earnings (\"DOE\") analysis provides additional detail on the sources of earnings, primarily for protection and health businesses, and explains the actual results compared to the longer term expectations. The DOE is presented on a reported and underlying common shareholders' basis. Within the net insurance service result, the underlying DOE provides detail on expected insurance earnings, impact of new insurance business and experience gains (losses). Within the net investment result, the underlying DOE provides detail on expected investment earnings, credit experience, earnings on surplus, and joint ventures & other. For more information, refer to the headings \"Underlying net income and Underlying EPS\", \"Earnings on surplus\", \"Notable items attributable to reported and underlying net income\", in this document.\n\nCertain amounts in the DOE are presented on a net basis to reflect how management views the business, compared to a gross basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples include: i) Net investment result and Other expenses of the Asset Management operating segment are combined with Fee Income to report the net contribution to earnings; ii) Income for fee-based businesses is reported net of the associated expenses; iii) Carried interest in SLC Management within Fee Income excludes the carried interest that Sun Life does not participate in economically, and nets the non-controlling interest portion of the carried interest against fee income and expenses of consolidated funds; iv) Net investment results include assets returns net of the crediting rate for investment contract liabilities and the unwinding of and changes in the discount rate for insurance contract liabilities; v) Earnings on surplus reflects net spread earned from investment strategies; vi) Earnings attributable to the participating account are excluded; and vii) Assumption changes and management actions combines the amounts included in Net insurance service result and Net investment result.\n\nEarnings on Surplus. This component of the Drivers of Earnings represents the net income earned on a company's surplus funds. Earnings on Surplus is comprised of realized gains on fair value through other comprehensive income assets, as well as net investment returns on surplus, such as investment income, gains (losses) on seed investments and investment properties mark-to-market, and also includes impacts from derivatives, currency and other items.\n\nExperience-related items attributable to reported net income and underlying net income. These notable items attributable to reported net income and underlying net income are components of the Drivers of Earnings represents gains and losses that are due to differences between the actual results during the reporting period and management's estimate of the expected longer-term returns on assets and liabilities (i.e. expected insurance earnings and expected investment earnings) at the start of the reporting period.\n\nFee earning AUM. FE AUM consists of assets managed by SLC Management, which are beneficially owned by Clients, on which we earn management fees for providing investment management, property management or advisory-related services. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nFee-related earnings and Operating income. Fee-related earnings represent profitability of SLC Management's fee-related portfolios, and is calculated as Fee-related revenue less Fee-related expenses. Operating income represents profit realized from our business operations, and is calculated as the sum of Fee-related earnings, Investment income (loss) and performance fees, and Interest and other. Fee-related revenue represents all fee income, with the exception of performance fees, generated from third-party investors. Fee-related expenses represent all expenses directly related to generating fee revenue from third-party investors. Investment income (loss) and performance fees represent total income or loss from our seed investments, net of the related expenses. Interest and other represents performance fee compensation, our net interest income or expense and income from managing the General Account assets.",

This ratio is an indicator of the Company's balance sheet strength measured by its proportion of capital qualifying debt in accordance with OSFI guidelines. This is calculated as the ratio of total debt plus preferred shares to total capital including the contractual service margin net of taxes, where debt consists of all capital-qualifying debt securities. Capital-qualifying debt securities consist of subordinated debt and innovative capital instruments. The CSM is included net of taxes because debts are repaid and serviced from available after-tax funds.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, the calculation for the financial leverage ratio was updated to include the CSM balance (net of taxes) in the denominator on adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9.\n\nImpacts of foreign exchange translation. To assist in comparing our results from period-to-period, the favourable or unfavourable impacts of foreign exchange translation are approximated using the foreign exchange rates, in effect during the comparative period, for several IFRS and Non-IFRS financial measures using the average or period end foreign exchange rates, as appropriate. Items impacting a reporting period, such as Revenue, Expenses, and Reported net income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as underlying net income (loss), and sales, are translated into Canadian dollars using average exchange rates for the appropriate daily, monthly, or quarterly period. For Assets and Liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, as well as the AUM and certain components of the Drivers of Earnings disclosure, period-end rates are used for currency translation purposes.\n\nLICAT market sensitivities. LICAT market sensitivities are non-IFRS financial measures for which there are no directly comparable measures under IFRS so it is not possible to provide a reconciliation of these amounts to the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\nPre-tax fee related earnings margin. This ratio is a measure of SLC Management's profitability in relation to funds that earn recurring fee revenues, while excluding investment income and performance fees. The ratio is calculated by dividing fee-related earnings by fee-related revenues and is based on the last twelve months. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nPre-tax net operating margin. This ratio is a measure of the profitability and there is no directly comparable IFRS measure. For MFS, this ratio is calculated by excluding management's ownership of MFS shares and certain commission expenses that are offsetting. These commission expenses are excluded in order to neutralize the impact these items have on the pre-tax net operating margin and have no impact on the profitability of MFS. For SLC Management, the ratio is calculated by dividing the total operating income by fee-related revenue plus investment Income (loss) and performance fees, and is based on the last twelve months.",

IFRS does not prescribe the calculation of ROE and therefore a comparable measure under IFRS is not available. To determine reported ROE and underlying ROE, respectively, reported net income (loss) and underlying net income (loss) is divided by the total weighted average common shareholders' equity for the period. The ROE provides an indication of the overall profitability of the Company. The quarterly ROE is annualized.\n\nSales and flows. Asset Management gross flows includes funds from retail and institutional Clients; SLC Management gross flows include capital raising, such as uncalled capital commitments and fund leverage. Asset Management net flows consist of gross flows less gross outflows; SLC Management's net flows do not include Client distributions from the sale of underlying assets in closed-end funds. In Canada and in Asia, net sales consist of wealth sales & asset management gross flows less redemptions. In Canada, wealth sales & asset management gross flows consist of sales in Group Retirement Services and Individual Wealth; group - health & protection sales consist of workplace benefits sold by Sun Life Health; and individual - protection sales refer to individual insurance sales. In the U.S., group - health & protection sales consist of sales by Group Benefits and Dental. In Asia, wealth sales & asset management gross flows consist of Hong Kong wealth sales & asset management gross flows, Philippines mutual fund sales, wealth sales & asset management gross flows by our India and China joint ventures and associates, and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited's equity and fixed income mutual fund sales based on our proportionate equity interest, including sales as reported by our bank distribution partners; individual - protection sales consist of the individual insurance sales, by our subsidiaries and joint ventures and associates, based on our proportionate equity interest, in the Philippines, Indonesia, India, China, Malaysia, Vietnam, International, Hong Kong and Singapore. Asia also has group - health & protection sales in the Philippines, Hong Kong and our joint ventures. To provide greater comparability across reporting periods, we exclude the impacts of foreign exchange translation from sales and gross flows. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, wealth sales & asset management gross flows in Group Retirement Services in Canada has been updated to exclude retained sales to better align with the methodology for LIMRA reporting. We have updated prior period amounts to reflect this change. Also effective January 1, 2023, insurance sales were renamed to \"Group - Health & Protection sales\" and \"Individual - Protection sales\" to better align to the business types within our business groups. For more information about business types, refer to section A - How We Report Our Results in this document.\n\nThird-party AUM. Third-party AUM is composed of retail, institutional, and other third party assets, which includes general fund and segregated fund assets managed by our joint ventures. In Asset Management, third-party AUM includes Client assets for retail and institutional Clients, as well as capital raising, such as uncalled commitments and fund leverage in SLC Management. In Canada, third-party AUM includes Client assets in retail mutual fund products of Sun Life Global Investments. In Asia, third-party AUM includes Client assets in Hong Kong managed fund products, International wealth & asset management products, Philippines mutual and managed fund products, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited equity and fixed income mutual fund products, Sun Life Everbright Asset Management products and our joint ventures' general fund and segregated fund assets based on our proportionate equity interest. There is no directly comparable IFRS financial measure.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, this measure was renamed to \"third-party AUM\", formerly \"other AUM\", in order to be more descriptive of the nature of these assets. Further, the presentation of \"consolidation adjustments\" has been updated in the current and prior periods to be shown separately from \"third-party AUM\", as consolidation adjustments apply to all components of total AUM.\n\nTotal weighted premium income (\"TWPI\"). This measure consists of 100% renewal premiums, 100% of first year premiums, and 10% of single premiums. In contrast to sales, which only includes premiums from new business, TWPI includes renewal premiums, reflecting the strength of the in-force block and providing a better understanding of both new and existing business. There is no directly comparable IFRS measure.",

We target an underlying dividend payout ratio of between 40% and 50% based on underlying EPS. For more information, see Section J - Capital and Liquidity Management in the 2023 Annual MD&A.\n\nUnderlying effective tax rate. This measure is calculated using the pre-tax underlying net income and the income tax expense associated with it. Our statutory tax rate is normally reduced by various tax benefits, such as lower taxes on income subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions, a range of tax-exempt investment income, and other sustainable tax benefits. Our effective tax rate helps in the analysis of the income tax impacts in the period.\n\n## 4.

        "page_content": "## N.  Accounting and Control Matters\n\nOn January 1, 2023 we adopted IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, detailed below. We have also adopted several amended IFRS standards in the current year, which had no material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, refer to Note 2 in our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 1.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur significant accounting and actuarial policies are described in Notes 1 and 6 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Management must make judgments involving assumptions and estimates, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain, under these policies. The estimates described below are considered particularly significant to understanding our financial performance. As part of our financial control and reporting, judgments involving assumptions and estimates are reviewed by the independent auditor and by other independent advisors on a periodic basis. Accounting policies requiring estimates are applied consistently in the determination of our financial results.\n\nIFRS 17 and IFRS 9 require enhanced disclosures for insurance contracts and financial instruments. These disclosures are included primarily in Notes 5, 6, 10 and 22 of our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended December 31, 2023. Certain disclosures in Note 2.B of the 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the disclosures in this section of this document  provide additional context during the first year of adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. The majority of these disclosures would otherwise only be reported by us annually.\n\n## 1.A Insurance Contracts Summary and Methods and Assumptions\n\n## Summary\n\nWe sell a variety of insurance contracts that include many forms of life, health and critical illness insurance sold to individuals and groups, annuities, and segregated fund products with guarantees. We hold reinsurance contracts that transfer mortality and other risks following internal guidelines.\n\nInsurance contracts with direct participation features are products where investments are managed on behalf of policyholders, and investment returns less a variable fee are passed through to policyholders with the insurance benefits they receive. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are measured using the VFA, and include segregated funds, unit-linked contracts, variable universal life contracts, and most participating insurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts (both issued and held) cannot be measured using the VFA.\n\nInsurance contracts without direct participation features are eligible to use the PAA if the coverage period is one year or less, or if the result of applying the PAA is not expected to be a materially different result than applying the GMA in each reporting period over the life of the contract. Insurance contracts eligible to use the PAA include most group life and health contracts and the associated reinsurance contracts held.\n\nOther insurance contracts are measured using the GMA. This includes most individual life and health insurance contracts and annuities and the associated reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Financial Position present insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held as both assets and liabilities, depending on whether the portfolio is in an asset or liability position.\n\nFor more information about insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held, and Insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders, see Note 1, Note 10 and Note 21 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Methods and Assumptions\n\n## General\n\nA group of insurance contracts is measured as the total of FCF, which is the present value of future cash flows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, and, for groups measured using the GMA or VFA, the CSM. In measuring the present value of future cash flows, assumptions must be made about mortality and morbidity rates, lapse and other policyholder behaviour (\"policyholder behaviour\"), expenses and other factors over the life of our products, and the prevailing market view of the cost of financial risk in our products. Many of these assumptions relate to events that are anticipated to occur many years in the future. Assumptions require significant judgment and regular review and, where appropriate, revision.\n\nThe RA is the compensation we require for the uncertainty related to non-financial risk in the estimates of future cash flows. This compensation is measured by discounting cash flows from applying margins to the non-financial assumptions used in the estimate of future cash flows.\n\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit that will be recognized as insurance contract services are provided.\n\nThe methods and assumptions used in the measurement of insurance contracts are reviewed regularly and are subject to external actuarial peer review.\n\n## Present Value of Future Cash Flows\n\nAssumptions for non-financial risk variables in the present value of future cash flows are intended to be current, neutral estimates of the expected outcome. The choice of assumptions takes into account current circumstances, past experience data from our own experience or from the industry, the relationship of past to expected future experience, anti-selection, the relationship among assumptions (including those for financial risk variables), and other relevant factors.",

        "page_content": "Assumptions for financial risk variables in the present value of future cash flows are based on current observable market prices, adjusted to account for differences between the financial risk embedded in our products and those in the corresponding observed market instrument. Where no relevant market instrument is available, we use the best information available.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality refers to the rates at which death occurs for defined groups of people. Mortality assumptions are generally based on the past five to ten years of experience. Our experience is combined with industry experience or experience from reinsurers where our own experience is insufficient to be statistically valid. Assumed mortality rates for life insurance and annuity contracts include assumptions about future mortality improvement based on recent trends in population mortality and our outlook for future trends.\n\n## Morbidity\n\nMorbidity refers to the rate of being unhealthy or disabled and the rates of recovery therefrom. Most of our disability insurance is marketed on a group basis. We offer critical illness policies on an individual basis in Canada and Asia, long-term care on an individual basis in Canada, and medical stop-loss insurance is offered on a group basis in the U.S. In Canada, group morbidity assumptions are based on our five-year average experience, modified to reflect any emerging trend in recovery rates. For Canadian long-term care and critical illness insurance in Canada and Asia, assumptions are developed in collaboration with our reinsurers and are largely based on their experience. In the U.S., our experience is used for both medical stop-loss and disability assumptions, with some consideration of industry or reinsurer experience.\n\n## Policyholder Behaviour\n\n## Lapse or surrender\n\nPolicyholders may allow their policies to lapse prior to the end of the contractual coverage period by choosing not to continue to pay premiums or by surrendering their policy for the cash surrender value. Assumptions for lapse or surrender experience on life insurance are generally based on our five-year average experience. Lapse or surrender rates vary by plan, age at issue, method of premium payment, policy duration and financial risk variables.\n\n## Premium payment patterns\n\nFor universal life contracts, it is necessary to set assumptions about premium payment patterns. Studies prepared by industry or the actuarial profession are used for products where our experience is insufficient to be statistically valid. Premium payment patterns usually vary by plan, age at issue, method of premium payment, policy duration and financial risk variables.\n\n## Expense\n\nFuture expenses directly attributable to the fulfilment of our insurance contracts include the costs of premium collection, claims adjudication and processing, actuarial calculations, preparation and mailing of policy statements, and related overhead. Future expense assumptions are mainly based on our recent experience using an internal expense allocation methodology. Inflationary increases assumed in future expenses are based on long-term expectations.\n\nAcquisition expenses directly attributable to portfolios of insurance contracts include the costs of selling, underwriting and issuing insurance contracts. For new insurance contracts measured using the GMA or VFA, actual or estimated directly attributable acquisition expenses are recognized in the initial measurement of the contract. If estimates are used, the difference between estimated and actual acquisition expenses adjusts the CSM when the group of insurance contracts is closed to new contracts.\n\n## Current Discount Rates\n\nCurrent discount rates are used to discount estimates of future cash flows in determining the present value of future cash flows. Current discount rates reflect the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows, and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.\n\n## Current discount rates for cash flows that do not vary based on returns on underlying items\n\nCash flows that do not vary at all based on the returns on any underlying items are discounted at rates that reflect the timing and currency of cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.\n\nThe timing of cash flows is reflected by constructing a discount curve, so that each cash flow is discounted consistent with the timing of the cash flow. In constructing the discount curve, a portion is based on market information (the observable period) and beyond that period, the discount rates are estimated (the unobservable period). The observable period, which varies by currency, is the time period where information on risk-free interest rates is deep and liquid. In the unobservable period, risk-free rates are interpolated between the last observable point and an ultimate risk-free rate at year 70. The ultimate risk-free rate is estimated using historical averages.\n\nThe currency of cash flows is reflected by using different discount curves for different currencies.\n\nLiquidity is reflected by adding a liquidity premium to risk-free discount rates that is consistent with the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. The liquidity premium in the observable period is based on the liquidity premium on assets with similar liquidity characteristics, which is estimated from the spread inherent in current market yields less a deduction for expected and unexpected credit losses. The deduction for expected and unexpected credit losses is estimated using historical rating agency data and current market conditions, and varies by asset type, quality, and duration. The liquidity premium in the unobservable period is interpolated between the last observable liquidity premium and an ultimate liquidity premium (at year 70) specific to liquid or illiquid contracts. See Note 10.A in the 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further details, which provides a weighted average summary of the discount curves used to present value cash flows for all major products that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items.\n\n## Current discount rates for cash flows that vary with returns on underlying items\n\nDiscount rates for cash flows that vary directly with returns on underlying items reflect that variability. For the portion of cash flows that is a pass through of returns on underlying items to policyholders, the discount rate is such that the present value of cash flows equals the portion of the underlying items that is passed through to policyholders. For cash flows that vary, but not directly, with underlying items (e.g., financial",

        "page_content": "guarantees), scenario testing may be necessary. If so, discount rates used in the scenario projections are scenario-specific and based on the projected risk-free rates in the scenario plus liquidity premiums consistent with the liquidity characteristics of the contracts being measured.\n\n## Scenario Testing\n\nScenario testing may be required when the relationship between cash flows and financial risk variables is non-linear, or where there are complex interdependencies among cash flows. In scenario testing of financial risk variables, future cash flows are projected for each scenario path and discounted at the scenario-specific discount rates, resulting in a present value of future cash flows for each scenario. The provision for the projected cash flows is the average of the scenario-specific values. Assumptions for non-financial risk variables are the best estimate assumptions consistent with the scenario.\n\nScenarios are consistent with the current market environment. Our Economic Scenario Generator calibration process produces integrated stochastic scenarios of financial risk variables (e.g., risk-free interest rates, bond fund returns, equity returns) with parameters calibrated to replicate observable market prices of financial instruments available in the market. Adjustments are made when the insurance contracts being measured are illiquid but the financial instruments to which the scenarios are calibrated to are liquid.\n\n## Risk Adjustment for Non-Financial Risk\n\nThe RA for insurance contracts issued is the compensation we require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. This amount is measured as the present value of the difference between estimated future cash flows with a margin applied to non-financial assumptions and estimated future cash flows without this adjustment. Margins generally range from 5% to 20% depending on the uncertainty in the determination of the assumption. The level of uncertainty, and hence the margin chosen, varies by assumption and by line of business and other factors. Considerations that would generally lead to a choice of margin at the higher end of the range are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The statistical credibility of our experience is too low to be the primary source of data for choosing the assumption;\n- \u00b7 Future experience is difficult to estimate;\n- \u00b7 The cohort of risks lacks homogeneity;\n- \u00b7 Operational risks adversely impact the ability to estimate the assumption; or\n- \u00b7 Past experience may not be representative of future experience and the experience may deteriorate.\n\nMargins are generally stable over time and are revised only to reflect changes in the level of uncertainty in the assumptions. Our margins tend to be at mid-range.\n\nThe RA for reinsurance contracts held represents the amount of risk transferred to the reinsurer. This is measured as the difference between the RA on the underlying insurance contracts without reinsurance and what the RA on the underlying insurance contracts would be with reinsurance. The RA for reinsurance contracts held increases the asset or reduces the liability for reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe RA for insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held corresponds to a confidence level of approximately 80-85% overall.\n\n## Contractual Service Margin\n\nThe initial and subsequent measurement of CSM is described in Note 2.A.i. in our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional detail about certain components of the measurement of CSM is provided below.\n\n## Interest accretion\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the GMA, locked-in discount rates are used to accrete interest on the CSM. The locked-in discount rate for a group of insurance contracts is the weighted average of the current discount rates at initial recognition of the contracts in the group. For groups of contracts that are in-force as at transition (January 1, 2022), the locked-in discount rates are the discount rates in effect at the date of transition as the fair value approach was applied for these groups at transition.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the VFA, there is no accretion of interest. Rather, the CSM is adjusted by the change in our share of the fair value of underlying items.\n\n## Changes in FCF relating to future service\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the GMA, locked-in discount rates are used to measure changes in FCF relating to future service. Changes in FCF relating to future service reflect changes in non-financial assumptions but not changes in assumptions related to financial risk.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the VFA, current discount rates are used to measure the change in FCF relating to future service. Changes in FCF relating to future service reflect both changes in non-financial assumptions and changes in assumptions related to financial risk.\n\nChanges in FCF relating to future service include (Liability for Remaining Coverage only):\n\n- \u00b7 All changes related to investment component payments (including current period payments);\n- \u00b7 Changes arising from changes in assumptions used to derive the present value of future cash flows - limited to non-financial assumptions for insurance contracts measured using the GMA;\n- \u00b7 Changes in future cash flows arising from claims in the current period; and\n- \u00b7 For insurance contracts measured using the GMA, changes related to discretionary cash flows on some universal life and adjustable products. Discretionary cash flows are cash flows outside the guaranteed payments to the policyholder, and are described as a spread on earned rates (in the case of some universal life contracts) and in the policy on criteria for changes to adjustable policies for adjustable policies.\n\n## CSM recognized for services provided\n\nThe amount of CSM recognized as insurance revenue in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided for a group of contracts in the period is determined by:",

The present value is measured using locked-in discount rates for groups measured using the GMA and current discount rates for groups measured using the VFA.\n\nThe coverage unit for a group is based on the nature of the insurance contract services provided. Insurance contract services comprise services for providing insurance coverage and, for some contracts, investment-return or investment-related services. It does not include services related to performing functions such as claims adjudication.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the VFA, coverage units are based on the policyholder's account value or the policyholders' share of the fair value of underlying items. For insurance contracts measured using the GMA, coverage units are based on the expected claim amount (excluding any investment component) for life and health insurance contracts, and the payment due in a period for annuity contracts.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held, the amount of CSM recognized reflects the services received in the period.\n\n## Sensitivities to Insurance Methods and Assumptions\n\nIn addition to the insurance risks factors and risk management governance and controls described in section K - Risk Management in this document and the Risk Factors section of the 2023 AIF, we also note that on adoption of IFRS 17 and 9, the tables below include sensitivities of contractual service margins to insurance and other non-financial assumption risks.\n\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, the CSM and net income to certain instantaneous changes in the insurance and other non-financial assumptions used in the calculation of our insurance contract liabilities, based on a starting point and business mix as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These sensitivities are calculated independently for each risk factor, generally assuming that all other risk variables stay constant. The estimates are illustrative and different starting points for best estimate assumptions, CSM balances and business mix will result in different estimated sensitivities. These sensitivities represent the Company's estimate of changes in best estimate assumptions that are reasonably likely based on the Company's and/or the industry's historical experience and industry standards and best practices as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe impact on CSM is attributable to insurance contracts measured under the GMA and VFA. For insurance contracts measured under the GMA, the impact flows through the CSM at locked-in discount rates. For insurance contracts measured under the VFA, the impact flows through the CSM at current discount rates.\n\nThe impact on net income is attributable to any portion of the sensitivities for insurance contracts measured under the GMA and VFA that cannot be absorbed by CSM, the full impact for insurance contracts measured under the PAA, and the difference in impact between locked-in and current discount rates for insurance contracts measured under the GMA. If current discount rates are higher than locked-in rates, this generally results in a favourable impact to net income from contracts measured under the GMA.\n\n| ($ millions)                                                        | As at December 31, 2023             | As at December 31, 2023                               | As at December 31, 2022             | As at December 31, 2022                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sensitivity (1)                                                     | Potential  impact on  CSM (pre-tax) | Potential  impact on  net income/ equity (after- tax) | Potential  impact on  CSM (pre-tax) | Potential  impact on  net income/ equity (after- tax) |\n| Policyholder Behaviour (10% increase/decrease, where adverse)       | (950)                               | 100                                                   | (850)                               | 75                                                    |\n| Life Mortality rates (2% increase)                                  | (75)                                | (25)                                                  | (75)                                | (25)                                                  |\n| Annuity Mortality rates (2% decrease)                               | (175)                               | -                                                     | (175)                               | 25                                                    |\n| Morbidity rates (5% incidence increase and 5% termination decrease) | (100)                               | (175)                                                 | (75)                                | (175)                                                 |\n| Expenses (5% increase)                                              | (175)                               | -                                                     | (175)                               | -                                                     |\n\n## Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\n\nDebt securities, equity securities, most mortgages and loans and certain other invested assets are measured FVTPL or FVOCI and are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Changes in fair value of assets measured FVTPL, and realized gains and losses on sale of FVTPL assets are recognized in income. Changes in fair value of FVOCI assets are recorded in OCI. For foreign currency translation, exchange differences calculated on the amortized cost of FVOCI assets are recognized in income and other changes in the carrying amount are recognized in OCI. Net impairment losses and realized gains and losses on sale of FVOCI assets (except for FVOCI equity securities as they remain in OCI) are reclassified from OCI to income.\n\nThe fair value of government and corporate debt securities is primarily determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar securities, where available. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined using market",

        "page_content": "standard valuation methodologies, which include a discounted cash flow method, consensus pricing from various broker dealers that are typically the market makers, or other similar techniques. The assumptions and valuation inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies are determined primarily using observable market inputs, which include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades of identical or similar instruments, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bid prices, and reference data including market research publications. In limited circumstances, non-binding broker quotes are used.\n\nThe fair value of asset-backed securities is primarily determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar securities, where available, or valuation methodologies and valuation inputs similar to those used for government and corporate debt securities. Additional valuation inputs include structural characteristics of the securities, and the underlying collateral performance, such as prepayment speeds and delinquencies. Expected prepayment speeds are based primarily on those previously experienced in the market at projected future interest rate levels. In limited circumstances where there is a lack of sufficient observable market data to value the securities, non-binding broker quotes are used.\n\nThe fair value of equity securities is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities or similar securities. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined using equity valuation models, which include a discounted cash flow method and other techniques that involve benchmark comparison. Valuation inputs primarily include projected future operating cash flows and earnings, dividends, market discount rates, and earnings multiples of comparable companies. Where equity securities are less frequently traded, the most recent exchange-quoted pricing is used to determine fair value.\n\nThe fair value of mortgages and loans is determined by discounting the expected future contractual cash flows using a current market interest rate applicable to financial instruments with a similar yield, credit quality, and maturity characteristics. Valuation inputs typically include benchmark yields and risk-adjusted spreads from current internal lending activities or loan issuances. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, valuation inputs also include external lending activities or loan issuances from both public and private markets, enhancing the market observability of inputs. The risk-adjusted spreads are determined based on the borrower's credit and liquidity, as well as term and other loanspecific features.\n\nThe fair value of other financial liabilities is determined by using the discounted cash flow methodology at the incremental borrowing rate or the effective interest rate. Other financial liabilities categorized as Level 3 represent the present value of the estimated price we would pay to acquire any remaining outstanding shares upon exercise of a put option and any mandatory income distributions. The fair value of the liabilities is based on the average earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the preceding years before the options' exercise dates and EBITDA multiples in accordance with the put agreements as well as the expected amount of any mandatory income distributions. A change in EBITDA would impact the fair value of other financial liabilities and our net income (loss).\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income unless the derivative is part of a qualifying hedging relationship for accounting purposes. The fair value of derivative financial instruments depends upon derivative types. The fair value of exchange-traded futures and options is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, while the fair value of OTC derivatives is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow method or other market standard valuation techniques, with primarily observable market inputs.\n\nValuation inputs used to price OTC derivatives may include swap interest rate curves, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, index prices, the value of underlying securities, projected dividends, volatility surfaces, and in limited circumstances, counterparty quotes. The fair value of OTC derivative instruments also includes credit valuation adjustments to reflect the credit risk of both the derivative counterparty and ourselves as well as the impact of contractual factors designed to reduce our credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset under master netting agreements. Inputs into determining the appropriate credit valuation adjustments are typically obtained from publicly available information and include credit default swap spreads when available, credit spreads derived from specific bond yields, or published cumulative default experience data adjusted for current trends when credit default swap spreads are not available.\n\nThe fair value of other financial invested assets consists primarily of limited partnership investments which is based on net asset value (\"NAV\") provided by management of the limited partnership investments. Based on the unobservable nature of these NAVs, we do not assess whether applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have an impact on the fair value of the limited partnership investments.\n\nInvestment properties are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in income. The fair value of investment properties is generally determined using property valuation models that are based on expected capitalization rates and models that discount expected future net cash flows at current market interest rates reflective of the characteristics, location, and market of each property. Expected future net cash flows include contractual and projected cash flows and forecasted operating expenses, and take into account interest, rental and occupancy rates derived from market surveys. The estimates of future cash inflows, in addition to expected rental income from current leases, include projected income from future leases based on significant assumptions that are consistent with current market conditions. The future rental rates are estimated based on the location, type and quality of the properties, and take into account market data and projections at the valuation date. The fair values are typically compared to market-based information for reasonability, including recent transactions involving comparable assets. The methodologies and inputs used in these models are in accordance with real estate industry valuation standards. Valuations are prepared externally or internally by professionally accredited real estate appraisers.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term securities are classified as held for trading for the purpose of meeting short-term cash requirements and accounted for at FVTPL due to their short-term nature or because they are frequently repriced to current market rates.\n\nInvestments for accounts of segregated fund holders are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) within the segregated fund and are not recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of investments for accounts of segregated fund holders is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets or independent valuation information provided by investment managers. The fair value of direct investments within investments for accounts of segregated fund holders, such as short-term securities and government and corporate debt securities, is determined according to valuation methodologies and inputs described above in the respective asset type sections. The fair value of the secured borrowings from mortgage securitization is based on the methodologies and assumptions as described above for asset-backed securities.",

        "page_content": "The fair value of investment contracts is measured through the use of prospective discounted cash flow method. For unit-linked contracts, the fair value is equal to the current unit fund value, plus additional non-unit liability amounts on a fair value basis if required. For non-unitlinked contracts, the fair value is equal to the present value of contractual cash flow. The fair value of the investment contract liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the nature of the contracts.\n\nThe fair values of these obligations are based on the fair value of the underlying securities, which can include debt or equity securities. The method used to determine fair value is based on the quoted market prices where available in an active market.\n\nThe fair value of underlying assets within our CLOs is determined primarily using observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and other observable market data.\n\nThe fair value of underlying liabilities within our CLOs is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using a current market interest rate applicable to financial instruments with a similar yield, credit quality, maturity characteristics, and structural credit protections. The valuation technique maximizes the use of observable inputs that incorporates comparable securities' prices and other market intelligence.\n\nThe methodologies and assumptions for determining the fair values of investment contract liabilities are included in Note 10.A of the 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe categorize our assets and liabilities carried at fair value, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Fair value is based on the unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. The types of assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 generally include cash and cash equivalents, certain U.S. government and agency securities, exchange-traded equity securities, and certain segregated and mutual fund units held for account of segregated fund holders.\n\nLevel 2: Fair value is based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities traded in active markets, or prices from valuation techniques that use significant observable inputs, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data through correlation or other means. The types of assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 generally include Canadian federal, provincial and municipal government, other foreign government and corporate debt securities, certain asset-backed securities, OTC derivatives, and certain segregated and mutual fund units held for account of segregated fund holders.\n\nLevel 3: Fair value is based on valuation techniques that require one or more significant inputs that are not based on observable market inputs. These unobservable inputs reflect our expectations about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The types of assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 generally include certain corporate bonds, certain other invested assets, and investment properties.\n\nAs pricing inputs become more or less observable, assets are transferred between levels in the hierarchy. Total gains and losses in income and OCI are calculated assuming transfers into or out of Level 3 occur at the beginning of the period. For a financial instrument that transfers into Level 3 during the reporting period, the entire change in fair value for the period is included in the Level 3 reconciliation schedule in Note 5 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. For transfers out of Level 3 during the reporting period, the change in fair value for the period is excluded from the Level 3 reconciliation schedule in Note 5 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Transfers into Level 3 occur when the inputs used to price the financial instrument lack observable market data and as a result, no longer meet the Level 1 or 2 criteria at the reporting date. Transfers out of Level 3 occur when the pricing inputs become more transparent and satisfy the Level 1 or 2 criteria at the reporting date.\n\nTransfers into and out of Level 3 for financial assets were $390 million and $918 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, (December 31, 2022 - $nil (1) and $123 million (1) , respectively). The total amount of the net realized/unrealized gains (losses) related to financial instruments transferred out of Level 3 during the period, which were excluded from the Level 3 reconciliation, was a gain of $31 million as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - loss of $18 million (1) ).\n\nAdditional information on the fair value measurement of investments can be found in Note 5 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets of the acquired businesses. Goodwill is carried at original cost less any impairment subsequently incurred. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that may result in the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (\"CGU\") falling below its carrying value. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other groups of assets. The goodwill balances are allocated to either individual or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill impairment is quantified by comparing a CGU's or a group of CGU's carrying value to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Impairment losses are recognized immediately and cannot be reversed in future periods.\n\nImpairment charges on goodwill of $nil were recognized in 2023. We had a carrying value of $8,969 million in goodwill as at December 31, 2023. Additional information on goodwill can be found in Note 9 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or using a units-of-production method, over the useful economic lives: i) Distribution, sales potential of field force, client relationships and asset administration contracts - 3 to 40 years ii) and internally generated software - 3 to 10 years. Amortization is charged through operating expenses. The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually, and the amortization is adjusted as necessary. Indefinite life intangibles are not amortized, and are assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying values of the indefinite life intangible assets to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the carrying values of the indefinite life intangibles exceed their recoverable amounts, these assets are considered impaired, and a charge for impairment is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The recoverable amount of intangible assets is determined using various valuation models, which require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that could affect the estimates of the recoverable amount. Impairment charges on intangible assets of $5 million were recognized in 2023 (2022 - $18 million).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, our finite life intangible assets had a carrying value of $4 billion, which reflected the value of the field force, asset administration contracts, and Client relationships acquired as part of the Clarica, CMG Asia, Genworth EBG, Dialogue, Ryan Labs, Prime Advisors, AAM, Bentall Kennedy, DentaQuest and the U.S. employee benefits business acquisitions, the ACB bancassurance partnership, and Crescent, as well as software costs. Our indefinite life intangible assets had a carrying value of $1 billion as at December 31, 2023. The value of the indefinite life intangible assets reflected fund management contracts of MFS, BGO, InfraRed, Crescent and AAM.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method. Our provision for income taxes is calculated based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nAs a multinational organization, we are subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions. We seek to operate in a tax efficient manner while ensuring that we are in compliance with all laws and regulations. The determination of the required provision for current and deferred income taxes requires that we interpret tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and that we make assumptions about the expected timing of realization of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Tax laws are complex and their interpretation requires significant judgment. The provision for income taxes reflects management's interpretation of the relevant tax laws and its best estimate of the income tax implications of the transactions and events during the period. We believe that our provisions for uncertain tax positions appropriately reflect the risk of tax positions that are under audit, dispute or appeal with tax authorities, or which are otherwise considered to involve uncertainty. The adequacy of our tax provision is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. To the extent that our interpretations differ from those of tax authorities or the timing of realization is not as expected, the provision for income taxes may increase or decrease in future periods to reflect actual experience. The amount of any increase or decrease cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized. At each reporting period, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the amount of deferred income tax assets to be recorded. If it is probable that the benefit of tax losses and tax deductions will not be realized, a deferred income tax asset is not recognized. The assessment requires significant estimates and judgment about future events based on the information available at the reporting date.\n\nFrom time to time, local governments, in countries in which we operate, enact changes to statutory corporate income tax rates. These changes require us to review and re-measure our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment. As at December 31, 2023, our net deferred tax asset in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position was $3,597 million, primarily in Canada. Any future tax rate reductions in jurisdictions where we carry a net deferred tax asset, could result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset and a corresponding income tax expense at the time of substantial enactment of a rate reduction.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project has prompted governments around the world, including Canada, to consider wide-ranging tax reforms to address BEPS and transparency issues. The proposals include introducing a global minimum tax rate of 15% to ensure that large multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each jurisdiction where they operate.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, the Canadian Department of Finance released draft legislation to implement certain previously announced measures, including application rules for a 15% global minimum tax under Pillar Two, which is applied on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. The global minimum tax rules will apply to Sun Life effective January 1, 2024, however the timing of the substantive enactment of these rules in most jurisdictions where Sun Life operates is uncertain. Under the legislation, Sun Life is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the effective tax rate under the Pillar Two rules on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, and the 15% minimum rate. The Pillar Two rules are not expected to have a material impact on Sun Life's consolidated financial statements when they become effective.\n\nOn December 27, 2023, Bermuda enacted its Corporate Income Tax Act 2023, which will apply a 15% income tax beginning on January 1, 2025. Bermuda Corporate Income Taxes are expected to be a covered tax and will reduce Pillar Two top-up taxes which would otherwise be payable to other jurisdictions. The enacted legislation provides an economic transition adjustment that aligns an entity's starting point for the tax regime more closely with its economic position prior to the application of the Corporate Income Tax 2023. The benefit of this economic transition adjustment has been recognized in 2023. The Bermuda Corporate Income Tax is not expected to have a material impact on Sun Life's consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective in 2025.\n\nThe Canadian Department of Finance has issued legislation which, if enacted, may limit the deductibility of interest and financing expenses for Canadian tax purposes, and would apply to Sun Life effective January 1, 2024. A Notice of Ways and Means Motion, which included this legislation, was released and tabled in Parliament in November 2023. We continue to monitor developments and assess the impact on our consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees. All of our material defined benefit plans worldwide are closed to new entrants with new hires participating in defined contribution plans. Our defined benefit pension plans offer benefits based on length of service and final average earnings and certain plans offer some indexation of benefits. We maintain certain supplementary non-contributory defined benefit pension arrangements for eligible employees, which are primarily for benefits which are in excess of local tax limits. In addition to these plans, in some countries the Company sponsors certain post-retirement benefit plans (for medical, dental and/or life insurance benefits) for eligible qualifying employees and their dependents who meet certain requirements.\n\nIn Canada, since January 1, 2009, all new employees participate in a defined contribution plan, while existing employees continue to accrue future benefits in the prior plan which provides a defined benefit plan and an optional contributory defined contribution plan.\n\nWith the closure of the Canadian defined benefit plans to new entrants, the volatility associated with future service accruals for active members has been limited and will decline over time. As at December 31, 2023, there are no active employees accruing future service benefits in the U.S. defined benefit plans. In 2023 all assets and liabilities associated with the UK pension plans were transferred to the buyer as part of the sale of Sun Life's UK business.\n\nThe major risks remaining in relation to past service obligations are increases in liabilities due to a decline in discount rates, greater life expectancy than assumed and adverse asset returns. We have significantly de-risked the investments of our material defined benefit pension plans Company-wide by systematically shifting the pension asset mix towards liability matching investments. The target for our significant plans is to minimize volatility in funded status arising from changes in discount rates and exposure to equity markets.\n\nDue to the long-term nature of these defined benefit plans, the calculation of benefit expenses and accrued benefit obligations depends on various assumptions, including discount rates, rates of compensation increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement ages, mortality rates and termination rates. Based upon consultation with external pension actuaries, management determines the assumptions used for these plans on an annual basis. The discount rate used for our material defined benefit plans is determined with reference to market yields of highquality corporate bonds that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of obligations.\n\nActual experience may differ from that assumed, which would impact the valuation of defined benefit plans and the level of benefit expenses recognized in future years. Details of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans and the key assumptions used for the valuation these plans are included in Note 24 of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.  Changes in Accounting Policies\n\nWe have included in this section a summary of changes in accounting policies. Where there are references to Notes, these are part of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Please also refer to Note 2 of our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n\n## 2.A New and Amended International Financial Reporting Standards Adopted in 2023\n\n## 2.A.i Adoption of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 17\"), with an amendment issued in June 2020 to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. This standard is to be applied using a retrospective approach, with at least one year of comparative results provided. If retrospective application to a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, a modified retrospective or fair value approach may be used. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 4\") and impacts how we recognize, measure, present, and disclose our insurance contracts in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (\"IFRS 9\") were effective for us beginning January 1, 2023. IFRS 9 includes guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting, and does not require restatement of comparative periods. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (\"IAS 39\"). We are permitted, under IFRS 17, to present comparative information on financial assets as if IFRS 9 were applicable during the comparative period (\"classification overlay\"). We have elected to apply the classification overlay to our financial assets and their comparative period results as if IFRS 9 had been effective since January 1, 2022. Certain comparative period information will continue to be presented in accordance with our previous accounting policies.\n\nFor initial measurement of insurance contracts at the transition date of January 1, 2022, we have elected to use the fair value approach for all groups for which the retrospective approach is impracticable. For more information on the application of the fair value approach at transition, see the heading \"Fair Value Measurement\" in Note 2.A.i in our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. The key principles of IFRS 17 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts are those under which an entity accepts significant insurance risk from another party (\"policyholder\") by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (\"insured event\") adversely affects the policyholder.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held are divided into groups that will be separately recognized and measured.\n- \u00b7 Groups of insurance contracts are recognized and measured as the total of the following measurement components: a) the present value of future cash flows; b) a risk adjustment for non-financial risk (\"RA\"); and c) the Contractual Service Margin (\"CSM\"), an amount that represents the unearned profit of the group of contracts. These measurement components apply to groups of insurance contracts measured using the GMA and the VFA. The VFA applies to insurance contracts issued with direct participation features, which are substantially investment-related service contracts under which the policyholder is promised an investment return based on underlying items, such as segregated funds and certain participating insurance contracts. For short duration contracts, such as most of our group life and health business, a simplified measurement approach (PAA) is applied. Under the PAA, insurance contracts are measured based on unearned profits and do not include a CSM.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The profit from a group of insurance contracts is recognized into income over the period that insurance contract services are provided and as the non-financial risks related to providing the insurance contracts diminish.\n- \u00b7 Insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and insurance finance income or expenses are presented separately.\n\n## Significant Differences between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4\n\nThe following section describes the most significant differences between IFRS 17 and the accounting policies applied under IFRS 4.\n\n## Scope\n\nThere is no substantial change in IFRS 17 compared to IFRS 4 with regards to which contracts fall within the scope of the standard. However, we have updated the accounting policy for classification that was adopted on the transition to IFRS 4 in 2011 to ensure consistency with the IFRS 17 definition of insurance contracts.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, an insurance contract is defined as a contract under which the issuer accepts significant insurance risk from the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if an insured event adversely affects the policyholder. In assessing whether \"significant\" insurance risk exists, certain contracts that were classified as insurance contracts under IFRS 4 were reclassified as investment contracts under IFRS 17. Such changes in classification were limited to certain deferred annuity products where the insurance risk is limited to the right to annuitize the maturity benefit, which fell short of the threshold for \"significant\" insurance risk.\n\nFurthermore, IFRS 17 includes new requirements for the separation of distinct investment components and distinct goods or non-insurance service components of insurance contracts. At transition to IFRS 17, there were no distinct investment components and only immaterial distinct service components in our insurance contracts.\n\nUnlike IFRS 4, IFRS 17 requires reinsurance contracts held to be measured separately from the underlying direct contracts. A reinsurance contract is an insurance contract issued by the reinsurer to compensate another entity for claims arising from one or more insurance contracts issued by that other entity (\"underlying contracts\").\n\nOnly contracts that transfer insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered reinsurance contracts held from the ceding entity's point of view. We have reinsurance treaties that transfer only non-insurance risks to the reinsurer, however these are not considered reinsurance contracts held in scope of IFRS 17, nor were they in scope of IFRS 4. Rather, they are treated as insurance contracts purchased.\n\nReinsurance treaties that are part of the underlying items of participating insurance contracts (i.e., where all the cash flows of the reinsurance treaty are fully passed through to the participating insurance policyholders) are measured and reported separately.\n\nInvestment contracts with DPF are in scope of IFRS 17 and were in scope of IFRS 4. However, such contracts were reported with other investment contracts under IFRS 4, and are reported with insurance contracts under IFRS 17.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe measurement of insurance contracts under IFRS 17 differs from the Canadian Asset Liability Method previously applied under IFRS 4. The most significant differences by measurement component are as follows:\n\n## Present value of future cash flows:\n\n- \u00b7 The discount rates used to present value future cash flows under IFRS 17 are based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts. Under IFRS 4, the Canadian Asset Liability Method is used to determine actuarial liabilities based on the portfolio of assets currently supporting the insurance contract liabilities and reinvestment assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Estimates under IFRS 17 include the current market view of the cost of financial guarantees, which requires a valuation consistent with market option prices. Under IFRS 4, the cost of financial guarantees is based on the amount required to fulfill the obligation but not directly linked to market option prices.\n- \u00b7 Expense cash flows under IFRS 17 are limited to those directly attributable to fulfillment of the obligations under insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Future income taxes are excluded from future cash flows under IFRS 17.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk:\n\n- \u00b7 Measures the compensation required for uncertainty related to non-financial risk, such as mortality, morbidity, surrender and expenses under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Provisions for uncertainty related to financial risk are implicitly included in the present value of future cash flows under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 No amount is provided for asset-liability mismatch risk under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Under IFRS 4, amounts provided for the risks listed above are reflected in a provision for adverse deviations included in insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## CSM:\n\n- \u00b7 This is a new component of liabilities and necessitates the \"grouping\" of insurance contracts, which is not required under IFRS 4.\n- \u00b7 The CSM represents unearned profits, as discussed above.\n\nThe measurement approaches under IFRS 17 and IFRS 4 are similar for insurance contracts measured using the PAA, such as our group life and health contracts. Differences arise mainly in the measurement of the liability for incurred claims (\"LIC\"), where the discount rate and risk adjustment for non-financial risk changes noted above apply.\n\n## Presentation\n\nIFRS 17 requires that portfolios of insurance contracts that are in an asset position be presented separately from portfolios of insurance contracts that are in a liability position in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Also, portfolios of insurance contracts issued must be presented separately from portfolios of reinsurance contracts held. Previously, insurance contracts issued were presented only as liabilities and reinsurance contracts held were presented only as assets. Certain balances, such as policy loans and outstanding and prepaid",

        "page_content": "premiums, that were previously presented separately or included in Other assets and Other liabilities are now included in the assets or liabilities for insurance contracts issued or reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe presentation of income from insurance contracts on the Consolidated Statements of Operations has changed significantly for IFRS 17. Prior to IFRS 17, insurance related income was presented separately in the lines Gross premiums, Ceded premiums, Gross claims and benefits paid, Reinsurance expenses (recoveries), Increase (decrease) in insurance contract liabilities, and Decrease (increase) in reinsurance assets. The line Operating expenses, commissions and premium taxes included all expenses, reflecting those from both insurance and non-insurance contracts.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, insurance-related income is presented in the Insurance service result section and the Insurance finance income (expenses) line in the Investment result section. Amounts are presented separately for insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. The Insurance service expenses line includes amounts previously reported as Gross claims and benefits paid, with the exclusion of repayments of investment components, which are amounts that are returned to policyholders under all circumstances. Directly attributable expenses are also presented as Insurance service expenses. Income or expense from reinsurance contracts held is now presented as one line, which includes an allocation of reinsurance premiums paid and amounts recovered from reinsurers.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the GMA or VFA, premiums are no longer reported as revenue or recognized in income when received. Insurance revenue in a reporting period is comprised of the portion of premiums that cover expected claims and directly attributable expenses in the period, as well as the release of RA and the amortization of CSM for the period. Insurance revenue excludes the portion of premiums that cover repayment of investment components.\n\nFee income excludes income from insurance contracts as any fees earned would be recognized in Insurance contract revenue. Similarly, the Operating expenses and commissions line excludes expenses that are directly attributable to issuing or fulfilling insurance contracts as these expenses, as well as premium taxes paid, are included in the Insurance service result section.\n\n## Revised accounting policies on adoption of IFRS 17\n\nFor more information about the revised accounting policies as a result of the adoption of IFRS 17 that differ from those included in our 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, refer to Note 2.A.i of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Impacts on our financial performance\n\nWe have highlighted in the following section certain impacts on our financial performance as a result of the differences between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4 described above:\n\n- \u00b7 New business gains (unearned profits) are measured differently under IFRS 17, reflecting measurement differences on insurance contracts as discussed above. In addition, new business gains under IFRS 17 are deferred and recorded in the CSM and amortized into income as insurance contract services are provided. Losses on new business are also measured differently, but continue to be recognized in income immediately. Under IFRS 4, new business gains and losses were both recognized in income immediately.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates used in calculating the present value of insurance contract liabilities are based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts rather than the assets supporting the liabilities. Amongst other differences, this results in changes in the timing of when investment-related income emerges.\n- \u00b7 Under IFRS 17, changes related to financial risk (e.g. changes in the discount rate) continue to be recognized in income immediately, except for insurance contracts measured using the VFA, where the changes are recorded through the CSM. Assumption changes for non-financial risk, such as mortality, are reflected in the CSM and amortized into income as insurance contract services are provided. Under IFRS 4, assumption changes for both financial and non-financial risk variables were recognized in income immediately.\n\n## Significant Differences between IFRS 9 and IAS 39\n\nThe following section describes the most significant differences between IFRS 9 and the accounting policies applied under IAS 39.\n\n## Classification of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 introduces three principal classification categories for financial assets. Financial assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are classified as and subsequently measured at FVTPL, FVOCI or amortized cost based on our business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\nIFRS 9 eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held-to-maturity, available-for-sale (\"AFS\"), and loans and receivable financial assets. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument, as a whole, is assessed for classification.\n\nIFRS 9 maintains the IAS 39 classification for financial liabilities. Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are measured at either amortized cost or FVTPL.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, we elected to recognize all insurance finance income or expense in income rather than other comprehensive income. Consequently, to avoid an accounting mismatch, we are electing under IFRS 9 to classify most of our fixed income assets supporting insurance contracts as FVTPL.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIFRS 9 replaces the \"incurred loss\" model under IAS 39 with a forward-looking ECL model. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt securities measured at FVOCI, mortgages and loans measured at FVOCI, lease receivables, account receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at FVTPL. Credit losses are recognized earlier under IFRS 9 as compared previously under IAS 39. IFRS 9 introduces an impairment model for financial assets not measured at FVTPL. The model requires the recognition of an allowance for 12-month expected losses at the initial recognition of a financial asset, and the recognition of an allowance for lifetime expected losses if certain criteria are met.",

        "page_content": "## Hedge accounting\n\nIFRS 9 introduced a new hedge accounting model, but permits entities to continue applying hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 instead of those under IFRS 9. We have elected to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 amendments\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2, which includes amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (\"IFRS 7\"), IFRS 4, and IFRS 16 Leases (\"IFRS 16\"). These amendments address issues that arise from the implementation of the reforms, including the replacement of a benchmark with an alternative reference rate ('ARR'), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'), in the case of US dollar LIBOR, and the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average ('CORRA'), in the case of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (\"CDOR\"). The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAll LIBOR settings were either discontinued or declared non-representative on or before June 30, 2023. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited, the administrator of CDOR, announced that it will permanently cease the publication of all three tenors of CDOR after June 28, 2024. Concurrently, OSFI published their expectation that Federally Regulated Financial Institutions (\"FRFIs\") transition all new derivatives and securities to an ARR by June 30, 2023, with no new CDOR exposure being recognized after that date (with limited exceptions for risk management requirements), and that loan agreements referencing CDOR be transitioned by June 28, 2024. FRFIs are also expected to prioritize system and model updates to accommodate the use of CORRA (or any alternative reference rates, as necessary) prior to such date.\n\nAlso, with the cessation of CDOR's publication, the Bankers' Acceptance ('BA') lending model will be discontinued, and BA issuance is expected to cease. To facilitate the Canadian loan markets' move away from CDOR and BAs, on July 27, 2023, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group ('CARR'), established by the Canadian Fixed-Income Forum committee of the Bank of Canada ('CFIF'), has implemented a milestone in its two-stage transition plan whereby no new CDOR or BA-related contract should be entered into after November 1, 2023. CFIF has formed a BA-related working group to facilitate a smooth transition away from BAs and to assess potential options to replace them.\n\nIn preparation for the above-mentioned benchmark reform, we implemented an Interbank Offered Rate (\"IBOR\") Transition Program (the \"Program\") to manage the transition from LIBOR and CDOR to appropriate ARRs. The Program is cross-functional in nature and comprises key stakeholders across our organization and operates with executive oversight. The Program is on track in executing its transition plan, and is mindful of incorporating market developments as they arise. We also actively participate in industry associations and incorporate best practice guidance from these industry associations, as well as regulatory bodies, into the transition plan, such as reviewing and remediating our IBOR-based contracts to incorporate appropriate fallback language. The Program is designed to address the risk and uncertainty relating to our transition to ARRs and other factors relating to reform that could otherwise adversely affect our operations and cash flows and the value of and return on our investments that are IBOR-based. Our affiliated entities with IBOR exposure related to derivatives adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol prior to June 30, 2023, facilitating the transition of our legacy derivative contracts to appropriate ARRs. Our GBP LIBOR exposure transitioned to Sterling Overnight Index Average, and our remaining US dollar LIBOR and CDOR exposure has transitioned or is expected to transition to appropriate ARRs in the first half of 2024.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, our exposure to US dollar LIBOR consists of non-derivative financial assets of $86 million (December 31, 2022 $2,750 million), non-derivative financial liabilities of $nil (December 31, 2022 - $77 million) and derivative notional of $nil (December 31, 2022 - $1,683 million) that have not yet been confirmed to have transitioned to SOFR. Our exposure to CDOR consists of non-derivative financial assets of $589 million (December 31, 2022 - $396 million), non-derivative financial liabilities of $4,896 million (December 31, 2022 $5,892 million), and derivative notional of $9,159 million (December 31, 2022 - $11,725 million) that have not yet transitioned to CORRA, excluding financial instruments maturing by June 28, 2024, and including derivatives that are expected to automatically transition to CDOR upon its cessation.\n\n## Revised accounting policies on adoption of IFRS 9\n\nFor more information about the revised accounting policies as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 that differ from those included in our 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, refer to heading \"IFRS 9 Financial Instruments\" in Note 2.A.ii of our 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 2.A.ii Other Amended International Financial Reporting Standards Adopted in 2023\n\nWe adopted the following amendments to IFRS on January 1, 2023. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\nIn May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes (\"IAS 12\"). The amendments, Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction, narrow the scope of the recognition exemption in IAS 12 so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (\"IAS 1\") and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgments (\"IFRS Practice Statement 2\"). The amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.\n\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . The amendments clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 to give temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes arising from Pillar Two model rules, which the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") published in December 2021. The amendments introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from jurisdictions implementing the global tax rules",

The Pillar Two rules are not expected to have a material impact on Sun Life's consolidated financial statements when they become effective.\n\n## 2.B New and Amended International Financial Reporting Standards to be Adopted in 2024\n\nThe following new and amended IFRS were issued by the IASB. We expect to adopt these in 2024:\n\nIn September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 to add subsequent measurement requirements for sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a way that it does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The amendments to IFRS 16 will be effective for annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early application permitted. We do not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.  Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management, including the Company's President and CEO, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\"), and Executive Vice-President, Chief Legal Officer and Public Affairs, on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure.\n\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under rules adopted by the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the SEC, as at December 31, 2023, was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company's management, including the CEO and the CFO. Based on our evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2023, has been audited by the Company's external auditor, Deloitte LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, who also audited our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. As stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, they have expressed an unqualified opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAs a result of the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, effective January 1, 2023, we made the necessary technology updates and modifications to the financial reporting processes and controls related to actuarial, finance, ALM and investments to comply with the requirements of the new accounting standards. No changes were made in our internal control over financial reporting for the period which began on January 1, 2023 and ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## O.  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\nInformation concerning legal and regulatory matters is provided in our Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the AIF, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2023.",

Forward-looking Statements\n\nFrom time to time, the Company makes written or oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the 'safe harbour' provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking statements contained in this document include statements (i) relating to our strategies; (ii) relating to expectations with respect to the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Change and its impact on our consolidated financial statements; (iii) relating to the use of proceeds of our sustainability bond offering; (iv) relating to our normal course issuer bid (including, but not limited to, statements regarding future purchases of common shares under the NCIB); (v) relating to MFS going to market with active ETFs over the next year; (vi) relating to the expected operational launch of SLCSI in 2024; (vii) relating to the expected full launch of our Diabetes Signature Solutions products in 2024; (viii) relating to expected changes in our LICAT ratio; (ix) relating to our growth initiatives and other business objectives; (x) relating to our targets, goals and commitments (including with respect to our sustainability plan and net zero emissions); (xi) relating to our expected tax range for future years; (xii) set out in this document under the heading K - Risk Management - Market Risk Sensitivities - Interest Rate Sensitivities; (xiii) relating to the expected impact of the Pillar Two rules; (xiv) relating to legislation issued by the Canadian Department of Finance potentially limiting the deductibility of interest and financing expenses for Canadian tax purposes, if enacted; (xv) relating to our remaining US dollar LIBOR and CDOR exposure transitioning to appropriate ARRs in the first half of 2024; (xvi) relating to the expected impact of the adoption of the amendments to IFRS 16; (xvii) that are predictive in nature or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions; and (xviii) that include words such as 'achieve', 'aim', 'ambition', 'anticipate', 'aspiration', 'assumption', 'believe', 'could', 'estimate', 'expect', 'goal', 'initiatives', 'intend', 'may', 'objective', 'outlook', 'plan', 'project', 'seek', 'should', 'strategy', 'strive', 'target', 'will', and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations. These statements represent our current expectations, estimates, and projections regarding future events and are not historical facts, and remain subject to change.\n\nForward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Future results and shareholder value may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Our ability to achieve our netzero GHG emissions reduction goals and targets is based on a number of assumptions and is subject to a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability of comprehensive, comparable and high-quality GHG emissions data, the need for active and continued participation of stakeholders (including enterprises, financial institutions and governmental and non-governmental organizations), the establishment and fulfilment of climate commitments and net-zero targets by governments and companies, the development and deployment of new technologies and industry-specific solutions including in hard-to-abate sectors, international cooperation, and the development of regulations internationally. The energy transition will not be linear and the pace of decarbonization for different sectors and countries will vary. We intend to review and potentially revise our emissions reduction goals and targets as appropriate as data quality and methodologies improve and as best practices, regulations and climate science continue to evolve. Other factors that may cause actual results and shareholder value to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements include the matters set out in this document under the headings D - Profitability - 5 - Income taxes, G - Financial Strength and K - Risk Management and in SLF Inc.'s 2023 AIF under the heading Risk Factors, and the factors detailed in SLF Inc.'s other filings with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators, which are available for review at www.sedarplus.ca and www.sec.gov, respectively.\n\n## Medium-Term Financial Objectives\n\nThe Company's medium-term financial objectives set out in section B - Overview - 2 - Financial Objectives are forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures. Our ability to achieve those objectives is dependent on our success in achieving growth initiatives and business objectives and on certain key assumptions that include: (i) no significant changes in the level of interest rates; (ii) average total return on real estate and equity investments of approximately 8% per annum; (iii) credit experience in line with expectations; (iv) no significant changes in the level of our regulatory capital requirements; (v) no significant changes to our effective tax rate; (vi) no significant increase in the number of shares outstanding; and (vii) other key assumptions include: no material changes to our hedging program, hedging costs that are consistent with our expectations, no material assumption changes and no material accounting standard changes. Our underlying ROE is dependent upon capital levels and options for deployment of excess capital. Our medium-term financial objectives do not reflect the indirect effects of interest rate and equity market movements including the potential impacts on goodwill or the current valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as well as other items that may be non-operational in nature.\n\nOur target dividend payout ratio of 40%-50% of our underlying net income assumes that economic conditions and our results will enable us to maintain our payout ratio in the target range, while maintaining a strong capital position. The declaration, amount and payment of dividends is subject to the approval of SLF Inc.'s Board of Directors and our compliance with the capital requirements in the Insurance Companies Act (Canada). Additional information on dividends is provided in the section J - Capital and Liquidity Management - 3 - Shareholder Dividends in this MD&A.\n\nAlthough considered reasonable by the Company, we may not be able to achieve our medium-term financial objectives as the assumptions on which these objectives were based may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results could differ materially from our medium-term financial objectives as described in the section B - Overview - 2 - Financial Objectives in this MD&A. Our medium-term financial objectives do not constitute guidance.",

This responsibility includes selecting appropriate accounting policies and making estimates and other judgments consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards. The financial information presented elsewhere in the annual report to shareholders is consistent with these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors (\"Board\") oversees management's responsibilities for financial reporting. An Audit Committee of non-management directors is appointed by the Board to review the Consolidated Financial Statements and report to the Board prior to their approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements for issuance to shareholders. Other key responsibilities of the Audit Committee include reviewing the Company's existing internal control procedures and planned revisions to those procedures, and advising the Board on auditing matters and financial reporting issues.\n\nManagement is also responsible for maintaining systems of internal control that provide reasonable assurance that financial information is reliable, that all financial transactions are properly authorized, that assets are safeguarded, and that Sun Life Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as \"the Company\", adhere to legislative and regulatory requirements. These systems include the communication of policies and the Company's Code of Business Conduct throughout the organization. Internal controls are reviewed and evaluated by the Company's internal auditors.\n\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2023, based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Audit Committee also conducts such review and inquiry of management and the internal and external auditors as it deems necessary towards establishing that the Company is employing appropriate systems of internal control, is adhering to legislative and regulatory requirements and is applying the Company's Code of Business Conduct. Both the internal and external auditors and the Company's Appointed Actuary have full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee with and without the presence of management.\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada conducts periodic examinations of the Company. These examinations are designed to evaluate compliance with provisions of the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) and to ensure that the interests of policyholders, depositors, and the public are safeguarded. The Company's foreign operations and foreign subsidiaries are examined by regulators in their local jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company's Appointed Actuary, who is a member of management, is appointed by the Board to discharge the various actuarial responsibilities required under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), and conducts the valuation of the Company's actuarial liabilities. The role of the Appointed Actuary is described in more detail in Note 10. The report of the Appointed Actuary accompanies these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's external auditor, Deloitte LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, has audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, in addition to auditing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

        "page_content": "## Independent Auditor's Report\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Sun Life Financial Inc.\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Sun Life Financial Inc. (the 'Company'), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022, and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements').\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and January 1, 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IFRS').\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards ('Canadian GAAS'). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Insurance Contract Liabilities - Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the Financial Statements\n\n## Key Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's insurance contract liabilities represent a significant portion of its total liabilities. Insurance contract liabilities are determined in accordance with IFRS 17. This requires the use of complex valuation models and assumptions to measure groups of insurance contracts as the total of fulfillment cash flows, plus a risk adjustment for non-financial risk and a contractual service margin ('CSM'). The CSM component is only relevant for groups of insurance contracts measured using the general measurement approach and the variable fee approach.\n\nWhile there is considerable judgment applied by management and inherent uncertainty in selecting assumptions, the assumptions with the greatest estimation uncertainty are those related to mortality, policyholder behaviour and discount rates. These assumptions required significant auditor attention particularly for (i) circumstances where there is limited Company and industry experience data, (ii) circumstances where the historical experience may not be a good indicator of the future, and (iii) the determination of discount rates, which requires complex calculation and measurement of unobservable market inputs. Auditing certain valuation models and significant assumptions (mortality, policyholder behaviour and discount rates) required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve actuarial and fair value specialists.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to certain valuation models and significant assumptions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated and tested the effectiveness of controls over actuarial models and the determination of the mortality, policyholder behaviour and discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of insurance contract liabilities, as well as access and change management controls over those actuarial models.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of actuarial and fair value specialists, tested the appropriateness of certain valuation models used in the valuation process by:\n- \u00b7 Calculating an independent estimate of the insurance contract liability for a sample of insurance policies and comparing the results to the Company's estimate; and\n- \u00b7 Testing the accuracy of certain valuation models for changes in key assumptions.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of actuarial specialists, tested the reasonableness of mortality and policyholder behaviour assumptions by:\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether management's assumptions were determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17;\n- \u00b7 Testing experience studies and other inputs used in the determination of the assumptions; and\n- \u00b7 Analyzing management's interpretation and judgment with respect to its experience study results and emerging claims experience, evaluating new and revised key assumptions, assessing reasonable possible alternative assumptions, and considering industry and other external sources of benchmarking where applicable.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of actuarial and fair value specialists, evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates used by:\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether management's assumptions and methodologies were determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17; and\n- \u00b7 Testing the inputs and source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and developing a range of independent estimates, and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n\n## Valuation of Investment Properties - Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the Financial Statements\n\n## Key Audit Matter Description\n\nInvestment properties are accounted for at fair value. The fair values of investment properties are generally determined using property valuation models and are based on expected capitalization rates and models that discount expected future net cash flows at current market expected rates of return reflective of the characteristics, location, and market of each property. Expected future net cash flows include contractual and projected cash flows and forecasted operating expenses, and take into account discount, rental, and occupancy rates derived",

The estimates of future cash inflows in addition to expected rental income from current leases, include projected income from future leases based on significant assumptions that are consistent with current market conditions.\n\nThe assumptions with the greatest uncertainty are the discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates. Performing audit procedures to assess inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need for the integral involvement of valuation specialists.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to valuation models and assumptions including discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated and tested the effectiveness of controls over the fair value process for investment properties. These controls include an assessment and approval by senior management of the discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates assumptions used in the determination of the valuation of investment properties and the valuation conclusions relative to comparable properties.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of valuation specialists, evaluated on a sample basis the reasonableness of management's discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates assumptions and valuation conclusions by comparing them to the discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates of market surveys and transactions in comparable properties.\n\n## Adoption of New and Amended Accounting Standards - IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\n\n## Key Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company adopted IFRS 17 effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of IFRS 17 was done on a retrospective basis which had an impact on the Company's January 1, 2022 opening equity balances. IFRS 17 is a complex accounting standard requiring considerable judgment and interpretation in its implementation, and impacts how the Company recognizes, measures, presents and discloses insurance contracts. In adopting the new standard, the Company used significant judgment in developing and implementing accounting policies, including policies specific to transition. Of particular importance, the Company elected to use the fair value approach for groups of insurance contracts where full retrospective application was impracticable. Under the fair value approach, the CSM at transition is equal to the fair value of a group of insurance contracts less the fulfillment cash flows measured at that date.\n\nThere are many elements embedded in the determination of the fair value for groups of insurance contracts that required management to use significant judgment in making estimates and assumptions related to (1) the appropriateness of the fair value methodology and calculations, (2) the appropriateness of the fair value adjustments to fulfilment cash flows and (3) the appropriateness of the discount rates. Auditing the development and implementation of IFRS 17 accounting policies and the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in fair value determination for groups of insurance contracts required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve fair value, technical accounting and actuarial specialists.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nWith the assistance of various specialists, our audit procedures related to the development and implementation of IFRS 17 accounting policies and judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the fair value determination for groups of insurance contracts as at January 1, 2022 included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated and tested the effectiveness of controls over the implementation of IFRS 17 accounting policies and the significant estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination for groups of insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the appropriateness of management's accounting policies and tested that they were appropriately implemented.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the fair value approach methodology and related fair value adjustments against the requirements of IFRS 17 and IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement ('IFRS 13') by:\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the methodologies and fair value adjustments and their applicability under IFRS 17 and IFRS 13;\n- Examining the audited historical projected cashflows and assumptions to ensure they are incorporated into the transition valuation\n- \u00b7 models as applicable;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating new and revised key assumptions under IFRS 17; and\n- \u00b7 Testing the appropriateness of certain valuation models used in the estimation process by calculating an independent estimate of the insurance contract liability for a sample of insurance policies and comparing the results to the Company's estimate.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates used to determine fair value by:\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether management's assumptions and methodologies were determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17 and IFRS 13; and\n- \u00b7 Testing the inputs and source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 Management's Discussion and Analysis\n- \u00b7 The information, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, in the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe obtained Management's Discussion and Analysis prior to the date of this auditor's report. If, based on the work we have performed on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor's report. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nThe Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor's report. If, based on the work we will perform on this other information, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact to those charged with governance.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Chantal Leclerc.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Ontario February 7, 2024",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and its financial performance and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IFRS').We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 7, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Adoption of New Accounting Standards\n\nAs discussed in Note 2.A to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments in 2023 due to the adoption of IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts ('IFRS 17') and IFRS 9, Financial Instruments.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Insurance Contract Liabilities - Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the Financial Statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's insurance contract liabilities represent a significant portion of its total liabilities. Insurance contract liabilities are determined in accordance with IFRS 17. This requires the use of complex valuation models and assumptions to measure groups of insurance contracts as the total of fulfillment cash flows, plus a risk adjustment for non-financial risk and a contractual service margin ('CSM'). The CSM component is only relevant for groups of insurance contracts measured using the general measurement approach and the variable fee approach.\n\nWhile there is considerable judgment applied by management and inherent uncertainty in selecting assumptions, the assumptions with the greatest estimation uncertainty are those related to mortality, policyholder behaviour and discount rates. These assumptions required significant auditor attention particularly for (i) circumstances where there is limited Company and industry experience data, (ii) circumstances where the historical experience may not be a good indicator of the future, and (iii) the determination of discount rates, which requires complex calculation and measurement of unobservable market inputs. Auditing certain valuation models and significant assumptions (mortality, policyholder behaviour and discount rates) required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve actuarial and fair value specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to certain valuation models and significant assumptions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated and tested the effectiveness of controls over actuarial models and the determination of the mortality, policyholder behaviour and discount rate assumptions used in the calculation of insurance contract liabilities, as well as access and change management controls over those actuarial models.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of actuarial and fair value specialists, tested the appropriateness of certain valuation models used in the valuation process by:\n- \u00b7 Calculating an independent estimate of the insurance contract liability for a sample of insurance policies and comparing the results to the Company's estimate; and\n- \u00b7 Testing the accuracy of certain valuation models for changes in key assumptions.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of actuarial specialists, tested the reasonableness of mortality and policyholder behaviour assumptions by:\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether management's assumptions were determined in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17;\n- \u00b7 Testing experience studies and other inputs used in the determination of the assumptions; and\n- \u00b7 Analyzing management's interpretation and judgment with respect to its experience study results and emerging claims experience, evaluating new and revised key assumptions, assessing reasonable possible alternative assumptions, and considering industry and other external sources of benchmarking where applicable.",

The fair values of investment properties are generally determined using property valuation models and are based on expected capitalization rates and models that discount expected future net cash flows at current market expected rates of return reflective of the characteristics, location, and market of each property. Expected future net cash flows include contractual and projected cash flows and forecasted operating expenses, and take into account discount, rental, and occupancy rates derived from market surveys. The estimates of future cash inflows in addition to expected rental income from current leases, include projected income from future leases based on significant assumptions that are consistent with current market conditions.\n\nThe assumptions with the greatest uncertainty are the discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates. Performing audit procedures to assess inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need for the integral involvement of valuation specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to valuation models and assumptions including discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluated and tested the effectiveness of controls over the fair value process for investment properties. These controls include an assessment and approval by senior management of the discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates assumptions used in the determination of the valuation of investment properties and the valuation conclusions relative to comparable properties.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of valuation specialists, evaluated on a sample basis the reasonableness of management's discount rates, terminal capitalization rates, and future rental rates assumptions and valuation conclusions by comparing them to the discount rates, terminal\n- capitalization rates, and future rental rates of market surveys and transactions in comparable properties.\n\n## Adoption of New and Amended Accounting Standards - IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company adopted IFRS 17 effective January 1, 2023. The adoption of IFRS 17 was done on a retrospective basis which had an impact on the Company's January 1, 2022 opening equity balances. IFRS 17 is a complex accounting standard requiring considerable judgment and interpretation in its implementation, and impacts how the Company recognizes, measures, presents and discloses insurance contracts. In adopting the new standard, the Company used significant judgment in developing and implementing accounting policies, including policies specific to transition. Of particular importance, the Company elected to use the fair value approach for groups of insurance contracts where full retrospective application was impracticable. Under the fair value approach, the CSM at transition is equal to the fair value of a group of insurance contracts less the fulfillment cash flows measured at that date.\n\nThere are many elements embedded in the determination of the fair value for groups of insurance contracts that required management to use significant judgment in making estimates and assumptions related to (1) the appropriateness of the fair value methodology and calculations, (2) the appropriateness of the fair value adjustments to fulfilment cash flows and (3) the appropriateness of the discount rates. Auditing the development and implementation of IFRS 17 accounting policies and the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in fair value determination for groups of insurance contracts required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the need to involve fair value, technical accounting and actuarial specialists.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 7, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's adoption of new accounting standards.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada February 7, 2024",

All amounts stated in U.S. dollars are in millions.)\n\n## 1. Material Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nSun Life Financial Inc. (\"SLF Inc.\") is a publicly traded company domiciled in Canada and is the holding company of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (\"Sun Life Assurance\"). Both companies are incorporated under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), and are regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada (\"OSFI\"). SLF Inc. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as \"us\", \"our\", \"ours\", \"we\", or \"the Company\". We are an internationally diversified financial services organization providing savings, retirement and pension products, and life and health insurance to individuals and groups through our operations in Canada, the United States (\"U.S.\"), Asia, and the United Kingdom (\"UK\"). Effective the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of our UK Business unit. We also operate mutual fund and investment management businesses, primarily in Canada, the U.S., and Asia.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nWe prepared our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\"). Our accounting policies have been applied consistently within our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nOur Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are presented in the order of liquidity and each statement of financial position line item includes both current and non-current balances, as applicable.\n\nWe have defined our reportable business segments and the amounts disclosed for those segments based on our management structure and the manner in which our internal financial reporting is conducted. Transactions between segments are executed and priced on an arm's-length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.\n\nThe material accounting policies used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements are summarized below and are applied consistently.\n\n## Estimates, Assumptions and Judgments\n\nThe application of our accounting policies requires estimates, assumptions and judgments as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have established procedures to ensure that our accounting policies are applied consistently and that the processes for changing methodologies for determining estimates are controlled and occur in an appropriate and systematic manner.\n\n## Use of Estimates and Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of our policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Key sources of estimation uncertainty include the measurement of insurance contract assets and liabilities, reinsurance contract held assets and liabilities and investment contract liabilities, determination of fair value, determination and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, determination of provisions and liabilities for pension plans, other post-retirement benefits, income taxes, and the determination of fair value of share-based payments. Actual results may differ from our estimates thereby impacting our Consolidated Financial Statements. Information on our use of estimates and assumptions is discussed in this Note and other Notes.\n\n## Judgments\n\nIn preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, we use judgments to select assumptions and determine estimates as described above. We also use judgment when applying accounting policies and when determining the classification of insurance contracts, investment contracts and service contracts; the substance of whether our relationship with a structured entity, subsidiary, joint venture or associate constitutes control, joint control or significant influence; functional currencies; contingencies; acquisitions; deferred income tax assets; and the determination of cash generating unit (\"CGU\").",

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date we obtain control, and deconsolidated on the date control ceases. The acquisition method is used to account for the acquisition of a subsidiary from an unrelated party at the date that control is obtained, with the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the subsidiary's net identifiable assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Judgment is required to determine fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a business combination. Interests in controlled entities held by external parties are reported as non-controlling interests (\"NCI\").\n\nWe control an entity when we have power over an entity, exposure to or rights to variable returns from our involvement with an entity, and the ability to affect our returns through our power over an entity. Power exists when we have rights that give us the ability to direct the relevant activities, which are those activities that could significantly affect the entity's returns. Power can be obtained through voting rights or other contractual arrangements. Judgment is required to determine the relevant activities and which party has power over these activities. When we have power over and variable returns from an entity, including an investment fund that we manage, we also apply significant judgment in determining whether we are acting as a principal or agent. To make this determination, we consider factors such as how much discretion we have regarding the management of the investment fund and the magnitude and extent of variability associated with our interests in the fund. If we determine we are the principal rather than the agent, we would consolidate the assets and liabilities of the fund. Interests held by external parties in investment funds that we consolidate are recorded as third-party interest in consolidated investment funds in Other liabilities. If we lose control of an entity, the assets and liabilities of that entity are derecognized from our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at the date at which control is lost and any investment retained is remeasured to fair value.\n\nA joint venture exists when SLF Inc., or one of its subsidiaries, has joint control of a joint arrangement and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control and exists only when the decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which SLF Inc. or its subsidiaries are able to exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an investee but not have control or joint control over those decisions. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when SLF Inc. or its subsidiaries holds greater than 20% of the voting power of the investee but does not have control or joint control. The equity method is used to account for our interests in joint ventures and associates. A joint operation exists when SLF Inc., or one of its subsidiaries, has joint control of an arrangement that gives it rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the operation, rather than the net assets of the arrangement. For joint operations, we record our share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the joint operation. Judgment is required to determine whether contractual arrangements between multiple parties results in control, joint control or significant influence, with consideration of the relevant activities of the entity, voting rights, representation on boards of directors and other decision-making factors. Judgment is also required to determine if a joint arrangement is a joint venture or joint operation, with consideration of our rights and obligations and the structure and legal form of the arrangement.\n\n## Determination of Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. We determine fair value by using quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. When observable valuation inputs are not available, significant judgment is required to determine fair value by assessing the valuation techniques and valuation inputs. The use of alternative valuation techniques or valuation inputs may result in a different fair value. A description of the fair value methodologies, assumptions, valuation techniques, and valuation inputs by type of asset is included in Note 5. A description of the fair value methodologies, assumptions, valuation techniques and valuation inputs for the transition of insurance contracts to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 17\") is included in Note 10.",

Transactions occurring in currencies other than the functional currency are translated to the functional currency using the spot exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the statement of financial position date. Insurance contract and reinsurance contract held assets and liabilities, including the contractual service margin (\"CSM\"), are monetary items. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are held at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the statement of financial position date, while non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nThe resulting exchange differences from the translation of monetary items and non-monetary items held at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded to income, are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For monetary assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVOCI\"), translation differences calculated on amortized cost are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and other changes in carrying amount are recognized in other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"). The exchange differences from the translation of non-monetary items on these assets are recognized in OCI.\n\n## Translation to the Presentation Currency\n\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, the financial statements of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies to Canadian dollars, our presentation currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the statement of financial position date, and income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates. The accumulated gains or losses arising from translation of functional currencies to the presentation currency, net of the effect of any hedges, are included as a separate component of OCI within equity. Upon disposal of a foreign operation that includes loss of control, significant influence or joint control, the cumulative exchange gain or loss related to that foreign operation is recognized in income.\n\n## Invested Assets\n\n## Financial Assets Excluding Derivative Financial Instruments (IFRS 9)\n\nFinancial assets include cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities, debt securities, equity securities, mortgages and loans, and other financial invested assets.\n\n## i) Initial Recognition and Subsequent Measurement\n\n## Classification of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are classified as and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (\"FVTPL\"), FVOCI, or amortized cost based on the business model used to manage the financial asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. Amortized cost is determined using the effective interest rate method, which is the gross carrying amount less the allowance for ECL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to initial recognition unless the business model used to manage the financial asset has changed. Financial assets are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position on their trade dates, which are the dates that we commit to purchase or sell the assets. Originated mortgages and loans are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position on their settlement dates.\n\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met and the asset is not designated at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 The asset is held within a business model that is held to collect (\"HTC\"), in which the collection of contractual cash flows from the financial asset is the primary objective and sales are expected to be insignificant or infrequent; and\n- \u00b7 The contractual terms of the asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (\"SPPI\") on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nA financial asset is measured at FVOCI if both of the following conditions are met and the asset is not designated at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 The asset is held within a business model that is held to collect and sell (\"HTC&S\"), in which both the collection of contractual cash flows and the sale of financial assets are integral to achieving the objective of the business model; and\n- \u00b7 The contractual terms of the asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are SPPI.\n\nFinancial assets that are managed on a fair value basis and do not meet the objectives of a HTC or HTC&S business model, such as financial assets that are held for trading, are measured at FVTPL and fall within the scope of other business models.\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI, as described above, are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets at FVTPL include financial assets that are held-for-trading. A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near term. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities are held for trading for the purpose of meeting short-term cash requirements and are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, we may also make an irrevocable election to designate a financial asset that would otherwise be measured at amortized cost or FVOCI as measured at FVTPL if the financial asset is managed together with a related financial liability and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Certain debt securities, mortgages and loan instruments that support insurance contract liabilities, which are measured at fair value, have been designated at FVTPL, as doing so significantly reduces measurement inconsistency with the related insurance contract liabilities. These financial assets would otherwise have been measured at FVOCI or amortized cost.\n\nEquity securities are measured at FVTPL, unless the asset is not held for trading purposes and we make an irrevocable election to designate the asset at FVOCI. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. If such an election is made, the fair value changes, including any associated foreign exchange gains or losses, are recognized in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including upon disposal. Realized gains and losses are transferred directly to retained earnings upon disposal.",

Judgment is used in determining our business models, which is supported by relevant, objective evidence including:\n\n- \u00b7 How the economic activities of our businesses generate benefits, for example, through enhancing yields or hedging and how such economic activities are evaluated and reported to key management personnel;\n- \u00b7 The significant risks affecting the performance of our businesses, for example, market risk, credit risk, or other risks as described in the Risk Management section of Management's Discussion and Analysis, and the activities undertaken to manage those risks;\n- \u00b7 The frequency, volume, and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for the sales and expectations about future sales activity. Information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how our stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized; and\n- \u00b7 The compensation structures for managers of our businesses, to the extent that these are directly linked to the economic performance of the business model.\n\nOur business models include HTC, HTC&S and other, as described above.\n\n## Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are SPPI\n\nFinancial assets held within a HTC or HTC&S business model are assessed to evaluate if their contractual cash flows are comprised of SPPI. SPPI payments are those which would typically be expected from basic lending arrangements, such as interest and basic lending returns, compensation for credit risk and the time value of money, costs associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time, and a profit margin. In making the SPPI assessment, we consider the contractual terms of the instrument, including assessment of whether the timing or amount of the contractual cash flows could change by a contractual term of the financial asset. A prepayment feature is consistent with the SPPI criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable compensation for early termination of the contract.\n\nWhere the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or variability of the cash flows that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified as and measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nEquity securities, debt securities, mortgages and loans, and assets related to Collateralized Loan Obligations (\"CLOs\") that are classified or designated at FVTPL are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, and gains or losses, including interest or dividend income and foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognized in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nDebt securities and mortgages and loans that are classified as FVOCI are recorded at fair value. Interest income, foreign exchange gains (losses), and impairment are recognized in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other gains or losses are recognized in OCI.\n\nMortgages and loans classified as amortized cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and impairment are presented in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOther financial invested assets include investments in limited partnerships, segregated funds, mutual funds, and assets related to CLOs that are classified as FVTPL. These financial assets are recorded at fair value, and gains or losses are recognized in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Debt securities and Mortgages and loans included in Other financial invested assets that are classified as FVOCI are recorded at fair value.\n\nCash equivalents are highly liquid instruments with a term to maturity of three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as FVTPL and the fair values are assumed to approximate their carrying values, due to their short-term nature or because they are frequently repriced to current market rates. Short-term securities are those that have a term to maturity exceeding three months but less than one year. The fair value of short-term securities is approximated by their carrying amount.\n\n## ii) Derecognition\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when our contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset have expired, or when we transfer the rights to receive contractual cash flows and substantially all the risks and rewards of owning the financial assets have been transferred. When we neither retain nor transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, the financial assets are derecognized if control over the financial assets have been relinquished. If we retain control of the financial assets, we continue to recognize the transferred assets to the extent of our continuing involvement.\n\nWhen financial assets are derecognized, the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received on the date of derecognition is recognized in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For debt securities at FVOCI, the cumulative gains (losses) previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of",

        "page_content": "Operations. For equity investments designated at FVOCI, the cumulative gains (losses) previously recognized in OCI are not reclassified to income.\n\nFor financial assets measured at amortized cost in which modifications have resulted in derecognition, the gain (loss) is presented together with impairment losses if the modification was a result of financial difficulties of the borrower. Otherwise, the gain (loss) is presented as Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nJudgment is applied in determining whether contractual rights to the cash flows from the transferred assets have expired or whether we retain the rights to receive the cash flows on the assets but have assumed an obligation to pay for those cash flows.\n\n## iii) Impairment\n\n## Policies applicable beginning January 1, 2023\n\nWe establish an allowance for expected credit losses (\"ECL\") for financial assets not classified or designated at FVTPL. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are presented at their carrying amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, which is the gross carrying amount less the allowance for ECL, with changes in the allowance for ECL recognized in Provision for credit losses in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for ECL on financial assets measured at FVOCI, including debt securities and mortgages and loans, does not reduce the carrying amount of the assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, which remains at fair value. Rather, an amount equal to the allowance for ECL that would arise if the assets were measured at amortized cost is recognized in OCI, with changes in the allowance for ECL recognized in Provision for credit losses in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, we apply a three-stage impairment approach to measure the ECL on financial assets measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1: For financial assets that have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk since the date of initial recognition, a loss allowance equal to the credit losses expected to result from default events occurring over the 12 months following the reporting date is recognized.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2: For financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since the date of initial recognition, a loss allowance equal to the credit losses expected to result from default events occurring over the remaining lifetime of the financial asset is recognized.\n- \u00b7 Stage 3: When a financial asset is considered to be credit-impaired, a loss allowance equal to the ECL over the remaining lifetime of the financial asset is recognized. Interest income is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance.\n\nWe monitor all financial assets that are subject to impairment for significant increase in credit risk. In making this assessment, we consider both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Additional details about significant increase in credit risk and forward-looking information are provided in Note 6.\n\n## Modified financial assets\n\nThe contractual terms of a financial asset may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the borrower. An existing financial asset whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated asset recognized as a new financial asset at fair value in accordance with the accounting policies in this Note.\n\nIf modification does not result in derecognition, the financial asset continues to be subject to the assessment for significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition. Expected cash flows arising from the modified contractual terms are considered when calculating the ECL for the modified asset. For loans that were modified while having lifetime ECLs, such loans can revert to having 12-month ECLs if the borrower's financial condition that led to it being identified as credit-impaired are no longer present.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default used in the measurement of ECL is consistent with the definition of default used for our internal credit risk management purposes. We consider a financial asset to be in default when the issuer is unlikely to meet its credit obligations in full, without recourse action on our part, or when the financial asset is 90 days past due. Our definition of default may differ across financial assets and consider qualitative factors, such as the terms of financial covenants, breaches of such covenants, and other indicators of financial distress, as well as quantitative factors, such as overdue status and non-payment of other obligations under the same issuer. We use internally developed data and those obtained from external sources when assessing default.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets (Stage 3)\n\nAt each reporting date, we assess whether financial assets measured at amortized cost and FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence of credit-impairment may include indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, probability of bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, as well as a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows evidenced by the adverse changes in the payments status of the borrower or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. If a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest income is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, which is net of the allowance for ECL, rather than on the gross carrying amount.\n\n## Write-off of financial assets\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset, and the related allowance for ECL, is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when we determine that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\nFor policies prior to January 1, 2023, please refer to Note 6.A.vi.",

        "page_content": "## iv) Embedded Derivatives\n\n## Policies applicable beginning January 1, 2023\n\nUnder IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (\"IFRS 9\"), derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument, as a whole, is assessed for classification.\n\n## Policies applicable prior to January 1, 2023\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a host contract that modifies the cash flows of the host contract in a manner similar to a derivative, according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, foreign exchange rate, underlying index or other variable. We are required to separate embedded derivatives from the host contract, if an embedded derivative has economic and risk characteristics that are not closely related to the host contract, meets the definition of a derivative, and the combined contract is not measured at fair value with changes recognized in income. If an embedded derivative is bifurcated for accounting purposes from the host contract, it will be accounted for as a derivative. For further details on embedded derivatives in insurance contracts, see the Insurance Contracts accounting policy in this Note.\n\n## Collateral\n\nCash received (pledged) as collateral is recognized (derecognized) in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with corresponding amounts recognized in Other liabilities (Other assets), respectively. All other types of assets received (pledged) as collateral are not recognized (derecognized) in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nAll derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Derivatives with a positive fair value are recorded as Derivative assets while derivatives with a negative fair value are recorded as Derivative liabilities.\n\nThe accounting for the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether or not it is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes. Changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting purposes, which are defined as derivative investments, are recorded in Net investment income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Income earned or paid on these derivatives is recorded in Net investment income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Hedge accounting is applied to certain derivatives to reduce income statement volatility. All hedging relationships are documented at inception and hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and on a quarterly basis to determine whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes attributable to the hedged risk in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nCertain interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards are designated as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risks associated with FVOCI assets. Changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Net investment income (loss) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The change in fair value of FVOCI assets related to the hedged risk is recognized in profit or loss. As a result, ineffectiveness, if any, is recognized in income to the extent that changes in fair value of the derivatives and FVOCI assets do not offset. Interest income earned and paid on the FVOCI assets and swaps in the fair value hedging relationships are recorded in net investment income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nCertain equity and foreign currency forwards are designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges for anticipated payments of awards under certain share-based payment plans and for anticipated foreign currency purchases of foreign operations. Changes in the fair value of derivatives for the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in OCI, while the ineffective portion of the hedge and any items excluded from the hedging relationship, such as the spot-to-forward differential, are recognized in net investment income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. A portion of the amount recognized in OCI related to the equity forwards is reclassified to income as a component of Operating expenses as the liabilities for the share-based payment awards are accrued over the vesting period. A portion of the amounts recognized in OCI related to the foreign currency forwards would be reclassified to income upon disposal or impairment of the foreign operations. All amounts recognized in, or reclassified from, OCI are net of related taxes.\n\n## Investment Properties\n\nInvestment properties are real estate held to earn rental income, for capital appreciation, or both. Properties held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation that have an insignificant portion that is owner-occupied are classified as investment properties. Properties that do not meet these criteria are classified as property and equipment, included in Other assets as described below. Expenditures related to ongoing maintenance of properties incurred subsequent to acquisition are expensed. Investment properties are initially recognized at cost in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Various costs incurred associated with the acquisition of an investment property are either capitalized or expensed depending on whether or not the acquisition is considered a business combination. Investment properties are subsequently measured at fair value with changes in value recorded to Fair value and foreign currency changes on assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nWhen the use of a property changes from owner-occupied to investment property, any gain arising on the remeasurement of the property to fair value at the date of transfer is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to the extent that it reverses a previous impairment loss. Any remaining increase is recognized in OCI.\n\n## Other Non-Financial Invested Assets\n\nOther non-financial invested assets include investments in joint ventures and associates, which are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recorded at cost. The investment in joint ventures and associates is increased by our share of capital contributions and for purchases of additional interests and is reduced by distributions received. In addition, subsequent adjustments to the investment are made for our share of net income or loss and our share of OCI. Our share of net income is recorded in investment income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and our share of OCI is recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Impairment losses on equity method investments are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that they are impaired. The impairment loss recognized is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount.",

        "page_content": "## Other Assets\n\nOther assets, which are measured at amortized cost, include accounts receivable, investment income due and accrued, deferred acquisition costs from service contracts, property and equipment, and lessee's right-of-use assets. Deferred acquisition costs from service contracts are discussed in the Service contract and fee income section of this Note. Right-of-use assets are discussed in the Leases section of this Note. Owner-occupied properties are amortized to their residual value over 25 to 49 years. Furniture, computers, other office equipment, and leasehold improvements are amortized to their residual value over 2 to 20 years.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For leases where we act as the lessee, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease. For leases where we act as the lessor, we assess whether the leases should be classified as finance or operating leases. Our leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases are recognized into income on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which is comprised of the initial amount of the lease liability with certain adjustments, and subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method, with depreciation expense included in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated to the earlier of the lease term and its useful life. The right-of-use asset is assessed for impairment under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . Right-of-use assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting period. If there is an indication that a right-of-use asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount. If an impairment loss has been incurred, the carrying value of the right-of-use asset is reduced with the corresponding amount recognized in income.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the term of the lease using a discount rate that is based on our incremental borrowing rate. The discount rate is specific to each lease and is determined by various factors, such as the lease term and currency. The lease term includes the non-cancellable period and the optional period where it is reasonably certain we will exercise an extension or termination option, considering various factors that create an economic incentive to do so. Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, with interest charged to Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are remeasured upon lease modifications. A lease modification is considered as a change in the scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible assets consist of finite life and indefinite life intangible assets. Finite life intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or using a units-of-production method, over the useful economic lives: i) Distribution, sales potential of field force, client relationships and asset administration contracts - 3 to 40 years; and ii) Internally generated software - 3 to 10 years. Amortization is charged through Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operation. The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually, and the amortization is adjusted as necessary. Indefinite life intangibles are not amortized, and are assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying values of the indefinite life intangible assets to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the carrying values of the indefinite life intangibles exceed their recoverable amounts, these assets are considered impaired, and a charge for impairment is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The recoverable amount of intangible assets is determined using various valuation models, which require management to make certain judgments and assumptions that could affect the estimates of the recoverable amount.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets of the acquired businesses. It is carried at original cost less any impairment subsequently incurred. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that may result in the recoverable amount of a CGU or a group of CGUs falling below its carrying value. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other groups of assets. We exercise significant judgment in determining our CGUs. The factors considered in determining our CGUs include product cash inflows, product distribution, target markets, and how management monitors and evaluates the operations.\n\nThe goodwill balances are allocated to either individual or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill impairment is quantified by comparing a CGU's or a group of CGUs' carrying value to its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Impairment losses are recognized immediately and cannot be reversed in future periods. Significant judgment is involved in estimating the model inputs used to determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs or group of CGUs, including those for discount rates, capital, the value of new business, expenses, cash flow projections, and market multiples, due to the uncertainty and the forward-looking nature of these inputs. The assumptions may differ from the actual experience, and estimates may change from period to period based on future events or revisions of assumptions. These key assumptions are discussed in Note 9.\n\n## Insurance Contracts\n\n## Classification\n\nInsurance contracts are comprised of insurance contracts issued, which are insurance and reinsurance or retrocession contracts that are issued by us, and reinsurance contracts held.\n\nInsurance contracts issued are contracts under which we accept significant insurance risk from a policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder. The presence of significant insurance risk in individual contracts is assessed by reviewing books of contracts with homogeneous risk features.",

We have a retention policy that requires that such arrangements be placed with well-established, highly-rated reinsurers.\n\nCertain investment contracts contain discretionary participation features (\"DPF\"), whereby the policyholder has the right to receive, in addition to guaranteed amounts, potentially significant benefits based on returns on a specified pool of assets. For entities like us that issue insurance contracts, investment contracts with DPF are measured and reported as insurance contracts.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the classification of a contract as an insurance contract, investment contract or a service contract. Contracts are classified at initial recognition. Once a contract is classified as an insurance contract, it remains an insurance contract until all rights and obligations are extinguished or the contract is derecognized.\n\n## Combination and Separation of Contracts\n\nDerivatives embedded in insurance contracts are treated as separate contracts and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract or when the risks and characteristics of the embedded derivative are closely related to those of the host contract. Embedded derivatives that are not separated are accounted for with the host insurance contract.\n\nInvestment components of insurance contracts are amounts we repay to a policyholder in all circumstances (e.g., cash surrender values). Investment components of insurance contracts are treated as separate investment contracts only if the investment component is not highly interrelated with the insurance component and a contract with equivalent terms could be sold separately in the same market. Investment components that are not separated are accounted for as non-distinct investment components of insurance contracts.\n\nService components of insurance contracts are treated as separate service contracts only if the service component is not highly interrelated with the insurance component and we provide no significant service in integrating the service component with the insurance component. Service components that are not separated are accounted for with insurance contracts.\n\nInsurance components of insurance contracts are treated as separate contracts only if the insurance component constitutes a separate insurance contract (e.g., certain reinsurance treaties that transfer risk on different types of insurance contracts).\n\nFor insurance contracts where both parties to the contract have the practical ability to terminate the contract, the extension of the contract beyond the termination date is treated as a new and separate contract. This occurs for most group life and health insurance contracts every year, when we have the right to reprice the contract and the policyholder has the option to not renew the contract. In such instances, each renewal is considered a new and separate contract. This also applies for many reinsurance contracts held, where the reinsurer has the right to reprice new cessions and we have the right to cease ceding new contracts with a notice period. In such instances, the cessions within each notice period are considered a new and separate reinsurance contract held.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInsurance contracts are measured in accordance with IFRS 17, using one of the following approaches:\n\n- \u00b7 Variable fee approach (\"VFA\"): This approach applies to insurance contracts (excluding reinsurance contracts) with direct participation features, which are substantially investment-related service contracts where the policyholder is promised an investment return based on underlying items.\n- \u00b7 Premium allocation approach (\"PAA\"): This is a simplified measurement approach and is applied to all insurance contracts that are eligible to use it, such as the majority of those in our group life and health businesses.\n- \u00b7 General measurement approach (\"GMA\"): This approach applies to all insurance contracts not measured using the VFA or the PAA.\n\nReinsurance contracts held are measured in a manner consistent with the associated underlying insurance contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract held. Reinsurance contracts held cannot be measured using the VFA. The measurement of reinsurance contracts held includes a provision for the risk that the reinsurer will not honour its obligations under the contract.\n\nThe carrying value of insurance contracts comprises the liability for remaining coverage (\"LRC\") and the liability for incurred claims (\"LIC\"):\n\n- \u00b7 The LRC is the measurement of our obligation to investigate and pay valid claims for insured events that have not yet occurred (i.e., the obligation that relates to the unexpired portion of the coverage period).\n- \u00b7 The LIC is the measurement of our obligation to investigate and pay valid claims for insured events that have already occurred, including events that have occurred but for which claims have not been reported. For reinsurance contracts held, the LIC is an asset for incurred claims.\n- \u00b7 For blocks of businesses acquired prior to January 1, 2023, any previously incurred claims where the amount paid to the beneficiary is subject to insurance risk are treated as LIC. For blocks of businesses acquired on or after January 1, 2023, such claims are treated as LRC.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in measuring assets or liabilities for insurance contracts, including the assumptions that are used for their measurement. Application of different assumptions may result in different measurement of the insurance contracts. Actual experience may differ from assumptions, and estimates may change from period to period based on future events or revisions of assumptions. Key assumptions and considerations in selecting these assumptions are discussed in Note 10. The sensitivity of the measurement of insurance contracts to changes in risk variables are discussed in Note 7.\n\n## Level of Aggregation\n\nThe unit of account for the measurement of insurance contracts is a group. Each insurance contract is assigned to a group at initial recognition and remains in that group until the insurance contract is derecognized.\n\nGroups are subdivisions of portfolios. Portfolios are insurance contracts subject to similar risks and managed together and a portfolio is the level at which expenses are attributed and the level at which insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held are presented.",

        "page_content": "We have established portfolios in each reportable business segment, distinguished between:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held;\n- \u00b7 Group insurance contracts and individual insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 Participating insurance contracts and non-participating insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 Adjustable insurance contracts and non-adjustable insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 Traditional life insurance contracts and universal life insurance contracts; and\n- \u00b7 Pass-through insurance contracts and discretionary crediting contracts.\n\nWithin each portfolio, separate groups are established by:\n\n- \u00b7 Date of issue: To be in the same group, contracts must be issued within the same time period, and the period cannot be longer than one year; and\n- \u00b7 Level of profitability: Insurance contracts are separated into groups of contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, contracts that do not have a significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently, and other contracts. The level of profitability for an insurance contract is based on the CSM at initial recognition of the contract (as described below in Initial Measurement).\n\nWe do not establish additional groups beyond the minimum required except for some portfolios of reinsurance contracts held where grouping is established to line up with the grouping of the underlying insurance contracts issued.\n\n## Initial Measurement\n\nGroups of insurance contracts are recognized and measured as the total of the following measurement components:\n\n- \u00b7 Fulfilment cash flows (\"FCF\"), which is comprised of:\n- \u00b7 The present value of future cash flows (including the provisions for financial risk),\n- \u00b7 The risk adjustment for non-financial risk; and\n- \u00b7 A CSM, representing the unearned profit that will be recognized in income as insurance contract services are provided.\n\nThese measurement components apply to groups of insurance contracts measured using the GMA and the VFA. Under the PAA, which is a simplified measurement approach, insurance contracts are measured based on unearned profits and do not include a CSM.\n\n## GMA or VFA\n\nUsing the GMA or VFA, a group of insurance contracts is measured as the total of the three measurement components, as described above.\n\nEstimates of the present value of future cash flows are explicit and current, and consider all reasonable and supportable information available at the reporting date without undue cost or effort. The portion of the present value of future cash flows related to financial risk variables is consistent with observable market prices and, where necessary, considers a range of scenarios that provides a good representation of possible outcomes. The cash flows for each scenario are probability-weighted and discounted using current assumptions.\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk represents the compensation required for uncertainty related to non-financial risk (mortality, morbidity, surrender and expenses, etc.). The risk adjustment is reduced as the non-financial risks of our insurance contracts diminish over time (\"release of risk adjustment\").\n\nThe CSM at the initial recognition of an insurance contract issued is the amount that fully offsets the FCF at initial recognition, and represents unearned profits on new business that are deferred and amortized into income as insurance contract services are provided. For insurance contracts issued that are not profitable at initial recognition (\"onerous insurance contracts\"), a CSM is not established and losses are recognized in income immediately.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held, there is no restriction on the CSM based on profitability at initial recognition, and any losses are deferred in the same manner as profits. In addition, the CSM for reinsurance contracts held can be adjusted to offset any gains or losses on the groups of underlying direct contracts that would have gone through CSM if the group of underlying direct contracts had a CSM balance.\n\nFor onerous insurance contracts, the loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations at initial recognition is added to the loss component of the group to which the contract is assigned. The loss component is a notional portion of the LRC that represents the amount of loss that can be reversed by future profit before a CSM is re-established for the group. For groups of reinsurance contracts held for which the CSM has been adjusted to offset gains and losses on groups of underlying direct contracts without a CSM, a loss recovery component is established.\n\n## PAA\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts using the PAA, there is no liability established at initial recognition, unless factors indicate that the group is onerous, in which case the group is initially recognized at the amount it is onerous, and a loss of that amount is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and becomes the loss component of the group. For groups using the PAA, insurance acquisition cash flows are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when incurred, rather than including such expenses in the measurement of LRC.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\nThe subsequent measurement of FCF uses the same approach as described above for initial measurement, but with current inputs for each subsequent reporting date.\n\nFor contracts measured using the PAA, the LRC subsequent to initial recognition is the amount of unearned revenue and the remaining loss component for any groups that are onerous. We do not adjust the LRC to reflect the time value of money and the effects of financial risk when we expect the time between providing coverage and the related premiums to be no more than one year. We do not adjust the LIC to reflect the time value of money and the effects of financial risk when we expect the claims to be fully paid within one year of the insured event occurring.\n\nFor contracts measured using the GMA or VFA, the measurement of CSM subsequent to initial recognition is described below.",

        "page_content": "For groups of insurance contracts issued using the GMA, the CSM at the end of a reporting period is measured as the CSM at the beginning of the reporting period, adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of any new contracts added to the group;\n- \u00b7 Interest accretion on the carrying amount of the CSM;\n- \u00b7 The change in FCF relating to future service, except to the extent that increases exceed the carrying amount of the CSM (giving rise to a loss) or decreases are allocated to the loss component of the LRC (reversing a prior loss);\n- \u00b7 The effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and\n- \u00b7 The amount recognized as Insurance revenue due to the performance of insurance contract services in the period (\"CSM amortization\").\n\nFor groups of insurance contracts issued using the VFA, the CSM at the end of a reporting period is measured as the CSM at the beginning of the reporting period, adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of any new contracts added to the group;\n- \u00b7 The change in the entity's share of the fair value of underlying items, except to the extent a decrease exceeds the carrying amount of the CSM (giving rise to a loss) or an increase reverses a prior loss, or that risk mitigation applies (see below);\n- \u00b7 The change in FCF relating to future service, except to the extent that increases exceed the carrying amount of the CSM (giving rise to a loss) or decreases are allocated to the loss component of the LRC (reversing a prior loss), or that risk mitigation applies (see below);\n- \u00b7 The effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and\n- \u00b7 CSM amortization.\n\nThe risk mitigation option is provided to avoid accounting mismatches that would otherwise occur when the financial risk of a group of insurance contracts is mitigated outside the underlying items of the group. For insurance contracts issued using the VFA, changes related to financial risk adjust the CSM, but offsetting changes from risk mitigation (e.g., derivatives) may go through income. The risk mitigation option allows for a change that would otherwise adjust CSM to be recognized in income instead, to avoid such a mismatch. We apply the risk mitigation option where applicable to reduce accounting mismatches. The effect on CSM of applying the risk mitigation option is disclosed in more detail in Note 5.C.\n\nFor groups of reinsurance contracts held, the CSM at the end of a reporting period is measured as the CSM at the start of the reporting period, adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of any new contracts added to the group;\n- \u00b7 Interest accretion on the carrying amount of the CSM;\n- \u00b7 Income recognized in the reporting period as a result of gains or losses recognized to offset gains or losses on groups of underlying direct contracts with no CSM;\n- \u00b7 Reversals of a loss-recovery component to the extent those reversals are not changes in the FCF of the group of reinsurance contracts held;\n- \u00b7 The change in FCF relating to future service, unless the change offsets a gain or loss on groups of underlying direct contracts with no CSM or the change is related to groups of onerous insurance contracts using the PAA;\n- \u00b7 The effect of any currency exchange differences on the CSM; and\n- \u00b7 The amount recognized in income due to services received in the period.\n\nWe have not changed the accounting estimates made in previous interim financial statements in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements. In particular, the CSM at the end of each reporting period is the CSM at the beginning of the reporting period adjusted as described above, rather than the CSM at the beginning of the calendar year adjusted as described above.\n\n## Presentation on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe carrying value of portfolios of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held that are in an asset position are presented as Insurance contract assets and Reinsurance contract held assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, while the carrying value of portfolios of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities are presented as Insurance Contract liabilities excluding those for account of segregated fund holders and Reinsurance contract held liabilities. Assets for insurance acquisition cash flows incurred before initial recognition of the contracts to which they are attributable are included in the carrying value of the portfolio associated with those contracts.\n\nAmounts related to insurance contracts that impact income are included in the Net insurance service result of the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Insurance finance income (expenses) line in the Net investment result section. Results in those sections are presented separately for insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. We have chosen to disaggregate changes in the RA between the Insurance revenue line in Net insurance service result, and the Insurance finance income (expenses) line in Net investment result.\n\n## Net insurance service result\n\nInsurance revenue is recognized as insurance contract services are provided for groups of insurance contracts. For insurance contracts issued that are measured using the GMA or the VFA, Insurance revenue includes the following services for which consideration in the form of premiums, net of premium taxes, is expected to be received:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected claims and other expenses directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts, measured at the amounts expected at the beginning of the period, and excluding investment components and amounts allocated to the loss component;\n- \u00b7 Release of the RA for the period, excluding amounts allocated to the loss component and amounts related to changes in the time value of money, which are recognized in Insurance finance income (expenses);\n- \u00b7 CSM amortization to reflect services provided in the period, measured using the coverage units for the reporting period as a proportion of total coverage units (additional detail on coverage units is provided in Note 10);\n- \u00b7 Amortization of insurance acquisition cash flows;\n- \u00b7 Premium experience adjustments that relate to current or past service; and\n- \u00b7 Expected amounts related to income taxes specifically chargeable to the policyholder.\n\nAmortization of insurance acquisition cash flows in Insurance revenue is an allocation of the portion of the premiums that relates to the recovery of insurance acquisition cash flows, determined in a systematic way based on the passage of time. An equal and offsetting amount is included in Insurance service expenses.",

        "page_content": "For insurance contracts issued measured using the PAA, expected premium receipts (net of premium taxes and excluding investment components) are recognized as revenue, generally based on the passage of time.\n\nInsurance service expenses include:\n\n- \u00b7 Claims incurred in the period (excluding investment components and amounts allocated to the loss component);\n- \u00b7 Expenses incurred that are directly attributable to fulfilling the insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 Losses on onerous contracts and reversals of those losses;\n- \u00b7 Changes related to past service (e.g., changes in the LIC in periods subsequent to the claim being incurred);\n- \u00b7 Amortization of insurance acquisition cash flows;\n- \u00b7 Insurance acquisition cash flows expensed as incurred related to PAA contracts; and\n- \u00b7 Impairment and reversals of impairment of assets for insurance acquisition cash flows.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held, we have elected to present income and expenses arising from these contracts as a single amount in the Reinsurance contract held net income (expense) line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This amount includes an allocation of reinsurance premiums, amounts recovered from reinsurers, and changes in the risk of non-performance by the reinsurer. Allocations of reinsurance premiums are recognized as services are received for the reinsurance contract held.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held measured using the GMA, the services received for which consideration is paid include:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected recoveries and expenses, excluding amounts that are paid regardless of claims;\n- \u00b7 Release of the RA for the period;\n- \u00b7 CSM recognized for services received; and\n- \u00b7 Premium experience adjustments that relate to current or past service.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held measured using the PAA, expected premium payments (net of premium taxes and excluding amounts that are paid regardless of claims) are recognized as an allocation of reinsurance premiums based on the passage of time. Amounts recovered from reinsurers includes incurred claims (excluding amounts that are paid regardless of claims) and expenses, loss recoveries and reversals of loss recoveries, and changes related to past service (e.g., changes in the asset for incurred claims in periods subsequent to the claim being incurred).\n\n## Insurance finance income (expenses)\n\nChanges in the carrying value of insurance contracts issued not measured using the VFA and reinsurance contracts held that are due to changes in the time value of money and in financial risk are recognized in the Insurance finance income (expenses) line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For insurance contracts issued measured using the VFA, Insurance finance income (expenses) includes changes in the fair value of underlying items and changes not recognized in the CSM when the risk mitigation option is applied. We have elected to recognize all insurance finance income (expenses) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and not in OCI. Insurance finance income (expense) for insurance contracts for account of segregated fund holders is discussed in the Segregated Funds section of this Note.\n\n## Derecognition and Modification\n\nInsurance contracts are derecognized when the obligations in the contract expire, are discharged or cancelled, or when it is modified and the modification is substantial, such as when the modification results in a change in the measurement approach. When a contract modification results in derecognition, the original contract is derecognized and the modified contract is recognized as a new contract. Modifications that do not result in derecognition are treated as changes in FCF.\n\n## Segregated Funds\n\nSegregated funds are products where the benefit amount is directly linked to the fair value of the investments held in the particular segregated fund. Although the underlying assets are registered in our name and the segregated fund contract holder has no direct access to the specific assets, the contractual arrangements are such that the segregated fund policyholders bear the risks and rewards of the fund's investment performance. In addition, certain segregated funds contracts include guarantees from us. Segregated fund contracts are classified as insurance contracts or investment contracts following the classification criteria described in the Insurance Contracts section of this Note and Note 10.\n\n## Investments for Account of Segregated Fund Holders\n\nInvestments for account of segregated fund holders are recorded separately from the Total general fund assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and are carried at fair value. Fair values are determined using quoted market values or, where quoted market values are not available, estimated fair values as determined by us. Investments for account of segregated fund holders includes investments for contracts that are classified as insurance contracts and investments for contracts that are classified as investment contracts. Unrealized gains and losses and other investment income from investments for account of segregated fund holders classified as insurance contracts is reported as Net investment income (loss) within the Net investment result for insurance contracts for account of segregated fund holders in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Such investment income (loss) will be offset by the corresponding increase in the insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders. Changes in the fair value of the investments for account of segregated fund holders classified as investment contracts are recorded in net realized and unrealized gains (losses) within the segregated fund and are not recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Insurance Contract Liabilities for Account of Segregated Fund Holders\n\nSegregated fund products classified as insurance contracts are contracts with direct participation features and are therefore measured using the VFA described in the Insurance contracts section of this Note. Insurance contract liabilities for these contracts are presented as two separate lines on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position: Insurance contract liabilities excluding those for account of segregated fund holders, and Insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders. The Insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders represents the obligation to pay the policyholder an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying items. Changes in this obligation due to changes in fair value of the underlying items are recognized as Insurance finance income or expenses in the Net investment result for insurance contracts for account of segregated fund holders in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

        "page_content": "insurance finance income or expenses will be offset by the corresponding increase in Investments for account of segregated fund holders. Deposits into and payments from the segregated funds are investment components and thus excluded from insurance revenue and insurance service expenses. The Insurance contract liabilities excluding those for account of segregated fund holders on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position includes the remaining insurance contract liabilities for these contracts, which comprises the provision for guarantees, future expenses (less future fees), the RA and the CSM. Revenue and expenses related to these items are included in the Insurance service result on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Investment Contract Liabilities for Account of Segregated Fund Holders\n\nInvestment contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders are recorded separately from the Total general fund liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The liabilities reported as Investment contracts for account of segregated fund holders are measured at the aggregate of the policyholder account balances. We derive fee income from segregated funds classified as investment contracts, which is included in Fee income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deposits to segregated funds and payments made from segregated funds are reflected as increases or decreases in Investment contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders and Investments for account of segregated fund holders and are not reported as revenues or expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\n## Classification and initial measurement\n\nOur financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortized cost, except for financial guarantees, derivative liabilities, and liabilities related to CLOs. Financial guarantees, derivative liabilities, and liabilities related to CLOs are classified as FVTPL. For further details on the liabilities related to CLOs, refer to Note 5.A.i. We may also designate certain investment contracts liabilities and third-party interests in consolidated funds at FVTPL on initial recognition, and once designated, the designation is irrevocable. Financial liabilities are designated at FVTPL if doing so either eliminates or significantly reduces accounting mismatch with the supporting assets or that the liabilities and supporting assets are managed together and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Liabilities related to CLOs are designated at FVTPL on initial recognition as doing so either eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch with the supporting assets. The FVTPL designation is available only for those financial liabilities for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. All other investment contracts are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Policies applicable beginning January 1, 2023\n\nFinancial liabilities classified or designated at FVTPL are measured at fair value. Any interest expenses, foreign exchange gains (losses), and fair value changes that are not due to changes in own credit risk are recognized in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, unless they arise from derivatives designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges. For financial liabilities designated at FVTPL, fair value changes attributable to changes in our own credit risk are recorded in OCI, and are not reclassified subsequently to Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost are measured at fair value less transaction costs at initial recognition, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains (losses) are recorded in Net investment income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nPolicies applicable prior to January 1, 2023\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified or designated at FVTPL with the total amount of changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nWe generally derecognize a financial liability when the contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled. We also derecognize a financial liability when the terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any new non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Investment Contract Liabilities\n\nPolicies applicable beginning January 1, 2023\n\nContracts issued by us that do not transfer significant insurance risk, but do transfer financial risk from the policyholder to us, are financial liabilities and are accounted for as investment contracts, unless they have DPF, in which case they are accounted for as insurance contracts (See Insurance Contracts). Distinct service components of investment contracts are treated as service contracts (See Service Contracts and Fee Income).\n\nInvestment contract liabilities without DPF are initially recognized at fair value, less transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the contract, and are subsequently held at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortization is recorded as a Decrease (increase) in investment contract liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deposits collected from and payments made to contract holders are recorded as changes in our Investment contract liabilities balance in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Investment contract liabilities are derecognized when the obligation of the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. Investment contract liabilities without DPF include term certain payout annuities in Canada, accumulation annuities and guaranteed investment contracts in Canada, unit-linked products issued in Hong Kong, and non-unit linked pensions contracts issued in Hong Kong.\n\nAs discussed in the Segregated Funds section of this Note, investment contracts under which the policyholder bears the risks associated with the underlying investments are classified as Investment contracts for account of segregated fund holders in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.",

        "page_content": "## Policies applicable prior to January 1, 2023\n\nLiabilities for investment contracts without DPF are measured at FVTPL or amortized cost. Contract recorded at FVTPL are measured at fair value at inception and each subsequent reporting period. At each subsequent period, changes in fair value of investment contract liabilities recorded at FVTPL are recorded as an Increase in investment contract liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investment contract liabilities without DPF include term certain payout annuities in Canada, accumulation annuities and guaranteed investment contracts in Canada, unit-linked products issued in the UK and Hong Kong, and non-unit linked pensions contracts issued in the UK and Hong Kong.\n\n## Obligations for Securities Borrowing\n\nThe obligation for securities borrowing represents our commitment to deliver securities under the short sale program. Under the program, we short sell the securities that we borrowed from a third party. The obligation to return the securities is not recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position until they are sold, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Upon recognition, they are measured at fair value. The securities borrowings are returnable to the lender upon demand or at our discretion.\n\n## Other Liabilities\n\nOther liabilities, which are measured at amortized cost, include accounts payable, credit facilities, repurchase agreements, accrued expenses and taxes, senior financing, provisions, lessee's lease liabilities and a deferred payment liability. Liabilities for provisions, other than those reported with insurance contract liabilities and investment contract liabilities, are recognized for present legal or constructive obligations as a result of a past event if it is probable that they will result in an outflow of economic resources and the amount can be reliably estimated. The amounts recognized for these provisions are the best estimates of the expenditures required to settle the present obligations or to transfer them to a third party at the reporting date, considering all the inherent risks and uncertainties, as well as the time value of money. These provisions are reviewed as relevant facts and circumstances change.\n\nLease liabilities are measured as described in the Leases Section of this Note.\n\nOther financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost. For put option liabilities, upon initial recognition, the present value is calculated using our incremental borrowing rate and subsequent revisions to the expected timing or amount of cash flows payable as well as interest expense will be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## Senior Debentures and Subordinated Debt\n\nSenior debentures and subordinated debt liabilities are recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs are recorded as part of the liability and are recognized in income using the effective interest rate method. These liabilities are derecognized when the obligation of the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Service Contracts and Fee Income\n\nContracts issued by us that do not transfer significant insurance risk and do not transfer financial risk from the customer to us, including contracts for investment management service, are classified as service contracts. Distinct service components of insurance and investment contracts are also accounted for as service contracts.\n\nFees earned from these contracts are recognized and included in Fee income in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fee income from service contracts represents fees associated with contracts with customers and includes distribution fees, fund management and other assetbased fees, and administrative services and other fees. Distribution fees includes fees earned from the distribution of investment products and other intermediary activities. Fund management and other asset-based fees includes fees earned from investment management services. Administrative services and other fees includes fees earned from contract administration and other management services. Fee income from service contracts is typically recognized as revenue when services are rendered at either a point in time or over time. The majority of fee income from service contracts is comprised of variable consideration that is based on a percentage of assets under management or another variable metric and is recognized as revenue when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs arising from service contracts or investment contracts are amortized over the expected life of the contracts based on the future expected fees. Where the cost of meeting the obligations of the contract exceeds the economic benefits expected to be received under it, a provision is recognized in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Current and deferred income tax relating to items recognized in the current or previous period in OCI or directly in equity is accordingly recognized in OCI or equity and not in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest and penalties payable to taxation authorities are recorded in Interest expense and Operating expenses, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on income tax rates and laws that are expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realized, which are normally those enacted or considered substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that future taxable profit is expected to be available against which these assets can be utilized. At each reporting period, we assess all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the amount of deferred income tax assets to be recognized. The recognition of deferred income tax assets requires estimates and significant judgment about future events, such as projections of future taxable profits, based on the information available at the reporting date.\n\nThe determination of the required provision for current and deferred income taxes requires that we interpret tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each reporting period, our income tax provision reflects our best estimate, based on the information available at the reporting date, of tax positions that are under audit or appeal by relevant tax authorities. To the extent that our estimate of",

        "page_content": "tax positions or the timing of realization of deferred income tax assets or liabilities are not as expected, the provision for income taxes may increase or decrease in the future to reflect the actual experience.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where we control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is apparent that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. No deferred income tax asset or liability is recognized in relation to temporary differences that arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, did not affect either the accounting profit or taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority and we intend either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, and actuarial assumptions that represent best estimates of future variables that will affect the ultimate cost of these obligations. The discount rate used for our material defined benefit plans is determined with reference to market yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of obligations. Plan assets are measured at fair value and are held in separate trustee administered funds or as qualifying insurance contracts. The difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation is recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as an asset or liability in Other assets or Other liabilities, respectively.\n\nCosts charged to our Consolidated Statements of Operations include current service cost, any past service costs, any gains or losses from curtailments or settlements, and interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset). Remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset), which includes the impact of changes to the actuarial assumptions underlying the liability calculations, liability experience gains or losses, the difference between the return on plan assets and the amount included in the interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset), is reflected immediately in OCI. The calculation of the defined benefit expenses and obligations requires judgment as the recognition is dependent on various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates and projected compensation increases. These key assumptions are discussed in Note 24.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends payable to holders of shares of SLF Inc. are recognized in the period in which they are authorized or approved. Dividends that have been reinvested in additional common shares under the Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan (\"DRIP\") are also reflected as dividends within retained earnings. Where SLF Inc. has issued common shares from treasury under the DRIP, the additional shares have been reflected in common shares.\n\n## Share-Based Payments\n\nStock options of SLF Inc. granted to employees are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The total compensation expense for stock options is computed based on the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant and the estimated number of options expected to vest at the end of the vesting period. The expense is recognized over the vesting period as compensation expense in Operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, with an offset to contributed surplus in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. When options are exercised, new common shares are issued, contributed surplus is reversed and the common shares issued are credited to common shares in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.\n\nOther share-based payment plans based on the value of SLF Inc.'s common shares are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The total liabilities for these plans are computed based on the estimated number of awards expected to vest at the end of the vesting period. The liabilities are recomputed at the end of each reporting period and are measured at the fair value of the award at that reporting date. The liabilities are accrued and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. The liabilities are settled in cash at the end of the vesting period.\n\nShare-based payment awards within MFS Investment Management (\"MFS\"), which are based on their own shares, are accounted for as cashsettled share-based payment awards. The vested and unvested awards, as well as the shares that have been issued under these plans, are recognized as liabilities because MFS has a practice of purchasing the issued shares from employees after a specified holding period. The total liabilities for these plans are computed based on the estimated number of awards expected to vest at the end of the vesting period. The liabilities are accrued over the vesting period and are measured at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as compensation expense in Operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The liabilities are settled in cash when the shares are purchased from the employees.\n\n## Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\")\n\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing the common shareholders' net income by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding.\n\nDiluted EPS adjusts common shareholders' net income and the weighted average number of common shares for the effects of all dilutive potential common shares under the assumption that convertible instruments are converted and that outstanding options are exercised. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the adjusted common shareholders' net income by the adjusted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For convertible instruments, common shareholders' net income is increased by the after-tax expense on the convertible instrument while the weighted average common shares are increased by the number of common shares that would be issued at conversion. For stock options, it is assumed that the proceeds from the exercise of options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of common shares during the period are used to repurchase common shares at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of common shares issued for the exercise of the dilutive options and the number of common shares that would have been repurchased at the average market price of the common shares during the period is adjusted to the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Changes in Accounting Policies\n\n## 2.A New and Amended International Financial Reporting Standards Adopted in 2023\n\nWe adopted the following new and amended IFRS on January 1, 2023.\n\n## 2.A.i IFRS 17\n\n## Summary\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17, with an amendment issued in June 2020 to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. This standard is to be applied using a retrospective approach, with at least one year of comparative results provided. If retrospective application to a group of insurance contracts is impracticable, a modified retrospective or fair value approach may be used. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (\"IFRS 4\") and impacts how we recognize, measure, present, and disclose our insurance contracts in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIFRS 17 and IFRS 9 were effective for us beginning January 1, 2023. Restated comparative period results have been provided for IFRS 17. As permitted by IFRS 9, we elected not to restate comparative period results, and as permitted by IFRS 17, we have elected to present comparative information on financial assets as if IFRS 9 were applicable during the comparative period.\n\nFor initial measurement of insurance contracts at the transition date of January 1, 2022, we have elected to use the fair value approach for all groups for which the retrospective approach is impracticable. For more information on the application of the fair value approach at transition, see the Fair value measurement section below.\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of insurance contracts. The key principles of IFRS 17 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts are those under which an entity accepts significant insurance risk from another party (\"policyholder\") by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (\"insured event\") adversely affects the policyholder.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held are divided into groups that will be separately recognized and measured.\n- \u00b7 Groups of insurance contracts are recognized and measured as the total of the following measurement components: a) the present value of future cash flows; b) a risk adjustment for non-financial risk (\"RA\"); and c) the Contractual Service Margin (\"CSM\"), an amount that represents the unearned profit of the group of contracts. These measurement components apply to groups of insurance contracts measured using the GMA and the VFA. The VFA applies to insurance contracts issued with direct participation features, which are substantially investment-related service contracts under which the policyholder is promised an investment return based on underlying items, such as segregated funds and certain participating insurance contracts. For short duration contracts, such as most of our group life and health business, a simplified measurement approach (PAA) is applied. Under the PAA, insurance contracts are measured based on unearned profits and do not include a CSM.\n- \u00b7 The profit from a group of insurance contracts is recognized into income over the period that insurance contract services are provided and as the non-financial risks related to providing the insurance contracts diminish.\n- \u00b7 Insurance revenue, insurance service expenses and insurance finance income or expenses are presented separately.\n\n## Significant Differences between IFRS 17 and IFRS 4\n\nThe following section describes the most significant differences between IFRS 17 and the accounting policies applied under IFRS 4.\n\n## Scope\n\nThere is no substantial change in IFRS 17 compared to IFRS 4 with regards to which contracts fall within the scope of the standard. However, we have updated the accounting policy for classification that was adopted on the transition to IFRS 4 in 2011 to ensure consistency with the IFRS 17 definition of insurance contracts.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, an insurance contract is defined as a contract under which the issuer accepts significant insurance risk from the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if an insured event adversely affects the policyholder. In assessing whether \"significant\" insurance risk exists, certain contracts that were classified as insurance contracts under IFRS 4 were reclassified as investment contracts under IFRS 17. Such changes in classification were limited to certain deferred annuity products where the insurance risk is limited to the right to annuitize the maturity benefit, which fell short of the threshold for \"significant\" insurance risk.\n\nFurthermore, IFRS 17 includes new requirements for the separation of distinct investment components and distinct goods or non-insurance service components of insurance contracts. At transition to IFRS 17, there were no distinct investment components and only immaterial distinct service components in our insurance contracts.\n\nUnlike IFRS 4, IFRS 17 requires reinsurance contracts held to be measured separately from the underlying direct contracts. A reinsurance contract is an insurance contract issued by the reinsurer to compensate another entity for claims arising from one or more insurance contracts issued by that other entity (\"underlying contracts\").\n\nOnly contracts that transfer insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered reinsurance contracts held from the ceding entity's point of view. We have reinsurance treaties that transfer only non-insurance risks to the reinsurer, however these are not considered reinsurance contracts held in scope of IFRS 17, nor were they in scope of IFRS 4. Rather, they are treated as insurance contracts purchased.\n\nReinsurance treaties that are part of the underlying items of participating insurance contracts (i.e., where all the cash flows of the reinsurance treaty are fully passed through to the participating insurance policyholders) are measured and reported separately.\n\nInvestment contracts with DPF are in scope of IFRS 17 and were in scope of IFRS 4. However, such contracts were reported with other investment contracts under IFRS 4, and are reported with insurance contracts under IFRS 17.",

        "page_content": "## Measurement\n\nThe measurement of insurance contracts under IFRS 17 differs from the Canadian Asset Liability Method (\"CALM\") previously applied under IFRS 4. The most significant differences by measurement component are as follows:\n\n## Present value of future cash flows:\n\n- \u00b7 The discount rates used to present value future cash flows under IFRS 17 are based on the characteristics of the insurance contracts. Under IFRS 4, the CALM is used to determine actuarial liabilities based on the portfolio of assets currently supporting the insurance contract liabilities and reinvestment assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Estimates under IFRS 17 include the current market view of the cost of financial guarantees, which requires a valuation consistent with market option prices. Under IFRS 4, the cost of financial guarantees is based on the amount required to fulfill the obligation but not directly linked to market option prices.\n- \u00b7 Expense cash flows under IFRS 17 are limited to those directly attributable to fulfilment of the obligations under insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Future income taxes are excluded from future cash flows under IFRS 17.\n\n## RA:\n\n- \u00b7 Measures the compensation required for uncertainty related to non-financial risk, such as mortality, morbidity, surrender and expenses under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Provisions for uncertainty related to financial risk are implicitly included in the present value of future cash flows under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 No amount is provided for asset-liability mismatch risk under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 Under IFRS 4, amounts provided for the risks listed above are reflected in a provision for adverse deviations included in insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## CSM:\n\n- \u00b7 This is a new component of liabilities and necessitates the \"grouping\" of insurance contracts, which is not required under IFRS 4.\n- \u00b7 The CSM represents unearned profits, as discussed above.\n\nThe measurement approaches under IFRS 17 and IFRS 4 are similar for insurance contracts measured using the PAA. Differences arise mainly in the measurement of the LIC, where the discount rate and risk adjustment for non-financial risk changes noted above apply.\n\n## Presentation\n\nIFRS 17 requires that portfolios of insurance contracts that are in an asset position be presented separately from portfolios of insurance contracts that are in a liability position in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Also, portfolios of insurance contracts issued must be presented separately from portfolios of reinsurance contracts held. Previously, insurance contracts issued were presented only as liabilities and reinsurance contracts held were presented only as assets. Certain balances, such as policy loans and outstanding and prepaid premiums, that were previously presented separately or included in Other assets and Other liabilities are now included in the assets or liabilities for insurance contracts issued or reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe presentation of income from insurance contracts on the Consolidated Statements of Operations has changed significantly for IFRS 17. Prior to IFRS 17, insurance related income was presented separately in the lines Gross premiums, Ceded premiums, Gross claims and benefits paid, Reinsurance expenses (recoveries), Increase (decrease) in insurance contract liabilities, and Decrease (increase) in reinsurance assets. The line Operating expenses, commissions and premium taxes included all expenses, reflecting those from both insurance and non-insurance contracts.\n\nUnder IFRS 17, insurance-related income is presented in the Insurance service result section and the Insurance finance income (expenses) line in the Investment result section. Amounts are presented separately for insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held. The Insurance service expenses line includes amounts previously reported as Gross claims and benefits paid, with the exclusion of repayments of investment components, which are amounts that are returned to policyholders under all circumstances. Directly attributable expenses are also presented as Insurance service expenses. Income or expense from reinsurance contracts held is now presented as one line, which includes an allocation of reinsurance premiums paid and amounts recovered from reinsurers.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the GMA or VFA, premiums are no longer reported as revenue or recognized in income when received. Insurance revenue in a reporting period is comprised of the portion of premiums that cover expected claims and directly attributable expenses in the period, as well as the release of RA and the amortization of CSM for the period. Insurance revenue excludes the portion of premiums that cover repayment of investment components.\n\nFee income excludes income from insurance contracts as any fees earned would be recognized in Insurance contract revenue. Similarly, the Operating expenses and commissions line excludes expenses that are directly attributable to issuing or fulfilling insurance contracts as these expenses, as well as premium taxes paid, are included in the Insurance service result section.\n\n## Transition Impacts\n\n## Transition Method\n\nThe retrospective application of IFRS 17 at the transition date of January 1, 2022, was implemented using the fair value approach where a full retrospective approach was impracticable. The full retrospective approach was deemed impracticable for all groups of insurance contracts measured using the GMA or VFA, because estimates required information that was either not available or would not have been available in a usable form in prior periods. For groups of insurance contracts measured using the PAA, we applied full retrospective measurement at transition.\n\nUnder the fair value approach, the CSM at transition for a group of insurance contracts is equal to the fair value of the group of insurance contracts less the FCF measured using IFRS 17. The fair value of a group of insurance contracts is the amount that a market participant would require to take over the obligations of the group of insurance contracts.",

        "page_content": "## Transition Grouping\n\nAs permitted under IFRS 17 when using the fair value approach, groups of insurance contracts at transition were formed according to the IFRS 17 grouping requirements, but without the restriction that groups should not contain contracts that are issued more than one year apart. Also, given the definition of fair value, all insurance contracts issued in a portfolio were in the same profitability group. Therefore, there was only one group for each portfolio of insurance contracts issued at transition. Portfolios of reinsurance contracts held at transition were grouped according to the grouping of the direct underlying contracts.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nThe fair value of a group of insurance contracts issued as at the transition date was measured using one of two approaches, the current pricing margin approach or the \"adjusted fulfilment cash flows\" approach. For both approaches, our requirements were considered a reasonable proxy for a market participant's requirements, as we share the characteristics of a typical market participant in the insurance market. The determination of fair value requires us to make estimates and assumptions that require significant judgment.\n\nThe \"adjusted fulfilment cash flows\" approach identifies specific amounts a market participant would require, in addition to the FCF, to take over the obligations of the group. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 A provision for reinvestment risk, which was measured as the cost of capital for interest rate risk using the higher of the Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test (\"LICAT\") and local capital requirements;\n- \u00b7 An amount for overhead and other non-directly attributable expenses not covered by FCF; and\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments, including a provision for general operational risk and an amount to compensate for the expectation, as at the transition date, that CSM would not be tax-deductible.\n\nThe current pricing margin approach identifies the amount a market participant would require by identifying the amount that we require in the current pricing of insurance contracts.\n\nThe \"adjusted fulfilment cash flows\" approach was used for most non-participating insurance and annuity contracts. The current pricing margin approach was used for most fee-based and pass-through contracts.\n\nThe fair value of a group of reinsurance contracts held as at the transition date was measured as the difference between the fair value of the group of underlying insurance contracts without consideration of reinsurance, and the fair value of the group of underlying insurance contracts together with the corresponding group of reinsurance contracts held.\n\n## CSM at Transition\n\nThe CSM at transition for each group of insurance contracts is the fair value of the contracts less the FCF. The FCF at transition were measured using the IFRS 17 policies described in Note 1 and Note 10. The discount curve was established as at the transition date, and became the locked-in discount curve for the group going forward, as the fair value method was applied.\n\nDetails on the impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements due to the adoption of IFRS 17 are included in Note 2.A.iv.\n\n## 2.A.ii IFRS 9\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the first quarter, we adopted IFRS 9, which includes guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting, and does not require restatement of comparative periods. IFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (\"IAS 39\"). As a result of the application of IFRS 9, we changed our accounting policies in the areas indicated below, which were effective beginning January 1, 2023. We are permitted, under IFRS 17, to present comparative information on financial assets as if IFRS 9 were applicable during the comparative period (\"classification overlay\"). We have elected to apply the classification overlay to our financial assets and their comparative period results as if IFRS 9 had been effective since January 1, 2022. Certain comparative period information will continue to be presented in accordance with our previous accounting policies, as indicated below.\n\n## Classification of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 introduces three principal classification categories for financial assets. Financial assets are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are classified as and subsequently measured at FVTPL, FVOCI or amortized cost based on our business model for managing the financial asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\nIFRS 9 eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held-to-maturity, available-for-sale (\"AFS\"), and loans and receivable financial assets. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in scope of IFRS 9 are not separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument, as a whole, is assessed for classification.\n\nIFRS 9 maintains the IAS 39 classification for financial liabilities. Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are measured at either amortized cost or FVTPL.\n\nFurther details on how we classify and measure our financial assets and financial liabilities and account for the related gains and losses under IFRS 9 are described in Note 1.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIFRS 9 replaces the \"incurred loss\" model under IAS 39 with a forward-looking ECL model. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt securities measured at FVOCI, mortgages and loans measured at FVOCI, lease receivables, account receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantees not measured at FVTPL. Credit losses are recognized earlier under IFRS 9 as compared previously under IAS 39. Refer to the impairment section in Note 1.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nIFRS 9 introduced a new hedge accounting model, but permits entities to continue applying hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 instead of those under IFRS 9. We have elected to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39.",

        "page_content": "## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 amendments\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2, which includes amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (\"IFRS 7\"), IFRS 4, and IFRS 16 Leases (\"IFRS 16\"). These amendments address issues that arise from the implementation of the reforms, including the replacement of a benchmark with an alternative reference rate ('ARR'), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), in the case of US dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), and the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (\"CORRA\"), in the case of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (\"CDOR\"). The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAll LIBOR settings were either discontinued or declared non-representative on or before June 30, 2023. On May 16, 2022, Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited, the administrator of CDOR, announced that it will permanently cease the publication of all three tenors of CDOR after June 28, 2024. Concurrently, OSFI published their expectation that Federally Regulated Financial Institutions (\"FRFIs\") transition all new derivatives and securities to an ARR by June 30, 2023, with no new CDOR exposure being recognized after that date (with limited exceptions for risk management requirements), and that loan agreements referencing CDOR be transitioned by June 28, 2024. FRFIs are also expected to prioritize system and model updates to accommodate the use of CORRA (or any alternative reference rates, as necessary) prior to such date.\n\nAlso, with the cessation of CDOR's publication, the Bankers' Acceptance (\"BA\") lending model will be discontinued, and BA issuance is expected to cease. To facilitate the Canadian loan markets' move away from CDOR and BAs, on July 27, 2023, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group (\"CARR\"), established by the Canadian Fixed-Income Forum committee of the Bank of Canada (\"CFIF\"), has implemented a milestone in its two-stage transition plan whereby no new CDOR or BA-related contract should be entered into after November 1, 2023. CFIF has formed a BA-related working group to facilitate a smooth transition away from BAs and to assess potential options to replace them.\n\nIn preparation for the above-mentioned benchmark reform, we implemented an Interbank Offered Rate (\"IBOR\") Transition Program (the \"Program\") to manage the transition from LIBOR and CDOR to appropriate ARRs. The Program is cross-functional in nature and comprises key stakeholders across our organization and operates with executive oversight. The Program is on track in executing its transition plan, and is mindful of incorporating market developments as they arise. We also actively participate in industry associations and incorporate best practice guidance from these industry associations, as well as regulatory bodies, into the transition plan, such as reviewing and remediating our IBOR-based contracts to incorporate appropriate fallback language. The Program is designed to address the risk and uncertainty relating to our transition to ARRs and other factors relating to reform that could otherwise adversely affect our operations and cash flows and the value of and return on our investments that are IBOR-based. Our affiliated entities with IBOR exposure related to derivatives adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol prior to June 30, 2023, facilitating the transition of our legacy derivative contracts to appropriate ARRs. Our GBP LIBOR exposure transitioned to Sterling Overnight Index Average (\"SONIA\"), and our remaining US dollar LIBOR and CDOR exposure has transitioned or is expected to transition to appropriate ARRs in the first half of 2024.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, our exposure to US dollar LIBOR consists of non-derivative financial assets of $86 (December 31, 2022 - $2,750), non-derivative financial liabilities of $nil (December 31, 2022 - $77) and derivative notional of $nil (December 31, 2022 - $1,683) that have not yet been confirmed to have transitioned to SOFR. Our exposure to CDOR consists of non-derivative financial assets of $589 (December 31, 2022 - $396), non-derivative financial liabilities of $4,896 (December 31, 2022 - $5,892), and derivative notional of $9,159 (December 31, 2022 - $11,725) that have not yet transitioned to CORRA, excluding financial instruments maturing by June 28, 2024, and including derivatives that are expected to automatically transition to CDOR upon its cessation.\n\n## 2.A.iii Other Amended International Financial Reporting Standards Adopted in 2023\n\nWe adopted the following amendments to IFRS on January 1, 2023. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\nIn May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes (\"IAS 12\"). The amendments, Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction, narrow the scope of the recognition exemption in IAS 12 so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (\"IAS 1\") and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgments (\"IFRS Practice Statement 2\"). The amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.\n\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . The amendments clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 to give temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes arising from Pillar Two model rules, which the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\"OECD\") published in December 2021. The amendments introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from jurisdictions implementing the global tax rules and disclosure requirements for affected entities to help users better understand an entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date. Effective upon issuance, we have applied the mandatory temporary exception which is effective immediately.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, the Canadian Department of Finance released draft legislation to implement certain previously announced measures, including application rules for a 15% global minimum tax under OECD's two-pillar plan, which will apply to Sun Life effective January 1, 2024, however the timing of the substantive enactment of these rules in most jurisdictions where Sun Life operates is uncertain. The Pillar Two rules are not expected to have a material impact on Sun Life's consolidated financial statements when they become effective.",

The amendments require a seller-lessee to subsequently measure lease liabilities arising from a leaseback in a way that it does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The amendments to IFRS 16 will be effective for annual reporting period beginning on or after January 1, 2024, with early application permitted. We do not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Total consideration for the 100% acquisition of DentaQuest was paid with cash of $3,267, and primarily comprised of goodwill and intangibles, including contractual relationships, software, and brand. DentaQuest is reported in the Dental CGU of our U.S. business segment. The acquisition of DentaQuest aligns to our business strategy of being a leader in health and group benefits, with an increasing focus on health.\n\nThe fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were:\n\n|                                             | As at June 1, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Intangible assets                           | $  1,074             |\n| Net assets                                  | 255                  |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                    | (189)                |\n| Total identifiable net assets at fair value | 1,140                |\n| Goodwill arising on acquisition (1)         | 2,127                |\n| Total consideration                         | $  3,267             |\n\nThe fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities were subject to refinement and have been adjusted.\n\n## Other\n\nOn January 20, 2023, we announced our entry into a 15-year exclusive bancassurance partnership with Dah Sing Bank, Limited. This is our first exclusive bancassurance partnership in Hong Kong and will be a valuable complement to our existing network of insurance advisors. Effective July 1, 2023, we commenced the partnership. We will pay an amount of approximately $260 for this exclusive arrangement, with ongoing variable payments to Dah Sing Bank, Limited based on the success of the partnership.\n\nEffective February 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our sponsored markets business to Canadian Premier Life Insurance Company (rebranded to Securian Canada). Our sponsored markets business includes a variety of association & affinity, and group creditor clients. We disposed of assets of approximately $638 and liabilities of approximately $638. Total consideration received consisted of cash consideration of $98 and contingent consideration of $25. During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of the business of $102 in Other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gain on the sale of the business net of goodwill disposed, transaction costs and taxes is $65.\n\nOn April 5, 2022, we announced a deepening of our existing bancassurance partnership with PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk (\"CIMB Niaga\") in Indonesia. Under the new agreement, which will be effective in January 2025, we will be the provider of insurance solutions to CIMB Niaga customers across all distribution channels for a term of 15 years, further accelerating our long-term strategy of growing our distribution capacity in the region. The agreement also extends our existing relationship with CIMB Niaga by a term of six years up to 2039. An initial payment of $508 was made on June 30, 2022. $18 of the initial payment related to the existing bancassurance partnership was capitalized as an intangible asset. The remaining $490 will initially be recognized as a prepayment and capitalized as an intangible asset once the agreement becomes effective in 2025. Amortization of this intangible asset will begin in 2025.\n\n## 4. Segmented Information\n\nWe have five reportable business segments: Canada, U.S., Asset Management, Asia, and Corporate. These business segments operate in the financial services industry and reflect our management structure and internal financial reporting. Asset Management includes the results of our MFS and SLC Management business units. Corporate includes the results of our UK business unit and our Corporate Support operations, which include run-off reinsurance operations, as well as investment income, expenses, capital and other items not allocated to our other business groups. Effective the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of our UK Business unit. We have retained our economic interest in the annuity business via a reinsurance arrangement that will be reported under the U.S. reportable segment on a prospective basis.\n\nRevenues from our business segments are derived primarily from life and health insurance, investment management and annuities, and mutual funds. Revenues not attributed to the strategic business units are derived primarily from Corporate investments and earnings on capital. Transactions between segments are executed and priced at an arm's-length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.\n\nThe expenses in each business segment may include costs or services directly incurred or provided on their behalf at the enterprise level. For other costs not directly attributable to one of our business segments, we use a management reporting framework that uses assumptions, judgments, and methodologies for allocating overhead costs and indirect expenses to our business segments.\n\nIntersegment transactions consist primarily of internal financing agreements which are measured at fair values prevailing when the arrangements are negotiated. Intersegment investment income consists primarily of interest paid by U.S. to Corporate. Intersegment fee income is primarily asset management fees paid by our business segments to Asset Management. SLC Management collects fee income and incurs the operational expenses associated with the management of the general fund assets. Intersegment transactions are eliminated in the Consolidation adjustments column in the following tables.\n\nManagement considers its external Clients to be individuals and corporations. We are not reliant on any individual Client as none is individually significant to our operations.",

Each CLO is a special purpose vehicle that owns a portfolio of investments, consisting primarily of senior secured loans, and issues various tranches of senior and subordinated notes to third parties for the purpose of financing the purchase of those investments. Assets of the special purpose vehicle, the senior secured loans, are included in Other financial invested assets and the associated liabilities, the senior and subordinated notes issued to third parties, are included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the assets related to CLOs are $3,478 (December 31, 2022 - $2,880), which consists of cash and accounts receivable of $251 (December 31, 2022 - $292) and loans of $3,227 (December 31, 2022 - $2,588). These underlying loans are mainly below investment grade.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the liabilities related to CLOs are $3,247 (December 31, 2022 - $2,816). Our maximum contractual exposure to loss related to the CLOs is limited to our investment of $192 (December 31, 2022 - $159) in the most subordinated tranche. The net realized and unrealized loss incurred to date is $43.\n\n## 5.A.ii Non-Financial Invested Assets\n\nNon-financial invested assets consist of investment properties, investment in associates, subsidiaries and joint ventures which are not consolidated. As at December 31, 2023, the carrying value and fair value of investment properties was $9,723 (December 31, 2022 - $10,102) and $9,723 (December 31, 2022 - $10,102), respectively. The carrying value of other non-financial invested assets which were measured using the equity method of accounting was $1,657 as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $1,652).",

        "page_content": "## 5.A.iii Fair Value Methodologies and Assumptions\n\nThe specific inputs and valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of our invested assets and financial liabilities are noted below:\n\n## Cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities\n\nCash equivalents are highly liquid investments that are subject to insignificant changes in value and are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Cash equivalents comprise financial assets with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Short-term securities comprise financial assets with maturities of greater than three months and less than one year when acquired. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities are classified as held for trading for the purpose of meeting short-term cash requirements and accounted for at FVTPL due to their short-term nature or because they are frequently repriced to current market rates.\n\n## Government and corporate debt securities\n\nThe fair value of government and corporate debt securities is primarily determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar securities, where available. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined using market standard valuation methodologies, which include a discounted cash flow method, consensus pricing from various broker dealers that are typically the market makers, or other similar techniques. The assumptions and valuation inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies are determined primarily using observable market inputs, which include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades of identical or similar instruments, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bid prices, and reference data including market research publications. In limited circumstances, non-binding broker quotes are used.\n\n## Asset-backed securities\n\nThe fair value of asset-backed securities is primarily determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar securities, where available, or valuation methodologies and valuation inputs similar to those used for government and corporate debt securities. Additional valuation inputs include structural characteristics of the securities, and the underlying collateral performance, such as prepayment speeds and delinquencies. Expected prepayment speeds are based primarily on those previously experienced in the market at projected future interest rate levels. In limited circumstances where there is a lack of sufficient observable market data to value the securities, non-binding broker quotes are used.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nThe fair value of equity securities is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities or similar securities, where available. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined using equity valuation models, which include a discounted cash flow method and other techniques that involve benchmark comparison. Valuation inputs primarily include projected future operating cash flows and earnings, dividends, market discount rates, and earnings multiples of comparable companies. Where equity securities are less frequently traded, the most recent exchange-quoted pricing is used to determine fair value.\n\n## Mortgages and loans\n\nThe fair value of mortgages and loans is determined by discounting the expected future contractual cash flows using a current market interest rate applicable to financial instruments with a similar yield, credit quality, and maturity characteristics. Valuation inputs typically include benchmark yields and risk-adjusted spreads from current internal lending activities or loan issuances. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, valuation inputs also include external lending activities or loan issuances from both public and private markets, enhancing the market observability of inputs. The risk-adjusted spreads are determined based on the borrower's credit and liquidity, as well as term and other loanspecific features.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments depends upon derivative types. The fair value of exchange-traded futures and options is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, where available, while the fair value of over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives is determined using pricing models, such as a discounted cash flow method or other market standard valuation techniques, with primarily observable market inputs. Valuation inputs used to price OTC derivatives may include swap interest rate curves, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, index prices, the value of underlying securities, projected dividends, volatility surfaces, and in limited circumstances, counterparty quotes. The fair value of OTC derivative instruments also includes credit valuation adjustments to reflect the credit risk of both the derivative counterparty and ourselves as well as the impact of contractual factors designed to reduce our credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset under master netting agreements. Inputs into determining the appropriate credit valuation adjustments are typically obtained from publicly available information and include credit default swap spreads when available, credit spreads derived from specific bond yields, or published cumulative default experience data adjusted for current trends when credit default swap spreads are not available.\n\n## Other financial invested assets\n\nThe fair value of other financial invested assets consists primarily of limited partnership investments which is based on net asset value (\"NAV\") provided by management of the limited partnership investments. Based on the unobservable nature of these NAVs, we do not assess whether applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have an impact on the fair value of the limited partnership investments.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe fair value of investment properties is generally determined using property valuation models that are based on expected capitalization rates and models that discount expected future net cash flows at current market interest rates reflective of the characteristics, location, and market of each property. Expected future net cash flows include contractual and projected cash flows and forecasted operating expenses, and take into account interest, rental, and occupancy rates derived from market surveys. The estimates of future cash inflows in addition to expected rental income from current leases, include projected income from future leases based on significant assumptions that are consistent with current market conditions. The future rental rates are estimated based on the location, type, and quality of the properties, and take into account market data and projections at the valuation date. The fair values are typically compared to market-based information for reasonability, including recent transactions involving comparable assets. The methodologies and inputs used in these models are in accordance with real estate industry valuation standards. Valuations are prepared externally or internally by professionally accredited real estate appraisers.",

        "page_content": "## Investments for account of segregated fund holders\n\nThe fair value of investments for account of segregated fund holders is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets or independent valuation information provided by investment managers. The fair value of direct investments within investments for account of segregated fund holders, such as short-term securities and government and corporate debt securities, is determined according to valuation methodologies and inputs described above in the respective asset type sections.\n\n## Investment contract liabilities\n\nThe fair value of investment contracts is measured through the use of prospective discounted cash flow method. For unit-linked contracts, the fair value is equal to the current unit fund value, plus additional non-unit liability amounts on a fair value basis if required. For non-unitlinked contracts, the fair value is equal to the present value of contractual cash flow. The fair value of the investment contract liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the nature of the contracts.\n\n## Obligations for securities borrowing\n\nThe fair values of these obligations are based on the fair value of the underlying securities, which can include debt or equity securities. The method used to determine fair value is based on the quoted market prices where available in an active market.\n\n## Other financial liabilities\n\nThe fair value of other financial liabilities is determined using the discounted contractual cash flow methodology at the incremental borrowing rate or the effective interest rate, where available. Other financial liabilities categorized as Level 3 represent the present value of the estimated price we would pay to acquire any remaining outstanding shares upon exercise of a put option and any mandatory income distributions. The fair value of the liabilities is based on the average earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") for the preceding years before the options' exercise dates and EBITDA multiples in accordance with the put agreements as well as the expected amount of any mandatory income distributions. A change in EBITDA would impact the fair value of other financial liabilities and our net income (loss).\n\n## Collateralized loan obligations\n\nThe fair value of underlying assets within our CLOs is determined primarily using observable market inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and other observable market data.\n\nThe fair value of underlying liabilities within our CLOs is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using a current market interest rate applicable to financial instruments with a similar yield, credit quality, maturity characteristics, and structural credit protections. The valuation technique maximizes the use of observable inputs that incorporates comparable securities' prices and other market intelligence.\n\n## 5.A.iv Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nWe categorize our assets and liabilities carried at fair value based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, into a three-level fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Fair value based on the unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets represents a Level 1 valuation. Where possible, valuations are based on quoted prices or observable inputs obtained from active markets. The types of assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 generally include cash and cash equivalents, certain U.S. government and agency securities, exchange-traded equity securities, and certain segregated and mutual fund units held for account of segregated fund holders.\n\nLevel 2: Fair value is based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities traded in active markets, or prices from valuation techniques that use significant observable inputs, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data through correlation or other means. When a fair value is based on all significant market observable inputs, the valuation is classified as Level 2. Financial instruments traded in a less active market are valued using indicative market prices, the present value of cash flows or other valuation methods. The types of assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 generally include Canadian federal, provincial and municipal government, other foreign government and corporate debt securities, certain asset-backed securities, repurchase agreements, OTC derivatives, and certain segregated and mutual fund units held for account of segregated fund holders.\n\nLevel 3: Fair value is based on valuation techniques that require one or more significant inputs that are not based on observable market inputs. These unobservable inputs reflect our expectations about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Where financial instruments trade in inactive markets or when using models where observable parameters do not exist, significant management judgment is required for valuation methodologies and model inputs. The types of assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 generally include certain corporate bonds, certain asset-backed securities, certain other financial invested assets, investment properties, and certain segregated and mutual fund units held for account of segregated fund holders.",

The key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of investment properties as at December 31, 2023 include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimated rental value: The estimated rental value is based on contractual rent and other local market lease transactions, net of reimbursable operating expenses. An increase (decrease) in the estimated rental value would result in a higher (lower) fair value. The estimated rental value varies depending on the property types, which include retail, office, and industrial properties. The estimated rental value (in dollars, per square foot, per annum) ranges from $12.00 to $76.00 for retail and office properties and from $3.00 to $23.00 for industrial properties.\n- \u00b7 Rental growth rate: The rental growth rate is typically estimated based on expected market behaviour, which is influenced by the type of property and geographic region of the property. An increase (decrease) in the rental growth rate would result in a higher (lower) fair value. The rental growth rate (per annum) ranges from 0.00% to 3.00%, however the one- to two-year short-term rent curve is either below or above this range for select properties.\n- \u00b7 Long-term vacancy rate: The long-term vacancy rate is typically estimated based on expected market behaviour, which is influenced by the type of property and geographic region of the property. An increase (decrease) in the long-term vacancy rate would result in a lower (higher) fair value. The long-term vacancy rate ranges from 2.00% to 10.00%.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate: The discount rate is derived from market activity across various property types and geographic regions and is a reflection of the expected rate of return to be realized on the investment over the next 10 years. An increase (decrease) in the discount rate would result in a lower (higher) fair value. The discount rate ranges from 5.50% to 10.00%.\n- \u00b7 Terminal capitalization rate: The terminal capitalization rate is derived from market activity across various property types and geographic regions and is a reflection of the expected rate of return to be realized on the investment over the remainder of its life after the 10-year period. An increase (decrease) in the terminal capitalization rate would result in a lower (higher) fair value. The terminal capitalization rate ranges from 4.00% to 8.50%.\n\nChanges in the estimated rental value are positively correlated with changes in the rental growth rate. Changes in the estimated rental value are negatively correlated with changes in the long-term vacancy rate, the discount rate, and the terminal capitalization rate.\n\nOur Mortgages and loans, categorized in Level 3, are included in Mortgages and loans - FVTPL and Mortgages and loans - FVOCI in the Level 3 roll forward table, and Mortgages and loans - Amortized cost in Note 5.A.i. The fair value of these mortgages and loans is determined by using the discounted cash flow methodology. The key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of mortgages and loans as at December 31, 2023 include credit spreads and liquidity adjustments. The credit spread is the difference between the instrument yield and the benchmark yield. The benchmark yield is determined by matching each asset by geography, sector, rating and maturity to a matrix comprised of spreads of publicly available corporate bonds. In some cases, a liquidity premium or discount may be applied if recent private spreads differ from public spreads. The credit spreads range from 0.50% to 4.50%. The liquidity adjustments range from a discount of 1.00% to a premium of 2.00%. Changes in the fair value of mortgages and loans are negatively correlated with changes in credit spread and liquidity adjustments.\n\nOur Debt securities categorized in Level 3, which are included in Debt securities - FVTPL and Debt securities - FVOCI in the Level 3 roll forward table, consist primarily of corporate bonds. The fair value of these corporate bonds is generally determined using broker quotes that cannot be corroborated with observable market transactions. Significant unobservable inputs for these corporate bonds would include issuer spreads, which are comprised of credit, liquidity, and other security-specific features of the bonds. A decrease (increase) in these issuer spreads would result in a lower (higher) fair value. Due to the unobservable nature of these broker quotes, we do not assess whether applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have an impact on the fair value of the Level 3 corporate bonds. The majority of our debt securities categorized in Level 3 are FVTPL assets supporting insurance contract liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these assets supporting insurance contract liabilities are largely offset by changes in the corresponding insurance contract liabilities. As a result, though using reasonably possible alternative assumptions may have an impact on the fair value of the Level 3 debt securities, it would not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Other financial invested assets categorized in Level 3, which are included in Other financial invested assets - FVTPL and Other financial invested assets - FVOCI in the Level 3 roll forward table, consists primarily of limited partnership investments. The fair value of our limited partnership investments is based on NAV provided by management of the limited partnership investments. Based on the unobservable nature of these NAVs, we do not assess whether applying reasonably possible alternative assumptions would have an impact on the fair value of the Level 3 limited partnership investments.\n\n## Valuation Process for Level 3 Assets\n\nOur assets categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are primarily Investment properties, Debt securities (including asset-backed securities), Mortgages and loans and limited partnership investments included in Other financial invested assets. Our valuation processes for these assets are as follows:\n\nThe fair value of investment properties are based on the results of appraisals performed annually and reviewed quarterly for material changes. The valuation methodology used to determine the fair value is in accordance with the standards of the Appraisal Institute of Canada, the U.S., and the UK. Investment properties are appraised externally at least once every three years. Investment properties not appraised externally in a given year are reviewed by qualified appraisers. A management committee, including investment professionals, reviews the fair value of investment properties for overall reasonability.\n\nThe fair value of mortgages and loans is based on an internal discounted cash flow model, subject to detailed review and validation to ensure overall reasonability.\n\nThe fair value of debt securities is generally obtained by external pricing services. We obtain an understanding of inputs and valuation methods used by external pricing services. When fair value cannot be obtained from external pricing services, broker quotes, or internal models subject to detailed review and validation processes are used. The fair value of debt securities is subject to price validation and review procedures to ensure overall reasonability.",

The financial statements used in calculating the NAV are generally audited annually. We review the NAV of the limited partnership investments and perform analytical and other procedures to ensure the fair value is reasonable.\n\nInvestment contracts for account of segregated funds can be surrendered and units in the segregated funds can be redeemed by the holder at any time. Accordingly, the fair values of investment contract liability and the liability for investment contracts for account of segregated fund holders are not less than the amount payable on demand. Their fair values are based on the fair value of the underlying items less any accrued fees and surrender charges and approximate their carrying values.\n\n## 5.B Net Investment Income (Loss)\n\n| For the year ended December 31, 2023                         | Financial  Instruments at  Amortized Cost   | Financial  Instruments  at FVOCI   | Financial  Instruments  at FVTPL   | Total     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Interest income (expense):                                   |                                             |                                    |                                    |           |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments            |                                             |                                    | $  473                             | $  473    |\n| Debt securities                                              |                                             | 563                                | 2,663                              | 3,226     |\n| Mortgages and loans                                          | 74                                          | 103                                | 2,503                              | 2,680     |\n| Derivative investments                                       |                                             |                                    | 69                                 | 69        |\n| Other financial invested assets                              |                                             | 1                                  | 247                                | 248       |\n| Other financial liabilities                                  | (154)                                       |                                    | (217)                              | (371)     |\n| Total interest income (expense)                              | (80)                                        | 667                                | 5,738                              | 6,325     |\n| Dividend & other investment income:                          |                                             |                                    |                                    |           |\n| Equity securities                                            |                                             | -

When a hedging relationship is effective, gains, losses, revenue and expenses of the hedging instrument will offset the gains, losses, revenue and expenses of the hedged item. Derivatives used in hedging relationships are recorded in Derivative assets or Derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## 5.E.i Derivatives Held for Risk Management\n\nWe use other derivatives, not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship (\"Derivatives investments\"), to manage exposure to foreign currency, interest rate, and equity market. The instruments used include principally interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forward contracts, interest rate futures, interest rate options, credit and swaps and equity swaps.\n\nThe following table describes the fair value of derivatives held for risk management purposes by type of risk exposure.\n\n| As at December 31,                 | 2023     | 2023        | 2022     | 2022        |\n|------------------------------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|\n|                                    | Assets   | Liabilities | Assets   | Liabilities |\n| Interest rate contracts:           |          |             |          |             |\n| Designated in fair value hedges    | $  -     | $  -        | $  -     | $  -        |\n| Designed in cash flow hedges       | -        | -           | -        | -           |\n| Derivative investments             | 418      | (667)       | 704      | (1,138)     |\n| Total interest rate derivatives    | $  418   | $  (667)    | $  704   | $  (1,138)  |\n| Foreign exchange contracts:        |          |             |          |             |\n| Designated in fair value hedges    | $  -     | $  -        | $  -     | $  (1)      |\n| Designed in cash flow hedges       | 2        | (19)        | 9        | (20)        |\n| Derivative investments             | 1,674    | (614)       | 1,291    | (1,182)     |\n| Total foreign exchange derivatives | $  1,676 | $  (633)    | $  1,300 | $  (1,203)  |\n| Other contracts:                   |          |             |          |             |\n| Designated in fair value hedges    | $  -     | $  -        | $  -     | $  -        |\n| Designed in cash flow hedges       | 17       | -           | 9        | -           |\n| Derivative investments             | 72       | (11)        | 82       | (10)        |\n| Total other contracts              | $  89    | $  (11)     | $  91    | $  (10)     |\n| Total derivative contracts         | $  2,183 | $  (1,311)  | $  2,095 | $  (2,351)  |\n\nThe maturity analysis of the notional amounts and the average rates (or weighted average rates, if applicable) and prices of the hedging instruments are disclosed in Note 6.A.iv.\n\n## 5.E.ii Hedge Accounting\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nWe use interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to changes in the fair values of fixed rate debt securities and mortgages and loans in respect of the US LIBOR benchmark interest rate. Pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps are matched to specific issuances of fixed-rate notes or pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swaps are matched to fixed-rate loans and advances with terms that closely align with the critical terms of the hedged item.\n\nOur approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in Note 6. Our exposure to interest rate risk is disclosed in Note 6. Interest rate risk to which we apply hedge accounting arises from fixed-rate debt securities, mortgages and loans, whose fair value fluctuates when benchmark interest rates change. We hedge interest rate risk only to the extent of benchmark interest rates because the changes in fair value of a fixed rate note or loan are significantly influenced by changes in the benchmark interest rate. Hedge accounting is applied where economic hedging relationships meet the hedge accounting criteria. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, we are also exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty, which is not offset by the hedged",

We minimize counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade.\n\nBefore fair value hedge accounting is applied, we determine whether an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument exists based on an evaluation of the qualitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. We consider whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. We evaluate whether the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to similar risks, and further support this qualitative assessment by using regression analysis to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nPotential sources of hedge ineffectiveness can be attributed to differences between hedging instruments and hedge items:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of the counterparty and our own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the change in interest rate.\n- \u00b7 Differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or debt securities.\n- \u00b7 Mismatches in the frequency and timing of when interest rates are reset and frequency of payment.\n- \u00b7 Differences in the discounting factors between the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nThe effective portion of fair value gains on derivatives held in qualifying fair value hedging relationships and the hedging gain (loss) on the hedged items are included in net gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\nWe did not have any fair value hedges held as at December 31, 2023.\n\nAssets and liabilities designated as hedged items as at December 31, 2022 are provided below:\n\n## As at December 31, 2022\n\n|                       |                       |        |             | Accumulated amount of fair value  adjustments on the hedged item  included in the carrying amount   | Accumulated amount of fair value  adjustments on the hedged item  included in the carrying amount   | Accumulated amount of fair value  adjustments on the hedged item  included in the carrying amount   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hedging risks         | Hedged item           | Assets | Liabilities | Assets                                                                                              |                                                                                                     | Liabilities                                                                                         |\n| Interest rate risk    | Fixed rate assets (1) | $  -   | $  -        | $                                                                                                   | -                                                                                                   | $  -                                                                                                |\n| Foreign exchange risk | Fixed rate assets (1) | $  37  | $  -        | $                                                                                                   | -                                                                                                   | $  -                                                                                                |\n\nEffectiveness of hedging relationships are provided below:\n\n## As at December 31, 2022\n\n| Hedging risks         | Hedged item           | Changes in  value of the  hedged item   | Change in fair  value of hedging  instrument   | Hedge ineffectiveness recognized  in net investment income (loss)   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate risk    | Fixed rate assets (1) | $  -                                    | $  -                                           | $  -                                                                |\n| Foreign exchange risk | Fixed rate assets (1) | $  (2)                                  | $  3                                           | $  1                                                                |\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nWe use pay fixed/receive floating interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risks in respect of the benchmark interest rate (mainly sterling and US dollar LIBOR and Euribor or SONIA, SOFR) and foreign currency risks (mainly U.S. dollar and sterling or SONIA, SOFR) from its issuance of floating-rate notes denominated in foreign currencies. We hedge interest rate risk to the extent of benchmark interest rate exposure on its floating-rate notes to mitigate variability in its cash flows. Hedge accounting is applied where economic hedging relationships meet the hedge accounting criteria.\n\nWe also hedge the variability of cash payments associated with changes in SLFC prices using total return forwards (\"TRF\"). This is related to our Sun Share Unit (\"Sun Share\") Plan as a long-term incentive award to executive employees.\n\nOur exposure to market risk and our approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, are discussed in Note 6.\n\nWe determine the amount of the exposure to which it applies hedge accounting by assessing the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the future cash flows from its issuance of floating-rate notes denominated in foreign currencies. This assessment is performed using analytical techniques, such as cash flow sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe manage our exposure to credit risk of the counterparties to the derivatives, which is not offset by the hedged items, in a similar manner as described above for the fair value hedges.\n\nWe determine whether an economic relationship exists between the cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument based on an evaluation of the qualitative characteristics of these items and the hedged risk that is supported by quantitative analysis. We consider whether the critical terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument closely align when assessing the presence of an economic relationship. We evaluate whether the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument respond similarly to the hedged risk, such as the benchmark interest rate or foreign currency. For cash flow hedging relationships directly impacted by IBOR reform (i.e. hedges of U.S. dollar LIBOR and sterling LIBOR), we assume that the cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument will not be altered as a result of IBOR reform. We further support this qualitative assessment by using regression analysis to assess whether the hedging instrument is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the present value of the hedged item. We assess hedge effectiveness using the",

The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and our functional currency, which causes the amount of the net investment to vary in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so would be expected to have a significant impact on the regulatory capital ratios and our subsidiaries' operations. We use a mixture of forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments. When the hedging instrument is foreign currency denominated debt, we assess effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in the spot rate. We hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal; therefore, the hedge ratio is established by aligning the principal amount of the debt with the carrying amount of the net investment that is designated.\n\nWhen the hedging instrument is a forward foreign exchange contract, we establish a hedge ratio where the notional on the forward foreign exchange contract matches the carrying amount of the designated net investment, and ensure that the foreign currency in which the hedging instrument is denominated is the same as the functional currency of the net investment.",

These transferred financial assets are not derecognized and remain on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The carrying value of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities are described in the sections below.\n\n## 5.F.i Mortgage Securitization\n\nWe securitize certain insured fixed-rate commercial mortgages through the creation of mortgage-backed securities under the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (\"NHA MBS\") Program sponsored by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (\"CMHC\"). The NHA MBS are then sold to Canada Housing Trust, a government-sponsored security trust that issues securities to third-party investors under the Canadian Mortgage Bond (\"CMB\") program. The securitization of these assets does not qualify for derecognition as we have not transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Specifically, we continue to be exposed to pre-payment and interest rate risk associated with these assets. There is no ECL on the securitized mortgages, as the mortgages were already insured by the CMHC prior to securitization. These assets continue to be recognized as Mortgages and loans in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Proceeds from securitization transactions are recognized as secured borrowings and included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nReceipts of principal on the securitized mortgages are deposited into a principal reinvestment account (\"PRA\") to meet our repayment obligation upon maturity under the CMB program. The assets in the PRA are typically comprised of cash and cash equivalents and certain asset-backed securities. We are exposed to reinvestment risk due to the amortizing nature of the securitized mortgages relative to our repayment obligation for the full principal amount due at maturity. We mitigate this reinvestment risk using interest rate swaps.\n\nThe carrying value and fair value of the securitized mortgages as at December 31, 2023 are $1,792 and $1,697, respectively (December 31, 2022 - $1,926 and $1,793, respectively). The carrying value and fair value of the associated liabilities as at December 31, 2023 are $2,119 and $2,021, respectively (December 31, 2022 - $2,158 and $2,018, respectively). The carrying value of securities in the principal reinvestment account (''PRA'') as at December 31, 2023 is $335 (December 31, 2022 - $244). There are $57 cash and cash equivalents in the PRA as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $nil).\n\nThe fair value of the secured borrowings from mortgage securitization is based on the methodologies and assumptions for asset-backed securities described in Note 5.A.iii. The fair value of these liabilities is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## 5.F.ii Repurchase Agreements\n\nWe enter into repurchase agreements for operational funding and liquidity purposes. Repurchase agreements have maturities ranging from 8 to 365 days, averaging 100 days, and bear interest at an average rate of 4.86% as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - 3.90%). The carrying values of the transferred assets and the obligations related to their repurchase, which approximate their fair values, are $2,705 as at",

        "page_content": "December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $2,725). These liabilities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Collateral primarily consists of cash and cash equivalents as well as government guaranteed securities. Details on the collateral pledged are included in Note 6.A.ii.\n\n## 5.F.iii Securities Lending\n\nThe Company engages in securities lending to generate additional income. Certain securities from its portfolio are lent to other institutions for short periods. Collateral exceeding the fair value of the securities lent is deposited by the borrower with a lending agent, usually a securities custodian, and maintained by the lending agent until the underlying security has been returned to us. The fair value of the securities lent is monitored on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the fair values fluctuate. Collateral primarily consists of Canadian federal and provincial government securities and cash and cash equivalents. Certain arrangements allow us to invest the cash collateral received for the securities lent. The carrying values of the securities lent approximate their fair values. The carrying values of the securities lent and the related collateral held are $2,044 and $2,158 respectively, as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $2,202 and $2,322, respectively). Of the collateral held, we held cash collateral of $187 as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $215), which is recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n## 6. Financial Instrument Risk Management\n\nThe significant risks related to financial instruments are credit risk, market risk (including equity risk, real estate risk, interest rate and spread risk, foreign currency risk, and inflation risk) and liquidity risk.\n\nWe use derivative instruments to manage market risks related to equity market, interest rate and currency fluctuations and in replication strategies for permissible investments. We do not engage in speculative investment in derivatives. The gap in market sensitivities or exposures between liabilities and supporting assets is monitored and managed within defined tolerance limits, by using derivative instruments, where appropriate. We use models and techniques to measure the effectiveness of our risk management strategies.\n\n## 6.A Credit Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nCredit risk is the possibility of loss from amounts owed by our borrowers or financial counterparties. We are subject to credit risk in connection with issuers of securities held in our investment portfolio, debtors, structured securities, reinsurers, counterparties (including derivative, repurchase agreement and securities lending counterparties), other financial institutions and other entities. Losses may occur when a counterparty fails to make timely payments pursuant to the terms of the underlying contractual arrangement or when the counterparty's credit rating or risk profile otherwise deteriorates. Credit risk can also arise in connection with deterioration in the value of, or ability to realize, any underlying security that may be used as collateral for the debt obligation. Credit risk can occur as a result of broad economic conditions, challenges within specific sectors of the economy, or from issues affecting individual companies. Events that result in defaults, impairments or downgrades of the securities in our investment portfolio would cause the Company to record realized or unrealized losses and may cause an increase in our provisions for asset default, adversely impacting earnings.\n\n## Credit Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe rate fixed income investments primarily through the use of internally developed scorecards which combine an estimated probability of default and loss given default to determine an expected loss and credit risk rating. This rating is expressed using a 22-point scale that is generally consistent with those used by external rating agencies, and is based on detailed examination of the borrower's, or issuer's, credit quality and the characteristics of the specific instrument. The probability of default assessment is based on borrower-level or issuer-level analysis, which encompasses an assessment of industry risk, business strategy, competitiveness, strength of management and other financial information. The loss given default assessment is based on instrument-level analysis, which considers the impact of guarantees, covenants, liquidity and other structural features. These scorecards provide input to stochastic value-at-risk models and are used to stress test the portfolio, which provide insight into the distribution and characteristics of credit risk within our portfolios. In accordance with our policies and under normal circumstances, our ratings cannot be higher than the highest rating provided by certain Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\"NRSROs\"). Certain assets, including those in our sovereign debt and asset-backed securities portfolios, are assigned a rating based on ratings provided by NRSROs using a priority sequence order of Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS Limited.\n\nWe employ a wide range of credit risk management practices and controls, as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limits have been established for credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Income and regulatory capital sensitivities are monitored, managed and reported against pre-established risk limits.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive Investment and Credit Risk Management Policy, guidelines and practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 Specific investment diversification requirements are in place, such as defined investment limits for asset class, geography, and industry.\n- \u00b7 Risk-based credit portfolio, counterparty, and sector exposure limits have been established.\n- \u00b7 Mandatory use of credit quality ratings for portfolio investments has been established and is reviewed regularly. These internal rating decisions for new fixed income investments and ongoing review of existing rating decisions are independently adjudicated by Corporate Risk Management.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive due diligence processes and ongoing credit analyses are conducted.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory solvency requirements include risk-based capital requirements and are monitored regularly.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive compliance monitoring practices and procedures including reporting against pre-established investment limits are in place.\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance exposures are monitored to ensure that no single reinsurer represents an undue level of credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as Financial Condition Testing (\"FCT\"), are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse credit developments.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contract liabilities are established in accordance with Canadian actuarial standards of practice.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.",

The credit exposure for debt securities may be increased to the extent that the amounts recovered from default are insufficient to satisfy the actuarial liability cash flows that the assets are intended to support.\n\nThe positive fair value of derivative assets is used to determine the credit risk exposure if the counterparties were to default. The credit risk exposure is the cost of replacing, at current market rates, all derivative contracts with a positive fair value. Additionally, we have credit exposure to items not on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as follows:\n\n| As at December 31,      | 2023     | 2022     |\n|-------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Off-balance sheet item: |          |          |\n| Loan commitments (1)    | $  2,061 | $  2,217 |\n\n## 6.A.ii Right of Offset and Collateral\n\nWe invest in financial assets which may be secured by real estate properties, pools of financial assets, third-party financial guarantees, credit insurance, and other arrangements.\n\nFor OTC derivatives, collateral is collected from and pledged to counterparties to manage credit exposure according to the Credit Support Annex (\"CSA\"), which forms part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's (\"ISDA\") master agreements. It is common practice to execute a CSA in conjunction with an ISDA master agreement. Under the ISDA master agreements for OTC derivatives, we have a right of offset in the event of default, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other early termination. In the ordinary course of business, bilateral OTC exposures under these agreements are substantially mitigated through associated collateral agreements with a majority of our counterparties.\n\nFor exchange-traded derivatives subject to derivative clearing agreements with the exchanges and clearinghouses, there is no provision for set-off at default. Initial margin is excluded from the table below as it would become part of a pooled settlement process.\n\nFor repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, assets are sold or purchased with a commitment to resell or repurchase at a future date. Additional collateral may be pledged to or collected from counterparties to manage credit exposure according to bilateral repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements. In the event of default by a counterparty, we are entitled to liquidate the assets we hold as collateral to offset against obligations to the same counterparty.\n\nIn the case of securities lending or borrowing, assets are lent or borrowed with a commitment from or to the counterparty to return at a future date. For securities lending, cash or securities are received as collateral from the counterparty; for securities borrowing, debt securities are pledged as collateral to the counterparty. In the event of default by the counterparty, we are entitled to liquidate the assets we hold as collateral to offset against obligations to the same counterparty.",

a single debtor, a group of related debtors, or groups of debtors that have similar credit risk characteristics, such as groups of debtors in the same economic or geographic regions or in similar industries. Related issuers may have similar economic characteristics so that their ability to meet contractual obligations may be impacted similarly by changes in the economic or political conditions. We manage this risk by appropriately diversifying our investment portfolio through the use of concentration limits. In particular, we maintain policies which set counterparty exposure limits to manage the credit exposure for investments in any single issuer or to the same underlying credit. Exceptions exist for investments in securities which are issued or guaranteed by the Government of Canada, U.S. or UK and issuers for which the Risk Committee have granted specific approval. Mortgages are collateralized by the related property, and generally do not exceed 75% of the value of the property at the time the original loan is made. Our mortgages and loans are diversified by type and location and, for mortgages, by borrower. Loans provide diversification benefits (name, industry and geography) and often provide stronger covenants and collateral than public debt securities, thereby providing both better credit protection and potentially higher recoveries in the event of default. The following tables provide details of the debt securities, mortgages and loans held by issuer country, geographic location and industry sector, where applicable.\n\nThe carrying value of debt securities by geographic location is shown in the following table. The geographic location is based on the country of the creditor's parent.\n\n| As at December 31,    | 2023      | 2023      | 2023                   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                       | FVTPL     | FVOCI     | Total debt  securities | FVTPL                         | FVOCI                         | Total debt  securities        |\n| Canada                | $  30,180 | $  4,339  | $  34,519              | $  26,613                     | $  6,064                      | $  32,677                     |\n| United States         | 20,111    | 6,266     | 26,377                 | 20,274                        | 6,196                         | 26,470                        |\n| United Kingdom        | 1,224     | 517       | 1,741                  | 2,760                         | 737                           | 3,497                         |\n| Other                 | 9,665     | 3,191     | 12,856                 | 9,710                         | 3,548                         | 13,258                        |\n| Total debt securities | $  61,180 | $  14,313 | $  75,493              | $  59,357                     | $  16,545                     | $  75,902                     |",

We monitor credit quality based on internal ratings as well as ratings assigned by external rating agencies where available.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments by Counterparty Credit Rating\n\nDerivative instruments consist of bilateral OTC contracts negotiated directly between counterparties, OTC contracts cleared through central clearing houses or exchange-traded contracts. Since a counterparty failure in an OTC derivative transaction could render it ineffective for hedging purposes, we generally transact our derivative contracts with highly-rated counterparties. In limited circumstances, we enter into transactions with lower-rated counterparties if credit enhancement features are included.\n\nWe pledge and hold assets as collateral under CSAs for bilateral OTC derivative contracts. The collateral is realized in the event of early termination as defined in the agreements. The assets held and pledged are primarily cash and debt securities issued by the Canadian federal government and U.S. government and agencies. While we are generally permitted to sell or re-pledge the assets held as collateral, we have not sold or re-pledged any assets. Exchange-traded and cleared OTC derivatives require the posting of initial margin, as well as daily cash settlement of variation margin. The terms and conditions related to the use of the collateral are consistent with industry practice.\n\nFurther details on collateral held and pledged as well as the impact of netting arrangements are included in Note 6.A.ii.",

The purchaser receives protection against the decline in the value of the referenced financial instrument as a result of specified credit events such as default or bankruptcy. The seller receives a periodic premium in return for payment contingent on a credit event affecting the referenced financial instrument. CDS index contracts are those where the underlying referenced financial instruments are a group of assets. The Company enters into credit derivatives to replicate credit exposure of an underlying reference security and enhance investment returns. The credit risk ratings of the underlying reference securities for single name contracts were established in accordance with the internal rating process described in the Credit Risk Management Governance and Control section.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the credit default swap protection sold by credit rating of the underlying reference security:\n\n| As at December 31,                              | 2023             | 2023       | 2022             | 2022       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|------------|\n|                                                 | Notional  amount | Fair value | Notional  amount | Fair value |\n| Single name credit default swap contracts:      |                  |            |                  |            |\n| AA                                              | $  -             | $  -       | $  20            | $  -       |\n| A                                               | 491              | 5          | 587              | 4          |\n| BB                                              | 540              | 15         | 706              | 5          |\n| BBB                                             | -                | -          | 47               | 7          |\n| Total single name credit default swap contracts | $  1,031         | $  20      | $  1,360         | $  16      |\n| Total credit default swap contracts sold        | $  1,031         | $  20      | $  1,360         | $  16      |\n\n## Reinsurance Contract Held Assets by Credit Rating\n\nThe table below presents the distribution of reinsurance contract held assets by credit rating:\n\n| As at December 31,                      | 2023            | 2023       | 2023         | 2023   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                         | Gross  exposure | Collateral | Net exposure |        | Gross  exposure               | Collateral                    | Net exposure                  | Net exposure                  |\n|                                         |                 |            |              | %      |                               |                               |                               | %                             |\n| AA or A                                 | $  3,550        | $  7       | $  3,543     | 97     | $  3,600                      | $  31                         | $  3,569                      | 98                            |\n| Below 'A'                               | 2,217           | 2,135      | 82           | 2      | 2,423                         | 2,346                         | 77                            | 2                             |\n| Not rated                               | 27              | 5          | 22           | 1      | 92                            | 89                            | 3                             | -                             |\n| Total reinsurance  contract held assets | $  5,794        | $  2,147   | $  3,647     | 100    | $  6,115                      | $  2,466                      | $  3,649                      | 100                           |",

We assign counterparties a relevant internal credit risk rating grade depending on their credit quality. Changes in borrower-specific internal risk ratings is a primary indicator of significant increase in credit risk.\n\nAt each reporting date, movements between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are determined based on whether an instrument's internal rating as at the reporting date has increased (decreased) significantly relative to the date it was initially recognized. We assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for exposures since initial recognition by comparing the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life from the reporting date and the date of initial recognition. The assessment considers borrower-specific quantitative and qualitative information without consideration of collateral, and the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic factors. Unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when more than 30 days past due or moved to Watch List status and such assets are automatically migrated to Stage 2. Exposures are classified as \"Watch List\" when there is a moderate deterioration in credit quality, but the full payment of principal and interest is still expected to be collected, or there is an increased possibility of the exposure being impaired in the near term. No impairment charge is recorded for unrealized losses on assets related to these debtors.\n\n## Incorporation of forward-looking information\n\nThe measurement of ECL for each stage and the assessment of significant increase in credit risk considers future events and economic conditions.\n\nThe probability of default (\"PD\"), loss given default (\"LGD\") and exposure at default (\"EAD\") inputs used to estimate allowance for ECL are modelled based on the macroeconomic variables (or changes in macroeconomic variables) that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio.\n\nOur estimation of ECL is a discounted probability-weighted estimate that considers a minimum of three future macroeconomic scenarios (base case, upside and downside) and probability weights are attributed to each scenario. All scenarios considered are applied to all portfolios subject to ECL with the same probabilities. Our assessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on changes in internal rating as at the reporting date.\n\nWe subscribe to Moody's Analytics economic forecasting services and leverage its forward-looking macroeconomic information to model ECL.\n\nThe table below includes the key macroeconomic variables, primarily but not limited to what is provided below, and the ranges of scenarios incorporated in the model within the US and Canada.\n\nCurrent\n\n| As at December 31, 2023    | quarter   | 12 months (2)   | 12 months (2)   | 12 months (2)   | Remaining forecast period (2)   | Remaining forecast period (2)   | Remaining forecast period (2)   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                            |           | Base case       | Upside case     | Downside  case  | Base case                       | Upside case                     | Downside  case                  |\n| U.S.                       |           |                 |                 |                 |                                 |                                 |                                 |\n| Gross Domestic Product (1) | $  22,538 | 1.3 %           | 3.5 %           | (2.4) %         | 2.2 %                           | 2.4 %                           | 2.5 %                           |\n| Unemployment Rate          | 3.8 %     | 4.0 %           | 3.1 %           | 6.7 %           | 4.0 %                           | 3.3 %                           | 6.7 %                           |\n| BBB Bonds Spreads          | 1.9 %     | 2.2 %           | 1.9 %           | 3.1 %           | 2.1 %                           | 2.1 %                           | 2.1 %                           |\n| Canada                     |           |                 |                 |                 |                                 |                                 |                                 |\n| Gross Domestic Product (1) | $  2,201  | 1.6 %           | 3.6 %           | (2.1) %         | 1.9 %                           | 2.3 %                           | 1.6 %                           |\n| Unemployment Rate          | 5.8 %     | 6.0 %           | 5.2 %           | 8.2 %           | 5.9 %                           | 4.8 %                           | 8.6 %                           |\n| Oil Price                  | $  85.60  | $  82.10        | $  84.70        | $  65.60        | $  71.40                        | $  71.80                        | $  61.00                        |\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nECL is measured as the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls expected to result from defaults over the relevant time horizon, which is the maximum contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk, including consideration of prepayments, and extensions.\n\nThe mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are as follows: PD, LGD, and EAD.\n\nThe PD is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. It is estimated as at a point in time based on historical losses, along with consideration of economic scenarios and forward-looking information.\n\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default at a given time. It is based on the difference in the present values of the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realization of any collateral (net of directly attributable costs).\n\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. We derive the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract, including amortization, and prepayments.",

We employ a portfolio monitoring process to identify assets or groups of assets that have objective evidence of impairment, having experienced a loss event or events that have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset or group of assets. There are inherent risks and uncertainties in our evaluation of assets or groups of assets for objective evidence of impairment, including both internal and external factors such as general economic conditions, issuers' financial conditions and prospects for economic recovery, market interest rates, unforeseen events which affect one or more issuers or industry sectors, and portfolio management parameters, including asset mix, interest rate risk, portfolio diversification, duration matching, and greater than expected liquidity needs. All of these factors could impact our evaluation of an asset or group of assets for objective evidence of impairment.\n\nManagement exercises considerable judgment in assessing for objective evidence of impairment and, based on its assessment, classifies specific assets as either performing or into one of the following credit quality lists:\n\n\"Monitor List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specified cash flows is reasonably assured, but changes in issuer-specific facts and circumstances require monitoring. No impairment charge is recorded for unrealized losses on assets related to these debtors.\n\n\"Watch List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specified cash flows is reasonably assured, but changes in issuer-specific facts and circumstances require heightened monitoring. An asset is moved from the Monitor List to the Watch List when changes in issuer-specific facts and circumstances increase the possibility that a security may experience a loss event on an imminent basis. No impairment charge is recorded for unrealized losses on assets related to these debtors.\n\n\"Impaired List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specified cash flows is no longer reasonably assured. For these investments that are classified as FVOCI or amortized cost, an impairment charge is recorded or the asset is sold and a realized loss is recorded as a charge to income. Impairment charges and realized losses are recorded on assets related to these debtors.\n\nOur approach to determining whether there is objective evidence of impairment varies by asset type. However, we have a process to ensure that in all instances where a decision has been made to sell an asset at a loss, the asset is impaired.\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nObjective evidence of impairment on debt securities involves an assessment of the issuer's ability to meet current and future contractual interest and principal payments. In determining whether debt securities have objective evidence of impairment, we employ a screening process. The process identifies securities in an unrealized loss position, with particular attention paid to those securities whose fair value to amortized cost percentages have been less than 80% for an extended period of time. Discrete credit events, such as a ratings downgrade, are also used to identify securities that may have objective evidence of impairment. The securities identified are then evaluated based on issuerspecific facts and circumstances, including an evaluation of the issuer's financial condition and prospects for economic recovery, evidence of difficulty being experienced by the issuer's parent or affiliate, and management's assessment of the outlook for the issuer's industry sector.\n\nManagement also assesses previously impaired debt securities whose fair value has recovered to determine whether the recovery is objectively related to an event occurring subsequent to the impairment loss that has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset.\n\nAsset-backed securities are assessed for objective evidence of impairment. Specifically, we periodically update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. In the event that there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows, the asset is impaired.

Losses incurred on the respective mortgage-backed securities portfolios are based on loss models using assumptions about key systematic risks, such as unemployment rates and housing prices, and loanspecific information such as delinquency rates and loan-to-value ratios.\n\n## Mortgages and Loans\n\nObjective evidence of impairment on mortgages and loans involves an assessment of the borrower's ability to meet current and future contractual interest and principal payments. In determining whether objective evidence of impairment exists, we consider a number of factors including, but not limited to, the financial condition of the borrower and, for collateral dependent mortgages and loans, the fair value of the collateral.\n\nMortgages and loans causing concern are monitored closely and evaluated for objective evidence of impairment. For these mortgages and loans, we review information that is appropriate to the circumstances, including recent operating developments, strategy review, timelines for remediation, financial position of the borrower and, for collateral-dependent mortgages and loans, the value of security as well as occupancy and cash flow considerations.\n\nIn addition to specific allowances, circumstances may warrant a collective allowance based on objective evidence of impairment for a group of mortgages and loans. We consider regional economic conditions, developments for various property types, and significant exposure to struggling tenants in determining whether there is objective evidence of impairment for certain collateral dependent mortgages and loans, even though it is not possible to identify specific mortgages and loans that are likely to become impaired on an individual basis.\n\nManagement also assesses previously impaired mortgages and loans to determine whether a recovery is objectively related to an event occurring subsequent to the impairment loss that has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset.\n\n## Policy applicable prior to January 1, 2023 (IAS 39)\n\n## Equity Securities and Other Invested Assets\n\nObjective evidence of impairment for equity securities and investments in limited partnerships, segregated funds, and mutual funds involves an assessment of the prospect of recovering the cost of our investment. Instruments in an unrealized loss position are reviewed to determine if objective evidence of impairment exists. Objective evidence of impairment for these instruments includes, but is not limited to, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including information about significant changes with adverse effects that have taken place in the technological, market, economic, or legal environment in which the issuer operates, and a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the instruments below their cost.\n\nWe apply presumptive impairment tests to determine whether there has been a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an instrument below its cost, and unless extenuating circumstances exist, the instrument is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Impairment of Available-for-Sale Assets\n\nWe recognized net impairment losses on AFS assets of $8 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nWe did not reverse any impairment on AFS debt securities during 2022.\n\n## Past Due and Impaired Mortgages and Loans\n\nThe distribution of mortgages and loans past due or impaired is shown in the following table:\n\n| As at December 31, 2022   | Gross carrying value   | Gross carrying value   | Allowance for losses   | Allowance for losses   | Allowance for losses   | Allowance for losses   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                           | Mortgages              | Loans                  | Total                  | Mortgages              | Loans                  | Total                  |\n| Not past due              | $  15,360              | $  40,868              | $  56,228              | $  -                   | $  -                   | $  -                   |\n| Impaired                  | 80                     | 145                    | 225                    | 80                     | 112                    | 192                    |\n| Total                     | $  15,440              | $  41,013              | $  56,453              | $  80                  | $  112                 | $  192                 |\n\n## Debt Securities by Credit Rating\n\nInvestment grade debt securities are those rated BBB and above.

We use judgment and experience to determine what factors should be considered when assigning an internal credit rating, which is validated through the use of credit scoring models, to a particular mortgage or corporate loan. The internal credit ratings reflect the credit quality of the borrower as well as the value of any collateral held as security.\n\nThe following tables summarize our mortgages and loans by credit quality indicator:\n\n| As at December 31, 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | Insured   | AAA    | AA       | A         | BBB       | BB and  lower   | Impaired   | Total     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|------------|-----------|\n| Mortgages by credit rating                       | $  4,035  | $  -   | $  1,665 | $  5,483  | $  2,686  | $  538          | $  14      | $  14,421 |\n| Loans by credit rating                           | n/a       | $  285 | $  5,101 | $  15,257 | $  14,284 | $  1,872        | $  33      | $  36,832 |\n\n## 6.B Market Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWe are exposed to market risk, which is defined as the risk that the value or future cash flows of insurance and investment contract liabilities or financial assets will fluctuate because of changes or volatility in market prices. Market risk includes equity, interest rate and spread, real estate, foreign currency, and inflation risks.\n\n## Market Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe employ a wide range of market risk management practices and controls as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Income and regulatory capital sensitivities are monitored, managed, and reported against pre-established risk appetite limits for equity, interest rate, credit spread, real estate and foreign currency risks.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive asset-liability management and hedging policies, programs and practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory solvency requirements include risk-based capital requirements and are monitored regularly.\n- \u00b7 Product Design and Pricing Policy requires a detailed risk assessment and pricing provisions for material risks.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as FCT, are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse market movements.\n- \u00b7 Insurance contract liabilities are established in accordance with Canadian actuarial standards of practice and International Financial Reporting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n\nSpecific market risks and our risk management strategies are discussed below in further detail.\n\n## 6.B.i Equity Risk\n\nEquity risk is the potential for financial loss arising from declines or volatility in equity market prices. We are exposed to equity risk from a number of sources.\n\nWe generate revenue in our asset management businesses and from certain insurance and annuity contracts where fees are levied on account balances that are affected directly by equity market levels. Accordingly, we have further exposure to equity risk as adverse fluctuations in the market value of such assets will result in corresponding adverse impacts on revenue and income. In addition, declining and volatile equity markets may have a negative impact on sales and redemptions (surrenders) in these businesses, and this may result in further adverse impacts on net income.\n\nA portion of our exposure to equity risk arises in connection with benefit guarantees on segregated fund products, some participating insurance contracts, some adjustable insurance contracts, and some universal life contracts. These benefit guarantees may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. The cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors, including general capital market conditions, our hedging strategies, policyholder behaviour and mortality experience, each of which may result in negative impacts on net income.\n\nWe also have direct exposure to equity markets from the investments supporting other general account liabilities, surplus, and employee benefit plans. These exposures fall within our risk-taking philosophy and appetite, and are therefore generally not hedged.\n\nThe carrying value of equities by issuer country is shown in the following table:\n\n| As at December 31,   | 2023     | 2023   | 2023           | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   | 2022 (restated, see Note 2)   |\n|----------------------|----------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                      | FVTPL    | FVOCI  | Total equities | FVTPL                         | FVOCI                         | Total equities                |\n| Canada               | $  3,081 | $  -   | $  3,081       | $  3,038                      | $  -                          | $  3,038                      |\n| United States        | 2,185    | 68     | 2,253          | 1,924                         | -                             | 1,924                         |\n| United Kingdom       | 105      | -      | 105            | 154                           | -                             | 154                           |\n| Other                | 1,699    | -      | 1,699          | 2,032                         | -                             | 2,032                         |\n| Total equities       | $  7,070 | $  68  | $  7,138       | $  7,148                      | $  -                          | $  7,148                      |",

        "page_content": "## 6.B.ii Interest Rate and Spread Risk\n\nInterest rate and spread risk includes the potential for financial loss arising from changes in the value of insurance and investment contract liabilities and financial assets due to changes or volatility in interest rates or spreads. In practice, when asset cash flows and the policy obligations they support are not matched, this may result in the need to either sell assets to meet policy payments and expenses or reinvest excess asset cash flows in unfavourable interest rate or credit spread environments. This risk is managed in our asset-liability management program.\n\nOur primary exposure to interest rate and spread risk arises from insurance and investment contracts that contain guarantees in the form of minimum crediting rates, maximum premium rates, settlement options, guaranteed annuitization options and minimum benefits. If investment returns fall below guaranteed levels, we may be required to increase liabilities or capital in respect of these contracts. The guarantees attached to these products may be applicable to both past premiums collected and future premiums not yet received. Segregated fund contracts provide benefit guarantees that are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death, maturity, withdrawal or annuitization. Exposure to guarantees is managed within our risk appetite limits through our asset-liability management program, which may include the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors, swaps, futures and swaptions. The impact of these guarantees on net income are included in the disclosed market risk sensitivities.\n\nSignificant changes or volatility in interest rates or spreads could have a negative impact on sales of certain insurance and annuity products, and adversely impact the expected pattern of redemptions (surrenders) on existing policies. Increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads may increase the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts, potentially forcing us to liquidate assets at a loss. While we have established hedging programs in place and our insurance and annuity products often contain surrender mitigation features, these may not be sufficient to fully offset the adverse impact of changes in interest rates or spreads. Declines in interest rates or narrowing spreads can result in compression of the net spread between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders. Declines in interest rates or narrowing spreads can also result in increased asset calls, mortgage prepayments, and net reinvestment of positive cash flows at lower yields, and therefore adversely impact our profitability and financial position. Negative interest rates may additionally result in losses on our cash and short-term deposits and low or negative returns on our fixed income assets impacting our profitability.\n\nWe also have direct exposure to interest rates and spreads from investments supporting other general account liabilities, surplus and employee benefit plans. Higher interest rates or wider spreads will reduce the value of our existing assets. Conversely, lower interest rates or a narrowing of spreads will result in reduced investment income on new fixed income asset purchases. These exposures fall within our risktaking philosophy and appetite and are therefore generally not hedged.\n\nA sustained low interest rate environment may additionally adversely impact our net income, CSM, capital, and our ability to implement our business strategy and plans. This may be realized through lower sales, less profitable new business, changes in the pattern of redemptions on existing policies, among other impacts.\n\n## 6.B.iii Real Estate Risk\n\nReal estate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from fluctuations in the value of, or future cash flows from, our investments in real estate. We are exposed to real estate risk and may experience financial losses resulting from the direct ownership of real estate investments or indirectly through fixed income investments secured by real estate property, leasehold interests, ground rents, and purchase and leaseback transactions. Real estate price risk may arise from external market conditions, inadequate property analysis, inadequate insurance coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals, or from environmental risk exposures. We hold real estate investments that support general account liabilities and surplus, and fluctuations in value will affect our net income. A material and sustained increase in interest rates may lead to deterioration in real estate values.\n\n## 6.B.iv Foreign Currency Risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the result of mismatches in the currency of our assets and liabilities (inclusive of capital), and cash flows. This risk may arise from a variety of sources such as foreign currency transactions and services, foreign currency hedging, investments denominated in foreign currencies, investments in foreign subsidiaries and net income from foreign operations. Changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates, including a change to currencies that are fixed in value to another currency, could adversely affect our net income.\n\nAs an international provider of financial services, we operate in a number of countries, with revenues and expenses denominated in several local currencies. In each country in which we operate, we generally maintain the currency profile of assets to match the currency of liabilities and required capital. This approach provides an operational hedge against disruptions in local operations caused by currency fluctuations. Foreign currency derivative contracts such as currency swaps and forwards are used as a risk management tool to manage the currency exposure in accordance with our Asset Liability Management Policy. As at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have a material foreign currency risk exposure.\n\nChanges in exchange rates can affect our net income and surplus when financial results in functional currencies are translated into Canadian dollars. Net income earned outside of Canada is generally not currency hedged and a weakening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the Canadian dollar can have a negative impact on our net income reported in Canadian currency. A strengthening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the Canadian dollar would have the opposite effect. Regulatory capital ratios could also be impacted by changes in exchange rates.\n\n## 6.B.v Inflation Risk\n\nInflation risk is the potential for financial loss arising from changes in inflation rates. This risk results from insurance contract liabilities that are linked to market measures of inflation such as the Consumer Price Index. The primary sources for this risk exposure are from certain group and retail annuity contracts and group long term disability contracts. In these contracts, the annuity and disability benefit payments may be linked to an indexing formula containing an inflation price index. Benefit payments linked to inflation indices may also include various caps, floors and averaging mechanisms that vary across product designs.\n\nExposure to inflation risk is managed within our asset-liability management program, primarily by investing in inflation linked assets to match liability exposures.",

        "page_content": "## 6.B.vi Market Risk Sensitivities\n\nWe use a variety of methods and measures to manage and quantify our market risk exposures. These include duration and key rate duration management, convexity measures, cash flow gap analysis, scenario testing, and sensitivity testing of earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe measurement of liabilities and assets are affected by the level of equity market performance, interest rates, credit and swap spreads and other market risk variables. The following sections set out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income and OCI to certain instantaneous changes in market variables as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe estimated sensitivities in the tables below reflect the impact of market movements on insurance contracts and investment contracts, assets backing insurance contracts, assets backing investment contracts, assets backing the surplus segment, and seed investments in our asset management subsidiaries.\n\nNet income sensitivities to equity and real estate market movements are driven primarily by changes in the value of investments backing general account liabilities and surplus. Net income sensitivities to interest rates and spreads are driven by the net impact on liabilities and the assets backing them. Lower interest rates or a narrowing of spreads will result in increased liabilities for insurance contracts, offset by increased values of the assets backing general account liabilities. Higher interest rates or a widening of spreads will result in decreased liabilities for insurance contracts, offset by decreased values of the assets backing general account liabilities. Further detail on the impact of changes or volatility in market prices on assets and liabilities is provided under the headings \"Equity Risk\", \"Interest Rate and Spread Risk\", and \"Real Estate Risk\" above.\n\nOCI sensitivities are impacted by changes in the market value of assets classified as FVOCI. The market value of FVOCI fixed income assets, which are held primarily in our surplus and investment contract segments, increases with lower interest rates or a narrowing of spreads, and decreases with higher interest rates or a widening of spreads.\n\nAs these market risk sensitivities reflect an instantaneous impact on net income and OCI, they do not include impacts over time such as the effect on fee income in our asset management businesses.\n\nRefer to Additional Cautionary Language and Key Assumptions Related to Sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates.\n\n## Equity Market Sensitivities\n\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, our net income and OCI to certain instantaneous changes in equity market prices as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n| As at                                       | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022 (4) (restated, see Note 2)   | December 31, 2022 (4) (restated, see Note 2)   | December 31, 2022 (4) (restated, see Note 2)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Change in Equity Markets (1)(2)(3)          | 25%  decrease       | 10%  decrease       | 10%  increase       | 25%  increase       | 25% decrease        | 10%  decrease                                  | 10%  increase                                  | 25%  increase                                  |\n| Potential impact on net income  (after-tax) | $  (400)            | $  (175)            | $  175              | $  425              | $  (300)            | $  (125)                                       | $  125                                         | $  325                                         |",

These sensitivities are calculated independently for each risk factor, generally assuming that all other risk variables stay constant. The sensitivities do not take into account indirect effects such as potential impacts on goodwill impairment or valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\nWe have provided measures of our net income sensitivity to instantaneous changes in equity markets, interest rates, credit spreads, swap spreads, and real estate price levels. The cautionary language which appears in this section is applicable to all net income and OCI sensitivities.\n\nActual results can differ materially from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including differences in the pattern or distribution of the market shocks, the interaction between these risk factors, model error, or changes in other assumptions such as business mix, effective tax rates, policyholder behaviour, currency exchange rates and other market variables relative to those underlying the calculation of these sensitivities. The extent to which actual results may differ from the indicative ranges will generally increase with larger movements in risk variables. Our sensitivities as at December 31, 2022 have been included for comparative purposes only.\n\nSensitivities to interest rates and credit spreads assume a parallel shift in assumed interest rates across the entire yield curve or a parallel shift in the indicated spreads across the entire term structure, with no change to the ultimate risk-free rate or ultimate liquidity premium. Realized sensitivities may be significantly differently from those illustrated based on factors such as different terms to maturity, geographies, asset classes and derivative types, and ratings.\n\nThe sensitivities reflect the composition of our assets and liabilities as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Changes in these positions due to new sales or maturities, asset purchases/sales, or other management actions could result in material changes to these reported sensitivities. In particular, these sensitivities reflect the expected impact of hedging activities based on the hedging programs in place as at the December 31 calculation dates. The actual impact of hedging activity can differ materially from that assumed in the estimated sensitivities due to ongoing hedge re-balancing activities, changes in the scale or scope of hedging activities, changes in the cost or general availability of hedging instruments, basis risk (i.e., the risk that hedges do not exactly replicate the underlying portfolio experience), model risk, and other operational risks in the ongoing management of the hedge programs or the potential failure of hedge counterparties to perform in accordance with expectations.\n\nOur hedging programs may themselves expose us to other risks, including basis risk, volatility risk, and increased levels of derivative counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk, model risk and other operational risks. These factors may adversely impact the net effectiveness, costs, and financial viability of maintaining these hedging programs and therefore adversely impact our profitability and financial position. While our hedging programs are intended to mitigate these effects (e.g., hedge counterparty credit risk is managed by maintaining broad diversification, dealing primarily with highly-rated counterparties, and transacting through OTC contracts cleared through central clearing houses, exchange-traded contracts or bilateral OTC contracts negotiated directly between counterparties that include credit support annexes), residual risk, potential reported earnings and capital volatility remain.\n\nThe sensitivities are based on methods and assumptions in effect as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as applicable. Changes in the regulatory environment, assumptions or methods used to measure assets and liabilities after those dates could result in material changes to the estimated sensitivities. Changes in market risk variables in excess of the changes illustrated may result in other than proportionate impacts.\n\nThe sensitivities reflect the CSM as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. For insurance contracts measured using the VFA, where the change in the effect of the time value of money and financial risk not arising from the underlying items adjusts the CSM, changes in the CSM balance will affect the sensitivity of income to changes in market risk variables.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, our sensitivities should only be viewed as indicative estimates of the underlying sensitivities of each factor under these specialized assumptions, and should not be viewed as predictors of our future income and OCI. Given the nature of these calculations, we cannot provide assurance that actual impacts will be consistent with the estimates provided.",

        "page_content": "## 6.C Liquidity Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will not be able to fund all cash outflow commitments and collateral requirements as they fall due. This includes the risk of being forced to sell assets at depressed prices resulting in realized losses on sale. This risk also includes restrictions on our ability to efficiently allocate capital among our subsidiaries due to various market and regulatory constraints on the movement of funds. Our funding obligations arise in connection with the payment of policyholder benefits, expenses, reinsurance settlements, asset purchases, investment commitments, interest on debt, and dividends on common and preferred shares. Sources of available cash flow include general fund premiums and deposits, investment related inflows (such as maturities, principal repayments, investment income and proceeds of asset sales), proceeds generated from financing activities, and dividends and interest payments from subsidiaries. We have various financing transactions and derivative contracts under which we may be required to pledge collateral or to make payments to our counterparties for the decline in market value of specified assets. The amount of collateral or payments required may increase under certain circumstances (such as changes to interest rates, credit spreads, equity markets or foreign exchange rates), which could adversely affect our liquidity.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe generally maintain a conservative liquidity position and employ a wide range of liquidity risk management practices and controls, which are described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity is managed in accordance with our Asset Liability Management Policy and operating guidelines.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity contingency plans are maintained for the management of liquidity in a liquidity event.\n- \u00b7 Stress testing is performed by comparing liquidity coverage risk metrics under a one-month stress scenario to our policy thresholds. These liquidity coverage risk metrics are measured and managed at the enterprise and legal entity levels.\n- \u00b7 Stress testing of our collateral is performed by comparing collateral coverage ratios to our policy thresholds.\n- \u00b7 Cash Management and asset-liability management programs support our ability to maintain our financial position by ensuring that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to cover potential funding requirements. We invest in various types of assets with a view of matching them to our liabilities of various durations.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels. Actual capital levels are monitored to ensure they exceed internal targets.\n- \u00b7 We actively manage and monitor our capital and asset levels, and the diversification and credit quality of our investments.\n- \u00b7 Various credit facilities for general corporate purposes are maintained.\n\nWe are subject to various regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ability of SLF Inc.'s subsidiaries to pay dividends and transfer funds is regulated in certain jurisdictions and may require local regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of specific conditions in certain circumstances. Through effective cash management and capital planning, SLF Inc. ensures that its subsidiaries, as a whole and on a stand-alone basis, are properly funded and maintain adequate liquidity to meet obligations, both individually and in aggregate.\n\nBased on our historical cash flows and liquidity management processes, we believe that the cash flows from our operating activities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for us to satisfy debt service obligations and to pay other expenses as they fall due.",

These cash flows include estimates related to the timing and payment of death and disability claims, policy surrenders, policy maturities, annuity payments, minimum guarantees on segregated fund products, policyholder dividends, amounts on deposit, commissions and premium taxes offset by contractual future premiums and fees on in-force contracts. These estimated cash flows are based on the best estimated assumptions used in the determination of insurance contract and reinsurance contract held assets and liabilities. Due to the use of assumptions, actual cash flows will differ from these estimates. Amounts payable on demand, which includes amounts on deposit, dividends on deposit, outstanding claims and policyholder account values, are included in the 1 year or less time band. The amounts included in the table differ from the carrying value of the portfolio due to discounting, RA, and LRC for contracts using the PAA.\n\nAmounts in this table include the LIC for contracts measured using the PAA, but exclude the LRC for contracts measured using the PAA.\n\n| As at December 31,                     | 2023        | 2022        |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Insurance contract liabilities:        |             |             |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $  11,428   | $  11,980   |\n| 1-2 years                              | 3,670       | 4,111       |\n| 2-3 years                              | 3,887       | 4,018       |\n| 3-4 years                              | 4,128       | 4,278       |\n| 4-5 years                              | 4,451       | 4,511       |\n| Over 5 years                           | 556,052     | 469,366     |\n| Total                                  | $ 583,616   | $ 498,264   |\n| Insurance contract assets:             |             |             |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $  (463)    | $  (324)    |\n| 1-2 years                              | (323)       | (341)       |\n| 2-3 years                              | (276)       | (287)       |\n| 3-4 years                              | (248)       | (254)       |\n| 4-5 years                              | (225)       | (234)       |\n| Over 5 years                           | (3,305)     | (3,753)     |\n| Total                                  | $  (4,840)  | $  (5,193)  |\n| Reinsurance contract held liabilities: |             |             |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $  140      | $  132      |\n| 1-2 years                              | 83          | 80          |\n| 2-3 years                              | 88          | 86          |\n| 3-4 years                              | 91          | 89          |\n| 4-5 years                              | 95          | 94          |\n| Over 5 years                           | 5,036       | 5,085       |\n| Total                                  | $  5,533    | $  5,566    |\n| Reinsurance contract held assets:      |             |             |\n| 1 year or less (1)                     | $  (520)    | $  (684)    |\n| 1-2 years                              | (54)        | (20)        |\n| 2-3 years                              | (69)        | (31)        |\n| 3-4 years                              | (105)       | (66)        |\n| 4-5 years                              | (130)       | (104)       |\n| Over 5 years                           | (11,330)    | (12,102)    |\n| Total                                  | $  (12,208) | $  (13,007) |",

Insurance Risk Management\n\n## 7.A Insurance Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nInsurance risk is the uncertainty of product performance due to actual experience emerging differently than expected in the areas of mortality, morbidity and longevity. In addition, policyholder behaviour, product design and pricing, expense and reinsurance risks impact multiple risk categories, including insurance risk.\n\n## Insurance Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe employ a wide range of insurance risk management practices and controls, as outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance risk governance practices are in place, including independent monitoring and review and reporting to senior management and the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Income and regulatory capital sensitivities are monitored, managed and reported against pre-established risk appetite limits for policyholder behaviour, mortality, morbidity and longevity risks.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive Insurance Risk Policy, guidelines and practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 The global underwriting manual aligns underwriting practices with our corporate risk management standards and ensures a consistent approach in insurance underwriting.\n- \u00b7 Board-approved maximum retention limits are in place. Amounts issued in excess of these limits are reinsured.\n- \u00b7 Detailed procedures, including criteria for approval of risks and for claims adjudication are established and monitored for each business segment.\n- \u00b7 Underwriting and risk selection standards and procedures are established and overseen by the corporate underwriting and claims risk management function.\n- \u00b7 Diversification and risk pooling is managed by aggregation of exposures across product lines, geography and distribution channels.\n- \u00b7 We use reinsurance to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks and to provide additional capacity for growth.\n- \u00b7 The Insurance Risk Policy and Investment & Credit Risk Policy establish acceptance criteria and protocols to monitor the level of reinsurance ceded to any single reinsurer or group of reinsurers.\n- \u00b7 Reinsurance counterparty risk is monitored, including annual reporting of reinsurance exposure to the Risk Committee.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Various limits, restrictions and fee structures are introduced into plan designs in order to establish a more homogeneous policy risk profile and limit potential for anti-selection.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory solvency requirements include risk-based capital requirements and are monitored regularly.\n- \u00b7 The Product Design and Pricing Policy requires detailed risk assessment and pricing provision for material risks.\n- \u00b7 Company specific and industry level experience studies and drivers of earnings analysis are monitored and factored into valuation, renewal and new business pricing processes.\n- \u00b7 Stress-testing techniques, such as Financial Condition Testing (FCT), are used to measure the effects of large and sustained adverse movements in insurance risk factors.\n- \u00b7 Internal capital targets are established at an enterprise level to cover all risks and are above minimum regulatory and supervisory levels.\n\nThe concentration for insurance risks is monitored geographically and its adverse effect is mitigated through a diversified product portfolio, product design, underwriting standards and practices, utilizing reinsurance as well as the Company's global operation. Specific to the reinsurance risk, the concentration is measured by aggregating the exposure to each reinsurance counterparty across all Business Groups to ensure it does not exceed a predefined risk level.\n\nSpecific insurance risks and our risk management strategies are discussed below in further detail.\n\n## 7.A.i Policyholder Behaviour Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWe can incur losses due to adverse policyholder behaviour relative to the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products regarding lapse of policies or exercise of other embedded policy options.\n\nUncertainty in policyholder behaviour can arise from several sources including unexpected events in the policyholder's life circumstances, the general level of economic activity (whether higher or lower than expected), changes in the financial and capital markets, changes in pricing and availability of current products, the introduction of new products, changes in underwriting technology and standards, as well as changes in our financial strength or reputation. Uncertainty in future cash flows affected by policyholder behaviour can be further exacerbated by unexpected behaviour during times of economic turbulence or at key option exercise points in the life of an insurance contract.\n\n## Policyholder Behaviour Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nVarious types of provisions are built into many of our products to reduce the impact of uncertain policyholder behaviour. These provisions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Surrender charges that adjust the payout to the policyholder by taking into account prevailing market conditions.\n- \u00b7 Limits on the amount that policyholders can surrender or borrow.\n- \u00b7 Restrictions on the timing of policyholders' ability to exercise certain options.\n- \u00b7 Restrictions on both the types of funds policyholders can select and the frequency with which they can change funds.\n- \u00b7 Policyholder behaviour risk is also mitigated through reinsurance on some insurance contracts.\n\nInternal experience studies are used to monitor, review and update policyholder behaviour assumptions as needed, which could result in updates to policy liabilities.\n\n## 7.A.ii Mortality and Morbidity Risk\n\nMortality and morbidity risk is the risk that future experience could be unfavourable relative to the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products. Mortality and morbidity risk can arise in the normal course of business through random fluctuation in realized experience, through catastrophes, as a result of a pandemic, or in association with other risk factors such as product development and pricing risk. Adverse mortality and morbidity experience could also occur through systemic anti-selection, which could arise due to poor plan design, or underwriting process failure or the development of investor-owned and secondary markets for life insurance policies.\n\nExternal factors could adversely affect our life insurance, health insurance, critical illness, disability, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses. Morbidity experience could be unfavourably impacted by external events, such as pandemics, increases in disability claims during economic slowdowns and increases in high medical treatment costs and growth in utilization of specialty drugs. This introduces the potential for adverse financial results.\n\n## Mortality and Morbidity Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nDetailed uniform underwriting procedures have been established to determine the insurability of applicants and to manage exposure to large claims. These underwriting requirements are regularly scrutinized against industry guidelines and oversight is provided through a corporate underwriting and claim management function.\n\nThe Insurance Risk Policy, which is approved by the Risk Committee, sets out limits on the maximum amount of insurance risk per life that may be retained. Amounts in excess of the Board-approved maximum retention limits are reinsured. On a single life or joint-first-to-die basis our retention limit is $40 in Canada and US$40 outside of Canada. For survivorship life insurance, our maximum global retention limit is $50 in Canada and US$50 outside of Canada. In certain markets and jurisdictions, retention levels below the maximum are applied. Reinsurance is utilized for numerous products in most business segments, and placement is done on an automatic basis for defined insurance portfolios and on a facultative basis for individual risks with certain characteristics.\n\nConcentration risk exposure is monitored on group policies in a single location. We do not have a high degree of concentration risk to single individuals or groups due to our well-diversified geographic and business mix. The largest portion of mortality risk within the Company is in North America. Individual and group insurance policies are underwritten prior to initial issue and renewals, based on risk selection, plan design, and rating techniques.\n\nRetention limits per life vary by geographic region and amounts in excess of limits are reinsured to ensure there is no exposure to unreasonable concentration of risk.",

        "page_content": "## 7.A.iii Longevity Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nLongevity risk is the potential for losses arising from adverse changes in rates of mortality improvement relative to the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products. This risk can manifest itself slowly over time as socioeconomic conditions improve and medical advances continue. It could also manifest itself more quickly, for example, due to medical breakthroughs that significantly extend life expectancy. Longevity risk affects contracts where benefits or costs are based upon the likelihood of survival and higher than expected improvements in insured life expectancy could therefore increase the ultimate cost of these benefits (for example, annuities, pensions, pure endowments, some segregated funds, and specific types of health contracts).\n\n## Longevity Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nTo improve management of longevity risk, we monitor research in the fields that could result in a change in expected mortality improvement. Stress-testing techniques are used to measure and monitor the impact of extreme mortality improvement on the aggregate portfolio of insurance and annuity products.\n\n## 7.A.iv Product Design and Pricing Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nProduct design and pricing risk is the risk a product does not perform as expected, causing adverse financial consequences. This risk may arise from deviations in realized experience versus assumptions used in the pricing of products. Risk factors include uncertainty concerning future investment yields, policyholder behaviour, mortality and morbidity experience, sales levels, mix of business, expenses and taxes. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the terms of these policies or contracts may not allow for sufficient adjustments to maintain expected profitability. This could have an adverse effect on our profitability and capital position.\n\n## Product Design and Pricing Governance and Control\n\nOur Product Design and Pricing Policy, approved by the Risk Committee, establishes the framework governing our product design and pricing practices and is designed to align our product offerings with our strategic objectives and risk-taking philosophy. Consistent with this policy, product development, design and pricing processes have been implemented throughout the Company. New products follow a stage-gate process with defined management approvals based on the significance of the initiative. Each initiative is subject to a risk assessment process to identify key risks and risk mitigation requirements and is reviewed by multiple stakeholders. Additional governance and control procedures are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Pricing models, methods, and assumptions are subject to periodic internal peer reviews.\n- \u00b7 Experience studies, drivers of earnings analysis, and product dashboards are used to monitor actual experience against those assumed in pricing and valuation.\n- \u00b7 On experience rated, participating, and adjustable products, emerging experience is reflected through changes in policyholder dividend scales as well as other policy adjustment mechanisms such as premium and benefit levels.\n- \u00b7 Limits and restrictions may be introduced into the design of products to mitigate adverse policyholder behaviour or apply upper thresholds on certain benefits.\n\n## 7.A.v Expense Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nExpense risk is the risk that future expenses are higher than the assumptions used in the pricing and valuation of products. This risk can arise from general economic conditions, unexpected increases in inflation, slower than anticipated growth, or reduction in productivity leading to increases in unit expenses. Expense risk occurs in products where we cannot or will not pass increased costs onto the policyholder and will manifest itself in the form of a liability increase or a reduction in expected future profits.\n\n## Expenses Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe closely monitor expenses through an annual budgeting process and ongoing monitoring of any expense gaps between unit expenses assumed in pricing and actual expenses.\n\n## 7.A.vi Reinsurance Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various insurance businesses. Reinsurance risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse developments in reinsurance markets (for example, discontinuance or diminution of reinsurance capacity, or an increase in the cost of reinsurance), insolvency of a reinsurer or inadequate reinsurance coverage. While reinsurance arrangements provide for the recovery of claims arising from the liabilities ceded, we retain primary responsibility to the policyholders.\n\nRates for our in-force reinsurance treaties can be either guaranteed or adjustable for the life of the ceded policy. Changes in reinsurance market conditions, including actions taken by reinsurers to increase rates on existing and new coverage and our ability to obtain appropriate reinsurance, may adversely impact the availability or cost of maintaining existing or securing new reinsurance capacity, with adverse impacts on our business strategies, profitability and financial position. There is a possibility of rate increases or renegotiation of some of the legacy reinsurance contracts by our reinsurers, as the global reinsurance industry continues to review and optimize their business models. In addition, changes to the regulatory treatment of reinsurance arrangements could have an adverse impact on our capital position.\n\n## Reinsurance Risk Management Governance and Control\n\nWe have an Insurance Risk Policy approved by the Risk Committee and an Investment & Credit Risk Policy approved by the Governance, Investment & Sustainability Committee, which set acceptance criteria and processes to monitor and manage the level of reinsurance ceded to any single reinsurer. These policies are regularly reviewed and approved by the relevant Board Committee to ensure the alignment with our risk appetite levels and reinsurance risk guidelines.",

        "page_content": "The policies set the acceptance criteria which verify if a reinsurer qualifies as a suitable reinsurance counterparty, having the capability, expertise, governance practices and financial capacity to assume the risks being considered. In addition, a periodic due diligence is performed on the existing reinsurance counterparties, including an internal credit assessment for reinsurance counterparties with whom we have material exposure.\n\nThe exposure to each reinsurance counterparty is monitored closely to ensure that no single reinsurance counterparty represents an undue level of credit risk and does not exceed the predefined limits. In order to diversify our reinsurance risk, there is generally more than one reinsurance counterparty supporting a reinsurance pool. A summary of the reinsurance counterparty credit risk exposures is reported annually to the Risk Committee.\n\nTo further increase the reinsurance risk control, our reinsurance agreements include provisions to allow actions to be taken, such as recapture of ceded risk (at a potential cost to the Company), in the event that the reinsurance counterparty loses its legal ability to carry on business through insolvency or regulatory action.\n\nIn case of unfavourable developments in the reinsurance markets, we also have an option to discontinue or implement changes to the new sales of our products to better manage the associated risks.\n\n## 7.B Sensitivity to Changes in Non-Financial Assumptions\n\nThe following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on, or sensitivity of, the CSM and net income to certain instantaneous changes in the insurance and other non-financial assumptions used in the calculation of our insurance contract liabilities, based on a starting point and business mix as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These sensitivities are calculated independently for each risk factor, generally assuming that all other risk variables stay constant. The estimates are illustrative and different starting points for best estimate assumptions, CSM balances and business mix will result in different estimated sensitivities.\n\nThe impact on CSM is attributable to insurance contracts measured using the GMA and VFA. For insurance contracts measured using the GMA, the impact flows through the CSM at locked-in discount rates. For insurance contracts measured using the VFA, the impact flows through the CSM at current discount rates.\n\nThe impact on net income is attributable to any portion of the sensitivities for insurance contracts measured under GMA and VFA that cannot be absorbed by CSM, the full impact for insurance contracts measured under the PAA, and the difference in impact between lockedin and current discount rates for insurance contracts measured using the GMA. If current discount rates are higher than locked-in rates, this generally results in a favourable impact to net income from contracts measured using the GMA.\n\n| As at December 31,                                                    | 2023                               | 2023                                 | 2023                                                | 2023                                                | 2022                               | 2022                                 | 2022                                                | 2022                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Potential impact on  CSM (pre-tax) | Potential impact on  CSM (pre-tax)   | Potential impact on  net income/equity  (after-tax) | Potential impact on  net income/equity  (after-tax) | Potential impact on  CSM (pre-tax) | Potential impact on  CSM (pre-tax)   | Potential impact on  net income/equity  (after-tax) | Potential impact on  net income/equity  (after-tax) |\n| Sensitivities (1)                                                     | Insurance  contracts  issued       | Net of  reinsurance  contracts  held | Insurance  contracts  issued                        | Net of  reinsurance  contracts  held                | Insurance  contracts  issued       | Net of  reinsurance  contracts  held | Insurance  contracts  issued                        | Net of  reinsurance  contracts  held                |\n| Policyholder Behaviour  (10% increase / decrease,  where adverse)     | $  (725)                           | $  (950)                             | $  100                                              | $  100                                              | $  (825)                           | $  (850)                             | $  75                                               | $  75                                               |\n| Life Mortality rates  (2% increase)                                   | $  (425)                           | $  (75)                              | $  25                                               | $  (25)                                             | $  (450)                           | $  (75)                              | $  50                                               | $  (25)                                             |\n| Annuity Mortality rates  (2% decrease)                                | $  (175)                           | $  (175)                             | $  25                                               | $  -                                                | $  (175)                           | $  (175)                             | $  25                                               | $  25                                               |\n| Morbidity rates (5% incidence  increase and 5%  termination decrease) | $  (225)                           | $  (100)                             | $  (200)                                            | $  (175)                                            | $  (200)                           | $  (75)                              | $  (175)                                            | $  (175)                                            |\n| Expenses (5% increase)                                                | $  (175)                           | $  (175)                             | $  -                                                | $  -                                                | $  (175)                           | $  (175)                             | $  -                                                | $  -                                                |",

        "page_content": "We use the best evidence of fair value less costs of disposal as the price obtainable for the sale of a CGU, or group of CGUs. Fair value less costs of disposal is initially assessed by looking at recently completed market comparable transactions. In the absence of such comparables, we use either an appraisal methodology (with market assumptions commonly used in the valuation of insurance companies or asset management companies) or a valuation multiples methodology. The fair value measurements are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe most recent calculations from 2018 for certain CGUs and groups of CGUs were carried forward and used in the impairment test in the current period as: (i) the recoverable amount for these CGUs and groups of CGUs exceeded the carrying amount by a substantial margin, (ii) the assets and liabilities making up the CGUs and groups of CGUs had not changed significantly, and (iii) the likelihood that the carrying value would exceed the recoverable amount was remote, based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed. The key drivers impacting the recoverable amount from 2018 are consistent with the key assumptions below.\n\nUnder the appraisal methodology, fair value is assessed based on best estimates of future income, expenses, level and cost of capital over the lifetime of the policies and, where appropriate, adjusted for items such as transaction costs. The value ascribed to new business is based on sales anticipated in our business plans, sales projections for the valuation period based on reasonable growth assumptions, and anticipated levels of profitability of that new business. In calculating the value of new business, future sales are projected for 10 to 15 years. In some instances, market multiples are used to approximate the explicit projection of new business.\n\nThe discount rates applied reflect the nature of the environment for that CGU. The discount rates used range from 9.50% to 12.50% (after tax). More established CGUs with a stronger brand and competitive market position use discount rates at the low end of the range and CGUs with a weaker competitive position use discount rates at the high end of the range. The capital levels used are aligned with our business objectives.\n\nUnder the valuation multiples methodology, fair value is assessed with reference to multiples or ratios of comparable businesses. For life insurers and asset managers, these valuation multiples and ratios may include price-to-earnings or price-to-assets-under-management measures. This assessment takes into consideration a variety of relevant factors and assumptions, including expected growth, risk, and market conditions among others. The price-to-earnings multiples used range from 10.50 to 11.50. The price-to-assets-under-management ratios used range from 1.5% to 2.0%.\n\nJudgment is used in estimating the recoverable amounts of CGUs and the use of different assumptions and estimates could result in material adjustments to the valuation of CGUs and the size of any impairment. Any material change in the key assumptions including those for capital, discount rates, the value of new business, and expenses, as well as cash flow projections used in the determination of recoverable amounts, may result in impairment charges, which could be material.\n\nIn considering the sensitivity of the key assumptions above, management determined that there is no reasonably possible change in any of the above that would result in the recoverable amount of any of the CGUs to be less than its carrying amount.",

Insurance Contracts\n\n## 10.A Summary and Methods and Assumptions\n\n## 10.A.i Summary\n\nWe sell a variety of insurance contracts that include all forms of life, health and critical illness insurance sold to individuals and groups, annuities, and segregated fund products with guarantees. We hold reinsurance contracts that transfer mortality and other risks following internal guidelines.\n\nInsurance contracts with direct participation features are products where investments are managed on behalf of policyholders, and investment returns less a variable fee are passed through to policyholders with the insurance benefits they receive. Insurance contracts with direct participation features are measured using the VFA, and include segregated funds, unit-linked contracts, variable universal life contracts, and most participating insurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts (both issued and held) cannot be measured using the VFA.\n\nInsurance contracts without direct participation features are eligible to use the PAA if the coverage period is one year or less, or if the result of applying the PAA is not expected to be materially different result than applying the GMA in each reporting period over the life of the contract. Insurance contracts eligible to use the PAA include most group life and health contracts and the associated reinsurance contracts held.\n\nOther insurance contracts are measured using the GMA. This includes most individual life and health insurance contracts and annuities and the associated reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Financial Position present insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held as both assets and liabilities, depending on whether the portfolio is in an asset or liability position. The disclosures in this Note are for the net insurance contract asset or liability, and net reinsurance contract held asset or liability. In addition, certain disclosures in this Note exclude assets and liabilities for contracts measured using the PAA, as indicated.\n\nThe tables in this note show the insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts held by reportable business segment, excluding insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders. Further details on Insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders are included in Note 21. Total insurance contract liabilities, including Insurance contract liabilities for account of segregated fund holders, are $154,710 as at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022 - $154,433, January 1, 2022 - $175,491).\n\n| As at December 31, 2023                        | Canada    | U.S.      | Asia      | Corporate   | Total      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|\n| Total contracts:                               |           |           |           |             |            |\n| Insurance contract assets                      | $  -      | $  90     | $  94     | $  -        | $  184     |\n| Insurance contract liabilities (1)             | 82,436    | 24,630    | 28,527    | 76          | 135,669    |\n| Net insurance contract liabilities             | $  82,436 | $  24,540 | $  28,433 | $  76       | $ 135,485  |\n| Reinsurance contract held assets               | 1,557     | 4,083     | 154       | -           | 5,794      |\n| Reinsurance contract held liabilities          | 1,432     | -         | 191       | -           | 1,623      |\n| Net reinsurance contract held assets           | $  125    | $  4,083  | $  (37)   | $  -        | $  4,171   |\n| Contracts measured using the PAA:              |           |           |           |             |            |\n| Insurance contract assets                      | $  -      | $  -      | $  -      | $  -        | $  -       |\n| Insurance contract liabilities                 | 12,446    | 4,791     | 27        | -           | 17,264     |\n| Net insurance contract liabilities - PAA       | $  12,446 | $  4,791  | $  27     | $  -        | $  17,264  |\n| Reinsurance contract held assets               | 152       | 185       | 4         | -           | 341        |\n| Reinsurance contract held liabilities          | -         | -         | -         | -           | -          |\n| Net reinsurance contract held assets - PAA     | $  152    | $  185    | $  4      | $  -        | $  341     |\n| Contracts not measured using the PAA:          |           |           |           |             |            |\n| Insurance contract assets                      | $  -      | $  90     | $  94     | $  -        | $  184     |\n| Insurance contract liabilities (1)             | 69,990    | 19,839    | 28,500    | 76          | 118,405    |\n| Net insurance contract liabilities - non-PAA   | $  69,990 | $  19,749 | $  28,406 | $  76       | $  118,221 |\n| Reinsurance contract held assets               | 1,405     | 3,898     | 150       | -           | 5,453      |\n| Reinsurance contract held liabilities          | 1,432     | -         | 191       | -           | 1,623      |\n| Net reinsurance contract held assets - non-PAA | $  (27)   | $  3,898  | $  (41)   | $  -        | $  3,830   |",

        "page_content": "## 10.A.ii Methods and Assumptions\n\n## General\n\nA group of insurance contracts is measured as the total of FCF, which is the present value of future cash flows plus the risk adjustment for non-financial risk, and, for groups measured using the GMA or VFA, the CSM. In measuring the present value of future cash flows, assumptions must be made about mortality and morbidity rates, lapse and other policyholder behaviour (\"policyholder behaviour\"), expenses and other factors over the life of our products, and the prevailing market view of the cost of financial risk in our products. Many of these assumptions relate to events that are anticipated to occur many years in the future. Assumptions require significant judgment and regular review and, where appropriate, revision.\n\nThe RA is the compensation we require for the uncertainty related to non-financial risk in the estimates of future cash flows. This compensation is measured by discounting cash flows from applying margins to the non-financial assumptions used in the estimate of future cash flows.\n\nThe CSM represents the unearned profit that will be recognized as insurance contract services are provided.\n\nThe methods and assumptions used in the measurement of insurance contracts are reviewed regularly and are subject to external actuarial peer review.\n\n## Present Value of Future Cash Flows\n\nAssumptions for non-financial risk variables in the present value of future cash flows are intended to be current, neutral estimates of the expected outcome as guided by Canadian accepted actuarial practice. The choice of assumptions takes into account current circumstances, past experience data from our own experience or from the industry, the relationship of past to expected future experience, anti-selection, the relationship among assumptions (including those for financial risk variables), and other relevant factors.\n\nAssumptions for financial risk variables in the present value of future cash flows are based on current observable market prices, adjusted to account for differences between the financial risk embedded in our products and those in the corresponding observed market instrument. Where no relevant market instrument is available, we use the best information available as guided by Canadian accepted actuarial practice.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality refers to the rates at which death occurs for defined groups of people. Mortality assumptions are generally based on the past five to ten years of experience. Our experience is combined with industry experience or experience from reinsurers where our own experience is insufficient to be statistically valid. Assumed mortality rates for life insurance and annuity contracts include assumptions about future mortality improvement based on recent trends in population mortality and our outlook for future trends.\n\n## Morbidity\n\nMorbidity refers to the rate of being unhealthy or disabled and the rates of recovery therefrom. Most of our disability insurance is marketed on a group basis. We offer critical illness policies on an individual basis in Canada and Asia, long-term care on an individual basis in Canada, and medical stop-loss insurance is offered on a group basis in the U.S. In Canada, group morbidity assumptions are based on our five-year average experience, modified to reflect any emerging trend in recovery rates. For Canadian long-term care and critical illness insurance in Canada and Asia, assumptions are developed in collaboration with our reinsurers and are largely based on their experience. In the U.S., our experience is used for both medical stop-loss and disability assumptions, with some consideration of industry or reinsurer experience.\n\n## Policyholder Behaviour\n\n## Lapse or surrender\n\nPolicyholders may allow their policies to lapse prior to the end of the contractual coverage period by choosing not to continue to pay premiums or by surrendering their policy for the cash surrender value. Assumptions for lapse or surrender experience on life insurance are generally based on our five-year average experience. Lapse or surrender rates vary by plan, age at issue, method of premium payment, policy duration and financial risk variables.\n\n## Premium payment patterns\n\nFor universal life contracts, it is necessary to set assumptions about premium payment patterns. Studies prepared by industry or the actuarial profession are used for products where our experience is insufficient to be statistically valid. Premium payment patterns usually vary by plan, age at issue, method of premium payment, policy duration and financial risk variables.\n\n## Expense\n\nFuture expenses directly attributable to the fulfillment of our insurance contracts include the costs of premium collection, claims adjudication and processing, actuarial calculations, preparation and mailing of policy statements, and related overhead. Future expense assumptions are mainly based on our recent experience using an internal expense allocation methodology. Inflationary increases assumed in future expenses are based on long-term expectations.\n\nAcquisition expenses directly attributable to portfolios of insurance contracts include the costs of selling, underwriting and issuing insurance contracts. For new insurance contracts measured using the GMA or VFA, actual or estimated directly attributable acquisition expenses are recognized in the initial measurement of the contract. If estimates are used, the difference between estimated and actual acquisition expenses adjusts the CSM when the group of insurance contracts is closed to new contracts.\n\n## Current Discount Rates\n\nCurrent discount rates are used to discount estimates of future cash flows in determining the present value of future cash flows. Current discount rates reflect the time value of money, the characteristics of the cash flows, and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.",

        "page_content": "Current discount rates for cash flows that do not vary based on returns on underlying items\n\nCash flows that do not vary at all based on the returns on any underlying items are discounted at rates that reflect the timing and currency of cash flows and the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts.\n\nThe timing of cash flows is reflected by constructing a discount curve, so that each cash flow is discounted consistent with the timing of the cash flow. In constructing the discount curve, a portion is based on market information (the observable period) and beyond that period, the discount rates are estimated (the unobservable period). The observable period, which varies by currency, is the time period where information on risk-free interest rates is deep and liquid. In the unobservable period, risk-free rates are interpolated between the last observable point and an ultimate risk-free rate at year 70. The ultimate risk-free rate is estimated using historical averages as guided by Canadian accepted actuarial practice.\n\nThe currency of cash flows is reflected by using different discount curves for different currencies.\n\nLiquidity is reflected by adding a liquidity premium to risk-free discount rates that is consistent with the liquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts. The liquidity premium in the observable period is based on the liquidity premium on assets with similar liquidity characteristics, which is estimated from the spread inherent in current market yields less a deduction for expected and unexpected credit losses. The deduction for expected and unexpected credit losses is estimated using historical rating agency data and current market conditions, and varies by asset type, quality, and duration. The liquidity premium in the unobservable period is interpolated between the last observable liquidity premium and an ultimate liquidity premium (at year 70) specific to liquid or illiquid contracts as guided by Canadian accepted actuarial practice.\n\nThe following table provides a weighted average summary of the discount curves used to present value cash flows that do not vary based on the returns on underlying items for all major products by business group:\n\n| As at   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|         | 1 year              |                     | 5 years             | 10 years            | 30 years            | Ultimate            | 1 year              | 5 years             | 10 years            | 30 years            | Ultimate            |\n|         | Canada CAD          | 5.51%               | 4.67%               | 4.59%               | 4.46%               | 4.95%               | 5.36%               | 5.00%               | 5.02%               | 4.80%               | 4.65%               |\n| U.S.    | USD                 | 5.84%               | 5.12%               | 5.04%               | 5.05%               | 4.95%               | 6.06%               | 5.83%               | 5.47%               | 5.33%               | 4.65%               |\n| Asia    | USD                 | 5.89%               | 5.06%               | 5.37%               | 5.48%               | 4.95%               | 5.88%               | 5.61%               | 6.35%               | 5.38%               | 4.65%               |\n\n## Current discount rates for cash flows that vary with returns on underlying items\n\nDiscount rates for cash flows that vary directly with returns on underlying items reflect that variability. For the portion of cash flows that is a pass through of returns on underlying items to policyholders, the discount rate is such that the present value of cash flows equals the portion of the underlying items that is passed through to policyholders. For cash flows that vary, but not directly, with underlying items (e.g., financial guarantees), scenario testing may be necessary. If so, discount rates used in the scenario projections are scenario-specific and based on the projected risk-free rates in the scenario plus liquidity premiums consistent with the liquidity characteristics of the contracts being measured.\n\n## Scenario Testing\n\nScenario testing may be required when the relationship between cash flows and financial risk variables is non-linear, or where there are complex interdependencies among cash flows. In scenario testing of financial risk variables, future cash flows are projected for each scenario path and discounted at the scenario-specific discount rates, resulting in a present value of future cash flows for each scenario. The provision for the projected cash flows is the average of the scenario-specific values. Assumptions for non-financial risk variables are the best estimate assumptions consistent with the scenario.\n\nScenarios are consistent with the current market environment. Our Economic Scenario Generator calibration process produces integrated stochastic scenarios of financial risk variables (e.g., risk-free interest rates, bond fund returns, equity returns) with parameters calibrated to replicate observable market prices of financial instruments available in the market. Adjustments are made when the insurance contracts being measured are illiquid but the financial instruments to which the scenarios are calibrated to are liquid.\n\n## Risk Adjustment for Non-Financial Risk\n\nThe RA for insurance contracts issued is the compensation we require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. This amount is measured as the present value of the difference between estimated future cash flows with a margin applied to non-financial assumptions and estimated future cash flows without this adjustment. Margins generally range from 5% to 20% depending on the uncertainty in the determination of the assumption. The level of uncertainty, and hence the margin chosen, varies by assumption and by line of business and other factors. Considerations that would generally lead to a choice of margin at the higher end of the range are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The statistical credibility of our experience is too low to be the primary source of data for choosing the assumption;\n- \u00b7 Future experience is difficult to estimate;\n- \u00b7 The cohort of risks lacks homogeneity;\n- \u00b7 Operational risks adversely impact the ability to estimate the assumption; or\n- \u00b7 Past experience may not be representative of future experience and the experience may deteriorate.\n\nMargins are generally stable over time and are revised only to reflect changes in the level of uncertainty in the assumptions. Our margins tend to be at mid-range.\n\nThe RA for reinsurance contracts held represents the amount of risk transferred to the reinsurer. This is measured as the difference between the RA on the underlying insurance contracts without reinsurance and what the RA on the underlying insurance contracts would be with reinsurance. The RA for reinsurance contracts held increases the asset or reduces the liability for reinsurance contracts held.\n\nThe RA for insurance contracts corresponds to a confidence level of approximately 80-85% overall.",

        "page_content": "## Contractual Service Margin\n\nThe initial and subsequent measurement of CSM is described in Note 1. Additional detail about certain components of the measurement of CSM is provided below.\n\n## Interest accretion\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the GMA, locked-in discount rates are used to accrete interest on the CSM. The locked-in discount rate for a group of insurance contracts is the weighted average of the current discount rates at initial recognition of the contracts in the group. For groups of contracts that were in-force as at January 1, 2022, which was the start of our restated comparative period as a result of adopting IFRS 17 (refer to Note 2 for details), the locked-in discount rates are the discount rates in effect at the date of transition as the fair value approach was applied for these groups at transition.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the VFA, there is no accretion of interest. Rather, the CSM is adjusted by the change in our share of the fair value of underlying items.\n\n## Changes in FCF relating to future service\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the GMA, locked-in discount rates are used to measure changes in FCF relating to future service. Changes in FCF relating to future service reflect changes in non-financial assumptions but not changes in assumptions related to financial risk.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the VFA, current discount rates are used to measure the change in FCF relating to future service. Changes in FCF relating to future service reflect both changes in non-financial assumptions and changes in assumptions related to financial risk.\n\nChanges in FCF relating to future service include (Liability for Remaining Coverage only):\n\n- \u00b7 All changes related to investment component payments (including current period payments);\n- \u00b7 Changes arising from changes in assumptions used to derive the present value of future cash flows - limited to non-financial assumptions for insurance contracts measured using the GMA;\n- \u00b7 Changes in future cash flows arising from claims in the current period; and\n- \u00b7 For insurance contracts measured using the GMA, changes related to discretionary cash flows on some universal life and adjustable products. Discretionary cash flows are cash flows outside the guaranteed payments to the policyholder, and are described as a spread on earned rates (in the case of some universal life contracts) and in the policy on criteria for changes to adjustable policies for adjustable policies.\n\n## CSM amortization\n\nThe amount of CSM recognized as insurance revenue in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided for a group of contracts in the period is determined by:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying the total coverage units in the group (for services in current and future periods) - based on the quantity of insurance contract services;\n- \u00b7 Allocating the CSM at the end of the period equally to each coverage unit in the current period and expected to be provided in the future (i.e., coverage units \"unitize\" the services provided); then\n- \u00b7 Recognizing in insurance revenue the amount allocated to coverage units provided in the period.\n\nTotal coverage units for services expected to be provided in future periods is the present value of projected coverage units. The present value is measured using locked-in discount rates for groups measured using the GMA and current discount rates for groups measured using the VFA.\n\nThe coverage unit for a group is based on the nature of the insurance contract services provided. Insurance contract services comprise services for providing insurance coverage and, for some contracts, investment-return or investment-related services. It does not include services related to performing functions such as claims adjudication. Where more than one type of service is provided to insurance contracts in a group, the coverage unit reflects the primary service provided.\n\nFor insurance contracts measured using the VFA, coverage units are based on the policyholder's account value or the policyholders' share of the fair value of underlying items. For insurance contracts measured using the GMA, coverage units are based on the expected claim amount (excluding any investment component) for life and health insurance contracts, and the payment due in a period for annuity contracts.\n\nFor reinsurance contracts held, CSM amortization reflects the services received in the period.",

When quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined from observable market data by dealers that are typically the market makers. The fair value is categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nInterest expense on senior debentures was $14 for both 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe senior debentures issued by SLF Inc. are direct senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of SLF Inc.\n\n## 12.B Innovative Capital Instruments\n\nInnovative capital instruments consist of Sun Life ExchangEable Capital Securities (\"SLEECS\"), which were issued by SLCT I, established as a trust under the laws of Ontario. SLCT I issued Sun Life ExchangEable Capital Securities - Series B (\"SLEECS B\"), which are units representing an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the assets of that trust. SLEECS B are non-voting except in certain limited circumstances. Holders of the SLEECS B are eligible to receive semi-annual non-cumulative fixed cash distributions.\n\nThe proceeds of the issuance of the SLEECS B were used by SLCT I to purchase senior debentures of Sun Life Assurance. SLCT I is not consolidated by us. As a result, the innovative capital instruments are not reported on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the senior debentures issued by Sun Life Assurance to SLCT I are reported on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe SLEECS B are structured to achieve Tier 1 regulatory capital treatment for SLF Inc. and Sun Life Assurance and, as such, have features of equity capital. No interest payments or distributions will be paid in cash by SLCT I on the SLEECS B if Sun Life Assurance fails to declare regular dividends (i) on its Class B Non-Cumulative Preferred Shares Series A, or (ii) on its public preferred shares, if any are outstanding (each, a \"Missed Dividend Event\"). If a Missed Dividend Event occurs, the net distributable funds of SLCT I will be distributed to Sun Life Assurance as the holder of Special Trust Securities of that trust.\n\nIf SLCT I fails to pay in cash the semi-annual interest payments or distributions on the SLEECS B in full for any reason other than a Missed Dividend Event, then, for a specified period of time, Sun Life Assurance will not declare dividends of any kind on any of its public preferred shares, and if no such public preferred shares are outstanding, SLF Inc. will not declare dividends of any kind on any of its preferred shares or common shares.\n\nEach SLEECS B unit will be automatically exchanged for 40 non-cumulative perpetual preferred shares of Sun Life Assurance if any one of the following events occurs: (i) proceedings are commenced or an order is made for the winding-up of Sun Life Assurance; (ii) OSFI takes control of Sun Life Assurance or its assets; (iii) Sun Life Assurance's capital ratios fall below applicable thresholds; or (iv) OSFI directs Sun Life Assurance to increase its capital or provide additional liquidity and Sun Life Assurance either fails to comply with such direction or elects to have the SLEECS B automatically exchanged (\"Automatic Exchange Event\"). Upon an Automatic Exchange Event, former holders of the SLEECS B will cease to have any claim or entitlement to distributions, interest or principal against SLCT I and will rank as preferred shareholders of Sun Life Assurance in a liquidation of Sun Life Assurance.",

        "page_content": "## 14. Share Capital\n\nThe authorized share capital of SLF Inc. consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 An unlimited number of common shares without nominal or par value. Each common share is entitled to one vote at meetings of the shareholders of SLF Inc. There are no pre-emptive, redemption, purchase, or conversion rights attached to the common shares.\n- \u00b7 An unlimited number of Class A and Class B non-voting shares, issuable in series. The Board is authorized before issuing the shares, to fix the number, the consideration per share, the designation of, and the rights and restrictions of the Class A and Class B shares of each series, subject to the special rights and restrictions attached to all the Class A and Class B shares. The Board has authorized 14 series of Class A non-voting preferred shares, 8 of which are outstanding.\n\nThe common and preferred shares of SLF Inc. qualify as capital for Canadian regulatory purposes. See Note 20.\n\n## Dividends and Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends\n\nUnder the Insurance Companies Act (Canada), SLF Inc. and Sun Life Assurance are each prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend on any of its shares if there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or by paying the dividend would be, in contravention of: (i) the requirement that it maintains adequate capital and adequate and appropriate forms of liquidity, (ii) any regulations under the Insurance Companies Act (Canada) in relation to capital and liquidity, and (iii) any order by which OSFI directs it to increase its capital or provide additional liquidity.\n\nSLF Inc. and Sun Life Assurance have each covenanted that, if a distribution is not paid when due on any outstanding SLEECS issued by SLCT I, then (i) Sun Life Assurance will not pay dividends on its public preferred shares, if any are outstanding, and (ii) if Sun Life Assurance does not have any public preferred shares outstanding, then SLF Inc. will not pay dividends on its preferred shares or common shares, in each case, until the 12th month following the failure to pay the required distribution in full, unless the required distribution is paid to the holders of SLEECS. Public preferred shares means preferred shares issued by Sun Life Assurance which: (a) have been issued to the public (excluding any preferred shares held beneficially by affiliates of Sun Life Assurance); (b) are listed on a recognized stock exchange; and (c) have an aggregate liquidation entitlement of at least $200. As at December 31, 2023, Sun Life Assurance did not have outstanding any shares that qualify as public preferred shares.\n\nThe terms of SLF Inc.'s outstanding preferred shares provide that for so long as Sun Life Assurance is a subsidiary of SLF Inc., no dividends on such preferred shares are to be declared or paid if Sun Life Assurance's minimum regulatory capital ratio falls below the applicable threshold.\n\nIn addition, under the terms of SLF Inc.'s outstanding preferred shares, SLF Inc. cannot pay dividends on its common shares without the approval of the holders of those preferred shares unless all dividends on the preferred shares for the last completed period for which dividends are payable have been declared and paid or set apart for payment.\n\nCurrently, the above limitations do not restrict the payment of dividends on SLF Inc.'s preferred or common shares.\n\nThe declaration and payment of dividends on SLF Inc.'s shares are at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements. Dividends may be adjusted or eliminated at the discretion of the Board on the basis of these or other considerations.\n\n## 14.A Common Shares\n\nChanges in common shares issued and outstanding for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n\n|                                          | 2023             | 2023     | 2022             | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|----------|------------------|----------|\n| Common shares (in millions of shares)    | Number of shares | Amount   | Number of shares | Amount   |\n| Balance, beginning of year               | 586.4            | $  8,311 | 586.0            | $  8,305 |\n| Stock options exercised (Note 18)        | 1.0              | 56       | 0.4              | 6        |\n| Common shares purchased for cancellation | (2.8)            | (40)     | -                | -        |\n| Balance, end of year                     | 584.6            | $  8,327 | 586.4            | $  8,311 |\n\nOn August 29, 2023, we launched a normal course issuer bid (the \"NCIB\") to purchase up to 17 million of our common shares between August 29, 2023 and, at the latest, August 28, 2024. We implemented an automatic repurchase plan with our designated broker in order to facilitate purchases of common shares under the NCIB. Under the automatic repurchase plan, our designated broker is able to purchase common shares pursuant to the NCIB at times when we ordinarily would not be active in the market due to applicable securities laws or selfimposed blackout periods. Any common shares purchased by us pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled or used in connection with certain equity settled incentive arrangements.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we purchased and cancelled approximately 2.8 million common shares at an average price per share of $66.61 for a total amount of $186 under the NCIB. The total amount paid to purchase the shares pursuant to the NCIB is allocated to Common shares and Retained earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. The amount allocated to Common shares is based on the average cost per common share and amounts paid above the average cost are allocated to Retained earnings.",

A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. We have an interest in a structured entity when we have a contractual or non-contractual involvement that exposes us to variable returns from the performance of the entity. Our interest includes investments held in securities or units issued by these entities and fees earned from management of the assets within these entities.\n\nInformation on our interests in unconsolidated structured entities is as follows:\n\n| As at December 31,                             |                                                       |                                                                                        | 2023            | 2023                         | 2022            | 2022                         |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| Type of structured entity                      | Type of investment  held                              | Consolidated Statements  of Financial Position line item                               | Carrying amount | Maximum exposure to loss (1) | Carrying amount | Maximum exposure to loss (1) |\n| Securitization entities -  third-party managed | Debt securities                                       | Debt securities                                                                        | $  9,931        | $  9,931                     | $  9,155        | $  9,155                     |\n| Securitization entities -  third-party managed | Short-term securities                                 | Cash, cash equivalents  and short-term securities                                      | $  539          | $  539                       | $  790          | $  790                       |\n| Investment funds -  third-party managed        | Investment fund units                                 | Equity securities                                                                      | $  5,869        | $  5,869                     | $  5,766        | $  5,766                     |\n| Investment funds -  company managed (2)        | Investment fund units  and Limited  partnership units | Equity securities, Other  financial invested assets, and  Other non-financial invested | $  3,484        | $  3,484                     | $  3,365        | $  3,365                     |\n| Limited partnerships -  third-party managed    | Limited partnership  units                            | Other non-financial invested  assets                                                   | $  3,128        | $  3,128                     | $  2,786        | $  2,786                     |\n\n## 15.D.i Securitization Entities\n\nSecuritization entities are structured entities that are generally financed primarily through the issuance of debt securities that are backed by a pool of assets, such as mortgages or loans.\n\n## Third-Party Managed\n\nOur investments in third-party managed securitization entities consist of asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (\"CDOs\"), and commercial paper. These securities are generally large-issue debt securities designed to transform the cash flows from a specific pool of underlying assets into tranches providing various risk exposures for investment purposes. We do not provide financial or other support to these entities other than our original investment and therefore our maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the carrying amount of our investment. We do not have control over these investments since we do not have power to direct the relevant activities of these entities, regardless of the level of our investment.\n\n## Company Managed\n\nWe provide collateral management services to various securitization entities, primarily CDOs, from which we earn a fee for our services. The financial support provided to these entities is limited to the carrying amount of our investment in these entities. We provide no guarantees or other contingent support to these entities. We have not consolidated these entities since we do not have significant variability from our interests in these entities and we do not have any investment in these entities.\n\n## 15.D.ii Investment Funds and Limited Partnerships\n\nInvestment funds and limited partnerships are investment vehicles that consist of a pool of funds collected from a group of investors for the purpose of investing in assets such as money market instruments, debt securities, equity securities, real estate, and other similar assets. The preceding table includes our investments in all investment funds, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and segregated funds, and our investments in certain limited partnerships. Some of these investment funds and limited partnerships are structured entities. For all investment funds and limited partnerships, our maximum exposure to loss is equivalent to the carrying amount of our investment in the fund or partnership. Investment funds and limited partnerships are generally financed through the issuance of investment fund units or limited partnership units.",

        "page_content": "## Third-Party Managed\n\nWe hold units in investment funds and limited partnerships managed by third-party asset managers. Our investments in fund units and limited partnership units generally give us an undivided interest in the investment performance of a portfolio of underlying assets managed or tracked to a specific investment mandate for investment purposes. We do not have control over investment funds or limited partnerships that are structured entities since we do not have power to direct their relevant activities.\n\n## Company Managed\n\nWe hold units in Company managed investment funds and limited partnerships. We generally have power over Company managed investment funds and limited partnerships that are structured entities since we have power to direct the relevant activities of the funds and limited partnerships. However, we have not consolidated these funds and limited partnerships since we do not have significant variability from our interests in these funds and limited partnerships. We earn management fees from the management of these investment funds and limited partnerships that are commensurate with the services provided and are reported in Fee income. Management fees are generally based on the value of the assets under management. Therefore, the fees earned are impacted by the composition of the assets under management and fluctuations in financial markets. The fee income earned is included in Fund management and other asset based fees in Note 16. We also hold units in investment funds and limited partnerships managed by our joint ventures. Our share of the management fees earned is included as part of the Net income (loss) reported in Note 15.B.\n\n## 15.E Consolidated Structured Entities\n\nWe control and consolidate structured entities related to the CLOs described in more detail in Note 5.A.i and investment funds managed by SLC Management and its affiliate managers which invest primarily in investment properties and entities which invest in renewable energy projects.\n\n## 16.

The expected term of options granted is derived based on historical employee exercise behaviour and employee termination experience. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the Canadian government bond yield curve in effect at the time of grant.",

Employees may elect to contribute from 1% to 20% of their target annual compensation to the Sun Life Financial Employee Stock Plan. Under this plan the match is provided for employees who have met one year of employment eligibility and is equal to 50% of the employee's contributions up to 5% of an employee's annual compensation. The match is further capped by a one thousand five hundred dollar annual maximum. Our contributions vest immediately and are expensed.\n\nIn the U.S., the Sun Life Financial U.S. Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employees to buy shares of SLF Inc. at a 10% discount at the end of six-month offering periods. Under this plan, employees who enroll can contribute from 1% to 10% of their base salary. At the end of each period, accumulated employee amounts are used to purchase stock, with the Company financing the 10% discount. The total annual contribution, including the company discount, is limited to U.S. twenty-five thousand dollars based on its fair market value on the offering date.\n\nWe recorded an expense of $10 for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2022 - $9).\n\n## 18.C Other Share-Based Payment Plans\n\nAll other share-based payment plans use notional units that are valued based on the common share price on the TSX. Any fluctuation in the common share price changes the value of the units, which affects our share-based payment compensation expense. Upon redemption of these units, payments are made to the employees with a corresponding reduction in the accrued liability. We use equity swaps and forwards to hedge our exposure to variations in cash flows due to changes in the common share price for all of these plans.\n\nDetails of these plans are as follows:\n\nSenior Executives' Deferred Share Unit (\"DSU\") Plan: Under the DSU plan, designated executives may elect to receive all or a portion of their short-term incentive award in the form of DSUs. Each DSU is equivalent in value to one common share and earns dividend equivalents in the form of additional DSUs at the same rate as the dividends on common shares. The designated executives must elect to participate in the plan prior to the beginning of the plan year and this election is irrevocable. Awards generally vest immediately; however, participants are not permitted to redeem the DSUs until after termination, death, or retirement. The value at the time of redemption will be based on the fair value of the common shares immediately before their redemption.\n\nSun Share Plan: Under the Sun Share plan, participants are granted units that are equivalent in value to one common share and have a grant price equal to the average of the closing price of a common share on the TSX on the five trading days immediately prior to the date of grant. Participants generally hold units for up to 36 months from the date of grant. The units earn dividend equivalents in the form of additional units at the same rate as the dividends on common shares. Under this plan, some units are performance-based that may vest or become payable if we meet specified threshold performance targets. The plan provides for performance factors to motivate participants to achieve a higher return for shareholders (performance factors are determined through a multiplier that can be as low as zero or as high as two times the number of units that vest). Payments to participants are based on the number of units vested multiplied by the average closing price of a common share on the TSX on the five trading days immediately prior to the vesting date.\n\nAdditional information for other share-based payment plans: The units outstanding under these plans and the liabilities recognized for these units in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are summarized in the following table:\n\n| Number of units (in thousands)            | Sun Shares   | DSUs   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|---------|\n| Units outstanding December 31, 2023       | 4,945        | 618    | 5,563   |\n| Units outstanding December 31, 2022       | 4,675        | 710    | 5,385   |\n| Liability accrued as at December 31, 2023 | $  233       | $  43  | $  276  |\n| Liability accrued as at December 31, 2022 | $  188       | $  44  | $  232  |\n\nCompensation expense and the Income tax expense (benefit) for other share-based payment plans for the years ended December 31 are shown in the following table. Since expenses for the DSUs are accrued as part of incentive compensation in the year awarded, the expenses below do not include these accruals. The expenses presented in the following table include increases in the liabilities for Sun Shares and DSUs due to changes in the fair value of the common shares and the accruals of the Sun Shares liabilities over the vesting period, and exclude any adjustment in expenses due to the impact of hedging.\n\n| For the years ended December 31,   | 2023    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Compensation expense               | $  164  | $  43  |\n| Income tax expense (benefit)       | $  (43) | $  (9) |\n\n## 18.D Share-Based Payment Plans of MFS\n\nShare-based payment awards within MFS are based on their own shares. Restricted share awards are settled in MFS shares and restricted stock unit awards are settled in cash. Restricted share awards and restricted stock unit awards generally vest over a four-year period and continued employment is generally the only service requirement for these awards. Holders of restricted share awards and restricted stock unit awards are entitled to receive non-forfeitable dividend equivalent payments during the vesting period at the same rate as the dividends on MFS's shares.\n\nAlthough restricted share awards are settled in shares, all of the MFS share-based awards, including outstanding MFS shares, are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payment awards due to the fact that MFS has a practice of repurchasing its outstanding shares after a specified holding period. The fair value of restricted share awards, restricted stock unit awards, and outstanding MFS shares are estimated using a market consistent share valuation model. The amount of periodic compensation expense recognized is impacted by grants of new awards, vesting, and forfeiture of unvested awards, share repurchases, changes in fair value of awards, and outstanding MFS shares.

        "page_content": "We have accumulated non-capital tax losses, primarily in Canada, Indonesia and Vietnam, totaling $4,388 (2022 - $4,349). The benefit of these tax losses has been recognized to the extent that it is probable that the benefit will be realized. In addition, in the U.S., we have net capital losses of $9 (2022 - $10) for which a deferred tax asset of $2 (2022 - $2) has been recognized. Unused tax losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognized amount to $597 as of December 31, 2023 (2022 - $696) primarily in Indonesia and Vietnam. We also have capital losses of $nil in the UK (2022 - $434) and $202 in Canada (2022 - $275) for which a deferred tax asset of $26 (2022 - $181) has not been recognized. 2022 comparatives included losses in Sun Life UK which was sold in 2023.\n\nWe will realize the benefit of tax losses carried forward in future years through a reduction in current income taxes as and when the losses are utilized. These tax losses are subject to examination by various tax authorities and could be reduced as a result of the adjustments to tax returns. Furthermore, legislative, business or other changes may limit our ability to utilize these losses.\n\nIncluded in the deferred tax asset related to losses available for carry forward are tax benefits that have been recognized on losses incurred in either the current or the preceding year. In determining if it is appropriate to recognize these tax benefits, we rely on projections of future taxable profits, and we also consider tax planning opportunities that will create taxable income in the period in which the unused tax losses can be utilized.\n\nThe non-capital losses carried forward in Canada expire beginning in 2030 and the capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The noncapital losses in Indonesia and Vietnam can be carried forward five years. The capital losses in the U.S. can be carried forward five years.\n\n## A tax recovery of $7 arose on the sale of Sun Life UK.\n\nRecent amendments to IAS 12 provide a mandatory temporary exception to the recognition and disclosure of information about deferred taxes arising from Pillar Two, and we have applied this temporary exception. Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the group has no related current tax exposure. Our deferred taxes will not reflect impacts of Pillar Two while the mandatory temporary exception is applicable. The global minimum tax rules will apply to Sun Life effective January 1, 2024, however the timing of the substantive enactment of these rules in most jurisdictions where Sun Life operates is uncertain. Under the legislation, Sun Life is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between the effective tax rate under the Pillar Two rules on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and the 15% minimum rate. For the jurisdictions in which Sun Life operates where the rules are considered substantively enacted, it is expected that the rules will not have a significant impact on Sun Life's Consolidated Financial Statements when they become effective.\n\nWe recognize a deferred tax liability on all temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates unless we are able to control the timing of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that these differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. As at December 31, 2023, temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognized amount to $4,606 (2022 - $4,397).\n\n## 19.B Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n\nIn our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31 has the following components:\n\n| For the years ended December 31,                                            | 2023     | 2022 (restated, see note 2)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|\n| Current income tax expense (benefit):                                       |          |                               |\n| Current year                                                                | $  1,187 | $  781                        |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years, including resolution of tax disputes | 159      | (67)                          |\n| Total current income tax expense (benefit)                                  | 1,346    | 714                           |\n| Deferred income tax expense (benefit):                                      |          |                               |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                           | (637)    | (82)                          |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years, including resolution of tax disputes | (172)    | 48                            |\n| Tax expense (benefit) arising from unrecognized tax losses                  | (25)     | 18                            |\n| Tax rate and other legislative changes                                      | (51)     | (152)                         |\n| Total deferred income tax expense (benefit)                                 | (885)    | (168)                         |\n| Total income tax expense (benefit)                                          | $  461   | $  546                        |\n\nIncome tax benefit (expense) recognized directly in equity for the years ended December 31:\n\n| For the years ended December 31,                                                                                               | 2023     | 2022 (restated, see note 2)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|\n| Recognized in other comprehensive income:                                                                                      |          |                               |\n| Current income tax benefit (expense)                                                                                           | $  -     | $  2                          |\n| Deferred income tax benefit (expense)                                                                                          | (101)    | 304                           |\n| Total recognized in other comprehensive income                                                                                 | (101)    | 306                           |\n| Recognized in equity, other than other comprehensive income:                                                                   |          |                               |\n| Deferred income tax benefit (expense)                                                                                          | (24)     | 15                            |\n| Total income tax benefit (expense) recorded in equity, including tax benefit (expense) recorded in  Other comprehensive income | $  (125) | $  321                        |",

Generally, earnings arising in tax jurisdictions with statutory rates lower than 27.75% reduce our tax expense and these differences are reported in Higher (lower) effective rates on income subject to taxation in foreign jurisdictions. The benefit reported in 2023 included slightly higher income in jurisdictions with low statutory income tax rates compared to 2022.\n\nTax-exempt investment (income) loss includes tax rate differences related to various types of investment income or losses that are taxed at rates lower than our statutory income tax rate. Examples include, but are not limited to, dividend income, capital gains arising in Canada and changes in market values including those resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nAdjustments in respect of prior periods, including the resolution of tax disputes, relate mainly to the resolution of Canadian tax matters and the finalization of the prior year's Canadian and U.S. tax filings. In 2022, it included the finalization of the prior year's UK tax filings.\n\nTax (benefit) cost of unrecognized tax losses and tax credits primarily reflects unrecognized losses in Asia, as well as the recognition of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets in the U.S. In 2022, it mainly reflected unrecognized losses in Asia and the UK.\n\nIn assessing unrecognized deferred tax assets, management has determined that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow deferred tax assets in the U.S. to be recovered. Our U.S. subsidiaries had state net operating losses and other future deductions in computing state income taxes, for which deferred tax assets had previously not been recognized. Management has concluded that it is probable that these subsidiaries, and other historically profitable subsidiaries with which it files consolidated (unitary) state income tax returns, will generate sufficient taxable profit against which the unused state losses and deductions can be utilized. The benefit will be realized in future years through a reduction in current income taxes payable.\n\nTax rate and other legislative changes reflects a benefit relating to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in Bermuda. On December 27, 2023, Bermuda enacted a Corporate Income Tax regime which will apply a 15% income tax beginning on January 1, 2025. The enacted legislation provides an economic transition adjustment that aligns an entity's tax basis starting point more closely with its economic position prior to the application of the Corporate Income Tax, and can reduce Bermuda income taxes in the future. In 2022, tax rate and other legislative changes included a benefit relating to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances as a result of a Canadian income tax rate change.\n\nOther primarily reflects withholding taxes on distributions from our foreign subsidiaries, the benefit relating to investments in joint ventures in Asia, and the impact of taxable income attributable to NCI. In 2022, Other included the tax impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge relating to the sale of Sun Life UK and the reversal of withholding taxes no longer expected to be paid.",

Capital Management\n\nOur capital base is structured to exceed minimum regulatory and internal capital targets and maintain strong credit and financial strength ratings, while maintaining a capital efficient structure. We strive to achieve an optimal capital structure by balancing the use of debt and equity financing. Capital is managed both on a consolidated basis under the principles that consider all the risks associated with the business, as well as at the business group level under the principles appropriate to the jurisdiction in which each operates. We manage the capital for all of our international subsidiaries on a local statutory basis in a manner commensurate with their individual risk profiles.\n\nThe Board of Directors of SLF Inc. is responsible for the annual review and approval of the Company's capital plan and capital risk policy. Management oversight of our capital programs and position is provided by the Company's Executive Risk Committee, the membership of which includes senior management from the finance, actuarial, and risk management functions.\n\nWe engage in a capital planning process annually in which capital deployment options, fundraising, and dividend recommendations are presented to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Capital reviews are regularly conducted which consider the potential impacts under various business, interest rate, and equity market scenarios. Relevant components of these capital reviews, including dividend recommendations, are presented to the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. The Board of Directors is responsible for the approval of the dividend recommendations.\n\nThe capital risk policy is designed to ensure that adequate capital is maintained to provide the flexibility necessary to take advantage of growth opportunities, to support the risks associated with our businesses and to optimize return to our shareholders. This policy is also intended to provide an appropriate level of risk management over capital adequacy risk, which is defined as the risk that capital is not or will not be sufficient to withstand adverse economic conditions, to maintain financial strength or to allow us and our subsidiaries to support ongoing operations and to take advantage of opportunities for expansion. SLF Inc. manages its capital in a manner commensurate with its risk profile and control environment.\n\nSLF Inc. is a non-operating insurance company and is subject to the LICAT guideline. As at December 31, 2023, SLF Inc.'s LICAT ratio exceeded the regulatory minimum target as set out by the OSFI.\n\nSun Life Assurance, SLF Inc.'s principal operating life insurance subsidiary in Canada, is also subject to the LICAT guideline. With a LICAT Ratio of 141% as at December 31, 2023, Sun Life Assurance's LICAT Ratio is above OSFI's Supervisory Target Total Ratio of 100% and minimum Total Ratio of 90%.\n\nOSFI may intervene and assume control of a Canadian life insurance company if it deems the amount of available capital insufficient. Capital requirements may be adjusted by OSFI in the future, as experience develops or the risk profile of Canadian life insurers changes or to reflect other risks. Sun Life Assurance exceeded levels that would require regulatory or corrective action as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company's regulated subsidiaries must comply with the capital adequacy requirements imposed in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In certain jurisdictions, the payment of dividends from our subsidiaries is subject to maintaining capital levels exceeding regulatory targets and/or receiving regulatory approval. We maintained capital levels above minimum local requirements as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nIn the U.S., Sun Life Assurance operates through a branch which is subject to U.S. regulatory supervision and it exceeded the levels under which regulatory action would be required as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In the U.S., we use captive reinsurance arrangements to provide efficient financing of U.S. statutory reserve requirements in excess of those required under IFRS. Under two such arrangements, the funding of these reserve requirements is supported by a guarantee from SLF Inc.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, our total capital base was re-measured due to our adoption of IFRS 17. We exceeded our minimum capital requirements as at January 1, 2023. Our adjusted total capital base presented in the table below consists mainly of common shareholders' equity, preferred shares and other equity instruments, equity in the participating account, non-controlling interests' equity, CSM, and certain other capital securities that qualify as regulatory capital.\n\n|                                               | IFRS 17 and IFRS 9   | IFRS 17 and IFRS 9   | IFRS 4 and IAS 39   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| As at                                         | December 31, 2023    | January 1, 2023      | December 31, 2022   |\n| Subordinated debt                             | $  6,178             | $  6,676             | $  6,676            |\n| Innovative capital instruments (1)            | 200                  | 200                  | 200                 |\n| Equity:                                       |                      |                      |                     |\n| Preferred shares and other equity instruments | 2,239                | 2,239                | 2,239               |\n| Common shareholders' equity (2)               | 21,343               | 20,290               | 25,211              |\n| Equity in the participating account           | 457                  | 268                  | 1,837               |\n| Non-controlling interests' equity             | 161                  | 90                   | 90                  |\n| Contractual Service Margin (3)                | 11,786               | 10,865               |                     |\n| Total capital (3) (4)                         | $  42,364            | $  40,628            | $  36,253           |",

        "page_content": "## 21. Segregated Funds\n\nWe have segregated fund products, including variable annuities, unit-linked products and variable universal life insurance policies, in Canada, the U.S., the UK, and Asia. Effective the second quarter of 2023, we completed the sale of our UK Business unit. See Note 3. Under these contracts, the benefit amount is contractually linked to the fair value of the investments in the particular segregated fund. Policyholders can select from a variety of categories of segregated fund investments. Although the underlying assets are registered in our name and the segregated fund contract holder has no direct access to the specific assets, the contractual arrangements are such that the segregated fund policyholder bears the risk and rewards of the funds' investment performance. Therefore, net realized gains and losses and other net investment income earned on the segregated funds are attributable to policyholders and not to us. However, certain contracts include guarantees from us. We are exposed to equity market risk and interest rate risk and sometimes insurance risk as a result of these guarantees. Further details on these guarantees and our risk management activities related to these guarantees are included in Notes 6 and 7.\n\nSegregated fund contracts are classified as insurance contracts or investment contracts depending on whether there is significant insurance risk in the guarantees we provide. Segregated funds that are classified as insurance contracts are insurance contracts with direct participation features, and therefore measured using the VFA.\n\nWe derive fee income from segregated funds. Market value movements in the investments held for segregated fund holders impact the management fees earned on these funds. Fees from segregated fund contracts that are classified as investment contracts are reported as Fee Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fees from segregated fund contracts that are classified as insurance contracts are reflected in the measurement of CSM of those contracts, which is reported as revenue as insurance contract services are provided.\n\nThe segregated fund types offered, by percentage of total investments for account of segregated fund holders, were within the following ranges as at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\n| Type of fund   | %        |\n|----------------|----------|\n| Money market   | 1 to 5   |\n| Fixed income   | 5 to 10  |\n| Balanced       | 40 to 45 |\n| Equity         | 45 to 50 |\n\nMoney market funds include investments that have a term to maturity of less than one year. Fixed income funds are funds that invest primarily in investment grade fixed income securities and where less than 25% can be invested in diversified equities or high-yield bonds. Balanced funds are a combination of fixed income securities with a larger equity component. The fixed income component is greater than 25% of the portfolio. Equity consists primarily of broad-based diversified funds that invest in a well-diversified mix of Canadian, U.S. or global equities. Other funds in this category include low volatility funds, intermediate volatility funds, and high volatility funds.\n\n## 21.A Segregated Funds Classified as Investment Contracts\n\n## 21.A.i Investments for Account of Segregated Fund Holders - Investment Contracts\n\nThe carrying value of investments for account of segregated fund holders for contracts classified as investment contracts are as follows:\n\n| As at                                                    | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | January 1, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Segregated and mutual fund units                         | $  107,239          | $  97,347           | $  107,277        |\n| Equity securities                                        | 1,280               | 3,801               | 4,317             |\n| Debt securities                                          | 862                 | 1,441               | 1,753             |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and short-term securities         | 4                   | 181                 | 264               |\n| Investment properties                                    | -                   | 271                 | 226               |\n| Mortgages                                                | -                   | -                   | 1                 |\n| Other assets                                             | 30                  | 75                  | 98                |\n| Total assets                                             | 109,415             | 103,116             | 113,936           |\n| Less: Liabilities arising from investing activities      | 4                   | 963                 | 19                |\n| Total investments for account of segregated fund holders | $  109,411          | $  102,153          | $  113,917        |",

        "page_content": "## 22. Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies\n\n## 22.A Lease Commitments\n\nWe lease offices and certain equipment. These are operating leases with rents charged to operations in the year to which they relate. Total future rental payments for the remainder of these leases total $1,269 (December 31, 2022 - $1,000). The future rental payments by year of payment are included in Note 6.\n\n## 22.B Contractual Commitments\n\nIn the normal course of business, various contractual commitments are outstanding, which are not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to loan commitments for debt securities and mortgages included in Note 6.A.i, we have equity, investment property, and property and equipment commitments. As at December 31, 2023, we had a total of $4,909 of contractual commitments outstanding (December 31, 2022 - $5,070). The expected maturities of these commitments are included in Note 6.\n\n## 22.C Letters of Credit\n\nWe issue commercial letters of credit in the normal course of business. As at December 31, 2023, we had credit facilities of $874 available for the issuance of letters of credit (December 31, 2022 - $889), from which a total of $113 in letters of credit were outstanding (December 31, 2022 - $110).\n\n## 22.D Commission on Release\n\nCommissions on Release (\"CORe\") is a program designed to facilitate the transfer of blocks of business between advisors in order to provide ongoing service and advice to our Clients. We facilitate and administer these transactions including payment and collection streams. Under the CORe program, when an eligible advisor releases Clients they are servicing, we are contractually obligated to pay them the associated CORe value, based on a specified formula as stipulated in the advisor contract. The value of the CORe commitment will vary for blocks of business which have not been released by an active advisor. The occurrence of future events that will trigger an advisor to release their block of business and the value of the related CORe commitment at that future release date is difficult to predict. As a result of uncertainty in the timing of the triggering event, we cannot reliably estimate our commitment under the CORe program. Due to the nature of the program, in the normal course of business, the commitment related to the future payment to advisors on release of a block of business would be expected to be matched or partially matched by a corresponding amount related to the receivable on the assignment of blocks of business to new advisors, resulting in an immaterial impact to earnings and liquidity in any reporting period.\n\n## 22.E Indemnities and Guarantees\n\nIn the normal course of our business, we have entered into agreements that include indemnities in favour of third parties, such as confidentiality agreements, engagement letters with advisors and consultants, outsourcing agreements, leasing contracts, trade-mark licensing agreements, underwriting and agency agreements, information technology agreements, distribution agreements, financing agreements, the sale of equity interests, and service agreements. These agreements may require us to compensate the counterparties for damages, losses or costs incurred by the counterparties as a result of breaches in representation, changes in regulations (including tax matters), or as a result of litigation claims or statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction. We have also agreed to indemnify our directors and certain of our officers and employees in accordance with our by-laws. These indemnification provisions will vary based upon the nature and terms of the agreements. In many cases, these indemnification provisions do not contain limits on our liability, and the occurrence of contingent events that will trigger payment under these indemnities is difficult to predict. As a result, we cannot estimate our potential liability under these indemnities. We believe that the likelihood of conditions arising that would trigger these indemnities is remote and, historically, we have not made any significant payment under such indemnification provisions. In certain cases, we have recourse against third parties with respect to the aforesaid indemnities, and we also maintain insurance policies that may provide coverage against certain of these claims.\n\nIn the normal course of our business, we have entered into purchase and sale agreements that include indemnities in favour of third parties. These agreements may require us to compensate the counterparties for damages, losses, or costs incurred by the counterparties as a result of breaches in representation. As at December 31, 2023, we are not aware of any breaches in representations that would result in any payment required under these indemnities that would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nGuarantees made by us that can be quantified are included in Note 6.A.i.\n\n## 22.F Guarantees of Sun Life Assurance Preferred Shares and Subordinated Debentures\n\nSLF Inc. has provided a guarantee on the $150 of 6.30% subordinated debentures due 2028 issued by Sun Life Assurance. Claims under this guarantee will rank equally with all other subordinated indebtedness of SLF Inc. SLF Inc. has also provided a subordinated guarantee of preferred shares issued from time to time by Sun Life Assurance, other than such preferred shares which are held by SLF Inc. and its affiliates. Sun Life Assurance has no outstanding preferred shares subject to the guarantee. As a result of these guarantees, Sun Life Assurance is entitled to rely on exemptive relief from most continuous disclosure and the certification requirements of Canadian securities laws.",

        "page_content": "## 22.G Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\nWe are regularly involved in legal actions, both as a defendant and as a plaintiff. Legal actions naming us as a defendant ordinarily involve our activities as a provider of insurance protection and wealth management products, as an investor and investment advisor, and as an employer. In addition, government and regulatory bodies in Canada, the U.S., the UK, and Asia, including federal, provincial, and state securities and insurance regulators, tax authorities, and other government authorities, from time to time, make inquiries and require the production of information or conduct examinations or investigations concerning our compliance with tax, insurance, securities, and other laws.\n\nProvisions for legal proceedings related to insurance contracts, such as for disability and life insurance claims and the cost of litigation, are included in Insurance contract liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Other provisions are established outside of the Insurance contract liabilities if, in the opinion of management, it is both probable that a payment will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Management reviews the status of all proceedings on an ongoing basis and exercises judgment in resolving them in such manner as management believes to be in our best interest.\n\nTwo class action lawsuits have been filed against Sun Life Assurance in connection with sales practices relating to, and the administration of, individual policies issued by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MLIC\"). These policies were assumed by Clarica when Clarica acquired the bulk of MLIC's Canadian operations in 1998 and subsequently assumed by Sun Life Assurance as a result of its amalgamation with Clarica. One of the lawsuits ( Fehr et al v Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ) is issued in Ontario and the other ( Alamwala v Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ) is in British Columbia. The Fehr action has been certified as a class action and notice has been made to class members. Sun Life Assurance has brought a motion for summary judgment seeking to dismiss all of the claims. The other action ( Alamwala v Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ) has remained largely dormant since it was commenced in 2011 and has not been certified. We will continue to vigorously defend against the claims in these actions. In connection with the acquisition of the Canadian operations of MLIC, MLIC agreed to indemnify Clarica for certain losses, including those incurred relating to the sales of its policies. Should either of the Fehr or the Alamwala lawsuits result in a loss, Sun Life Assurance will seek recourse against MLIC under that indemnity through arbitration.\n\nAn Ontario class action lawsuit has been certified against Sun Life Assurance regarding the administration of disability benefits under the Government of Canada employee benefits plan ( Belec v Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ). Notice of the class action will be sent to potential class members. The Company has substantive defences to the claims and is defending this lawsuit.\n\nManagement does not believe that the probable conclusion of any current legal, regulatory or tax matter, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position or the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## 23. Related Party Transactions\n\nSLF Inc. and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates transact business worldwide. All transactions between SLF Inc. and its subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation. Transactions with joint ventures and associates, which are also related parties, are disclosed in Note 15. Transactions between the Company and related parties are executed and priced on an arm's-length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.\n\n## 23.A Transactions with Key Management Personnel, Remuneration and Other Compensation\n\nKey management personnel refers to the executive team and Board of Directors of SLF Inc. These individuals have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and controlling the activities of the Company. The aggregate compensation to the executive team and directors are as follows:\n\n| For the years ended December 31,              | 2023           | 2023      | 2022           | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|\n|                                               | Executive team | Directors | Executive team | Directors |\n| Number of individuals                         | 12             | 11        | 13             | 11        |\n| Base salary and annual incentive compensation | $  26          | $  -      | $  19          | $  -      |\n| Additional short-term benefits and other      | $  1           | $  -      | $  1           | $  -      |\n| Share-based long-term incentive compensation  | $  28          | $  4      | $  32          | $  3      |\n| Value of pension and post-retirement benefits | $  2           | $  -      | $  2           | $  -      |\n\n## 23.B Other Related Party Transactions\n\nWe provide investment management services for our pension plans. The services are provided on substantially the same terms as for comparable transactions with third parties. We also hold units of investment funds managed by certain of our joint ventures. The carrying amount of our investment in these funds is included in Note 15.D.",

        "page_content": "## 24. Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for eligible employees. All of our material defined benefit plans worldwide are closed to new entrants with new hires participating in defined contribution plans. Material defined benefit plans are located in Canada and the U.S. The defined benefit pension plans offer benefits based on length of service and final average earnings and certain plans offer some indexation of benefits. The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the employee group and countries in which employees are located. In addition, we maintain supplementary non-contributory defined benefit pension arrangements for eligible employees, which are primarily for benefits which are in excess of local tax limits. As at December 31, 2014, there are no active members in the U.S. defined benefit plans continuing to accrue future service benefits. On January 1, 2009, the Canadian defined benefit plans were closed to new employees. In 2023, all assets and liabilities associated with the UK pension plans were transferred to the buyer as part of the sale of Sun Life's UK business. Canadian employees hired before January 1, 2009 continue to earn future service benefits in the previous plans, which includes both defined benefit and defined contribution components, while new hires since then are eligible to join a defined contribution plan. In addition, one small defined benefit plan in the Philippines remains open to new hires.\n\nOur funding policy for defined benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by regulations in the countries in which the plans are offered. The defined benefit pension arrangements are governed by local pension committees. Significant plan changes require the approval of the Board of Directors of the sponsoring subsidiary of SLF Inc.\n\nWe also established defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to these defined contribution pension plans may be subject to certain vesting requirements. Generally, our contributions are a set percentage of employees' annual income and may be a set percentage of employee contributions, up to specified levels.\n\nIn addition to our pension plans, in Canada and the U.S., we provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and to their dependents upon meeting certain requirements. Eligible retirees may be required to pay a portion of the premiums for these benefits and, in general, deductible amounts and co-insurance percentages apply to benefit payments. These post-retirement benefits are not pre-funded. In Canada, certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits are provided for eligible employees who retired before December 31, 2015. Eligible employees in Canada who retire after December 31, 2015 will have access to voluntary retiree-paid health care coverage. In the U.S., certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits are provided to eligible retirees. In the U.S., employees who were not age 50 with 10 years of service as of December 31, 2015 only have access to subsidized retiree health care coverage until eligible for Medicare. Eligible existing and future retirees and covered dependents eligible for Medicare receive an annual contribution to a health reimbursement account to be applied against individual coverage and other eligible expenses.\n\n## 24.A Risks Associated with Employee Defined Benefit Plans\n\nWith the closure of the material defined benefit pension and retiree benefit plans to new entrants, the volatility associated with future service accruals for active members has been limited and will decline over time.\n\nThe major risks remaining in relation to past service obligations are increases in liabilities due to a decline in discount rates, greater life expectancy than assumed and adverse asset returns. We have significantly de-risked the investments of our material defined benefit pension plans Company-wide by shifting the pension asset mix away from equities and into more fixed income and liability-matching investments. In 2023, all asset and liabilities associated with the UK pension plans were transferred to the buyer as part of the sale of Sun Life's UK business. The target for our material funded defined benefit plans is to minimize volatility in funded status arising from changes in discount rates and exposure to equity markets.",

In countries where a deep corporate market does not exist, government bonds are used. Compensation and health care trend assumptions are based on expected long-term trend assumptions which may differ from actual results.\n\n## 24.D Sensitivity of Key Assumptions\n\nThe following table provides the potential impact of changes in key assumptions on the defined benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans as at December 31, 2023. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. The impact of changes in each key assumption may result in greater than proportional changes in sensitivities.\n\n|                                           | Pension   | Post-retirement benefits   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------|\n| Interest/discount rate sensitivity: (1)   |           |                            |\n| 1% decrease                               | $  354    | $  21                      |\n| 1% increase                               | $  (287)  | $  (18)                    |\n| Rate of compensation increase assumption: |           |                            |\n| 1% decrease                               | $  (45)   | n/a                        |\n| 1% increase                               | $  50     | n/a                        |\n| Health care trend rate assumption:        |           |                            |\n| 1% decrease                               | n/a       | $  (9)                     |\n| 1% increase                               | n/a       | $  10                      |\n| Mortality rates: (2)                      |           |                            |\n| 10% decrease                              | $  49     | $  3                       |",

In 2023, 4% of our fixed income investments (2022 - 2%) are determined based on valuation techniques consistent with Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe assets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily held in trust for plan members, and are managed within the provisions of each plan's investment policies and procedures. Diversification of the investments is used to limit credit, market, and foreign currency risks. We have significantly de-risked the investments of our material defined benefit pension plans by shifting the pension asset mix away from equities and into more fixed income and liability-matching investments. In 2018 and in 2021, the risk in our UK pension plan was reduced through buy-in insurance contracts, protecting the majority of pensioner benefits. The long-term investment objectives of the defined benefit pension plans are to equal or exceed the rate of growth of the liabilities. Over shorter periods, the objective of the defined benefit pension plan investment strategy is to minimize volatility in the funded status. Liquidity is managed with consideration to the cash flow requirements of the liabilities.\n\n## 24.F Future Cash Flows\n\nThe following tables set forth the expected contributions and expected future benefit payments of the defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans:\n\n|                                               | Pension   | Post-retirement   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|\n| Expected contributions for the next 12 months | $  47     | $  17             | $  64   |\n\n## Expected Future Benefit Payments\n\n|                 | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   | 2029 to 2033   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| Pension         | $  128 | $  133 | $  138 | $  142 | $  148 | $  769         |\n| Post-retirement | 17     | 18     | 18     | 19     | 19     | 106            |\n| Total           | $  145 | $  151 | $  156 | $  161 | $  167 | $  875         |\n\n## 24.G Defined Contribution Plans\n\nWe expensed $199 in 2023 (2022 - $160) with respect to defined contribution plans.\n\n## 25.

        "page_content": "## Drivers of Earnings\n\nThe Drivers of Earnings (DOE) is a non-International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) financial measure. The DOE analysis provides additional detail on the sources of earnings, primarily for protection and health businesses, and explains the actual results compared to the longer term expectations. The underlying DOE and reported DOE are both presented on a common shareholders' basis by removing the allocations to participating policyholders.\n\nThe terminology used in the discussion of DOE is described below:\n\n## Risk adjustment release\n\nThe compensation we require for bearing uncertainty about the amount and timing of the cash flows that arises from non-financial risk.\n\n## Contractual service margin (CSM) recognized for services provided\n\nThe amount of CSM recognized as insurance revenue in each period to reflect the insurance contract services provided for a group of contracts in the period .\n\n## Expected earnings on short-term (group) insurance business\n\nGroup - Health & Protection profits recognized over a short coverage period. Excludes Administrative Services Only (ASO) business, presented in the 'Other fee income' line.\n\n## Impact of new insurance business\n\nRepresents 'onerous' new business for the period. An onerous contract does not necessarily mean it is unprofitable business .\n\n## Experience gains (losses):\n\nGains and losses that are due to differences between the actual results during the reporting period and management's estimate of the expected longer-term returns liabilities (i.e. expected insurance earnings) at the start of the reporting period .\n\n## Expected investment earnings\n\nReflects the spread between the expected investment return on general account assets and the discount rate (net of margins for credit risk) on insurance contract liabilities and crediting rate of investment contract liabilities.\n\n## Credit experience\n\nImpact of ratings changes, and impairments (net of recoveries) on FVTPL assets. Includes changes in expected credit loss provisions on FVOCI assets. Expected credit is reflected in the 'Expected investment earnings' line.\n\n## Earnings on surplus\n\nRepresents the net income earned on a company's surplus funds. Earnings on Surplus is comprised of realized gains on fair value through other comprehensive income assets, as well as net investment returns on surplus, such as investment income, gains (losses) on seed investments and investment properties mark-to-market, and also includes impacts from derivatives, currency and other items.\n\n## Joint Ventures & Other\n\nJoint venture earnings from India, Malaysia and China. Other includes various smaller investment-related items that may arise from period to period.\n\n## Asset management - Underlying\n\nRepresents pre-tax earnings (net of expenses) for MFS and SLC Management .\n\n## Other fee income\n\nIncludes pre-tax earnings (net of expenses) for certain wealth businesses in Canada and Asia as well as Canada & U.S. fee-based businesses (e.g. ASO from Group - Health & Protection) and fee income from Open par account in Canada.\n\n## Expenses - other\n\nNon-directly attributable contract expenses, corporate expenses, strategic initiatives and financing charges.\n\n## Market-related impacts\n\nMarket-related impacts represent the difference between actual versus expected market movements. Except for risk free rates which are based on current rates, expected market movements are based on our medium-term outlook which is reviewed annually.\n\n## Assumption Changes and Management Actions (ACMA)\n\nCaptures the impact of method and assumption changes, and management actions on insurance and reinsurance contracts.\n\n## Other adjustments\n\nIncome impact from items that are not operational or ongoing in nature:\n\n- i. Management's ownership of MFS shares - this adjustment removes the change  in  fair  value  and  other  activity related to MFS common shares owned by management.\n- ii. Acquisition, integration, and restructuring - expense and income related to acquisition or disposal of a business. Also includes expenses related to restructuring activities.\n- iii. Intangible asset amortization - removes the amortization expense associated with finite life intangible assets arising from acquisitions or business combinations excluding amortization of software and distribution agreements.\n- iv. Other - represents items that are unusual or exceptional in nature which management believes are not representative of the long-term performance of the Company.",

These included favourable impacts from modelling enhancements in Asia and financial-related assumptions, which were partially offset by unfavourable policyholder behaviour updates in Asia, mortality updates in the U.S., and refinements to Sun Life Health in Canada.\n\nOther adjustments in 2023 decreased reported net income  $224 million, reflecting DentaQuest integration costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, and SLC Management acquisition-related costs (4) , partially offset by gains on the sale of the sponsored markets business in Canada (5) and the sale of Sun Life UK (1) , and the impact of the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Change (6) .\n\n2\n\n2022 restated results may not be fully representative of our future earnings profile, as we were not managing our asset and liability portfolios under the new standards.

See section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in our 2023 Annual Management's Discussion and Analysis ('MD&A') for further information.\n\n3 Business pillars refer to our business segments. Excludes Corporate underlying net loss of $(377)M. 2023 reported net income by business pillar (excludes Corporate reported net loss of $(320)M): Asset Management: 31%; Canada: 37%; U.S.: 17%; Asia: 15%.\n\n4 Business Mix based on underlying net income, excluding Corporate expenses and other. Wealth & Asset Management includes MFS Investment Management, SLC Management, Canada Individual Wealth, Group Retirement Services, Asia Wealth & Asset Management. Group - Health & Protection includes Canada Sun Life Health, U.S. Group Benefits (Employee Benefits and Health and Risk Solutions) and U.S. Dental. Individual - Protection includes Canada Individual Insurance, U.S. In-force Management and Asia Individual - Protection.\n\n5 Underlying earnings per share ('EPS'), underlying ROE and underlying dividend payout ratio are non-IFRS financial measures. See section M - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in our 2023 Annual MD&A for further information. Underlying dividend payout ratio represents the ratio of common shareholders' dividends to diluted underlying EPS. See section J - Capital and Liquidity Management - 3 - Shareholder Dividends in our 2023 Annual MD&A for further information regarding dividends.\n\n6 Our medium-term financial objective for underlying ROE changed to 18%+ following the adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, an increase from 16%+ prior to transition. Our medium-term financial objectives remain consistent for underlying earnings per share and underlying dividend payout ratio following the adoption of both standards. 2022 restated results may not be fully representative of our future earnings profile, as we were not managing our asset and liability portfolios under the new standards. See the heading 'Note to Readers: 2022 Restated Results on Adoption of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9' in section A - How We Report Our Results of our 2023 Annual MD&A.\n\n7 Although considered reasonable, we may not be able to achieve our medium-term financial objectives as our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results could differ materially from our medium-term financial objectives as described above. Our medium-term financial objectives do not constitute guidance. Our medium-term financial objectives are forwardlooking non-IFRS financial measures and additional information is provided in our 2023 Annual MD&A in section P - Forward-looking Statements - Medium-Term Financial Objectives.\n\n8 Underlying EPS growth, ROE and dividend payout ratio are calculated using an average. Underlying EPS growth reflects 1-year growth (2023 over 2022). The beginning period is January 1, 2022 and ending period is December 31, 2023.\n\n9 2022 results have been restated for the adoption of IFRS 17 and the related IFRS 9 classification overlay ('the new standards'). The restated results may not be fully representative of our future earnings profile, as we were not managing our asset and liability portfolios under the new standards. The majority of the actions taken to re-balance asset portfolios and transition asset-liability management execution to an IFRS 17 basis occurred in Q1'23. Accordingly, analysis based on 2022 comparative results may not necessarily be indicative of future trends and should be interpreted with this context. Using sensitivities to analyze the outlook for market risk and related impacts (e.g., interest rate sensitivities) will be more representative starting with the sensitivities disclosed for Q1'23 and onward in section K - Risk Management in our MD&A for the period ended December 31, 2023 ('2023 Annual MD&A') and section I - Risk Management in each quarter's respective interim MD&A document. Certain 2022 restated results and 2023 interim results in the Drivers of Earnings and CSM Movement Analysis were refined to more accurately reflect how management views the business.\n\n10 Percentage result is a 5-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) from 2018 to 2023.\n\n11 Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test ('LICAT') ratio. Our LICAT ratios are calculated in accordance with the OSFI-mandated guideline, Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test.\n\n## Endnotes from pages 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.\n\n- 12 Simpill Health Group operating as Pillway.\n- 13 According to Insurance Authority's Provisional Statistics for Long Term Business 2021-2023, Bowtie ranked first in number of new individual paid policies through direct channel in Hong Kong.",
