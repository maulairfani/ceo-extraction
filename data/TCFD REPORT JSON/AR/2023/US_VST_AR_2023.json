The company's investment in a growing number of nuclear power plants and solar facilities is paired with substantial battery energy storage capacity.\n\nIn 2023, Vistra completed a milestone expansion of its Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility, bringing the project's total capacity to 750 MW/3,000 MWh. This storage facility, which is among the largest in the world, is co-located on the same site with Vistra's existing natural gas-fueled Moss Landing Power Plant in Monterey County-a site that has provided critical electricity to Californians through various evolving generation technologies since 1950.\n\nExecuting its commitment to grow its zero-carbon portfolio has made Vistra a market leader in battery energy storage, as it now owns the second-most energy storage capacity in the country.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout the past year, and as we look to the future, we continue to capitalize on our four strategic priorities to drive value to all of our key stakeholders.\n\nWe continued our commitment to growing our zero-carbon generation portfolio through the creation of Vistra Vision and the announcement of our acquisition of Energy Harbor in the first quarter of 2023. Vistra Vision combines Vistra's nuclear, retail, renewables, and battery energy storage assets with Energy Harbor's nuclear and retail assets to create one of the largest clean energy businesses in the country. We closed the acquisition on March 1, 2024, and look forward to fully integrating the businesses and realizing the synergies this transformative acquisition brings. Building on the success of Vistra Vision, we also brought online an additional 350 megawatts of battery energy storage at our Moss Landing site in California. This brings the total to 750 megawatts of battery energy storage, backed by contracted revenues. Our Vistra Tradition assets, comprised of our large flexible natural gas-powered fleet and coal-powered assets, provide the dispatchable, reliable, and a/ffordable power that is in increasing demand across the United States.\n\nWe continue to capitalize on our four strategic priorities to drive value to all of our key stakeholders.\n\nJim Burke President & Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nAltogether, Vistra brings approximately 41,000 megawatts to power markets across the country while serving nearly 5 million retail customers who have a choice of an electric provider.\n\nWe also remained disciplined in our approach to capital allocation. We delivered on our capital allocation program by repurchasing $1.26 billion in shares throughout 2023, equating to $3.5 billion in share repurchases since the program began in November 2021. We continued to execute our dividend policy of $300 million in dividends annually while allowing the per share dividend to grow. Most recently we received Board approval for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases expected to be utilized through year end 2025, allowing us to meet and exceed our goal of at least $1 billion of share repurchases in 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn the next pages, I will discuss our key milestones from the year in greater detail, while also pointing toward our goals and vision for the future.",

Our integrated operations are the cornerstone of our company, and we remain confident that our best-in-class, e/fficient, low-cost generation fleet along with a stable, customer-centric retail business, will continue to drive Vistra forward well into the future.\n\n## Financial Achievements\n\nWe began 2023 on the heels of a strong 2022. This momentum brought us into the year ready to achieve the guidance expectations we set while delivering on our strategic priorities.\n\nAs is becoming more typical, weather events came into play and Vistra was prepared to perform. Multi-part winterization e/fforts enabled us to deliver as Winter Storm Mara spread through Texas in early 2023, while commercial and fleet optimization activities during the record Texas summer heat ensured that we served increased retail load without negative impacts to our financial results. Throughout 2023, we demonstrated that our\n\ncommercial, generation, and retail capabilities are top tier, creating value and maintaining resiliency across many and varied economic and weather\n\nconditions.\n\nOur outlook for 2023 started o/ff solid with a guidance range of Ongoing Operations Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $3.4 billion to $4.0 billion. As our team pressed forward, we then narrowed that guidance on the second quarter 2023 call to $3.6 billion to\n\nOur financial results speak for themselves as we ended the year exceeding the upper end of our raised guidance.\n\n$4.0 billion. Continuing this strength, and following the strong summer performance, we further narrowed and increased our 2023 guidance to $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion on the third quarter 2023 earnings call. Our best-in-class retail, generation, and commercial capabilities, combined with our strong employee base allowed Vistra to drive value to our shareholders throughout the year. Our financial results speak for themselves as we ended the year exceeding the upper end of our raised guidance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also achieved $2.49 billion of Adjusted Free Cash Flow before Growth, exceeding the midpoint of the original guidance by $441 million.\n\nRetail\n\nVistra's retail team continues to perform year after year. Their innovative spirit and dedication produce industry-leading results and customer satisfaction. Our retail team continued to increase customer counts across the markets we serve, while introducing new and exciting campaigns. Our flagship retail brand, TXU Energy, saw its third consecutive year of organic growth in ERCOT, increasing residential customer counts year-over-year. We have held a 5-star rating by the Public Utility Commission of Texas for 15 straight months, demonstrating our drive for success and execution. Exceptional sales performance in our large business markets category exceeded expectations. In the Midwest and Northeast, competitive retailer costs decreased as default service prices quickly increased, inverting the dynamic observed the previous year. The team capitalized on this dynamic, growing customer counts while delivering attractive margins.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVISTRA\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n3\n\nVistra owns and operates the second-largest competitive nuclear power fleet in the U.S. Pictured: Vistra's Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant in Glen Rose, Texas, with\n\n~2,400 MW of zero-carbon nuclear generation capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRetail continues to drive innovation in product o/fferings. TXU Energy's 'Daytime Pass' is a firstof-its-kind plan giving customers half o/ff energy charges automatically, every day, all year long. This plan is helping to fill an unmet need, appealing to those who work from home, and rounding out our time-of-use product portfolio.\n\n## Generation\n\nOur generation team had yet another strong year in volatile commodity and weather conditions. The team's unparalleled commitment is illustrated by the 95.5% commercial availability achieved fleet-wide in 2023 2 while our Best Defense safety program delivered a top quartile Total Recordable Incident Rate. 3 This past summer, we saw unprecedented heat in Texas breaking temperature and demand records. Our Texas fleet's leading commercial availability at 95.7% 4 plus the operational flexibility allowed us to capitalize on our unhedged generation while keeping the air conditioner on for our customers at competitive prices. In the other markets we operate, the milder weather allowed our commercial optimization activities to shine. Overall, the diverse conditions allowed Vistra to demonstrate the operational excellence our team members deliver, no matter the weather-providing value to our shareholders and keeping the lights on for our customers and communities.",

When this plan was originally announced in November 2021, it anticipated a return of capital of at least $7.5 billion to our common shareholders through year-end 2026. Through February 23, 2024, we executed approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchases and paid $0.6 billion in dividends since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. This policy reduced Vistra's share count by ~28% from November 2021 while the consistent allocation of $300 million in dividends per year results in our dividend per share increase of ~43% since November 2021. Concurrent with fourth quarter 2023 earnings, we announced Board approval for an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases expected to be utilized through 2025. We plan for the dividend per share growth to persist each quarter as we continue to reduce our share count.\n\n## Strong Balance Sheet\n\nA strong balance sheet is core to Vistra's strategy and will remain a priority as we move into the future. We remain committed to a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero, of less than 3x. 5 The strength of our balance sheet will enable us to perform for our shareholders, employees, and customers. Vistra achieved sub-3x leverage at year-end and remained near 3x following the Energy Harbor acquisition, delivering on our low-leverage commitment.\n\nClean Energy Investments\n\nStrategic growth of our clean energy portfolio\n\nis of upmost importance as we are a leader in energy transformation. This year we announced the creation of our leading zero-carbon generation and retail integrated platform, Vistra Vision. Within our Vistra Vision platform we plan for innovative and disciplined growth of our zero-carbon generation portfolio, driving value through diversified markets and generation sources.\n\nVISTRA\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nVistra has several green-focused targets that directly support our key tenets of reliability, a/ffordability, and sustainability. We have targets in place to achieve a 60% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, with a net-zero target by 2050. 6 Recent portfolio transformations are bringing our fleet into the future, with:\n\n- \u00b7  ~7,800 megawatts of zero-carbon generation currently online, including ~6,400 megawatts from our nuclear plants, including Energy Harbor\n- \u00b7  ~15,150 megawatts of fossil generation retired since 2010\n- \u00b7~10,400 megawatts retired since 2018\n- \u00b7  On track for ~20,000 megawatts total retired by 2027 (from 2010 baseline)\n\nIn 2023, Vistra began the year announcing the transformative clean energy acquisition of Energy Harbor, which added ~4,000 megawatts of zero-carbon nuclear generation to our fleet and ~1 million new retail customers. We successfully closed this acquisition on March 1, 2024, and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA strong balance sheet is core to Vistra's strategy and will remain a priority as we move into the future.\n\nenjoyed welcoming our new Energy Harbor\n\ncolleagues into the Vistra family.

This addition came online ahead of schedule and within budget, despite a challenging supply chain environment and extreme rainfall, and is supported by contracted revenues. We continue to see additional opportunities to add batteries to this site in the future as we evaluate future zero-carbon opportunities.\n\nLastly, we announced our expectation to begin construction in the spring of 2024 on our three larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments located at our former coal plant sites. This is part of our Illinois Coal to Solar and Energy Storage Initiative, and we expect these projects to exceed our target return thresholds, displaying our responsible clean energy investments and disciplined capital approach.\n\nWe are excited for all that is on the horizon for our Vistra Vision platform.

The Company incentivized certain large commercial and industrial customers to curtail their usage during Winter Storm Uri by providing bill credits for use in future periods. The Company believes the inclusion of the bill credits as a reduction to Adjusted EBITDA in the years in which such bill credits are applied more accurately reflects its operating performance. We estimate remaining bill credit amounts to be applied in future periods for 2024 (approximately $11 million) and 2025 (approximately $26 million).\n\n## Non-GAAP Reconciliations - 2023 Adjusted Free Cash Flow\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 (Unaudited) (Millions of Dollars)\n\n|                                                                                | Ongoing Operations   | Asset Closure   | Vistra Consolidated   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                                | 4,140                | (39)            | 4,101                 |\n| Interest paid, net (a)                                                         | (560)                | -               | (560)                 |\n| Taxes paid net of refunds                                                      | (24)                 | -               | (24)                  |\n| Working capital and margin deposits                                            | 1,887                | (3)             | 1,884                 |\n| Accrued environmental allowances                                               | 336                  | -               | 336                   |\n| Reclamation and remediation Transition and merger expense, including severance | (3) (58)             | (16) (23)       | (19)                  |\n| Other changes in other operating assets and liabilities                        | (63)                 | (121)           | (81) (184)            |\n| Cash provided by (used in) operating activities                                | 5,655                | (202)           | 5,453                 |\n| Capital expenditures including nuclear fuel purchases and LTSA prepayments (b) | (994)                | -               | (994)                 |\n| Development and growth expenditures                                            | (682)                | -               | (682)                 |\n| (Purchase)/sale of environmental allowances                                    | (571)                | -               | (571)                 |\n| Other net investing activities (c)                                             | (5)                  | 107             | 102                   |\n| Free cash flow                                                                 | 3,403                | (95)            | 3,308                 |\n| Working capital and margin deposits                                            | (1,887)              | 3               | (1,884)               |\n| Development and growth expenditures                                            | 682                  | -               | 682                   |\n| Accrued environmental allowances                                               | (336)                | -               | (336)                 |\n| Purchases and sales of environmental credits and allowances, net               | 571                  | -               | 571                   |\n| Transition and merger expense, including severance                             | 58                   | 23              | 81                    |\n| Adjusted free cash flow before growth                                          | 2,491                | (69)            | 2,422                 |\n\n(a) Net of interest received.\n\n(b)  Includes $227 million LTSA prepaid capital expenditures\n\n(c)  Includes investments in and proceeds from the nuclear decommissioning trust fund, insurance proceeds, proceeds from sales of assets, proceeds from sales of\n\nVISTRA\n\n2023 ANNUAL REPORT\n\n8",

ISOs/RTOs administerenergyand ancillary servicemarkets in theshortterm, whichusually consists of day-ahead andreal-time markets. SeveralISOs/RTOs also ensure long-term planning reserves through monthly, semiannual, annualand multi-year capacity markets. TheISOs/RTOs that oversee most of thewholesalepower marketsinwhich we operate currently impose, andwill likelycontinue to impose, bidand pricelimits or othersimilarmechanisms. NERC regions andISOs/RTOs oftenhavedifferent geographicfootprints,and while theremay be geographicoverlap between NERC regions andISOs/RTOs,their respectiveroles andresponsibilities do not\n\ngenerally overlap.\n\nIn ISO/RTOregions with centrally dispatched market structures (e.g., ERCOT, PJM, ISO-NE,NYISO,MISO, and CAISO),all generators sellingintothe centralized market receive thesameprice forenergysoldbased on thebid price associated with theproduction of thelastMWh that is needed to balancesupplywith demand within adesignatedzone or at a givenlocation.

Generatorswill receive thelocation-basedmarginalprice fortheir output.\n\nERCOT -ERCOT is an ISOthatmanages theflowofelectricity from approximately 98,000 MW of expected Summer 2023 peak generationcapacitytoapproximately 26 million Texascustomers,representingapproximately 90% of thestate's electricload.\n\nAs an energy-onlymarket, ERCOT'smarketdesignisdistinctfromother competitiveelectricity marketsinthe U.S. Othermarkets maintain aminimumplanning reservemarginthrough regulated planning, resource adequacy requirementsand/ or capacity markets. In contrast,ERCOT'sresourceadequacy is currently predominatelydependent on energy-market price signals. The PUCT hasvoted to recommend aPerformance Credit Mechanism(PCM) that wouldalignarequiredreliability standard with resource availability duringhigher-risk system conditions in acentrally-cleared market. These changesare currently beingevaluated by thePUCTand ERCOTand have not been implemented as of thedatehereof. In 2014, ERCOT implemented theOperatingReserve Demand Curve(ORDC), pursuanttowhich wholesaleelectricity prices in thereal-time electricity market increase automatically as availableoperatingreservesdecreasebelow definedthresholdlevels, creatinga priceadder. Theslope of theORDCcurve is determined through amathematical loss of load probability calculation using forecasted reserves andhistorical data. InbothMarch 2019 andMarch 2020, ERCOTimplemented 0.25 standard deviation shifts in thelossofloadprobability calculationand movedtousing asingleblendedORDCcurve;these changesresultedina more rapidescalationinpower prices as operatingreservesfallbelow definedthresholds. EffectiveJanuary 1, 2022, when operatingreservesdropto3,000 MW or less, theORDCautomatically adjustspower prices to $5,000/MWhwhich is equalto thehighsystem-wide offercap. ERCOTalsocalculatesthe \"peakernet margin\"based on revenuesahypothetical unhedged peakingunitwouldcollect in themarket. If thepeaker netmarginexceedsacertain threshold, thesystem-wide offercap is reduced to thelow system-wideoffercap of $2,000/MWhfor theremainderofthe calendaryear. InDecember2023, thePUCT also approvedanEmergency PricingProgram that temporarily lowers thesystem-wide offercap to $2,000/MWhifprices have been at thecap for12hoursinarolling24-hour period. Historically,highdemanddue to elevated temperatures in thesummer months or high demand due to reduced temperatures in the winter months, combined with underperformance of wind generation, hascreated theconditions duringwhich theORDCcontributes meaningfully to power prices. Extreme weather conditions can also lead to scarcity conditions regardless of season. Otherthanduringperiods of \"scarcity pricing,\" theprice of power is typically setbynatural gas-fueled generation facilities(seeItem7.

The day-ahead market is avoluntary, financialelectricity market conductedthe daybeforeeach operatingday in whichgeneratorsand purchasersofelectricity maybid forone or more hoursofelectricity supplyorconsumption. Thereal-time market is aphysical market in which electricity is dispatched and priced in five-minute intervals.

ERCOT currently procures ancillary services in theday-ahead market, but planstoimplement co-optimizationofenergyand ancillaryservices in thereal-time market in 2026. Because ERCOThas one of thehighest concentrations of wind andsolar capacity generationamong U.S. markets, theERCOTmarketismore susceptible to fluctuations in wholesaleelectricity supplydue to intermittent wind andsolar production, making ERCOTmore vulnerabletoperiods of generationscarcity. Beginning in July 2021, ERCOThas increased its ancillary serviceprocurement volumes to maintain amoreconservativelevel of operating reserves. ERCOTimplemented theERCOTContingencyReserve Service(ECRS)inJune 2023 to furtheraddressthe need foroperatingreservestomanageloadand intermittent resource output uncertainty.

Thecapacity market is comprisedofGeneric,Flexibleand Local Resource Adequacy (RA) Capacity andisadministeredbythe CaliforniaPublic UtilitiesCommission (CPUC). Unlike othercentrally cleared capacity markets, theresource adequacy marketsinCaliforniaare primarily bilaterally traded markets. In 2020, theCPUCintroduced acentral procuremententityfor Local RA Capacity effectivefor the2023 complianceyear. The central procurement entityruns apay-as-bidauction forLocal RA Capacity. InNovember 2016, CAISOimplemented a voluntarycapacity auctionfor annual, monthly, andintra-month procurementtocoverfor deficiencies in themarket.

Market demand, also knownasload, faced by electricpower systems, such as thoseweoperate in,variesfrommomenttomomentasaresult of changesinbusiness andresidentialdemand, whichisoften driven by weather. Unlike most othercommodities, theproductionand consumptionof electricity must remain balanced on an instantaneous basis. Thereisacertain baselinedemandfor electricity acrossanelectric power system that occurs throughout theday,which is typically satisfied by baseload generationunits with lowvariable operatingcosts. Baseloadgenerationunits can also increase output to satisfy certain incrementaldemandand reduceoutput when demand is unusually low. Intermediate/load-following generationunits,which can more efficiently change theiroutput to satisfy increases in demand, typically satisfy alarge proportionofchangesinintradayloadastheyrespond to daily increases in demand or unexpected changesinsupplycreated by reduced generationfromrenewable resources or othergenerator outages. Peak daily loadsmay be satisfied by peakingunits. Peaking units aretypically themostexpensivetooperate,but they can quickly startupand shut downtomeet briefpeaksindemand. In general, baseload units,intermediate/load following units and peakingunits aredispatchedintothe ISO/RTOgridinorder from lowest to highest variable cost.

Risk Factors foradditionaldiscussion of risksposed to us regardingregulatoryrequirements. SeeNote14tothe Financial Statements foradiscussion of litigationrelated to EPAreviews.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThereiscontinuing emphasisdomestically andinternationallyonglobalclimate change andhow GHG emissions,suchas CO2,contributetoglobalclimatechange. GHG emissions fromthe combustionoffossilfuels,primarily by our coal-fueledgenerationplantsaswellasour naturalgas-fueled generation plants representthe substantialmajority of our totalGHG emissions. CO2,methane andnitrous oxide areemitted in this combustionprocess, with CO2 representing thelargest portion of theseGHG emissions. Weestimatethatour generation facilitiesproduced approximately 95 millionshorttons of CO2 in the year ended2023.\n\nTo manage our environmentalimpact fromour businessactivitiesand reduceour emissions profile,Vistraset emissions reductiontargets. Vistraistargetingtoachieve a60% reductioninScope 1and Scope 2CO2equivalent emissions by 2030 as compared to a2010 baselinewith along-term goaltoachieve net-zerocarbon emissions by 2050, assuming necessary advancements in technology andsupportivemarketconstructs andpublic policy. Since2010, Vistra hasretired more than 15,100 MW of coal and naturalgas power plants resultingina50% reductionincarbon dioxide (CO2)emissions,a68% reductioninnitrogenoxide (NOX)emissions,and an 89% reductioninsulfurdioxide (SO2)emissions through year-end 2023, compared to a2010 baseline.

Inresponsetochallengesbrought by environmentalgroups and certain states,the U.S. CourtofAppealsfor theDistrictofColumbiaCircuit (D.C.Circuit Court) vacated theACE rule, including therepeal of theCPP,inJanuary 2021 andremandedthe rule to theEPA forfurther action. In June 2022, theU.S. SupremeCourtissued anopinion reversingthe D.C. CircuitCourt'sdecision, andfinding that theEPA exceeded its authority underSection111 of theClean AirAct when theEPA setemission requirementsinthe CPPbased on generationshifting. In October2022, theD.C.Circuit Courtissued an amendedjudgment, denying petitions forreviewofthe ACEruleand challenges to therepeal of theCPP. Inaddition, theEPA openedadocketseekinginput on questions relatedtothe regulationofGHGs underSection111(d) whichclosedinMarch 2023. In May2023, theEPA released anew proposal regulatingpower plant GHG emissions,while also proposingtorepeal theACE rule. The newGHG proposal sets limits for(a) newnatural gas-fired combustionturbines, (b)existingcoal-,oil- andnatural gas-firedsteam generationunits,and (c)certain existingnatural gasfiredcombustionturbines. Theproposed standardsare basedontechnologies such as carbon capture andsequestration/storage (CCS), low-GHG hydrogenco-firing, andnatural gasco-firing. Startingin2030, theproposal wouldgenerally require more CO2 emissions controlatfossilfuel-firedpower plants that operate more frequently andfor more yearsand wouldphase in increasinglystringent CO2 requirementsovertime. Underthe proposal,stateswouldberequiredtosubmit planstothe EPA within 24 months of therule'seffectivedatethatprovide forthe establishment, implementation, andenforcementofstandards of performancefor existing sources. These stateplans must generally establishstandardsthatare at leastasstringent as the EPA'semission guidelines. Existingsteam generationunits must startcomplying with theirstandardsofperformance on January 1, 2030. Existing combustionturbine units must startcomplying with theirstandardsofperformance on January 1, 2032, or January 1, 2035, depending on theirsubcategory. We submittedcommentstothe EPAonthisproposal in August 2023.\n\n## StateRegulationofGHGs\n\nMany states whereweoperate generationfacilities have,are considering, or areinsomestage of implementing, state-only regulatoryprogramsintendedtoreduceemissions of GHGs from stationary sources as ameansofaddressing climate change.\n\nRegional GreenhouseGas Initiative(RGGI) -RGGI is astate-drivenGHG emission controlprogram that took effect in 2009 andwas initiallyimplemented by tenNew Englandand Mid-Atlantic states to reduceCO2emissions frompower plants. TheparticipatingRGGI states implementedacap-and-tradeprogram. Compliancewith RGGI can be achievedbyreducing emissions,purchasingortrading allowances,orsecuring offset allowances fromanapprovedoffset project. Weare requiredto holdallowances equaltoatleast 50 percentofemissions in each of thefirst twoyearsofthe three-year controlperiod.\n\nIn December2017, theRGGI states released an updatedmodelrulewith changestothe CO2 budgettrading program,\n\nincluding an additional30percent reductioninthe CO2 annualcap by theyear2030, relativeto2020 levels.

In 2019, following challengesbynumerous parties, theD.C.Circuit Courtfound that theCSAPR Update didnot fully addresscertain states'2008 ozone NAAQS obligations. InOctober2020, theEPA proposed an action to addressthe outstanding 2008 ozone NAAQS obligations in responsetothe D.C. CircuitCourt's2019 ruling. Vistra subsidiaries filedcommentsonthatrulemakinginDecember2020, and theEPA publishedafinalruleinthe FederalRegisteronApril 30, 2021 that reduces ozone season NOX budgets in certain states. Wedonot believe that thefinal rule causesamaterial adverseimpact on our future financialresults.\n\nIn October2015, theEPA revisedthe primary andsecondary ozone NAAQS to lowerthe 8-hour standard forozone emissions duringozone season (May to September). As requiredunderthe CAA, in October2018, theState of Texas submittedaStateImplementationPlan(SIP) to theEPA demonstratingthatemissions fromTexas sources do not contribute significantly to nonattainmentin, or interfere with maintenanceby, anyother statewith respect to therevised ozone NAAQS. In February 2023, theEPA disapprovedTexas'SIP andthe StateofTexas,Luminant, certain tradegroups,and others challengedthatdisapprovalinthe U.S. CourtofAppealsfor theFifth Circuit(FifthCircuit Court). InMarch 2023, thosesame partiesfiledmotions to stay theEPA's SIPdisapprovalinthe FifthCircuit Court, andthe EPAmovedtotransferour challenges to theD.C.Circuit Courtorhavethosechallengesdismissed.\n\nIn April2022, priortothe EPA'sdisapprovalofTexas'SIP,the EPAproposed aFederal Implementation Plan (FIP)to addressthe 2015 ozone NAAQS. We, along with many othercompanies,trade groups,statesand ISOs,including ERCOT, PJMand MISO,filed responsivecommentstothe EPA'sproposal in June 2022, expressing concerns about certain elements of theproposal,particularly thosethatmay result in challengestoelectricreliability undercertain conditions. InMarch 2023, the EPAadministrator signedits finalFIP. The FIPappliesto22statesbeginning with the2023 ozone seasons. Stateswhere Vistra operates electric generation units that would be subject to this rule are Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia andWestVirginia. Texaswouldbemovedintothe revisedGroup 3trading program previously establishedinthe RevisedCSAPR Update Rule that includesemission budgets for2023 that theEPA says areachievable through existingcontrols installedatpower plants. Allowances will be limitedunderthe program andwill be furtherreduced beginning in ozone season 2026 to alevel that is intendedtoreduceoperatingtime of coal-fueled power plants duringozone season or forcecoalplantstoretire, particularly thosethatdonot have selectivecatalytic reductionsystems such as our Martin Lake power plant.\n\nIn May2023, theFifth CircuitCourtgranted our motion to stay theEPA's disapprovalofTexas'SIP pending adecision\n\non themerits anddeniedthe EPA'smotiontotransferour challenge to theD.C.Circuit Court. As aresultofthe stay,wedonot believe theEPA hasauthoritytoimplement theFIP as to Texassources pending theresolutionofthe merits,meaningthat Texaswill remain in Group 2and not be subject to anyrequirementsunderthe FIPatleastuntil theFifth CircuitCourtrules on themerits.

ForSO2,the rule establishedanintrastateTexas emission allowance tradingprogram as a\"BART alternative\" that operatesinasimilar fashiontoaCSAPRtrading program. The program includes 39 generationunits (including theMartin Lake,Big Brown, Monticello,Sandow 4, Coleto Creek,Stryker2andGraham2 plants). Thecomplianceobligations in theprogram startedonJanuary 1, 2019. ForNOX,the rule adopted theCSAPR's ozone program as BART andfor particulatematter, theruleapprovedTexas'SIP that determines that no electricity generationunits aresubject to BART forparticulate matter. In August2020, theEPA issued afinal rule affirmingthe priorBARTfinal rule but also includedadditionalrevisions that were proposed in November 2019. Challengestoboththe 2017 rule andthe 2020 rules have been consolidated in theD.C.Circuit Court, wherewehaveintervenedinsupportofthe EPA. We areincompliancewith therule, andthe retirements of our Monticello,Big Brownand Sandow 4plantshaveenhanced our ability to comply. The EPA is in theprocessofreconsideringthe BART rule,and thechallengesinthe D.C. CircuitCourthavebeen held in abeyance pending theEPA's finalactiononreconsideration. In May2023, aproposed BART rule waspublishedinthe FederalRegister that wouldwithdraw thetrading program provisions of theprior rule andwouldestablishSO2limits on sixfacilitiesinTexas, including Martin Lake andColetoCreek. Underthe current proposal,compliancewouldberequiredwithin 3years forMartin Lake and5yearsfor Coleto Creek. Due to theannounced shutdownfor Coleto Creek,wedonot anticipateany impactsatthat facility, andweare evaluating potentialcomplianceoptions at Martin Lake shouldthisproposal become final. We submitted commentstothe EPAonthisproposal in August2023.\n\n## National AmbientAir QualityStandards (NAAQS)\n\nTheCAA requiresthe EPAtoregulateemissions of pollutantsconsidered harmfultopublic health andthe environment. TheEPA hasestablished NAAQS forsix such pollutants, includingSO2andozone. Each stateisresponsible fordeveloping a SIPthatwill attain andmaintainthe NAAQS. These plansmay result in theimpositionofemission limits on our facilities.\n\n## SO2 Designations forTexas\n\nIn November 2016, theEPA finalized its nonattainmentdesignations forcountiessurrounding our Martin Lakegeneration plantand our now retiredBig Brownand Monticello plants. The finaldesignations require Texastodevelop nonattainment plansfor theseareas. InFebruary2017, theState of Texasand Luminantfiledchallengestothe nonattainment designations in theFifth CircuitCourt. In August2019, theEPA issued aproposed ErrorCorrectionRulefor allthree areas, which, if finalized,wouldhaverevised its previous nonattainment designations andeach area at issuewouldbedesignatedunclassifiable. In May2021, theEPA finalizeda\"Clean Data\"determinationfor theareas surrounding theretired BigBrown andMonticello plants,redesignatingthoseareas as attainment basedonmonitoring data supportinganattainment designation. In June 2021, theEPA publishedtwo notices;one that it waswithdrawingthe August2019 ErrorCorrectionRuleand asecond separate noticedenying petitions fromLuminantand theState of Texastoreconsider theoriginalnonattainment designations. We, along with theState of Texas, challengedthatEPA actionand have consolidated it with thepending challenge in theFifth CircuitCourt,and this casewas arguedbeforethe FifthCircuit CourtinJuly2022. In September2021, theTCEQconsidered a proposal forits nonattainment SIPrevisionfor theMartin Lake area andanagreed ordertoreduceSO2 emissions fromthe plant. Theproposed agreed orderassociated with theSIP proposal reduces emission limits as of January 2022. Emission reductions requiredare thosenecessary to demonstrateattainment with theNAAQS. The TCEQ's SIPactionwas finalized in February 2022 andhas been submittedtothe EPAfor review andapproval. In January 2024, in asplit decision, theFifth CircuitCourtdeniedthe petitions forreviewweand theState of TexasfiledoverEPA'2016 nonattainment designation forSO2 forthe area around Martin Lake.

Thesefactors, in additiontoothersspecifically addressedinItem7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition, and Results of Operations (MD&A) ,provide important informationfor the understanding of our forward-looking statements in this annualreportonForm10-K. If one or more of thefactors, events and uncertaintiesdiscussedbelow or in theMD&Aweretomaterialize, our business, results of operations,liquidity,financial condition, cashflows,reputationorprospectscouldbematerially adverselyaffected. Inaddition, if one or more of such factors, events anduncertaintiesweretomaterialize, it couldcause results or outcomestodiffermaterially fromthosecontained in or implied by any forward-looking statement in this annual report on Form 10-K. There may be further risks and uncertaintiesthatare not currently knownorthatare not currently believedtobematerialthatmay adverselyaffectour business, results of operations,liquidity,financial condition andprospectsand themarketprice of our commonstock in the future. The realizationofany of thesefactorscouldcause investorsinour securities(including our commonstock)toloseall\n\nor asubstantialportion of theirinvestment.\n\nMarket,Financial andEconomicRisks\n\n## Ourrevenues, resultsofoperations andoperatingcashflows generally areaffected by pricefluctuations in thewholesale power market andother market factorsbeyond ourcontrol.\n\nWe arenot guaranteedany rate of return on capitalinvestmentsinour businesses. We conductintegratedpower generationand retail electricity activities, focusing on power generation, wholesaleelectricity salesand purchases,retailsales of electricity andnatural gastoend usersand commodity risk management. Our wholesaleand retail businessesare to some extent countercyclical in nature,particularly forthe wholesalepower andancillary services suppliedtothe retail business. However, we do have awholesalepower positionthatissubjecttowholesalepower pricemoves, whichmay be significant. As aresult, our revenues,results of operations andoperating cash flowsdependinlarge part upon wholesalemarketprices for electricity,natural gas, uranium, lignite,coal, fuel oil, andtransportationinour regionalmarkets andother competitive markets in whichweoperate andupon prevailingretailelectricity rates, whichmay be impacted by, among otherthings,actions of regulatoryauthorities.\n\nMarket prices forpower,capacity,ancillary services,natural gas, coal andfueloil areunpredictableand mayfluctuate substantially overrelativelyshortperiods of time. Unlikemostother commodities, electricpower can onlybestoredonavery limited basisand generallymustbeproduced concurrently with its use. As aresult, power prices aresubject to significant volatilitydue to supplyand demand imbalances,especially in theday-ahead andspot markets. Demand forelectricity can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. Over-supply can occur as a result of the constructionofnew power generationsources,aswehaveobservedinrecentyears. During periods of over-supply, electricity prices might be depressed. Forexample,the cost of electricityfromrenewable resources,suchassolar,windand batteryESS, hasdroppedsubstantially in recent years. In many instances, energy fromthese sources arebid into therelevantspot market at aprice of zeroorclose to zero duringcertain timesofthe day, lowering theclearingprice forall power wholesalersinsuch market. Also, at times thereispolitical pressure,orpressure from regulatoryauthoritieswith jurisdictionoverwholesaleand retail energy commodity andtransportationrates,toimposeprice limitations,bidding rulesand othermechanisms to address volatilityand otherissues in thesemarkets.\n\nExtremeweather events can also materially impact power prices or otherwiseexacerbate conditions or circumstancesthat result in volatilityofpower prices. For example, in February 2021, theU.S.experienced Winter StormUri andextreme cold temperatures in thecentral U.S.,including Texas. This severe weatherevent substantially increased thedemandfor naturalgas used in our electricpower generationbusiness, andthe cold furtherlimitedthe availability of renewablegenerationacrossthe region contributingtoextremely high market prices fornatural gasand electricity,which resultedinsubstantialincreases in the coststoprocure sufficientfuelsupplyand increased collateral postingrequirements. Winter StormElliott, in December 2022, and Winter Storm Heather, in January 2024, were other examples of extreme weather across the U.S. that resulted in widespread wholesalepower market volatility.\n\n20",

Asaresult,we largelysellelectricenergy, capacity andancillary services into thewholesaleenergyspot market or into otherwholesaleand retail power marketsonashort-term basisand arenot guaranteedany rate of return on our capitalinvestments. Consequently, therecan be no assurancethatwewill be able to sell anyorall of theelectricenergy, capacity or ancillary services fromthose facilitiesatcommerciallyattractiverates or that our facilitieswill be able to operate profitably. We depend, in largepart, upon prevailingmarketprices forpower,capacity andfuel. Giventhe volatility of commodity power prices,tothe extent we are unabletohedge or otherwisesecure long-term power salesagreements forthe output of our power generationfacilities, our revenuesand profitability will be subject to volatility, andour financialcondition, results of operations andcashflows couldbe\n\nmaterially adverselyaffected.\n\n## We purchase naturalgas,coal,fueloil, andnuclear fuel forour generationfacilities, andhigherthanexpected fuel costs, volatility,ordisruptioninthese fuel marketsmay have an adverse impactonour costs, revenues, results of operations, financialconditionand cash flows.\n\nWe rely on naturalgas,coal, fuel oil, andnuclear fuel forthe majority of our power generationfacilities. Deliveryof thesefuels to thefacilitiesisdependent upon thecontinuing availability of such fuelsand financialviability of contractual counterpartiesaswellasupon theinfrastructure(including mines,raillines,railcars, bargefacilities, roadways,riverways and naturalgas pipelines)available andfunctioning to serveeachgenerationfacility,and geopolitical risk,including thecurrent Russiaand Ukraineconflict andthe potentialfor additionalU.S.sanctions againstRussiaorother potentialrestrictions on Russian energy deliveries. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, and Results of Operations -Significant Activitiesand Events,and ItemsInfluencing Future Performance-Macroeconomic Conditions . Asa result, we have experienced,and remain subject to therisks of disruptions or curtailmentsinthe productionofpower at our generationfacilitiesifnofuelisavailableatany price, if acounterpartyfails to perform or if thereisadisruptioninthe fuel deliveryinfrastructure. Certainofour generationfacilities rely on alimitednumberofcounterparties, such as naturalgas suppliers and railcar companies, to provide the necessary fuel. Disputes relating to or non-performance of contractual arrangementshaveresultedin, andmay continue to result in adverseimpactstoour costs, revenues, results of operations, financialcondition, andcashflows.\n\nAs part of our strategy to mitigatethe potentialnegativeeffectsofcommodity pricevolatility,wehavesoldforward a substantialportionofour expected power salesinthe next fewyearsinorder to lock in long-term prices. Inorder to hedge our obligations underthese forwardpower salescontracts, we have enteredintolong-term andshort-term contractsfor thepurchase anddeliveryoffuel. Many of theforward power salescontractsdonot allowustopassthrough changesinfuelcosts or dischargethe power sale obligations in thecaseofadisruption in fuel supplydue to forcemajeure events or thedefault of afuel supplierortransporter. Fuel costs(including diesel,natural gas, lignite,coaland nuclear fuel)are volatile,and thewholesale pricefor power doesnot always change at thesamerateaschangesinfuelcosts,and disruptions in our fuel suppliesmay thereforerequire us to find alternativefuelsources at costswhich maybehigherthanplanned, to find othersourcesofpower to deliver to counterpartiesatahighercost, or to paydamages to counterpartiesfor failure to deliver power as contracted. Longterm andshort-term contractsare subject to risk of non-deliveryorclaims of forcemajeure,which mayimpact our ability to economically recoverthe valueofthe contract. Inaddition, we purchaseand sell naturalgas andother energy related commodities, andvolatility in thesemarkets mayaffectcosts incurredinmeetingour obligations. Further,any changesinthe costsofnatural gas, coal,fueloil, nuclear fuel or transportationrates andchangesinthe relationshipbetween such costsand the market prices of power will affect our financialresults. Ifweare unabletoprocure fuel forphysical deliveryatpriceswe consider favorable,orifweare unabletoprocure thesefuels at all, our financialcondition, results of operations andcashflows couldbemateriallyadverselyaffected. For example, supplychallengeswere among theprimary driversofthe significant loss experienced in 2021 as aresultofWinterStorm Uri.\n\nWe also buy significantquantitiesoffuelonashort-term or spot market basis.\n\nPrices forall of our fuelsfluctuate,\n\nsometimes rising or falling significantly overarelativelyshortperiodoftime. The pricewecan obtainfor thesaleofenergy maynot rise at thesamerate, or maynot rise at all, to matcharise in fuel or deliverycosts. Thismay have amaterialadverse effect on ourfinancial andoperatingperformance.

Overthe last severalyears, theU.S.Congresshas considered anddebated several proposalsintendedtoaddressclimate change usingdifferent approaches,including acap on carbon emissions with emitters allowed to trade unused emission allowances (cap-and-trade), a tax on carbon or GHG emissions, incentives for the developmentoflow-carbon technology andfederal renewableportfolio standards. In July 2019, theEPA finalized theACE rule that developedemissions guidelines that states must usewhendeveloping planstoregulateGHG emissions from existing coal-fueled electricgenerationunits. InJanuary 2021, theACE rule wasvacated by theD.C.Circuit Courtand remandedtothe EPAfor furtherconsideration in accordance with thecourt'sruling. TheD.C.Circuit Court'sdecision wasappealedtothe U.S. SupremeCourt. In June 2022, theU.S.SupremeCourtissued its decision in West Virginia v. EPA ,inwhich it held that the EPAdoesnot have theauthoritytoapplygenerationshiftinginthe regulationofGHG emissions. The judgmentreversedthe D.C. CircuitCourt'sdecision andremandedthe case forfurther proceedings consistent with theU.S.SupremeCourt's opinion. TheEPA is in theprocess of developing amorestringent andmoreencompassing rule to replace theACE rule in itsremand proceedingand hasbeen directed by theBiden Administrationtoreviewthisruleand others promulgatedbythe EPAduring theTrump Administration.

We couldbemateriallyand adverselyaffected if newfederal and/or statelegislationorregulations areadopted to addressglobal climate change that couldrequire effortsthatexceed or aremoreexpensivethanour currently plannedinitiatives or if we are subject to lawsuits foralleged damage to persons or propertyresultingfromGHG emissions.\n\nAdditionally,inJanuary 2021, PresidentBiden issued writtennotificationtothe UnitedNations of theU.S.'sintentionto\n\nrejoin theParis Agreement, effectiveinFebruary2021. Although theParis Agreementdoesnot createany binding obligations fornations to limit theirGHG emissions,itdoesinclude pledgestovoluntarily limit or reducefutureemissions,and various corporations,investorsand U.S. states andlocal governmentshavepreviously pledgedtofurther thegoals of theParis Agreement. Additionally, theBiden Administrationhas directed certain agencies to submit aplantothe NationalClimate Task Forcetoachieve acarbon-pollution-freeelectricity sector by 2035. TheCompany'splantotransitiontoclean power generation sources andreduceits GHG emissions maynot be completedinthistimeframe andwemay not otherwiseachieve our sustainability andemissions reductiontargets as expected. Accordingly, we mayberequiredtoaccelerateorchange our targets, incuradditionalexpenses,and/or adjust or cease certain operations as aresultofnewly implemented federaland/or state regulations to reducefuturecarbon emissions.\n\n33",

Electricity prices aretypically setbythe cost to fuel agenerationfacilityand theamount of fuel needed to generate one unitofelectricity (Heat Rate)fromthe generationfacility. Market Heat Rate is theimplied relationshipbetween wholesaleelectricity prices andthe commodity priceofthe marginal supplier(generallynatural gasplants).\n\nWholesaleelectricity prices generally track to increases or decreases in theprice of naturalgas,with exceptions such as when ERCOTpower prices rise significantly duringweather events as aresultofthe scarcity of availablegenerationresources relativetopower demand. Theprice of naturalgas is volatile; therefore, thecosts to operate anatural gas-fueled generation facilitycan be volatile as well. Incontrast to our naturalgas-fueled generationfacilities, changesinnatural gasprices have no significanteffect on thecostofgeneratingpower at our nuclear-, lignite-and coal-fueled facilities; however,all otherfactors beingequal, changesinnatural gasprices affect our operatingmargins on thesefacilitiesaselectricity prices generally trackto naturalgas prices. Other variablesthatcouldimpact electricity prices include,but arenot limitedto, theprice of otherfuels, generationresources in theregion, weather, on-going competition, emerging technologies,and macroeconomic andregulatory factors.\n\nThewholesalemarketprice of electricity dividedbythe market priceofnatural gasrepresentsthe Market Heat Rate. Market Heat Rate canbeaffected by anumberoffactors, including generationavailability,mix of assets andthe efficiency of themarginalsupplier(generallynatural gas-fueled generationfacilities) in generatingelectricity. Our Market Heat Rate exposureisimpacted by changesinthe availability of generationresources,suchasadditions andretirements of generation facilities, andmix of generation assets. For example, increasingrenewable (windand solar) generationcapacity generally depressesMarketHeatRates,particularly duringperiods when totaldemandisrelativelylow. However,increasingpenetration of renewablegenerationcapacitymay also contributetogreater volatility of wholesalemarketprices independent of changesin theprice of naturalgas,given theirintermittent nature.\n\nAs aresultofour exposuretothe variability of naturalgas prices andMarketHeat Rates, retail salesand hedging activitiesare critical to our operatingresults andmaintaining consistent cashflowlevels. Ourintegratedpower generationand retail electricitybusinessprovidesusopportunitiestohedge our generationpositionutilizingretailelectricity marketsasasales channel.

Suchchangesinfairvalue areaccounted forasunrealized mark-to-market gainsand lossesinnet income with an offset to derivativeassets andliabilities. The availability of quoted market prices in energy markets is dependent on thetype of commodity (e.g., naturalgas,electricity,etc.),time period specified anddeliverypoint.

Derivative instrumentsvaluedbased on unobservableinputsprimarily include (i)forward salesand purchases of electricity (including certain retail contracts),natural gasand coal,(ii) electricity, naturalgas andcoaloptions,and (iii) financialtransmission rights. In computingfairvalue forderivatives,each forwardpricing curveisseparated into liquidand illiquidperiods. The liquid period varies by delivery point andcommodity.

For additionalinformation seethe following discussion of our results of operations.\n\nEBITDAand Adjusted EBITDA\n\nIn analyzingand planning forour business, we supplementour useofGAAP financialmeasures with non-GAAP\n\nfinancialmeasures,including EBITDA andAdjustedEBITDAasperformance measures. These non-GAAP financialmeasures reflect an additionalway of viewingaspectsofour businessthat, when viewed (i)with our GAAP results and(ii) the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financialmeasures mayprovide amorecompleteunderstanding of factorsand trends affectingour business. Because EBITDA andAdjustedEBITDAare financialmeasures that management uses to allocateresources,determineour ability to fund capitalexpenditures, assess performance againstour peers, andevaluate overall financialperformance, we believe they provide useful informationfor investors.\n\n59",

Operatingcosts forthe yearsended December 31, 2023 and2022 also include ongoing costsassociated with thedecommissioning andreclamationofretired plants andmines. GAAP andAdjustedEBITDAresults for2023 arefavorable to 2022 primarily due to the$89 milliongainonsaleoflandinFreestone County, Texas.\n\n## Energy-RelatedCommodity Contractsand Mark-to-MarketActivities\n\nAs forward power prices materially increased in 2022, our generation segments (Texas, East, West and Sunset) aggressively sold forwardpower for2023 andfutureyears. While settledpower prices in 2023 arelower than 2022, the strategichedging allowedustolockinmargins for2023 whichresultedinrealized revenue netoffuelabove what we were able to recognize in 2022 (weremostlyhedgedgoing into 2022 so didnot recognize thefullbenefit of settledprices). The forward power salesare also thedrivers of thechangesinunrealized gains/lossesonhedging activities. As power prices increase/ decreaseincomparisontowhatour generationsegmentshavesoldforward,the generationsegmentsrecognize unrealized losses/gains. Theretailsegment procures power fromthe generationsegmentstoserve future load obligations andthus changes in forwardpower prices have an inverseeffect on unrealized mark to market forthe retail segmentascomparedtothe generationsegments. This is evidentin2022 as material increaseinforward power prices drove material unrealized lossesin our generationsegment,partially offset by unrealized gainsinour retail segment. In 2023, forwardpower prices decreased slightly whichresultedinunrealized gainsinour generation segments whichispartially offset by unrealized lossesinour retail segment.\n\n65",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVEDISCLOSURESABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk is theriskthatinthe normalcourse of businesswemay experience alossinvalue because of changesin market conditions that affect economic factorssuchascommodity prices,interestrates andcounterpartycredit. Ourexposure to market risk is affected by severalfactors, including thesize, durationand compositionofour energy andfinancial portfolio, as well as thevolatility andliquidity of markets. Instrumentsusedtomanagethisexposureinclude interest rate swapstohedge debt costs, as well as exchange-traded, over-the-counter contractsand othercontractualarrangementstohedge commodity\n\nprices.\n\nRisk Oversight\n\nWe manage thecommodity price, counterpartycreditand commodity-relatedoperationalriskrelated to thecompetitive energy businesswithinlimitations establishedbyseniormanagementand in accordance with overall risk management policies. Interest rate risk is managedcentrally by our treasuryfunction.

See\n\nGlossary of Termsand Abbreviations\n\nfordefined terms.\n\nVistra is aholding companyoperatinganintegratedretailand electricpower generationbusinessprimarily in markets throughout theU.S. Through our subsidiaries,weare engagedincompetitiveenergymarketactivitiesincluding electricity generation, wholesaleenergysales andpurchases,commodity risk management andretailsales of electricity andnatural gasto\n\nendusers.\n\nVistra hassix reportablesegments: (i)Retail, (ii) Texas, (iii)East, (iv) West,(v) Sunset and(vi)AssetClosure. See Note 21 forfurther informationconcerning our reportablebusinesssegments.\n\n## TransactionAgreement\n\nOn March6,2023, Vistra Operations andMergerSub enteredintoatransactionagreement(TransactionAgreement) with Energy Harbor pursuanttowhich,upon theterms andsubjecttothe conditions thereof, Merger Subwill be merged with and into Energy Harbor,withEnergyHarbor survivingasanindirect subsidiary of Vistra (Merger, andcollectivelywith theother transactions contemplated by theTransactionAgreement,the Transactions). TheTransactionAgreement, theMergerand the otherTransactions were approvedbyeach of Vistra's board of directors(Board) andEnergyHarbor's board of directors. On February 16, 2024, we receivedapprovalfromFERCtoacquire Energy Harbor. FERC'sapprovalwas thelastregulatory approvalneeded,and we anticipateclosing on March1,2024. SeeNote2formoreinformationconcerning theTransaction Agreement.\n\n## Winter StormUri\n\nIn February 2021, aseverewinterstorm with extremelycoldtemperaturesaffected much of theU.S., including Texas. This severe weatherresultedinsurging demand forpower,natural gassupplyshortages, operationalchallengesfor generators, andasignificant load shed eventthatwas orderedbyERCOTbeginning on February 15, 2021 andcontinuing through February 18, 2021. Winter StormUri hadamaterial adverseimpactonour 2021 results of operations andoperatingcashflows.\n\nAs part of the2021 regular Texaslegislativesessions andinresponsetoextraordinary costsincurredbyelectricity market participants duringWinterStorm Uri, theTexas legislaturepassedHouseBill (HB) 4492 forERCOTtoobtainfinancing to distributetoload-servingentities(LSEs)thatwereupliftedand paid to ERCOTexceptionally high priceadders andancillary servicecosts duringWinterStorm Uri. In October2021, thePUCTissued aDebtObligationOrder approving $2.1 billion financingand themethodology forallocationofproceedstothe LSEs. InDecember2021, ERCOTfinalized theamount of allocations to theLSEs, andwereceived$544 millionofproceedsfromERCOTinthe second quarter of 2022. TheCompany accounted forthe proceedswereceivedbyanalogy to thecontributionmodelwithin AccountingStandardsCodification(ASC) 958-605, Not-for-Profit Entities-RevenueRecognition andthe grantmodelwithinInternationalAccountingStandard 20, Accountingfor Government Grantsand Disclosure of Government Assistance ,asareductiontoexpenses in thestatementsof operations in theannualperiodfor whichthe proceeds areintendedtocompensate. We concludedthatthe thresholdfor recognizing areceivable wasmet in December2021 as theamountstobereceivedweredeterminable andERCOTwas directed by its governingbody, thePUCT, to take allactions requiredtoeffectuate the$2.1 billion funding approvedinthe Debt ObligationOrder.

Allintercompanyitems andtransactions have been eliminatedin consolidation. Alldollaramountsinthe financialstatementsand tables in thenotes arestatedinmillions of U.S. dollars unless\n\notherwiseindicated. Certain priorperiodamountshavebeen reclassified to conformwiththe current year presentation.\n\nUseofEstimates\n\nPreparationoffinancial statements requiresestimatesand assumptions about future events that affect thereportingof assets andliabilities as of thebalance sheetdates andthe reportedamountsofrevenue andexpense, including fair value measurements,estimates of expected obligations,judgments relatedtothe potentialtimingofeventsand otherestimates. Inthe eventestimates and/or assumptions prove to be different from actualamounts, adjustmentsare made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.\n\n## DerivativeInstruments andMark-to-MarketAccounting\n\nWe enterinto contractsfor thepurchaseand sale of electricity, natural gas, coal and other commodities utilizing instrumentssuchasoptions,swaps,futures andforwardsprimarily to manage commodity priceand interest rate risks. If the instrument meetsthe definition of aderivativeunderaccountingstandardsrelated to derivativeinstruments andhedging activities, changesinthe fair valueofthe derivative arerecognized in netincomeasunrealized gainsand losses. This recognitionisreferredtoasmark-to-marketaccounting. Thefairvaluesofour unsettledderivativeinstruments undermark-tomarket accountingare reportedinthe consolidated balancesheetsascommodity andother derivativecontractualassets or liabilities. Wereportderivativeassets andliabilities in theconsolidated balancesheetswithout taking into considerationnetting arrangementswehavewithcounterparties. Margin depositsthatcontractually offset theseassets andliabilitiesare reported separately in theconsolidatedbalance sheets, exceptfor certainmarginamountsrelated to changesinfairvalue on CME transactions that are legally characterized as settlement of derivative contracts rather than collateral. When derivative instrumentsare settled andrealized gainsand lossesare recorded,the previously recorded unrealized gainsand lossesand derivativeassets andliabilities arereversed. SeeNotes 16 and17for additionalinformation regardingfairvalue measurement andcommodity andother derivativecontractualassetsand liabilities. Acommodity-relatedderivativecontract maybe designatedasanormal purchaseorsaleifthe commodity is to be physically receivedordelivered foruse or sale in thenormal course of business. If designatedasnormal, thederivativecontract is accounted forunderthe accrualmethod of accounting (not marked-to-market)withnobalance sheet or income statementrecognitionofthe contract until settlement.\n\nBecause derivative instruments are frequently used as economic hedges, accounting standards related to derivative instrumentsand hedging activitiesallowfor hedge accounting, whichprovidesfor thedesignationofsuchinstruments as cash flow or fair valuehedgesifcertain conditions aremet. AsofDecember 31, 2023 and2022, therewerenoderivativepositions accounted forascashfloworfairvalue hedges.\n\nWe reportcommodity hedging andtrading results as revenue,fuelexpenseorpurchased power in theconsolidated statements of operations depending on thetype of activity. Electricity hedges, financialnatural gashedgesand trading activitiesare primarily reportedasrevenue. Physicalorfinancial hedgesfor coal or fuel oil, along with physical naturalgas trades,are primarily reportedasfuelexpense. Realized andunrealized gainsand lossesassociated with interest rate swap transactions arereportedinthe consolidated statements of operations in interest expense.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized when electricity is delivered to our customersinanamount that we expect to invoice for volumes\n\ndelivered or services provided. Salestax is excludedfromrevenue. Energysales andservices that have been deliveredbut not billedbyperiodend areestimated. Accruedunbilled revenuesare basedonestimatesofcustomerusage sincethe date of the last meterreadingprovidedbythe independent system operators or electricdistributioncompanies. Estimatedamountsare adjusted when actualusage is knownand billed.\n\n86",

Theprojected payments arebased on certain assumptions,including but not limited to (a)the federalcorporateincometax rate of 21%,(b) estimatesofour taxableincomeinthe current andfuture yearsand (c)additionalstatesthatVistranow operates in,including therelevanttax rate andapportionmentfactorfor each state. Ourtaxable income takesintoconsiderationthe current federaltax code,various relevant statetax laws andreflectsour current estimatesoffutureresults of thebusiness. Theestimatesoffuturebusinessresults include assumptions relatedto renewabledevelopmentprojectsthatVistraisplanning to execute that generate significanttax benefits. These benefits have a material impactonthe timingofTRA obligationpayments. Theseassumptions aresubject to change,and thosechangescould have amaterialimpact on thecarryingvalue of theTRA obligation. As of December 31, 2023, andexcluding theJanuary and February 2024 activity discussedabove,the aggregateamount of undiscounted federaland statepaymentsunderthe TRAis estimatedtobeapproximately $350 million, with more than half of such amount expected to be paid duringthe next 15 years, andthe finalpayment expected to be made around theyear2056 (ifthe TRAisnot terminated earlierpursuanttoits terms).\n\nThecarryingvalue of theobligationisbeing accretedtothe amount of thegross expected obligationusing theeffective interest method. Changesinthe amount of this obligationresultingfromchangestoeither thetimingoramount of TRA payments arerecognizedinthe period of change andmeasuredusing thediscount rate inherent in theinitialfairvalue of the obligation.\n\nTheTRA providesthat, in theevent that Vistra breaches anyofits material obligations underthe TRA, or upon certain mergers, assetsales,orother formsofbusinesscombinationorcertain otherchangesofcontrol, thetransferagent underthe TRAmay treat such eventasanearly terminationofthe TRA, in whichcaseVistrawouldberequiredtomakeanimmediate paymenttothe holders of theTRA Rightsequaltothe presentvalue (atadiscount rate equaltothree-monthCME Term SOFR plus thetenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% plus 100 basispoints) of theanticipated future taxbenefitsbased on certain valuationassumptions.\n\nTheLIBOR provisions of theTRA aresubject to theAdjustableInterestRate(LIBOR) Actof2022 (LIBOR Act) andthe\n\nregulations promulgatedtocarry out theLIBOR Act(LIBORRegulations). With respect to payments underthe TRA, pursuant to theLIBOR Actand theLIBOR Regulations,the \"Board-selected benchmarkreplacement\" (BSBR) of three-monthCME Term SOFR plus thetenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% automatically becamethe benchmarkreplacement to three-month LIBORonJuly1,2023 and, in addition, thefour conforming changespromulgated by theFederal ReserveSystemBoard in the LIBORRegulations (eachofwhich is atechnical or administrativeinnature) also applytothe TRA, by operationoflaw,to effectuate theimplementationand useofthe foregoing BSBR.\n\n106",

In March2023, theThird CourtofAppealsissued aunanimous decision andagreed with our arguments that thePUCT'spricing orders constituteddefacto competitionrules andexceeded thePUCT'sstatutory authority. The ThirdCourtofAppealsvacated thepricing orders andremandedthe mattertothe PUCT forfurther proceedings. InMarch 2023, thePUCTappealed theThird CourtofAppeals' ruling to theTexas SupremeCourt.

In addition, we have also submittedsettlement disputes with ERCOToverpower prices andother issues duringWinterStorm Uri.

TheACE rule developedemission guidelines that states must usewhendeveloping plans to regulate GHG emissions from existing coal-fueled electric generation units. In response to challenges brought by environmentalgroups andcertain states,the U.S. CourtofAppealsfor theDistrictofColumbiaCircuit (D.C.Circuit Court) vacated theACE rule,including therepeal of theCPP, in January 2021 andremandedthe rule to theEPA forfurther action. In June 2022, theU.S.SupremeCourtissued an opinion reversingthe D.C. CircuitCourt'sdecision, andfinding that theEPA exceeded its authorityunderSection111 of theClean AirAct when theEPA setemission requirementsinthe CPPbased on generationshifting. In October2022, theD.C.Circuit Courtissued an amendedjudgment, denying petitions forreviewofthe ACEruleand challengestothe repeal of theCPP. In addition, theEPA openedadocketseekinginput on questions relatedto theregulationofGHGs underSection111(d) whichclosedinMarch 2023. In May2023, theEPA released anew proposal regulatingpower plantGHG emissions,while also proposingtorepeal theACE rule. The newGHG proposal sets limits for(a) newnatural gas-firedcombustion turbines,(b) existingcoal-,oil- andnatural gas-firedsteam generationunits,and (c)certain existing naturalgas-firedcombustionturbines. Theproposed standardsare basedontechnologies such as carbon captureand sequestration/storage(CCS),low-GHG hydrogenco-firing, andnatural gasco-firing. Startingin2030, theproposal would generally require more CO2 emissions controlatfossilfuel-firedpower plants that operate more frequently andfor more years andwouldphase in increasinglystringent CO2 requirementsovertime. Underthe proposal,stateswouldberequiredtosubmit planstothe EPAwithin24months of therule'seffectivedatethatprovide forthe establishment, implementation, and enforcementofstandardsofperformance forexistingsources. Thesestate plansmustgenerally establishstandards that areat leastasstringent as theEPA's emission guidelines. Existingsteam generationunits must startcomplying with theirstandards of performance on January 1, 2030. Existingcombustion turbineunits must startcomplying with theirstandardsofperformance on January 1, 2032, or January 1, 2035, depending on theirsubcategory.

        "page_content": "Cross-StateAir PollutionRule(CSAPR)\n\nIn October2015, theEPA revisedthe primary andsecondary ozone NationalAmbient AirQuality Standards(NAAQS)to lowerthe 8-hour standard forozone emissions duringozone season (May to September). As requiredunderthe CAA, in October2018, theState of TexassubmittedaStateImplementationPlan(SIP) to theEPA demonstratingthatemissions from Texassources do not contributesignificantly to nonattainmentin, or interfere with maintenanceby, anyother statewithrespect to therevised ozoneNAAQS. InFebruary2023, theEPA disapprovedTexas'SIP andthe StateofTexas,Luminant, certain tradegroups,and others challengedthatdisapprovalinthe U.S. CourtofAppealsfor theFifth Circuit(FifthCircuit Court). In March2023, thosesameparties filedmotions to stay theEPA's SIPdisapprovalinthe FifthCircuit Court, andthe EPAmoved\n\nto transfer our challengestothe D.C. CircuitCourtorhavethosechallengesdismissed.\n\nIn April2022, priortothe EPA'sdisapprovalofTexas'SIP,the EPAproposed aFederal ImplementationPlan(FIP) to addressthe 2015 ozone NAAQS. We, along with many othercompanies,trade groups,statesand ISOs,including ERCOT, PJMand MISO,filed responsivecommentstothe EPA'sproposal in June 2022, expressing concerns about certain elements of theproposal,particularlythosethatmay result in challengestoelectricreliability undercertain conditions. InMarch 2023, the EPAadministrator signedits finalFIP. The FIPappliesto22statesbeginning with the2023 ozone seasons. Stateswhere Vistra operatesgenerationunits that wouldbesubject to this rule areIllinois, NewJersey, NewYork, Ohio,Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia andWestVirginia. Texaswouldbemovedintothe revised(andmorerestrictive) Group 3trading program previously establishedinthe RevisedCSAPR Update Rule that includesemission budgets for2023 that theEPA says are achievablethrough existing controls installedatpower plants. Allowances will be limitedunderthe program andwillbe furtherreduced beginning in ozone season 2026 to alevel that is intendedtoreduceoperatingtime of coal-fueled power plants duringozone season or forcecoalplantstoretire, particularly thosethatdonot have selectivecatalytic reductionsystems such as our Martin Lake power plant.\n\nIn May2023, theFifth CircuitCourtgranted our motion to stay theEPA's disapprovalofTexas'SIP pending adecision on themerits anddeniedthe EPA'smotiontotransferour challenge to theD.C.Circuit Court. As aresultofthe stay,wedonot believe theEPA hasauthoritytoimplement theFIP as to Texassources pending theresolutionofthe merits,meaningthat Texaswill remain in Group 2and not be subject to anyrequirementsunderthe FIPatleastuntil theFifth CircuitCourtrules on themerits. Oralargumentwas heardinDecember2023 before theFifth CircuitCourt. In June 2023, theEPA publishedthe finalFIP in theFederal Register,which includedrequirementsastoTexas despite thestayofthe SIPdisapprovalbythe Fifth CircuitCourt. In June 2023, theState of Texas, Luminant andvarious otherpartiesalsofiledchallengestothe FIPinthe Fifth CircuitCourt, filedamotiontostaythe FIPand confirmvenue forthisdisputeinthe FifthCircuit Court. Afterthe motionto stay andtoconfirmvenue wasfiled, theEPA signedaninterim finalruleonJune 29, 2023 that confirms theFIP as to Texasis stayed. InJuly2023, theFifth CircuitCourtruled that theFIP challenge wouldbeheldinabeyancepending theresolutionof thelitigationonthe SIPdisapprovaland denied themotiontostayasnot needed giventhe EPA'sadministrativestay.\n\n## Regional Haze -ReasonableProgressand Best AvailableRetrofitTechnology (BART)for Texas\n\nIn October2017, theEPA issued afinal rule addressing BART forTexas electricity generationunits,withthe rule servingasapartialapprovalofTexas'2009 SIPand apartialFIP. For SO2,the rule establishedanintrastateTexas emission allowancetrading program asa\"BARTalternative\" that operatesinasimilarfashion to aCSAPR tradingprogram. The program includes39generationunits (including theMartinLake, BigBrown,Monticello,Sandow 4, Coleto Creek,Stryker 2 andGraham2plants). Thecomplianceobligations in theprogram startedonJanuary 1, 2019. ForNOX,the rule adopted the CSAPR'sozone program as BART andfor particulatematter, theruleapprovedTexas'SIP that determines that no electricity generationunits aresubjecttoBARTfor particulatematter. In August2020, theEPA issued afinal rule affirmingthe prior BART finalrulebut also includedadditionalrevisions that were proposed in November 2019. Challengestoboththe 2017 rule andthe 2020 ruleshavebeenconsolidated in theD.C.Circuit Court, wherewehaveintervenedinsupportofthe EPA. We are in compliancewiththe rule,and theretirements of our Monticello,Big Brownand Sandow 4plantshaveenhanced our ability to comply. The EPAisinthe processofreconsideringthe BART rule,and thechallengesinthe D.C. CircuitCourthavebeen held in abeyance pending theEPA's finalactiononreconsideration. In May2023, aproposed BART rule waspublishedinthe FederalRegisterthatwouldwithdraw thetrading program provisions of theprior rule andwouldestablishSO2 limits on six facilitiesinTexas,including Martin Lake andColetoCreek. Underthe current proposal,compliancewouldberequiredwithin 3yearsfor Martin Lake and5years forColetoCreek. Due to theannounced shutdownfor Coleto Creek,wedonot anticipate anyimpactsatthatfacility, andweare evaluatingpotentialcomplianceoptions at Martin Lake shouldthisproposal become final.

        "page_content": "SO2 Designations forTexas\n\nIn November 2016, theEPA finalized its nonattainmentdesignations forcountiessurrounding our Martin Lakegeneration plantand our now retiredBig Brownand Monticello plants. The finaldesignations require Texastodevelop nonattainment plansfor theseareas. InFebruary2017, theState of Texasand Luminantfiledchallengestothe nonattainment designations in theFifth CircuitCourt. In August2019, theEPA issued aproposed ErrorCorrectionRulefor allthree areas, which, if finalized,wouldhaverevised its previous nonattainment designations andeach area at issuewouldbedesignatedunclassifiable. In May2021, theEPA finalizeda\"Clean Data\"determinationfor theareas surrounding theretired BigBrown andMonticello plants,redesignatingthoseareas as attainment basedonmonitoring data supportinganattainment designation. In June 2021, theEPA publishedtwo notices;one that it waswithdrawingthe August2019 ErrorCorrectionRuleand asecond separate noticedenying petitions fromLuminantand theState of Texastoreconsider theoriginalnonattainment designations. We, along with theState of Texas, challengedthatEPA actionand have consolidated it with thepending challenge in theFifth CircuitCourt, andthiscasewas arguedbeforethe FifthCircuit CourtinJuly2022. In September2021, theTCEQconsidered a proposal forits nonattainment SIPrevisionfor theMartin Lake area andanagreed ordertoreduceSO2 emissions fromthe plant. Theproposedagreedorder associated with theSIP proposal reduces emission limits as of January 2022. Emission reductions requiredare thosenecessary to demonstrateattainment with theNAAQS. The TCEQ's SIPactionwas finalized in February 2022 andhas been submittedtothe EPAfor review andapproval. In January 2024, in asplit decision, theFifth CircuitCourtdeniedthe petitions forreviewweand theState of Texasfiledoverthe EPA's2016 nonattainment designationfor SO2 forthe area around Martin Lake. Asaresult of this decision, theEPA's nonattainment designation-originally made in 2016 -remains in place. We anticipatethe EPAwilllikelymove forwardwith either proposingafederalplanfor theareain light of an approved consent decree between the Sierra Club and the EPA that requires the EPA taking final action promulgatingaFIPfor thenonattainment area by December 13,2024 or theEPA mayapprove Texas' SIPsubmittal discussed above. InFebruary2024, we filedapetitionaskingthe full FifthCircuit Courttoreviewthe paneldecision issued in January 2024.\n\n## ParticulateMatte\n\nr\n\nIn February 2024, theEPA issued aruleaddressing theannualhealth-based nationalambient airquality standards for fine particulatematter(or PM2.5). Ingeneral,the rule lowers thelevel of theannualPM2.5 standard from12.0 microgramsper cubicmeter (\u00b5g/m3)to9.0 \u00b5g/m3. The effectivedateofthe rule is 60 days frompublicationinthe FederalRegister, andthe earliest attainment date forareas exceedingthe newstandard is 2032. At this time,weare still determiningwhatimpact,ifany, this rule will have on our existing plants or anyplantswemay build in thefuture. Basedon2020-2022 design valueassociated with therule, we have just five plants (Oakland (California),Calumet (Illinois),Liberty (Pennsylvania),Miami Fort (Ohio) and Lake Hubbard (Texas)) operatinginareas wherethe airquality monitoring data arecurrently exceedingthe newPM2.5 standard. Wehavepreviously announced that our MiamiFortgenerationfacility will closebythe endof2027. States will have to developaplan (bylate2027 at theearliest) to getthoseareas into attainment andthere wouldbeapossibilitythat additionalcontrols wouldberequiredfor thosesites. However,beforethe statebeginsthisplanning process, thedesignation processwill occurwithin twoyearsfromthe issuance of thefinal rule. The states developrecommendations about the boundaries of the nonattainment counties and the EPA must finalize the designations including the boundaries of each nonattainment area.\n\n123",

        "page_content": "Effluent LimitationGuidelines (ELGs)\n\nIn November 2015, theEPA revisedthe ELGsfor steamelectricity generationfacilities, whichwill imposemorestringent standards(as individualpermits arerenewed)for wastewater streams, such as flue gasdesulfurization(FGD),fly ash, bottom ashand flue gasmercury controlwastewaters. Various partiesfiledpetitions forreviewofthe ELG rule,and thepetitions were consolidated in theFifth CircuitCourt. In April2017, theEPA grantedpetitions requestingreconsiderationofthe ELG rule andadministrativelystayedthe rule's compliancedatedeadlines. InApril 2019, theFifth CircuitCourtvacated andremanded portions of theEPA's ELGrulepertainingtoeffluent limitations forlegacy wastewater andleachate. TheEPA publisheda finalruleinOctober2020 that extends thecompliancedatefor bothFGD andbottomash transportwater to no laterthan December2025, as negotiatedwith thestate permittingagency. Additionally,the finalruleallows foraretirementexemption that exemptsfacilities certifyingthatunits will retire by December 2028 providedcertain effluent limitations aremet. In November 2020, environmentalgroups petitionedfor review of thenew ELG revisions,and Vistra subsidiaries filedamotion to interveneinsupportofthe EPAinDecember2020. Notifications were made to Texas, Illinoisand Ohio stateagencieson theretirementexemptionfor applicable coal plants by theregulatorydeadlineofOctober13, 2021. In March2023, theEPA publishedits proposed supplementalELG rule,which retainsthe retirementexemptionfromthe 2020 ELG rule andsetsnew limitsfor plants that arecontinuing to operate. The proposed rule also establishespretreatment standardsfor combustion residualleachate, and we arecurrently evaluatingthe impact of thoseproposed requirements. We submittedcommentsonthe proposal in May2023.\n\n## Coal CombustionResiduals (CCR)/Groundwater\n\nIn August2018, theD.C.Circuit Courtissued adecision that vacates andremands certain provisions of the2015 CCR rule,including an applicabilityexemptionfor legacy impoundments. InAugust2020, theEPA issued afinal rule establishing a deadlineofApril 11, 2021 to ceasereceipt of wasteand initiate closureatunlined CCR impoundments. The finalruleallowsa generationplant to seek theEPA's approvaltoextendthisdeadlineifnoalternativedisposal capacity is availableand either a conversiontocomplywiththe CCR rule is underway or retirementwill occurbyeither 2023 or 2028 (depending on thesizeof theimpoundmentatissue). Prior to theNovember 2020 deadline, we submittedapplications to theEPA requestingcompliance extensions underbothconversionand retirementscenarios. In2022 and2023, we withdrew theapplications forCoffeen, Martin Lake,Joppa andZimmer stations because extensions were no longerneeded. InNovember 2020, environmentalgroups petitionedfor review of this rule in theD.C.Circuit Court, andVistrasubsidiaries filedamotiontointervene in supportofthe EPAinDecember 2020. Also,inNovember 2020, theEPA finalized arulethatwouldallowanalternativeliner demonstration forcertain qualifying facilities. InNovember 2020, we submittedanapplicationfor an alternateliner demonstrationfor one CCR unitatMartin Lake,however,wewithdrew theapplicationfor an alternateliner demonstrationinNovember 2023 after determiningthe pond wasnolongerneeded forCCR. In August2021, we submittedarequest to transfer our conversion applicationfor theZimmer facility to aretirementapplicationfollowing theannouncementthatZimmerwill closebyMay 31, 2022. In January 2022, theEPA determined that our conversionand retirementapplications forour CCR facilities were complete but hasnot yetproposed actiononany of thoseapplications. Inaddition, in January 2022, theEPA also made aseries of public statements,including in apress release, that purportedtoimposenew,moreonerous closurerequirementsfor CCR units. The EPAissued thesenew purportedrequirementswithout priornoticeand without following thelegal requirementsfor adoptingnew rules. Thesenew purportedrequirementsannounced by theEPA arecontrary to existingregulations andthe EPA'sprior positions. InApril 2022, we,along with theUtilitySolid Waste ActivitiesGroup (USWAG),atradeassociationof over130 utility operatingcompanies,energycompanies,and certain otherindustryassociations,filed petitions forreviewwith theD.C.Circuit Courtand have askedthe courttodeterminethatthe EPAcannot implement or enforcethe newpurported requirementsbecause theEPA hasnot followedthe requiredprocedures. The StateofTexas andthe TCEQ have intervenedin supportofthe petitions filedbythe Vistra subsidiaries andUSWAG, andvarious environmentalgroups have intervenedon behalf of theEPA. Briefingbeforethe D.C. CircuitCourtiscompleteand thecourtwill hear argumentinMarch 2024.\n\nIn May2023, theEPA issued anotherproposal that furtherrevises thefederal CCR rule that wouldexpand coverage of\n\ngroundwater monitoring andclosure requirementstothe followingtwo newcategoriesofunits:(a) legacy units whichare CCR impoundments at inactivesites that ceased receiving wastebeforeOctober19, 2015 and(b) so-called\"CCR management units\" whichgenerally couldencompass areas of CCR located at afacility that is currently regulated by theexistingCCR rule. CCR Management Units,asdefined by theEPA in theproposal,couldinclude anyash deposits,haulroads,and previously closed impoundments andlandfills. Aspartofthe proposed rule,the EPAidentified134 CCRmanagementunits at 82 different facilitiesacrossthe country,including sixofour potential units. The Vermilionash ponds discussedbelow arethe onlyunit whichwebelieve qualifyasalegacy CCR surface impoundmentand givenour closureplanfor that site we do not believethis proposal,iffinalized,willhaveany impact on that site. Weare continuing to evaluate what wouldberequiredofthe CCR management units identified in theproposal shouldthe proposal become finalinits current form. Wesubmittedcommentsin July 2023.\n\n124",

        "page_content": "MISO -In2012, theIllinoisEnvironmentalProtectionAgency(IEPA)issued violationnotices alleging violations of groundwater standardsonsiteatour Baldwinand Vermilion facilities' CCR surface impoundments. These violationnotices remain unresolved; however,in2016, theIEPAapprovedour closureand post-closurecareplans forthe Baldwinold east, east,\n\nandwestfly ashCCR surface impoundments. Wehavecompleted closureactivitiesatthoseponds at our Baldwinfacility.\n\nAt our retired Vermilionfacility, whichwas not potentially subject to theEPA's 2015 CCR rule until theaforementioned D.C. CircuitCourtdecision in August2018, we submitted proposed correctiveactionplans involving closureoftwo CCR surface impoundments ( i.e. ,the oldeastand thenorth impoundments)tothe IEPA in 2012, andwesubmittedrevised plansin 2014. In May2017, in responsetoarequest fromthe IEPA foradditionalinformationregarding theclosure of theseVermilion surface impoundments,weagreedtoperform additionalgroundwater samplingand closureoptions andriverbank stabilizing options. InMay 2018, PrairieRiversNetwork (PRN)filed acitizen suit in federalcourtinIllinoisagainst Dynegy Midwest Generation, LLC (DMG), alleging violations of theClean WaterAct forallegedunauthorized discharges. InAugust2018, we filedamotiontodismiss thelawsuit. In November 2018, thedistrictcourtgranted our motiontodismissand judgmentwas enteredinour favor. InJune 2021, theSeventh CircuitCourtaffirmed thedistrictcourt'sdismissalofthe lawsuit. In April 2019, PRNalsofiledacomplaintagainst DMGbeforethe IPCB,alleging that groundwater flowsallegedlyassociated with the ashimpoundments at theVermilionsite have resultedinexceedances bothofsurface waterstandardsand Illinoisgroundwater standardsdatingbackto1992. We answered that complaintinJuly2021. In July 2023, PRNfiledanunopposed motion to voluntarily dismissthe casewithprejudice, whichthe IPCB grantedinAugust2023 andclosedthe case.\n\nIn 2012, theIEPAissued violationnotices alleging violations of groundwater standardsatthe Newton andCoffeen facilities' CCR surface impoundments. Weare addressing theseCCR surface impoundments in accordance with thefederal CCR rule. InJune 2018, theIEPAissued aviolationnoticefor allegedseep discharges claimedtobecomingfromthe surface impoundments at our retiredVermilionfacility,which is ownedbyour subsidiary DMG, andthatnoticewas referredtothe IllinoisAttorneyGeneral. InJune 2021, theIllinoisAttorneyGeneral andthe VermilionCountyState Attorneyfileda complaintinIllinoisstate courtwith an agreed interimconsentorder whichthe courtsubsequently entered. Giventhe violation notices andthe enforcementaction, theunique characteristicsofthe site,and theproximity of thesite to theonlynationalscenic riverinIllinois, we agreed to enterintothe interimconsentorder to resolvethismatter. Perthe termsofthe agreed interim consentorder,DMG is requiredtoevaluatethe closurealternativesunderthe requirementsofthe newlyimplemented Illinois Coal Ashregulation(discussedbelow)and closethe site by removal. In addition, theinterim consentorder requiresthatduring theimpoundmentclosure process, impacted groundwater will be collected before it leaves thesite or enters thenearby Vermilionriver and, if necessary,DMG will be requiredtoinstall temporaryriverbank protectionifthe rivermigrateswithin a certain distance of theimpoundments. The interimorder wasmodified in December2022 to require certain amendments to the Safety EmergencyResponsePlan. In June 2023, theIllinoisstate courtapprovedand enteredthe finalconsentorder,which includedthe termsabove andarequirement that when IEPA issues afinal closurepermit forthe site,DMG will demolish the power stationand submit forapprovaltoconstructanon-site landfill within thefootprintofthe former planttostore and manage thecoalash. These proposed closurecosts arereflected in theARO in our consolidated balancesheets(seeNote22).\n\nIn July 2019, coal ash disposal and storage legislation in Illinois was enacted. The legislation addresses state requirementsfor theproperclosure of coal ashponds in thestate of Illinois. Thelaw tasksthe IEPA andthe IPCB to setupa series of guidelines,rules andpermit requirementsfor closureofash ponds. Underthe finalrule, whichwas finalized and becameeffectiveinApril 2021, coal ashimpoundmentownerswouldberequiredtosubmit aclosure alternativeanalysistothe IEPA forthe selectionofthe best method forcoalash remediationataparticular site. The rule doesnot mandate closureby removalatany site. InMay 2021, we filedanappeal in theIllinoisFourth Judicial District overcertain provisions of thefinal rule andthatcaseremains pending. Otherpartieshavealsofiledappealsofcertain provisions of thefinal rule. InOctober 2021, we filed operating permit applications for 18 impoundments as required by the Illinois coal ash rule, and filed constructionpermitapplications forthree of our sitesinJanuary 2022 andfiveofour sitesinJuly2022. Oneadditionalclosure constructionapplicationwas filedfor our BaldwinfacilityinAugust2023.\n\nForall of theabove matters, if certain correctiveactionmeasures, including groundwater treatment or removalofash,are\n\nrequiredatany of our coal-fueled facilities, we mayincur significantcosts that couldhaveamaterialadverseeffect on our financialcondition, resultsofoperations andcashflows. The Illinoiscoalash rule wasfinalized in April2021 anddoesnot require removal. However, therulerequiredustoundertakefurther site specificevaluations requiredbyeach program. We will not know thefullrange of decommissioning costs, including groundwater remediation, if any, that ultimately maybe requiredunderthe Illinoisruleuntil permit applications have been approvedbythe IEPA. However,the CCR surface impoundmentand landfillclosure costscurrently reflectedinour existingARO liabilitiesreflect thecosts of closuremethods that our operations andenvironmentalservices teamsbelieve areappropriate basedonexistingclosure requirementsand protectiveofthe environmentfor each location. Once theIEPAactsonour permit applications,wewill reassess the decommissioning costsand adjust our AROliabilitiesaccordingly.\n\n125",

We useamid-market valuationconvention(themid-point pricebetween bidand askprices)asapracticalexpedienttomeasurefairvalue forthe majority of our assets andliabilitiesand usevaluation techniquestomaximizethe useofobservableinputsand minimize theuse of unobservableinputs. Ourvaluationpoliciesand procedures were developed, maintained andvalidated by acentralized risk management group that reports to theVistraChief FinancialOfficer.\n\nFair valuemeasurementsofderivativeassets andliabilities incorporateanadjustment forcredit-relatednonperformance risk. These nonperformance risk adjustmentstakeintoconsiderationmasternettingarrangements, credit enhancementsand the credit risksassociatedwithour credit standing andthe credit standing of our counterparties(seeNote17for additional information regarding credit risk associated with our derivatives). We utilize credit ratings and default rate factors in calculatingthese fair valuemeasurementadjustments.\n\nWe categorizeour assets andliabilitiesrecorded at fair valuebased upon thefollowing fair valuehierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1valuations usequoted prices in active marketsfor identical assets or liabilitiesthatare accessibleatthe measurement date. Our Level 1 assets and liabilities include CME or ICE (electronic commodity derivative exchanges) futuresand options transacted through clearing brokers forwhich prices areactivelyquoted. Wereport thefairvalue of CMEand ICEtransactions without taking into considerationmargindeposits,with theexceptionof certain margin amountsrelated to changesinfairvalue on certainCME transactions that arelegally characterized as settlement of derivativecontractsratherthancollateral.\n- \u00b7 Level 2valuations utilizeover-the-counter broker quotes,quoted prices forsimilarassets or liabilitiesthatare corroborated by correlations or othermathematical means, andother valuationinputssuchasinterestrates andyield curves observableatcommonlyquoted intervals. We attempttoobtainmultiple quotes frombrokers that areactivein themarkets in whichweparticipate andrequire at leastone quotefromtwo brokers to determineapricing input as observable. Thenumberofbrokerquotes receivedfor certain pricinginputsvariesdepending on thedepth of the tradingmarket, each individualbroker'spublicationpolicy, recent tradingvolumetrends andvarious otherfactors.\n- \u00b7 Level 3valuations useunobservableinputsfor theasset or liability. Unobservableinputsare used to theextent observableinputsare not available, therebyallowing forsituations in whichthere is little,ifany, market activity for theassetorliabilityatthe measurementdate. We usethe most meaningful informationavailablefromthe market combined with internally developedvaluationmethodologies to developour best estimate of fair value. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation models include volatility curves, correlation curves, illiquid pricing deliveryperiods andlocations andcredit-relatednonperformance risk assumptions. These inputsand valuation models aredevelopedand maintained by employees trainedand experienced in market operations andfairvalue measurements andvalidated by theCompany'sriskmanagementgroup.\n\nThefairvalue input hierarchylevel to whichanassetorliabilitymeasurementinits entiretyfalls is determined basedon\n\nthelowestlevel input that is significanttothe measurement.\n\n132",

The East segmentrepresentsresults fromVistra'selectricity generationoperations in theEastern Interconnectionof theU.S.electricgrid, otherthanassets that arenow part of theSunset or AssetClosure segments,and includesoperations in the PJM, ISO-NE andNYISO markets. We determined it wasappropriate to aggregateresults fromthese markets into one reportablesegment,East, givensimilareconomic characteristics.\n\nTheWestsegment represents results fromthe CAISOmarket, including our battery ESSprojectsatour Moss Landing power plantsite (see Note 3).\n\nTheSunset segmentconsists of generationplantswithannounced retirementdates afterDecember31, 2023. Separately reportingthe Sunset segmentdifferentiatesoperating plants with announced retirementplans fromour otheroperatingplantsin theTexas,Eastand Westsegments.
