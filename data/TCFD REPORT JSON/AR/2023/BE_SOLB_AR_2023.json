Effective December 9, 2023, the Specialty Businesses were separated from Solvay through a partial demerger of the Company, whereby the shares and other interests held by the Company in the legal entities operating the Specialty Businesses, the Company's rights and obligations under the agreements entered into with those legal entities, as well as certain other assets and liabilities were contributed to Syensqo, and ordinary shares of Syensqo were issued and allocated directly to shareholders in Solvay on a pro rata basis. In connection with the partial demerger, Syensqo became a publicly listed company independent from Solvay with its ordinary shares trading on the regulated markets of Euronext in Brussels and Paris. Solvay's ordinary shares remained listed on the regulated markets of Euronext in Brussels and Paris.\n\nThe financial results of the Specialty Businesses for the periods prior to, and until the effectiveness of, the partial demerger have been reflected in Solvay's Consolidated Income Statement, retrospectively, as discontinued operations. Subsequent to the completion of the partial demerger, Solvay decided to depart from its previous organization in four reporting segments (Materials, Solutions, Chemicals and Corporate & Business Services) and now operates under three reporting segments: Basic Chemicals, Performance Chemicals and Corporate. For additional information on the impact of the partial demerger on Solvay's financial results, please refer to Solvay's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in this report.\n\nThe completion of the partial demerger also impacted the governance of the Company, as it led to changes to the composition of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Leadership Team, in addition to amendments to the Company's Articles of Association and Governance Charter. For more information, see chapter 'Corporate Governance Statement' of this report.",

        "page_content": "## The Solvay spirit in action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nW\n\nhen future generations look back at the long history  of  Solvay,  stretching  all  the  way  to 1863, this last year will certainly stand out as a milestone moment.\n\nIn early December 2023, our shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the partial demerger and the spin-off of our specialty businesses to Syensqo. This has created  an exceptional opportunity that few organizations are ever presented with: launching a new entity showcasing innovation and renewal, while still leveraging  a distinctive industrial platform with strong foundations.\n\nPulling this off has been achieved against a difficult external macroeconomic environment with a background of geopolitical  conflict,  weak  economic  growth,  high  interest  rates, inflation, higher energy prices and high level of regulation in Europe. Despite all of these challenges, building on all the great work accomplished over the last years, Solvay was still able to deliver a strong financial performance, maintaining our competitive position and at the same time continuing to deliver on our ambitious sustainability targets. This is the Solvay spirit in action.\n\nHaving served on the previous Solvay Board, I have come to know the company and its assets well. Solvay has always been at the forefront of excellence and innovation because of the enduring values  of our founder, Ernest Solvay: science, an eagerness to learn and improve, entrepreneurship and societal responsibility.\n\nAt Solvay, we are thus rediscovering our roots and spreading our wings. At the heart  lies a central concept: Mastery. Mastery is a rich, multi-faceted and profound concept.\n\nIt starts with a key mindset: honoring past experiences to guide us for the future. In today's world we are too often absorbed by the problems of today and planning the future, and tend to forget that each day we walk on paths that have been created by our predecessors.\n\nThen, Mastery is about the relentless drive to improve and perfect  our  scientific  and  technological  capabilities.  Like  a craftsman, we must continually work and rework until we reach a level of perfection that we can be proud of. We must both welcome and reinvent traditions.\n\nMastery also implies the transmission of values and experience, from one person to another, from one team to another, from one generation to another. There is immense beauty and care in the act of genuine transmission.\n\nFinally, Mastery is about a double ambition: pursuing a demanding  performance,  while  committing  generously  to  a noble purpose.\n\nOur endeavor therefore centers on our mastering of the elements essential to our world. There is a growing demand for more sustainable products while remaining competitive, which is why we are focused on applications that help shape a future where everyone thrives. That is the central transformation we are facing. 160 years ago, Ernest Solvay developed the soda ash process and, building on his legacy, we remain committed to continued innovation and to perfecting the science of essential chemistry for generations to come. Nothing is impossible, Ernest Solvay would say, not even re-inventing his original soda ash process as we recently did, which will result in a significant reduction of our carbon emissions and use of resources such as water.\n\nOne of the most important lessons I have learned in a long career advising large complex organizations is a very simple but profound truth: in the end, it is all about people - real people like you and me, of flesh and blood, fears and hopes, dreams and ambitions, and with a desire to contribute to noble goals that create pride. Organization and process are paramount, but in the end it is the human factor that counts most. Looking at Solvay, at the core of our legacy and our future is our highly motivated and skilled workforce, who do not spare their efforts and energy. Our strength lies in our people and their values, and how this is transferred from colleague to colleague, from generation to generation. It is this collective journey that makes us successful, starting at the top of the company with its leadership, leading all the way to empowering the base.\n\nThe new Board of ten directors, including six independent ones, is diverse, skilled, experienced, and committed. More importantly, we have people with the right mindset, wisdom and ambition to step up Solvay's performance and delivery. To generate resilient cash and create sustainable and abundant value for all of our stakeholders. To serve our customers",

To earn the trust, confidence, and support of our shareholders, our anchor for the future.\n\nWe have committed to build a real and effective team with the Board. A team bound by a deep sense of stewardship and will to generate collective intelligence.\n\nBuilding on the concept of Mastery, this Board will support the Executive Leadership Team as they implement structural measures to raise the bar in all domains - strategy, mindset and operational excellence - to make Solvay more efficient and to enhance our ability to continue creating value in the long term.\n\nSo, I want to take this opportunity to express not only my gratitude but the gratitude of the entire Board, to Solvay employees for their unwavering commitment; to the Solvay leaders and Chief Executive Officer, who have strived to set up a new strategy at pace in doing so raising the bar; to our customers for their trust during this period of change and relying on our products and solutions; to the Executive Leadership Team and Board of the 'old' Solvay who have made the split possible, and finally to our shareholders for their continued commitment and support for the split.\n\nBuilding  on  our  strong  foundations,  we  embark  with  confidence and commitment on the next chapter in our history.\n\nThe spirit of Solvay is in action.\n\nPierre Gurdjian\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

I am honored to lead the company forward, supported by a skilled team of executives and the dedication of more than 9,000 employees worldwide. I thank the Board for entrusting me with the responsibility of guiding Solvay into a future that holds sustainability at its core.\n\nWith over 160 years of history, our portfolio spans key chemical sectors and includes five business lines: soda ash, peroxides, silica, rare earths, and fluorine. We hold global market and technological leadership in these areas, along with a strong regional business in Latin America, known as Coatis. We focus on delivering essential products that play a crucial role in the manufacturing of items integral to the day-to-day life of consumers, such as glass for buildings and bottles, detergents, paper, tires, semiconductors, food, and pharmaceuticals, positioning us across a wide array of markets. In line with the legacy of our founder, Ernest Solvay, we are committed to mastering the core technologies and materials that are essential to meeting our customers' fast-evolving needs, building on our strong foundation.\n\n## DELIVERING ON OUR COMMITMENTS\n\n- In 2023, amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, we  recorded  high-quality  results.  Our  net  sales  reached \u20ac4.9bn. Our EBITDA stands strong at \u20ac1.2bn, stable versus 2022 on an organic basis, with the EBITDA margin increasing to a record 25.5%. This demonstrates our ability to maintain solid financial ground even in the face of declining volumes. The  higher  profit  and  the  simplification  of  our  portfolio  resulted in a high free cash flow of \u20ac0.6bn, with a record conversion ratio of 45.4%, further strengthening our financial health.\n\nSustainability is at the heart of our operations, reinforcing our position as market leader and enhancing our competitive advantage. We are committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and I am pleased to report that we are on the right path. In 2023, we significantly accelerated our energy transition efforts. We achieved a 19% reduction in emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) compared to 2021. We are actively advancing 27 energy transition projects globally  and  implementing  energy  efficiency  upgrades  across  all our facilities, making substantial progress in the transition",

These initiatives position us strongly  to  achieve  our  ambitious  target  of  reducing  our emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\nWe have made significant progress towards our goal of phasing out coal use in our soda ash plants, and at the beginning of 2024, we announced its complete phase-out at our Green River, Wyoming, USA, facility. In 2025, our plants in Rheinberg, Germany, and Dombasle, France, will also cease coal use. Furthermore, our breakthrough e.Solvay soda ash process which is currently being piloted at an industrial scale, will put our carbon neutrality goal within reach by removing our emissions from the soda ash process.\n\nOur emissions upstream and downstream in the value chain (Scope 3 for the 'Focus 5' categories) have experienced an impressive 16% reduction compared to 2021, positioning us well on our trajectory towards achieving our 2030 target of a 20% reduction. To further this progress, we are collaborating with our top greenhouse gas (GHG)-emitting suppliers to better track and reduce emissions from our purchased goods and services.\n\nEmbracing our founder's vision, safety is a critical value at Solvay, and we will continue to push the boundaries to reach the zero accident target. In parallel, we have committed to reducing inequalities by ensuring a living wage for all Solvay employees by 2026. We initiated a pilot program to assess our adherence to living wage standards in the U.S., U.K., and China. The initial results have confirmed our compliance, affirming our status as a responsible employer.\n\nWe continue our efforts towards achieving gender balance in leadership in ten years and fostering social dialogue through the Solvay Global Forum. Our 2023 initiatives have further integrated Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) into our organization, including enhanced disability inclusion practices across all levels.\n\n## OUR STRATEGY: LEADING WITH PROCESS INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY\n\n- We have a clear strategy. We aim to deliver value to our customers through our leadership positions in every market where we operate. Our approach to achieving this is to grow in line with our customers'needs and to innovate in our production processes. Our cutting-edge hydrogen peroxide facility in Taiwan is designed to meet the region's growing demand for semiconductors, while our plant in Livorno, Italy, is introducing a new circular silica unit derived from rice husk ash, which will significantly boost the sustainability of the tire industry.\n\nFurther  strengthening  our  technology  leadership  position, we are establishing Europe's first rare earths hub for a permanent magnets value chain in La Rochelle, France, to meet growing needs in the electronics, automotive and clean energy markets. In Saudi Arabia, we plan to construct the world's first carbon-neutral soda ash facility using our innovative e.Solvay process. This initiative will set a new global standard in competitiveness and sustainability.\n\nTo drive excellence and competitiveness, we are transforming the way we operate. This means excelling as leaders in processes and cost savings, which we expect to be a major driver of our EBITDA growth over the next five years. We have started deploying initiatives aimed at delivering savings, and we are confident in achieving our goal of \u20ac300 million in annual savings by 2028.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD: AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nLooking ahead, our ambitions are high. Building on our strong foundation, we aim to further enhance our performance metrics. Our objective is not only to preserve our position in the top quartile but also to establish new standards for the industry.\n\nWhen it comes to creating sustainable value and a resilient, forward-looking business model, maintaining capital discipline  is  key.  Our  cash  allocation  strategy  will  be  simplified and more focused: one third of the generated cash will be directed towards essential capital expenditures, another third will be allocated to our shareholders, to whom we pledge a stable or increasing dividend, and the final third will support growth initiatives.\n\nI  am  excited  about  embarking  on  this  new  chapter  with Solvay. Our dedication to steering the industry towards a sustainable future, through our mastery of technology and sustainable practices, will drive Solvay's ongoing transformation. We aim to become a model of operational excellence, paving the way for a sustainable future that sets a standard for others in our industry. This is our commitment to all our stakeholders.\n\nPhilippe Kehren Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the past ten years, we have achieved a radical transformation of our company. We deeply reshaped and streamlined our portfolio, with more than 50 mergers and acquisitions in the past 15 years, exiting cyclical businesses. Our G.R.O.W. strategy and Solvay One Planet sustainability objectives accelerated the momentum, allowing us to focus on higher growth and higher margin activities while placing sustainability at the heart of what we do.\n\nThrough a gradual process, we have transitioned to more efficient  operations  to  better  serve  customers  and  initiated a  profound  cultural  change  towards  more  agility  and  customer-centricity.  We  have  achieved  our  financial  mid-term targets  three  years  ahead  of  schedule  and  made  significant\n\nScience, Innovation, Excellence and Leadership within our DNA 01\n\nIngrained in our DNA, you will find science, progress, innovation, excellence and leadership that can all be traced back to our founder, Ernest Solvay.\n\nWhat started with the invention of a synthetic soda ash process, a breakthrough that was more environmentally friendly and revolutionized the industry of the time, has since opened the door to other process innovations. Like our founder, we never settle when it comes to creating high-end chemistry.\n\nprogress on our sustainability objectives. As a result of our successful transformation journey, two distinct business groups emerged, focused respectively on essential and specialty chemicals. We decided to separate Solvay into two distinct listed companies (Solvay and Syensqo) in order to unlock the full potential of each of these business groups.\n\nOn December 8, 2023, our shareholders approved the partial demerger of Solvay SA/NV and the spin-off of our specialty businesses to a new company named Syensqo. From that date, we have welcomed the next chapter of Solvay's heritage built on the strong foundations of our past and strengthened by our recent transformation. And, as has been the case for 160 years, our products remain at the heart of everyday lives. We are essential. We are SOLVAY.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe in science and, with it, continuous progress.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, we were at the forefront of the first industrial globalization. Today, thanks to the support of our shareholders and our unshakeable commitment to process innovation and operational excellence, we are able to maintain our technology and market leadership. Based on our portfolio of quality and expertise, we continue to build upon the strong global leadership positions existing in every one of\n\nour businesses and lead process technology improvements and sustainability.\n\nOur culture of performance has been over 160 years in the making. We continuously seek to enhance our performance and respond to our customers' essential needs, expanding our culture of agility and flexibility.

The Solvay legacy of CSR lives on through several of our initiatives focused on the well-being of our employees and our communities. For example, the Solvay Life Saving Rules have been implemented to continuously improve safety at the workplace and reinforce our culture in this field.\n\nIn the 1880s, Solvay led the way when it came to social policy, taking care of employees through health and protection initiatives and forming a key part of the company's social policy. We have continued to build on this legacy through the launch of our Solvay Cares social program. Solvay Cares provides a minimum level of company social benefits for employees worldwide and includes 16\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nweeks of parental leave for all parents, health insurance, and disability and life insurance.\n\nIn 2020, we launched the Solvay Solidarity Fund to provide additional support to our people or communities facing hardship. Since then, the Fund has donated more than \u20ac10.5 million to individual and collective causes, supporting 67 projects in 16 countries.\n\nAt the cornerstone of our beliefs is social dialogue. As the first chemical company to establish a partnership with IndustriALL Global Union back in 2005, we recently renewed and strengthened our Solvay Global Forum Agreement and Global Framework Agreement with them.\n\nOur efforts to reinforce our employees' sense of belonging has also included our first employee share plan launched in 2022, which achieved an impressive participation rate ahead of the benchmark for similar initiatives, with one out of four employees being Solvay shareholders - a testament to their high level of engagement.\n\nIn order to develop and protect our culture of integrity, we have set up a Code of Business Integrity as part of our Ethics & Compliance program. It applies to every Solvay employee, regardless of location or role, and to all third parties acting on Solvay's behalf, including suppliers. Such internal due diligence procedures are pivotal to mitigating risk across our value chains.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within the past few years, we stepped up our sustainability ambitions by creating our Solvay One Planet roadmap, establishing 10 objectives to reduce our impact on the climate and natural resources and to improve the quality of life of our people and communities. This unique approach to sustainability topics provides a holistic view of many areas, such as biodiversity, circularity, quality of life, and more.\n\nWe have built a very ambitious roadmap to achieve our goal of carbon neutrality on Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. We have taken big steps towards reducing our carbon footprint, heavily investing to phase out coal for energy production at our soda ash plants, accelerating the shift to renewable energy worldwide, and constantly innovating to make our processes more sustainable and less carbon intensive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurthermore, our solid and unique Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) methodology helps us embed sustainability in our key business decisions. And we have made progress, delivering more sustainable solutions, such as our flue gas treatment product based on sodium bicarbonate SOLVair\u00ae and a wastewater disinfection treatment based on hydrogen peroxide, all while reinventing a more sustainable soda ash manufacturing process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe launched our One Dignity program, a comprehensive initiative featuring nine objectives with action plans designed to accelerate the company-wide adoption of a DEI mindset. What sets us apart is our specific approach of using equity and inclusion as building blocks for diversity. To measure our progress, we launched an annual Groupwide Pulse survey. Tackling gender inequities, we were among the very first companies to publish a gender pay gap report and launch a pay equity correction exercise covering mid and senior management across the Group.\n\nAs a continuous effort, sustainability is deeply embedded in our culture and operations.

The program addresses all aspects of the plants, such as safety, operational performance, competitiveness, people development, and sustainability, with digitalization acting as a key accelerator for these changes.\n\nLaunched in 2021 among pilot sites, the program has proven to be a real game changer in terms of business and environmental performance. Not only does it provide a framework to  efficiently  implement  our  new  operating  model  and  energy transition roadmap at all of our sites, but it also helps to prioritize resources to support each one. By upgrading the capabilities and operational efficiencies of our plants, we will be able to better meet the increasingly higher expectations of customers and of the communities around. It is now underway at half of our industrial sites and will be implemented at all 45 of our sites before mid-2024.\n\nWithin the program, each plant defines its own unique roadmap and sets bold objectives that address five main areas:\n\n- f Safety, aiming for zero accidents.\n- f Operational excellence: Implementing best practices and leveraging digital technologies to achieve and maintain best-in-industry excellence.\n- f Sustainability:  Reducing  environmental  footprint,  improving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) performance and being a responsible community partner.\n- f Digitalization: Accelerating delivery of digital- and data-enabled value for customers.\n- f People development: Upskilling our manufacturing teams, empowering them, and developing future talents.\n\nThe  STAR  Factory  program's  mindset  -  Standardize, Transform, Accelerate, Repeat - reflects our new operating model. Through sharing best practices and duplicating and applying them to all sites, we will be able to streamline our operations  and  further  leverage  our  excellence,  elevating our performance.

Our businesses now have the same profile, requirements and strategic imperatives, allowing us to be more efficient and act faster. This helps us build a fit-for-purpose operating model with a strong central governance that will generate cost efficiency.\n\nWe will drive simplification and standardization, duplicating what works in one organization. Soda ash, peroxides and silica represent 70% of our assets and are based on three technologies. We will focus on efficiently scaling our improvements across these technologies.\n\nWe are also incredibly fortunate to have talented people who are already driving transformations within their own plants and organizations. Looking forward, we will lift up those best practices and implement them, creating standards. Safety remains our core value and we will continue to progress towards our goal of zero injuries and incidents.\n\nIn addition, we will continue to drive process innovation across our businesses, investing to become safer and more reliable, make our operations and products more sustainable and cost-competitive, and disrupt the\n\nmarket. Examples include e.Solvay, our breakthrough soda ash manufacturing process, and our new circular silica for tires.\n\n## How will Solvay achieve its ambition to become the industry benchmark on costs?\n\nL.D. Our achievements will come as a result of our efforts in three areas: implementing a standard operating strategy, creating a simplified ERP landscape and leveraging our digital transformation.\n\nOur first step is to implement an operating strategy that will deliver lean and efficient operations. We have a wide range of operational maturity across our organization, with some plants having elements that are best-in-class while others can still be improved.\n\nFor example, we have several plants that have world-class predictive maintenance practices resulting in higher plant availability and lower cost. However, these practices were developed in isolation. There are many other similar examples across the company.\n\nFurthermore, creating a simplified ERP landscape will enable efficiencies in many of our support functions, such as supply chain and logistics. This critical component will help us move from being top-quartile to becoming\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe industry benchmark in terms of general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Can you further explain the role of digital transformation as a key enabler?\n\nL.D. This is our biggest opportunity to improve our business in every dimension. In digital, it all starts with data. We are in the process of creating a structured data platform where the majority of our improvements will take place. We simplified the digital agenda to focus on short- to mediumterm opportunities while creating the opportunities to explore advanced tools.\n\nAs an example, there are multiple facilities that have implemented an IoT strategy to improve the reliability of our assets. We have demonstrated a significant improvement in the cost and reliability of our assets.  As a result of the effort to create a clear data structure we can now implement this improvement across all of our plants. This is just one example. We have a whole list of improvements in all of our technologies and the fact that we have repeatable technologies that allow us to go further and faster.",

There is still more to tackle to drive excellence and efficiency in the organization. We are working on transforming how we operate companywide, looking at all aspects to standardize business performance with a strong central governance.\n\nTo support this, our STAR Factory program is being deployed in all 45 sites. It has proven to be a realgame-changer in terms of business performance, providing a framework to efficiently implement our improvements across our sites and prioritize resources to support. The STAR Factory program is so successful that we recently launched STAR Operations to support the company-wide transformation. These are the activities that will ensure that, in addition to being low cost and highly competitive, we are safe, environmentally conscious, and careful about being a responsible partner in the communities where we operate. It will also be a key lever to attract and retain talent.\n\nWe already have the elements for success. Our teams are hard at work building on the momentum that we have, and I am confident we will deliver on our commitment to make our plants 'THE benchmark' in the industry.\n\n## Process innovation to make our operations more sustainable\n\n- - Without process innovation, Solvay would not be the industry leader that we are today. Process innovation is in our DNA. It has enabled us to continuously disrupt the industry and we will continue to do so. By improving or reinventing our processes to make them more competitive and sustainable, we will strengthen our market leadership.

Solvay's process was much more effective, competitive, and sustainable. Our founder established the continuous cultivation of innovation into our DNA and today, we carry on his legacy, once again reinventing our process to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nTo provide our customers with the sustainable and competitive products they require, we need to go beyond decarbonizing our plants, phasing out coal, and adopting renewable energy sources as we are currently doing. We must change the  process  itself.  Accounting  for  a  significant  amount  of our emissions, our founder's process produces high levels of GHG emissions related to the steam generation required as part of it.\n\nTo address this, we are once again at the forefront of innovation, reimagining the soda ash production process resulting in our patented new e.Solvay technology. After investing a cumulative \u20ac40 million in research over the past 30 years, today, we are the only one in the world to propose such a breakthrough technology that adopts an electrochemical process powered by renewable energy.\n\nWe built a pilot production unit at our research center in Dombasle, France, to validate the new process at an industrial scale. It is currently running in shifts and can produce 500t of soda ash per year. Even though this is 1/1000 of a typical soda ash plant operation, it is an appropriate scale-up for an electrochemical process. The pilot study will enable us to make necessary adjustments.\n\nComplementing our energy transition program, this technology replaces lime kilns with an electrochemical process that can be powered by renewable energy instead of fossil fuels while requiring 20% less energy than the existing process. It will reduce our CO2 emissions by 50% compared to the current process. Because it is more efficient, it will also reduce our consumption of natural resources, specifically 20% less water  and  salt  and  30%  less  limestone,  while  significantly reducing the limestone residues. Before 2030, our existing plants will gradually be converted to e.Solvay. From 2030 onwards, we will build new greenfield plants using this technology. This transformation will enable us to achieve carbon neutrality on Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.\n\nReducing our energy requirements and dependence on fossil fuels will improve our competitiveness and ability to keep up with customer demand overall. Through this more sustainable e.Solvay process, we will also set a new standard for the soda ash industry.\n\n50%\n\nreduction of CO2 emissions\n\n20%\n\nless water and salt\n\n30% less limestone",

When added to a tire, our HDS helps decrease the CO2 emissions of thermal engines by approximately 7% and extends the battery range for electric vehicles up to 10% without wear compromise by combining best-in-class technologies, while improving the lifetime of tires and the grip performance for safety.\n\nTire manufacturers have set up ambitious targets in terms of sustainable raw materials, and precipitated silica is instrumental to achieving them. For example, Michelin has a target of using 40% sustainable raw materials by 2030 and 100% by 2050, while Pirelli is targeting 60% by 2030.\n\nIn response, Solvay has developed a patented proprietary process for biosourced HDS from rice husk ashes, a rice byproduct, making it a circular material. This breakthrough silicate process provides a circular solution, giving a second life to rice husks ashes in local value chains. Both customers and our planet benefit from this new process, which features a circular HDS with 100% locally sourced raw materials, a 35% reduction of CO2 emissions per metric ton of precipitated silica, thanks to a less-energy-intensive manufacturing process, and the same performance of current grades, shortening the qualification  process.  This  project  makes  Solvay  the  first HDS producer in Europe with a circular production. This new process is under industrialization at our plant in Livorno, Italy, with production expected to begin in early 2025.\n\nThis launch is only the beginning of our silica circular journey. The new generation of precipitated silica will also be able to address needs in other markets, such as Home & Personal Care and Feed & Food, where silica is used in products ranging from toothpaste to animal feed in all regions, as circular projects are being investigated in Asia and the Americas.

        "page_content": "F ollowing the spin-off of the specialty businesses to Syensqo in December 2023, Solvay has reconfirmed and even reinforced its ambitious commitment to reduce its CO 2 emissions. Our new baseline has shifted from 2018 to 2021 while maintaining a goal of a 30% reduction on Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a reduction of 20% of Scope 3 (upstream and downstream) emissions by 2030. We are also maintaining our objective to phase out coal from energy production in soda ash by 2030 wherever an alternative exists. In addition, carbon neutrality by 2050 remains an overarching objective.\n\nSolvay joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in October 2020, receiving a formal approval from the Initiative (well below 2\u00b0C) in early 2023 for its 2030 climate targets. The spin-off of Syensqo has triggered the need for a reassessment that will start with SBTi in 2024.\n\n## Accelerating our energy transition roadmap\n\n- - Our current objectives are supported by a global energy transition  roadmap  made  of  already  validated  and  financed projects with a strong delivery anticipated in 2025, as well as a portfolio of projects (still under validation process) grouped by type:\n- f Energy  transition  projects  for  which  a  significant  investment is necessary to use a less emitting primary source of energy.\n- f Energy efficiency projects that allows us to consume less energy per production unit.\n- f Renewable sourcing consisting of the substitution of current fossil energy with a renewable or low carbon option.\n\nIn 2023, Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 1.7 Mt CO2eq. (-19%) compared to 2021 and 1.2 Mt CO2eq. compared to 2022, which can be explained by lower activity, new GHG reduction projects, including biomass consumption in Devnya in substitution to coal, better mine gas usage in Green River, and other energy efficiency projects. Overall, we have more than 27 projects around the world that are either completed or underway, including four new ones that were validated in 2023.\n\nBy the end of 2023, we had already delivered a 5% structural emission reduction in Scope 1 and 2 compared to 2021 thanks  to  our  projects  in  Rheinberg,  Germany,  Devnya, Bulgaria, and Green River, Wyoming, United States. We have launched new projects that will deliver an additional 15% emission reduction by 2025 1 , with designs for more plans to save another 10% by 2030 1 .\n\n## Energy transition to phase out coal from the energy mix at our soda ash plants\n\n- Soda ash production is based on an energy-intensive process, originally relying on local coal sources. Phasing out coal from our energy mix is obviously  necessary  to achieve the carbon neutrality target. This journey is almost completed at Green River, US, plant (Q1 2024) and underway at Rheinberg, Germany, and Dombasle, France, with the construction of validated projects (Q1 and Q2 2025 respectively).\n\nDevnya, Bulgaria, and Torrelavega, Spain, are in the final step of defining their own roadmap. In addition:\n\n- f The Green River, Wyoming, US plant will complete its full coal phase-out by Q1 2024. The full substitution of coal by natural gas will allow a CO 2 emission reduction close to 280 kt/y.\n- f The Rheinberg, Germany, plant will be primarily powered by locally sourced biomass waste. The first step of the project is already completed (2022) while the second one will be finalized by the end of 2024 to deliver 485 kt/y CO 2 emission reduction.\n- f In  Dombasle,  France,  where  Solvay  is  partnering  with Veolia, the plant expected to completely phase out the use of coal for energy generation by mid-2025. The coal will be substituted by local refuse-derived fuel (RDF). After the completion of the project, the plant is expected to emit 240 kt/y less CO 2 than in 2021.\n- f The Devnya, Bulgaria, plant has already adapted one of its existing boilers to increase its co-combustion rate with biomass. The boiler, which can be powered by 30% biomass fuel from a variety of sources, including locally sourced sunflower husk pellets, it reduced the plant's CO 2 emissions by around 100 kt  in 2023 compared to the current process.\n\n## Energy transition to phase out fuel oil at our Collonges silica plant\n\n- In 2023, Solvay announced that our Silica business was planning to construct an electric furnace to replace the existing fuel-powered one at our Collonges, France, facility, with operations scheduled to start in 2025. This strategic shift towards clean energy sources is expected to reduce by 20 kt per year the CO 2 emissions related to Silica production activities compared to the current process. This new investment will  secure  long-term  sustainability  and  competitiveness targets and delivers enduring advantages to our customers. Combined with our circular silica offering, this should position us to provide a unique value proposition to customers and consumers alike.",

Despite the change, we were able to reduce  overall  Scope  3  (for  our  five 1 main categories) GHG emissions by 16% in 2023 compared to 2021, inclusive of the methodological change.\n\nCollaborating with suppliers is key to achieving our target and addressing the first and main category: purchased goods and services.\n\nWe have active collaboration with our most GHG-emitting raw materials suppliers to collect data on the product carbon footprint (PCF) of the raw materials they supply to us - a preliminary step that enables us to track and manage progress. In 2023, we collected more than 50% 2 of the PCF coverage of our raw materials. We have also created a more dedicated and specific approach with suppliers, for example, understanding their Scope 1 and 2 climate strategies and their potential impacts on our Scope 3 emissions.\n\nIn Q4 2023, we called on some of our top raw materials suppliers to share their actions towards decarbonization and climate strategies so that we can better understand how their plans will impact our PCF. The first wave consisted of eight suppliers, and a second wave of requests is planned for 2024. Our objective is to create a clear upstream Scope 3 roadmap featuring specific actions to help us reach our goal.\n\nFurthermore, Solvay is partnering with transportation providers to reduce upstream emissions resulting from transportation. The Voikkaa site, for example, takes an additional step forward as it transitions transportation fuel from diesel to biofuel. This shift will result in a significant reduction of over 700 tons of CO2 emissions in 2024, representing more than 80% of the site transportation carbon footprint.\n\nBesides suppliers, Solvay is looking to engage its employees in reducing Scope 3 emissions linked to business travel. In 2023, Solvay launched the Travel Carbon Fund to track its carbon travel footprint, raising awareness of responsible and sustainable travel. In doing so, we ultimately aim to finance a fund for sponsoring sustainability projects with a carbon-offset focus wherever feasible. Starting in 2023, Global Business Units began contributing a monetary amount based on the entity's travel footprint, calculated at \u20ac100 per ton of CO 2 , to the Fund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBraskem, a global petrochemical company has been a key supplier for Solvay for several decades. We have developed strong relationships based on our common commitment to sustainability, competitiveness, and innovative solutions to stay ahead of market needs. Braskem is engaged in contributing to the value chain to strengthen the circular economy.\n\n## What is the driving force behind the relationship between Braskem and Solvay?\n\nJorge Soto Braskem and Solvay's long-lasting business relationship is directly aligned to both companies' sustainable development goals. Since the 70s, Braskem's Cumene plant located in Mau\u00e1 - S\u00e3o Paulo, has focused on supplying Solvay's Paul\u00ednia S\u00e3o Paulo site, with raw material, for their Coatis business in Latin America.\n\n## How is Braskem reducing its carbon footprint?\n\nJ.S.

Our STAR Factory program, which is currently being rolled out globally across our sites, defines clear roadmaps for each plant with targeted actions that will be pursued long term. They include initiatives to reduce our non-sustainable industrial waste and freshwater intake where applicable.\n\n## Reducing pressure on biodiversity\n\n-Since 2020, Solvay has been combining a global and local approach with the aim of reducing pressure and damage, and  progressively  restoring  biodiversity  around  our  sites. We want to contribute to the main objectives of the Global Biodiversity Framework adopted in Montr\u00e9al-Kumming COP 15 in December 2022, which are to stop biodiversity loss and reverse the trend.\n\nBy understanding and addressing our impact throughout the value chain, from raw materials to production, we have found ways to reduce pressure on biodiversity. Since 2018, we have decreased our impact by 20%. Our impact on biodiversity is calculated across the value chain for our entire portfolio 1 of products.\n\n## Recognized for our actions to protect and restore biodiversity\n\n-  Our  Paul\u00ednia,  Brazil,  Torrelavega,  Spain,  and  Rosignano, Italy  sites  were  recognized  by  the  International  Union  for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for contributing to the protection and restoration of biodiversity. In its 2023 report, the IUCN compiled 28 case studies that highlighted the initiatives from several multinational companies among which our three sites were recognized. This demonstrates our proactive approach to safeguarding natural ecosystems and setting a  higher  standard  for  biodiversity  conservation  within  our operational areas. Our approach not only aims for the protection of natural environments but also actively contributes to local communities and ecological education.",

From 1927 to 2006, the Cuch\u00eda quarry supplied limestone to our soda ash factory in Torrelavega. When the quarry ceased activity in 2006, we went beyond regulatory obligations ahead of the quarry's closure. Focused on landscape integration and biodiversity, we launched the Ecological Recovery Plan, planting thousands of native trees and documenting diverse wildlife. We also collaborated with organizations like SEO BirdLife and the European Union's LIFE Stop Cortaderia project to further enhance restoration. This transformed area now thrives as a bird sanctuary and is a natural area available to the local community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Preserving local biodiversity through site-specific objectives\n\n- All of our sites have been assessed based on their sensitivity  towards  biodiversity  using  two  international  reference tools: the IUCN Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) and the World Wide Fund for Nature's (WWF) Biodiversity  Risk  Filter.  These  tools  identify  protected species  and  areas  around  a  specific  location,  as  well as  'Key  Biodiversity  Areas,'  which  play  a  significant  role in  biodiversity  conservation  and  sensitive  ecosystems. An update of previous assessments was performed in 2023 to consider additional information from these international databases.\n\nBased on this evaluation, we have prioritized 16 of our manufacturing sites and are developing and implementing biodiversity roadmaps for each.\n\nOur roadmaps aim to:\n\n- f Develop a vision for improved integration of the site into its local environment and communities.\n- f Identify and implement projects at sites and in surrounding areas to protect biodiversity and support regeneration.\n- f Develop 'nature-based solutions' that will bring economic, environmental, and social benefits.\n\nOut of the 16 priority sites, nine of them have already validated their roadmap and started implementation, including Dombasle and La Rochelle in France, Linne Herten in the Netherlands, Anan in Japan, Paulinia in Brazil, Torrelavega in Spain, and Rosignano in Italy.\n\n## Launching SBTs to prioritize actions for our plants\n\n- In 2023, the first two steps of the method developed by the Science Based Targets Network were applied to our sites. They consisted of evaluating impacts and dependencies on nature all along the value chain and prioritizing key issues and locations for taking action.\n\nThe results from step two confirmed the importance of investing in the carbon neutrality trajectory, as climate change is the main pressure on biodiversity from direct operations. Brazilian sites from Coatis appear in the top three priorities for land use pressure while soda ash sites have to be prioritized based on water consumption, especially when the sites are located in water stressed areas. For upstream supply, mineral raw materials represent the main pressure on nature and the use of coal in a few remaining sites is the primary pressure related to energy.\n\nThe Science Based Targets Network by the Global Common Alliance has developed methods to support companies to operate within environmental boundaries on a social equitable basis through the setting of science-based targets (SBTs). SBTs are measurable, actionable and time-bound objectives based on best-available science that allow companies to align with Earth's limits and social sustainability goals.\n\n## Managing our water-related risks\n\n- 2023 was again a year marked by record high temperatures, long periods without rainfall around the world, and more  frequent  extreme  events  such  as  floods.  NASA  and other climate observatories like Copernicus in Europe confirmed 2023 as being the warmest year on record. Because water is essential to our operations, shortages can have a significant impact and even lead to production losses.",

We can now monitor more than 90% of Solvay's daily freshwater intake across the world, thanks to the dashboard put in place last year.\n- f Drawing up and/or updating water-related risk mitigation plans for each industrial site.\n- f Launching water consumption reduction projects to manage risks at priority sites.\n\nIn 2023, we reduced our freshwater intake by around 20 million m 3 compared to last year, and by 9% compared to 2021, mainly due to lower volumes of production.\n\n## Number of initiatives across our sites\n\n- To address water scarcity at our sites, we have launched various water management initiatives. Through our STAR Factory program, we are developing water intake and consumption reduction roadmaps for over 20 of our sites.\n\nAt our silica plant in W\u0142oc\u0142awek, Poland, we were able to reduce the freshwater intake by 8% in 2023 compared to 2022, at similar production levels, thanks to water reuse and recycling initiatives.\n\nIn parallel, to minimize the consumption of surface water and control well water intake, we continued to optimize the operation of cooling towers. Actions were implemented in several sites, such as our soda ash plant in Bernburg, Germany, where we put in place a tracer-based river water system targeted at reducing river water intake by 250.000 m\u00b3 on a yearly basis beginning in 2023.\n\nThe  investment  procedure  was  also  revised  to  integrate costs of externalities for water.

This led to the implementation of seven additional water risk mitigation plans in 2023. In total, we now have 10 plants with water mitigation plans, with the potential to achieve 10% water intake reduction through specific water projects and even possibly go beyond this thanks to our carbon neutrality strategy.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of drought, we conducted several onsite diagnostics at our plants in Dombasle and Collonges in France. In Dombasle, the shortage of water could jeopardize plant operations and may lead to severe reduction of production capacity of the site. Water scarcity impacts both the availability of cooling water and of process water for the production of its final product. A project was launched in 2023 to create a detailed mapping of all process water flows and usages. An action plan was made to reduce, recycle, and reuse the process water in order to be better prepared for drought. This plan will be implemented in the frame of the National French program to reach -10% water intake by 2030 compared to 2023.\n\n## Our initiatives to reduce non-sustainable industrial waste\n\n- Non-sustainable industrial waste is waste that is disposed of without energy recovery, for example through incineration. At Solvay, we are committed to reducing our impact on nature and we have long been taking initiatives to reduce this type of waste. This means finding ways to either reduce it at the source, reuse it in the same process, recycle it in another process, or recover energy from it.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, we had projects deployed at more than 20 plants across the world to address non-sustainable industrial waste and this is expected to continue growing through our STAR Factory program.\n\nRecycling is one of our ways to reduce our industrial waste, contributing to a circular economy along with preserving resources and nature.\n\n## CREATING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY FOR THE RESIDUES GENERATED FROM OUR SOLVAIR\u00ae TECHNOLOGY\n\nFor decades, Solvay has been dedicated to establishing a circular economy for the residues generated from flue gas cleaning through our SOLVAir\u00ae technology. More than 80% of SOLVAir\u00ae residue can be recycled into purified brine, serving as a circular raw material in soda ash manufacturing at our facilities in Dombasle, France, and Rosignano, Italy.\n\nIn January 2024, we announced capacity expansions for our Resolest\u00ae 1 and Solval\u00ae units, specifically designed for recycling residues from the flue gas cleaning process using the market-leading SOLVAir\u00ae solution. The rising demand for this advanced technology stems from the enforcement of stringent environmental standards governing emissions across various industries. By the end of 2025, Resolest\u00ae is poised to undergo a significant 60% surge in recycling capacity. Likewise, commencing January 2024, Solval\u00ae is set to witness a substantial 30% increase in its capacity.\n\nThis aligns with our dedication to a circular economy, supporting initiatives such as the European Green Deal. By doing so, we support our customers from various industries in their sustainability journey while fostering responsible business growth at Solvay. In addition, this innovative process empowers both plants to reduce natural brine consumption, actively contributing to resource conservation. SOLVAir\u00ae patented sodium-based solutions enable various industries to efficiently eliminate over 99% of pollutants.",

In order to implement more circular processes, we looked for partnerships outside of the value chain and worked with open innovation to find new feasible solutions that would create additional value for all. For wastewater treatment sludge and water treatment sludge, we are currently working with partners and circular alternatives of waste recovery, where these materials will be used in the bricks for the fertilizers industry. In 2023, while we are working on those alternatives, we sent approximately 36% of the sludge from the water treatment unit to partners in the cement industry to be incorporated as raw material (co-processing).\n\n## Giving a second life to soda ash production waste\n\n- At the Solvay site in Torrelavega, Spain, where we produce soda ash and bicarbonate, discussions about sustainability and circularity have led to new partnerships. When looking to create sustainable solutions for waste, team members developed  external  collaborations  to  find  a  second  life  for select materials, such as ashes resulting from the soda ash manufacturing process. This led to a partnership with a cement plant with whom we worked closely to sort, adapt, and upgrade our ashes in order to meet their needs and quality specifications. This win-win situation, made possible thanks to  transparency,  flexibility,  and  agility  from  both  sides,  enabled us to recycle about 35% of the non-hazardous waste generated by the plant in 2023.\n\n## Projects deployed at over 20 plants across the world to address non-sustainable industrial waste\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result, we are assessing our living wage equity with plans to close any potential gaps within the company by 2030. This will ensure that our 9,000+ employees around the world receive a fair living wage by 2026, meaning a sufficient salary to afford a standard of living for each employee even if they should become the single income earner of their family. In order to do so, we have partnered with experts, such as the Fair Wage Network, an independent organization that provides a comprehensive and updated database used to define, build and deploy living wage assessments to make concrete steps towards improved fair wage practices. The first assessments have taken place in China, the US and the UK, which represent 16% of our internal workforce. As part of this step towards securing a more equitable workplace, Solvay will report on the fair living wage initiative progress annually to the UN Global Compact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong commitment to ethics and compliance\n\n- Ethical and compliant behavior is essential to how Solvay does business. In 2023, we published a new section on our corporate website, highlighting our commitment to ethics and compliance, our Code of Business Integrity, and our policies, actions, and audited data. All of our employees are required to undertake mandatory annual training, and our Speak Up service gives employees a way to safely report or seek assistance if they witness any inappropriate or unethical behaviors.\n\n## Social dialogue key in times of strategic disruption\n\n- Good social dialog is key to driving commitment, motivation, and business success. We ensure our employees' representatives stay informed about strategic decisions and encourage feedback. As a result, we experience a high level of maturity, transparency, and trust among senior management and employees. This greatly contributed to our successful separation from Syensqo.\n\nIn 2022, we renewed and strengthened our Solvay Global Forum Agreement and Global Framework Agreement with the IndustriALL union, the global union for the chemical industry. Current commitments in the agreements address the areas of mental and physical health and safety at work, including the fight against discrimination, promotion of inclusion and diversity, remote work rights, and respect for the environment. The latest addition to our Agreement is that Solvay expects  its  suppliers,  contractors,  and  subcontractors  to contribute to Solvay's compliance with the provisions of this agreement.\n\nThroughout the partial demerger project, regular discussion took  place  with  both  the  Solvay  Global  Forum  (SGF)  and the European Works Council (EWC), both before and after the official  consultation, through the creation of an 'Ad Hoc Committee.' This enabled us to address the concerns of the representatives at an early stage and to provide responses, such as the support put in place for the exit from the Master Transitional Service Agreements (TSAs) entered into between Solvay and Syensqo in connection with the partial demerger.",

After  first establishing  our  vision  and  baseline  for  diversity,  equity, and inclusion (DEI) and then putting into motion the major cultural change to make it a reality, we were ready for the next phase. Last year, we continued to carry out our strategic roadmap, aiming to strengthen DEI within our organization's culture and embed it in our day-to-day business through initiatives that focused on leaders, employees, industrial sites, customers, and suppliers, using our nine Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to help raise awareness through our organization.\n\nchallenging, but changes also happen naturally, and that's a great thing to see.\n\nLastly, we keep the agreements and social benefits from Solvay legacy and we can continue building on them.\n\nWhat are your priorities as SGF coordinator? How could the new Solvay become an even more attractive employer?\n\nM.R. We have made a lot of progress, but we must remain honest and acknowledge that we still have work to do. We need to be more inclusive and diverse, respecting everybody's opinions and the way every individual acts in life, which is not always the case across the company. In addition, we'll have to face a more challenging global economic situation and the constraints that come with it.\n\nA critical point for the future is to look after all our talents, not only the highpotential ones. We have to create opportunities for the many talents we have working on shop floors, especially in the many small sites we have, in order to keep them in the company for a much longer time.\n\nWe  have a very open and transparent atmosphere in many areas of the company and we need to continue working to make that available everywhere. Let's celebrate our progress and our unique social dialogue!\n\nThroughout the year, we focused on gender parity during recruitment as well as the nomination of Solvay leaders. In 2023, 26.3% of mid and senior managers were women.\n\nAdditionally, we have progressed forward on our pay equity journey, ensuring this is done in a gender-neutral manner. We conducted off-cycle reviews using a statistically sound model for computing 'expected salaries ' by country and job class. A review was conducted for 951 1 employees identified as a priority. When the pay gap could not be justified by performance, seniority or another objective reason, it led to an off-cycle salary increase, performed in January 2023.\n\n- 1.

Eureka, our Latin American based ERG that helps employees nurture theirwell-being at work, planned and implemented the action led by Claudinei, who shared information among shop floor employees, encouraged open conversation, and built unity among teams, creating a safe space for all to share and learn about DEI. Acting as the voice for all shifts, Claudinei participates in events, taking notes and materials to share with shop floor employees. The response from every shift has been overwhelmingly positive, with plans to expand and enhance this initiative.

Depending on our different business models, we are involved upstream in the value chain, producing some of the raw materials we use, or downstream, processing chemicals or producing formulations.\n\nIn addition, we work closely with suppliers, partners, customers,  and  brand  owners  to  share  knowledge  and  unlock shared value all across the value chain. This includes constantly raising the bar to reach our sustainability commitments by working together to build a greener, more agile, and resilient supply chain. In 2023, we mapped more than 50% of the product carbon footprint (PCF) coverage of our raw materials.\n\nTo offer more innovative features and bring greater added value to customers, we blend or transform products.

Agency feedback has a real impact on our priorities, as it helps us to better understand our stakeholders' key concerns and is an invaluable measurement of our strengths as well as areas where we need to improve.\n\nIn  previous  years,  we  have  focused  our  action  plans  on addressing the common strengths and weaknesses identified by the ratings agencies. This allowed us to achieve results in the top quartile, and sometimes even the top ten. However, questionnaires are evolving and agencies are now sometimes assessing the same dimensions differently. This means, for example, that while some ratings agencies identify 'green sales' as a strength for Solvay, based on the use of our Sustainable Portfolio Management methodology, others identify it as a weakness because of our limited use of biosourced raw materials.\n\nDespite these challenges, we continue to take comments from ratings agencies very seriously. This includes addressing operational eco-efficiency, the need to reduce emissions while monitoring our impact on biodiversity and on the entire value chain.

Middle and senior management levels refer to the entire active internal workforce having Hay points above 530 and 2022 is out of the audit scope.\n- (f) This KPI is out of the scope of the audit.\n\n## Climate\n\nIn November 2023, Solvay renewed its ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050 and confirmed its mid-term targets of -30% for scope 1 & 2, and -20% for scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 vs. 2021 baseline.\n\nScope 1 & 2 emissions decreased by 1.7 Mt CO2eq (-19%) as compared to 2021 and 1.2 Mt CO2eq as compared to 2022 which can be explained by lower activity (0.8 Mt CO2eq), new GHG reduction projects (0.3 Mt CO2eq), including biomass consumption in Devnya in substitution to coal, better mine gas usage in Green River and other energy efficiency projects. Building on the 5% structural savings achieved from 2018 to 2021, Solvay launched new projects that will deliver additional 20% emission reductions by 2025, with plans to save another 10% by 2030.\n\nCoal phase-out was completed in Green River, U.S. in Q1 2024, and is underway in Rheinberg, Germany and Dombasle, France. Plants in Devnya, Bulgaria and Torrelavega, Spain have started their journey with partial introduction of biomass co-firing. The shift towards more renewable energy sources is also advancing with for instance the switch to 100% wind power in Voikkaa, Finland starting 2023.\n\nIn addition, the roll-out of the STAR Factory program which started in 2022 led to an acceleration of energy efficiency initiatives through deployment on about half of the sites. Thanks to a standardized methodology, 60+ projects have been implemented saving fossil-based heat and electricity. Electricity consumptions have been reduced thanks to process control actions and installation of variable frequency drives.",

        "page_content": "Solvay's scope 3 emissions (focus 5 categories) decreased by 16% versus 2021. Solvay is collaborating with its  most GHG-emitting raw materials suppliers to track and to improve its purchased goods and services emissions (category 1). The Group already mapped a total of more than 50% of the product carbon footprint (PCF) coverage of its raw materials. Solvay also aims at reducing its employees scope 3 emissions linked to business travels (category 6). Concretely, as from January 2023, an internal tax - based on the travel footprint calculated at \u20ac100 per ton of CO2 - is charged to every business. It will finance a Travel Carbon Fund with the aim of sponsoring sustainability projects with a carbon-offset focus wherever feasible.\n\n## Better Life\n\nIn 2023, the rate of reportable injuries and illnesses remained stable versus 2022 at 0.27. This performance derives from the safety culture deployed across the Group with interactive safety dialogues, near misses reporting, Solvay Life Saving Rules improvement initiatives and audit findings.\n\nIn 2023, Solvay progressed in its Solvay One Dignity program launched in 2021. The Group took concrete actions to strengthen DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion)  within its company's culture and to embed it in its day-to-day activities with a clear focus on leaders and employees. Solvay has nine Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that encourage employees to recognize and celebrate diversity, which is a critical component to guide the DEI journey. With the spin-off of Syensqo, the population of mid and senior management at Solvay shrank by -4.3% and resulted in a drop of the proportion of women in mid and senior management from 28.8% (end of 2022) to 26.3% (end of 2023) without changing Solvay's dedication to gender parity within 10 years.\n\nIn 2023, the Group joined the UN Global Compact living wage action, part of its Forward Faster initiative. As a result, Solvay is undertaking living wage equity with the objective to close any potential gaps by 2026. The 9,000+ Solvay employees will receive a fair living wage by 2026, meaning a sufficient salary to afford a standard of living for each employee even if they should become the single income earner of their family. The Group is partnering with the Fair Wage Network, an independent organization that provides their expertise to deploy living wage assessments and to improve fair wage practices. The first assessments took place in China, the US and the UK, which represents 16% of Solvay's workforce. As part of this step towards securing a more equitable workplace, Solvay will report on the fair living wage initiative progress annually to the UN Global Compact. More information will be available in the Solvay Annual Integrated Report to be published in April 2024.\n\n## 2. PREPARATION BACKGROUND\n\n## 2.1.  Comparability of results & reconciliation of underlying Income Statement indicators\n\nIn addition to IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents underlying Income Statement performance indicators to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of Solvay's economic performance. These figures adjust IFRS figures for the non-cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to acquisitions, for the coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity under IFRS but treated as debt in the underlying statements, and for other elements to generate a measure that avoids distortion and facilitates the appreciation of performance and comparability of results over time.\n\n## 2.2.  Alternative performance metric (APM)\n\nSolvay measures its financial performance using alternative performance metrics, which can be found below. Solvay believes that these measurements are useful for analyzing and explaining changes and trends in its historical results of operations, as they allow performance to be compared on a consistent basis. Definitions of the different metrics presented here are included in the glossary at the end of this financial report.\n\n## 2.3.  Description of the operational segments\n\nFollowing the Partial Demerger of the Specialty business on December 9, 2023, Solvay restructured its operating segments to better align with the Group's strategy and is organized in the following operating segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Basic Chemicals host chemical intermediate businesses focused on mature and resilient markets. Solvay is a world leader in soda ash and peroxides and major markets served include building and construction, consumer goods and food.\n- \u00b7 Performance Chemicals offer a unique formulation & application expertise through customized specialty formulations. Its Silica, Coatis and Special Chem businesses are also high quality assets with strong positions in their markets.\n- \u00b7 Corporate comprises corporate and other business services, such as Group research & innovation.",

The distribution per region is the following: in Europe (70%) followed by the Americas (21%), and Asia and the rest of the world (8%). The main energy sources expense are natural gas for 33% (vs 44% in 2022), coke, anthracite, petcoke and coal for 39% (vs 29% in 2022), electricity for 21% (vs 21% in 2022), steam, hydrogen and biomass for 6% (vs 5% in 2022).\n\nMore information on energy efficiency is available in the Extra-financial section of this Annual Report 4.2.

These figures adjust IFRS figures for the non-cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to acquisitions, for the coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity under IFRS but treated as debt in the underlying statements, and for other elements to generate a measure that avoids distortion and facilitates the appreciation of performance and comparability of results over time.\n\nEBITDA on an IFRS basis totaled \u20ac701 million, versus \u20ac1,246 million on an underlying basis. The difference of \u20ac545 million is explained by the following adjustments to IFRS results, which are done to improve the comparability of underlying results:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac455 million to adjust for the 'Result from portfolio management and major restructuring' (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment elements), including the loss on RusVinyl disposal and the restructuring and other costs incurred for the project aimed at the separation of the Group into two independent, publicly listed companies and other restructuring initiatives.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac50 million to adjust for the 'Result from legacy remediation and major litigations', mainly due to environmental provisions accrued.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac68 million to adjust for the pure corporate cost related to the project aimed at the separation of the Group into two independent listed companies\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-21 million to exclude net losses/gains related to the management of the CO2 hedges not accounted for as Cash Flow Hedge, deferred in adjustments until the maturity of the economic hedge\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-7 million to exclude contribution to equity earnings of RusVinyl, disposed of in Q1 2023.\n\nEBIT on an IFRS basis totaled \u20ac278 million, versus \u20ac926 million on an underlying basis. The difference of \u20ac647 million is explained by the abovementioned \u20ac545 million adjustments at the EBITDA level and \u20ac102 million of 'Depreciation, amortization & impairments'. The latter consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac7 million to adjust for the non-cash impact of purchase price allocation (PPA), consisting of amortization charges on intangible assets,\n- \u00b7 which are adjusted in \"Other operating gains & losses\" for \u20ac7 million.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac95 million to adjust for the impact of impairment of other non-performing assets in 'Results from portfolio management and major restructuring'\n\nNet financial charges on an IFRS basis were \u20ac-99 million versus \u20ac-140 million on an underlying basis. The \u20ac-41 million adjustment made to IFRS net financial charges mainly consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-70 million reclassification of coupons on perpetual hybrid bonds, which are treated as dividends under IFRS, and as financial charges in underlying results\n- \u00b7 \u20ac17 million related to the impact of decreasing discount rates on environmental provisions\n- \u00b7 \u20ac16 million related to costs for the refinancing in the context of the Partial Demerger.\n\nIncome taxes on an IFRS basis were \u20ac-208 million, versus \u20ac-198 million on an underlying basis. The \u20ac10 million adjustment mainly relates to the adjustments of the earnings before taxes described above and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\nDiscontinued operations generated \u20ac2,132 million profit on an IFRS basis and a profit of \u20ac842 million on an underlying basis.\n\nProfit / (loss) attributable to Solvay shareholders was \u20ac2,093 million on an IFRS basis and \u20ac1,417 million on an underlying basis. The delta of \u20ac-676 million reflects the above-mentioned adjustments to EBIT, net financial charges and income taxes.",

If approved and taking into account the interim gross dividend of \u20ac1.62 per share paid on January 17, 2024, a final gross dividend of \u20ac0.81 per share will be paid on June 5, 2024.\n\nIn addition, the Board has confirmed the dividend policy of Solvay as follows:\n\n- 'Solvay's policy is to propose a stable or growing dividend to its shareholders. Solvay yearly dividend is paid in two installments:\n- \u00b7 the interim dividend (typically 40% of the previous year's total dividend) is announced with the Third Quarter Results and paid in January.\n- \u00b7 the final dividend is announced in February/March, along with the Full Year Results, and is paid, if approved, after the Ordinary General Meeting.'\n\nFor over 40 years, the dividend has been stable or has gradually increased, and has never been reduced.\n\n## 7. OUTLOOK\n\nAcross its product portfolio, Solvay expects current demand levels to continue over the next few months and, as such, expects H1 2024 volumes to be broadly in line with H2 2023. At this point, there is little visibility on the second half of the year, however there are signs that the trend in the second half could improve. Solvay expects Soda Ash prices over FY 2024 to be lower than FY 2023, consistent with the current market environment, which will affect the business margin in 2024. Pricing trends across Solvay's other businesses are forecasted to be more resilient year on year.\n\nLower energy and raw materials prices should offset some of the negative pressure on the topline. More importantly, Solvay has started to implement cost savings initiatives that will start to deliver results in 2024.\n\nFor full year 2024, Solvay expects an organic growth of the underlying EBITDA by -10% to -20% versus a high comparison base in 2023, especially in H1. This translates into a range of \u20ac925 million to \u20ac1,040 million at a 1.10 EUR/USD exchange rate.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nSolvay SA/NV ('Solvay' or the 'Company') - headquartered in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris - is committed to upholding the highest level of Belgian governance practices and disclosures. We consistently seek to strengthen our corporate governance practices and disclosures, emphasizing transparency and promoting a culture of sustainable long-term value creation, in line with our Purpose.\n\nSolvay's Board is responsible for maintaining the Solvay Group's long-term strategic thinking and for overseeing, challenging and supporting the Executive Leadership Team's implementation of Solvay's strategy.\n\nIn accordance with Belgian law, Solvay adheres to the principles and provisions of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code (the 'Belgian Governance Code'), which is based on a 'comply or explain' principle. The English, French and Dutch versions of the Belgian Governance Code can be found on the website of the Belgian Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nSolvay's Board has adopted a Corporate Governance Charter (the 'Governance Charter'). The Governance Charter was last amended on December 9, 2023 (see section 2.4. below for further details on the latest changes to the Governance Charter) and is available in English, French and Dutch on Solvay's corporate website. It describes the main aspects of Solvay's approach to corporate governance, including the governance structure and the internal rules of the Board, the Executive Leadership Team and the Committees set up by the Board.\n\nIn addition, Solvay publishes a Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Integrated Report, which includes the information required by the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (hereafter the 'Code of Companies and Associations' or 'BCCA') and the Belgian Governance Code. The Corporate Governance Statement includes additional factual information regarding Solvay's corporate governance practices and relevant modifications thereto, together with details on the remuneration of directors and executives and on relevant events that took place during the preceding year.\n\nThis section of the Annual Integrated Report constitutes Solvay's Corporate Governance Statement for the year 2023.\n\n## 2. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR\n\n2023 was a pivotal year for the Solvay Group with the completion of the separation of Solvay into two independent publicly listed companies.\n\nOn December 8, 2023, the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of the Company and Syensqo SA/NV ('Syensqo') approved the Partial Demerger of the Company whereby the shares and other interests the Company held in the legal entities operating the so-called 'Specialty Businesses,' its rights and obligations under the agreements entered into with those legal entities, as well as certain other assets and liabilities were transferred to Syensqo (the 'Partial Demerger'), with 99.53% of positive votes.\n\nAccordingly, the Partial Demerger became effective at 00:00 am CET during the night of December 8, 2023 to December 9, 2023 (the 'Partial Demerger Date'), at which time the assets and liabilities of the Company set forth in the Partial Demerger proposal were transferred pursuant to a universal succession regime to Syensqo.\n\nThe completion of the Partial Demerger impacted the governance of Solvay. Amongst others, it led to changes to the composition of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Leadership Team and to amendments to the Articles of Association and to the Governance Charter. In accordance with Principle 1.3 of the Belgian Governance Code, these changes are further described below.",

Unless otherwise indicated, section 2.3.1 of this Annual Integrated Report refers to theoretical voting rights, taking into account all the shares to which voting rights are attached, even if the exercise of these rights is suspended.\n\n## Solvac\n\nSolvay's largest shareholder is Solvac SA (' Solvac '). Solvac is a public limited liability company established under Belgian law, founded in 1983. Its annual reports indicate that its primary asset consists of shares in Solvay.\n\nIts most recent notification to Solvay is dated from March 29, 2021, and indicates it owns 32,621,583 shares of Solvay, representing 30.81% of the total number of shares issued by Solvay.\n\nSolvac's shares are traded on Euronext Brussels.

The contemplated separation would firmly establish two industry leaders respectively in essential and specialty chemicals, each positioned to meet their key strategic, financial and sustainability goals.\n\nSolvac continues to be convinced of the role that essential chemistry plays to respond to humanity's needs and of the impact of innovation that specialty chemistry will play to answer future sustainability challenges.\n\n'Following Solvac's initial expression of support in its press release of March 15, 2022, Solvay has published further information with respect to the",

The Board of Directors of Solvac, on the basis thereof, confirms Solvac's continued full support of the project as announced on Solvay's website and as presented in the documents and the capital market day relating to it.'\n\nA relationship agreement with Solvac has not been considered necessary so far. Under the new Corporate Governance, Solvay welcome the proportional representation of Solvac's representative on the Board of Solvay as a sign of long term commitment to Solvay's new chapter and its continued success.\n\n## Solvay Stock Option Management\n\nSolvay Stock Option Management SRL (SSOM) is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Solvay. As of December 31, 2023, SSOM held 868,990 Solvay shares and 279,880 call options entitling it to purchase Solvay shares. Those shares and options are held by SSOM on its own account, as part of its strategy to cover the obligations assumed by SSOM regarding stock options granted by Solvay to Solvay Group senior executives.\n\nThe voting rights attached to the shares held by Solvay Stock Option Management are, as a matter of law, suspended.\n\n## Employee Share Purchase Plan\n\nIn December 2021, Solvay announced a global employee shareholding initiative, the Employee Share Purchase Program ('ESPP'), in coordination with the Solvay Global Forum, a global employee representative body created in 2015 to meet with Solvay's top management on a quarterly basis to comment on and discuss the quarterly results of Solvay and to keep everyone informed of the main new projects. The ESPP was set-up to increase the Solvay Group employees' understanding of Solvay's performance and enhance their sense of belonging and ownership in Solvay.\n\nIn September 2022, 6,105 employee shareholders participated to the first employee shareholder plan. As at December 31, 2023, 2,075 active employees at Solvay were part of the ESPP.\n\nIn October 2024 they will receive their free and matching Solvay shares. The number of those free and/or matching shares will be determined based on the 30-day average closing price of the Solvay share relative to the combined 30-day average closing prices of the Syensqo share and the Solvay share.\n\n## 3.4.  Relations with investors and analysts\n\nSolvay maintains an open, ongoing and constructive dialogue with the investment community. We always seek to provide pertinent and accurate information to ensure understanding of Solvay's business and strategy, helping the financial community to make make its own informed assessments and judgments. Detailed information on our business activities, strategy and financial performance is available through various regulatory and other publications, such as the Annual Integrated Report, financial reports and press releases, as well as other media, such as webcasts, which are available on our website.\n\nThe Investor Relations team maintains a close relationship with investors throughout the year. The CEO and CFO also prioritize interactions with the investment community. Solvay's teams have been agile and flexible in maintaining these interactions, supplementing the use of digital technologies with a return to face-to-face meetings.\n\nIn February 2023, the webinar series that we initiated in 2022 continued with a focus on the Soda Ash business, showcasing the leading positions and growth prospects. Another webinar on the Composite Materials segment focused on innovation and growth opportunities in the aerospace and defense market.\n\nFurther, throughout 2023, specific information was shared with the financial community regarding the activities of Solvay that remained with Solvay following the completion of the Partial Demerger:\n\n- \u00b7 Mid-June 2023, Solvay announced the capital structure and financial policies applicable to Solvay after the Partial Demerger.\n- \u00b7 On June 30, 2023, Solvay published an information document providing additional information, including pro forma financial information, about Solvay and how it would operate following completion of the Partial Demerger.\n- \u00b7 On August 28, 2023, Solvay published H1 2023 unaudited pro forma financial information covering Solvay's activities following completion of the Partial Demerger.\n- \u00b7 On November 13, 2023, at its Capital Market Day, Solvay unveiled its new management, new strategy and financial and extra-financial targets following completion of the Partial Demerger.

Interactions with shareholders, Solvac and Solvay founding families\n\nEvery shareholder has access to clear, comprehensive, transparent information, tailored to his or her individual needs, through a dedicated section on the Solvay website. Solvay also engages with retail banks, regularly interacting with their analysts and participating in events dedicated to private investors.\n\nIn 2023, Solvay held regular meetings with its reference shareholder, Solvac. The CEO and CFO gave three presentations to Solvac's Board of Directors in 2023, covering the Solvay Group's half- and full-year results and the progress on the project to separate Solvay into two companies.\n\nSolvay's management participated in two events organized by shareholders from Solvay's founding families to update them on strategy and results.\n\nIn addition, the IR team participated in Finance Avenue - a shareholder event hosted in Brussels - prior to the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting to share information related to the Partial Demerger.\n\n## 3.4.2.

Although specifically geared toward analysts, these conference calls are accessible live to all investors, and remain available in the form of a video and transcript on the Solvay website.\n\nWhere opportunities permit, such as when Solvay management undertakes investor roadshows or participates in investor conferences, face-to-face meetings with analysts are also periodically arranged in major financial cities, including Brussels, London, Paris, New York and Boston.\n\n## 3.4.3. Interactions with institutional investors\n\nSolvay mainly interacts with institutional investors following the announcement of quarterly, half- and full-year results. In 2023, Solvay participated in many events, including with senior management. This included roadshows, virtual meetings and investor conferences in countries across Europe and North America.\n\nSolvay's CEO and CFO attended many of the meetings with the financial community. They discussed different topics, including quarterly earnings results, market conditions, the prospects for the current year and the medium-term strategy. In 2023, the executive management was also particularly active in communicating information about the separation project at various events organized with institutional investors.\n\n## 3.4.4. Interactions with stewardship teams at shareholders and ESG research providers, including proxy advisors\n\nAt least once a year, the CEO, the CFO, the Group General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, the Chief People Officer, the Chief Sustainability and Government Affairs Officer, and the Head of Investor Relations meet with the stewardship teams of institutional investors and ESG research providers, including proxy advisors. The purpose of this engagement exercise is to provide an update on Solvay's key ESG targets, as well as our performance. In 2023, topics included:\n\n- \u00b7 The strengthening of Solvay's climate commitments through our new Scope 3 objective.\n- \u00b7 The impact of the separation project: employees' commitment, culture, performance, governance.\n- \u00b7 The definition and functioning of the Boards of Solvay and Syensqo following the Partial Demerger.\n- \u00b7 The biodiversity roadmap and results.\n- \u00b7 The actions and investments made to reinforce responsible site management.\n- \u00b7 The impact of the Partial Demerger for the Solvay One Planet program.\n\nSolvay also treats these engagements as an opportunity to understand changes in the methodologies and policies used by the stewardship teams and service providers, as well as to actively solicit their feedback on how Solvay can improve its ESG practices and disclosures.\n\nDuring 2023, Solvay engaged with its top investors' stewardship teams and leading service providers. These meetings were attended by various members of the Pre-Demerger ELT, including Solvay's former CEO at the relevant time.",

Diversity at Board level\n\nSolvay values diversity of its directors, including in terms of gender, age, nationalities, experience, education and skill sets. Details of the qualifications and experience of the Board members can be found in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. The composition of the Board satisfies the legal requirements applicable in Belgium relating to gender diversity though the Board considers this to be the minimum threshold to be met and will continuously review the requirements of its institutional investors and proxy advisors. Furthermore, Solvay's commitment to diversity at Board level is further evidenced by the criteria for appointment of directors listed in section 5.2.3 of the Governance Charter, which is available on Solvay's corporate website.\n\n## 4.1.4. Functioning\n\n- \u00b7 The Articles of Association provide that the Board shall meet as often as the Company's interests so require. The meeting of the Board is convened by the Chairperson or, in the absence of the Chairperson, the Vice-Chairperson or a director with day-to-day responsibilities. The Board of Directors shall be convened each time that the Executive Leadership Team, a director with day-to-day responsibilities or three directors so request(s) it. Further information on the functioning of the Board of Directors is provided for in the Governance Charter.\n- \u00b7 2023 was an exceptional year for the Company as it worked intensively towards the Partial Demerger. The Board undertook an active role in the governance of the project, which is reflected by the number of Board meetings held during the year. The below table indicates the individual attendance rate of directors at Board meetings in 2023.\n\n| Number of meetings   | 17 meetings  from January1-December 8                                                                                                                          | 1 meeting  from December 9-December 31                                            |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | \u00b7 Mr. Nicolas Bo\u00ebl: 17/17 \u00b7 Ms. Ilham Kadri: 17/17 \u00b7 Mr. Charles Casimir-Lambert: 3/3*  \u00b7 Mr. Wolfgang Colberg: 17/17 \u00b7 Mr. Herv\u00e9 Coppens d'Eeckenbrugge:16/17 | \u00b7 Mr. Pierre Gurdjian: 1/1 \u00b7 Mr. Philippe Kehren: 1/1 \u00b7 Mr. Thomas Aebischer: 1/1 |\n|                      |                                                                                                                                                                | \u00b7 Mr. Thierry Bonnefous: 1/1                                                      |\n|                      |                                                                                                                                                                | \u00b7 Mr. Yves Bonte: 1/1                                                             |\n|                      | \u00b7 Ms. Fran\u00e7oise de Viron: 14/17                                                                                                                                | \u00b7 Mr. Wolfgang Colberg: 1/1                                                       |\n|                      | \u00b7 Ms. Laurence Debroux: 1/3**                                                                                                                                  | \u00b7 Mr. Melchior de Vog\u00fc\u00e9: 1/1                                                      |\n|                      | \u00b7 Mr. Pierre Gurdjian: 17/17                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7 Ms. Marjan Oudeman: 1/1                                                         |\n|                      | \u00b7 Mr. Edouard Janssen: 15/17                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7 Ms. Aude Thibaut de Maisi\u00e8res: 1/1                                              |\n| Attendance           | \u00b7 Ms. Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand: 9/17                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7 Ms. Annette Stube: 1/1                                                          |\n| Attendance           | \u00b7 Mr. Matti Lievonen: 16/17                                                                                                                                    | \u00b7 Ms. Annette Stube: 1/1                                                          |\n| Attendance           | \u00b7 Mr. Gilles Michel: 14/17                                                                                                                                     | \u00b7 Ms. Annette Stube: 1/1                                                          |\n| Attendance           | \u00b7 Ms. Marjan Oudeman: 17/17 \u00b7 Ms. Aude Thibaut de Maisi\u00e8res:17/17                                                                                              | \u00b7 Ms. Annette Stube: 1/1                                                          |\n| Attendance           | \u00b7 Ms. Rosemary Thorne: 17/17 * Mr. Charles Casimir-Lambert's mandate ended at the Annual General                                                               | \u00b7 Ms. Annette Stube: 1/1                                                          |\n| Attendance           | Meeting held on May 9, 2023. ** Ms. Laurence Debroux resigned at the Annual General Meeting held on                                                            | \u00b7 Ms. Annette Stube: 1/1                                                          |\n| Attendance           | May 9, 2023.                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                   |",

The Board of Directors took note of this statement and noted that the Chief Executive Officer left the meeting during the deliberations and decisions relating to her (see point 1 of the resolution, below).

'\n\nAfter completion of the Partial Demerger, there was no application of Article 7:96 of the Code of Companies and Associations, relating to conflicts of interests.\n\n## 4.1.6. Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the Governance Charter, the Board, under the direction of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors and the Chairperson of the Nomination Committee, evaluates on a regular basis its composition, its functioning, its information and interactions with the executive management and the composition and functioning of the Committees created by it.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are invited to express their opinions on those various points.\n\nIn addition, every three years, the evaluation is led by an external consultant.\n\nThe Chairperson of the Board of Directors and the Chairperson of the Nomination Committee, together with an external consultant where applicable, analyze the outcome of the evaluation and submit conclusions and recommendations to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors decides on possible improvements to be made at the end of this evaluation process.\n\n- \u00b7 Considering the new composition of the Board, the next external evaluation is foreseen in 2026.\n\n## 4.1.7. Induction and continuous Board training\n\nAn Induction Program is in place for new directors. The program includes a review of the Group's strategy, activities and corporate governance.\n\nOn December 15, 2023, the Board had a dedicated induction session on the Partial Demerger, its consequences and key agreements in place in this respect.\n\nThe Board is also actively engaged on the topic of sustainability. Every year, a specific session is organized, dedicated to receiving updates on various themes from sustainability teams, so as to better understand the Group's strengths and weaknesses, and to determine the impact of emerging trends on the Group's business and performance.\n\nSite visits are also part of the Board's continuous training program. They consist of meetings with management and local teams, business presentations and field tours.\n\n## 4.2.  Board committees\n\nThe Board of Directors has the following permanent committees: Audit and Risk Committee (formerly named 'Audit Committee'), Finance Committee, Compensation Committee, Nomination Committee and ESG Committee. The principles governing the composition, role and missions of the committees, as well as their internal rules, are set out in the Governance Charter.\n\nThe composition of the key committees is regularly reviewed, including whether they meet the expectations of the market and our diverse shareholder base. As we continue to refresh the Board, we also consider adding independent members to our committees. As of today, all key committees (Audit and Risk Committee, and the Nomination and Compensation Committees) are composed solely of non-executive directors, a majority of which are independent. More importantly, these committees comprise members that have the experience and skills necessary to add value and deliver effectively on their mandate. The Group Corporate Secretary acts as Secretary to each of the Board committees.",

Consequently, the Pre-Demerger ELT promoted actions to manage both the short term headwinds while simultaneously investing to support the long-term growth which will set a strong foundation for both future companies.\n\nIn addition, these structural savings enabled the Group to invest in projects to support the future growth of both Solvay and Syensqo, like the expansion of sulfone technologies in the US to support healthcare market growth, the new bio-circular highly dispersible silica process, the natural Soda Ash expansion in Green River, Wyoming, the plan to produce Green Hydrogen at the Rosignano site, Italy through a partnership with Sapio, the launch of a new PEEK compound for electric-motors, a polymer collaboration with Zoatfoams to extend the reach of polymers into the aero market.\n\nProgress was made in relation to our Solvay One Planet targets, especially with the validation by SBTi of the climate targets of Solvay before the Partial Demerger. The recent Partial Demerger has triggered the need for a reassessment that will start with SBTi in 2024. In addition, Solvay commits to assess the company's living wage equity and close any potential gaps before 2030.\n\nThe Pre-Demerger ELT met 10 times in 2023 to share information, align priorities, and decide upon activities within its mandate and to align priorities allowing Solvay to deliver excellent performance.",

REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## Note to readers\n\nThis year's Remuneration Report is unique in the sense that it presents information on two different Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Teams (ELT) that led Solvay during the 2023 financial year. The unique nature of the Remuneration Report is owed to the significant transformation that Solvay underwent to unlock value through a successful Partial Demerger of Syensqo in early December 2023. The Partial Demerger, which saw near full support from our shareholders, will allow each company to optimize its capital allocation priorities, refine its capital structures to ensure efficiency and resilience, prioritize talent attraction and retention strategies to foster a high-performing workforce, enhance operational capabilities to drive efficiency and innovation, and steadfastly advance its sustainability initiatives to create long-term value for all stakeholders.\n\nFollowing shareholder approval on December 8, 2023, Solvay has a new Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team (ELT) to deliver on its communicated objectives. To ease the understanding of the Remuneration Report, the remuneration of the new ELT is provided on a blue background during the transitional phase from December 9, 2023, to December 31, 2023.\n\n## 6.1.  Year in overview\n\n## Solvay proved resilient in an atypical year\n\nDuring a period marked by significant changes and challenging conditions, we have demonstrated resilience. Despite facing obstacles such as soft key economies and geopolitical tensions, we have maintained our focus on safeguarding our position. Additionally, we have worked towards ensuring the successful Partial Demerger of Syensqo. Our margins rose to 25%, limiting EBITDA erosion to 4.9%, and we sustained strong cash generation, allowing us to distribute dividends. These results have enabled us to set ourselves apart from our peers. We were among the minority of chemical companies that met guidance without needing to issue a profit warning.\n\nAmidst challenging circumstances, we showcased our innovative spirit and resilience by prioritizing various aspects beyond just financial results. This included expediting the adoption of digital technologies to enhance production efficiency, diligently catering to customer demands, upholding safety as paramount, and implementing price adjustments to sustain margins, all while adhering to disciplined cost and cash management practices.\n\nThanks to the dedication and work of Solvay employees, we have emerged as a more robust organization across all aspects. Their commitment enables us to embark on a journey of further transformation, equipping us with the readiness to embrace a new chapter filled with opportunities.\n\n## Committed to our people\n\nWhile we were driving a significant transformation of the Company, we remained steadfast in supporting our employees financially, socially, and professionally, as we continue to master the elements essential to our world to create sustainable solutions. The continuous dialogue with the European Works Council (EWC) and social partners was crucial during this transformational period and we are proud to have maintained a strong level of employee engagement of 76%, the highest engagement rate in the last five years.\n\n## Financially\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) approved the anticipated payment of a portion of the Short-term Incentive (for cadre employees) and the Global Performance Sharing (GPS) bonus (for non-cadre employees), the payments were made in January 2023 supporting our employees to cope in an increasing inflationary environment.\n\n## Socially\n\nWe further enhanced our Solvay Cares benefits program, by including a new benefit to support employees with caregiving duties. Our employees are now able to take up to five days a year to handle unexpected situations where they must care for a loved one, so as to complement any provisions of local legislation. Furthermore, Solvay created a holiday donation bank with 100 days of leave for employees to use for caregiving purposes. Employees can also donate days off to their fellow colleagues.\n\n## Professionally\n\nAs we embarked on the transformative project, we continued to invest in the growth and development of our employees, recognizing the learning opportunities inherent in a project of this magnitude. Through the Solvay Career Catalyst Program, employees had the opportunity to engage in introspection regarding their roles, strengths, networks, and acquiring new soft and technical skills. This Program included self-assessments, crafting career visions, and honing skills necessary for advancement, aimed at guiding employees to explore potential career pathways aligned with the Group's transformation.\n\nAs of December 2023, we established two industry-leading entities - Solvay and Syensqo - each equipped with robust teams, allocated to facilitate a seamless transition preceding the separation. A comprehensive selection process was undertaken to assemble well-rounded business leaders, experts, and professionals possessing the requisite experience, skills, and diversity, aligning with the distinct strategies of each company.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of the new Solvay's Executive Leadership Team after the Partial Demerger\n\nAt the May 2022 Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting, approximately 96% of participating shareholders supported Solvay's Remuneration Policy, a result confirming that Solvay's remuneration philosophy, pay elements, pay mix, variable incentive design, and disclosures were broadly aligned with market expectations. The Board decided that the current Remuneration Policy should remain in place to provide the framework as to how the new ELT and Board members' remuneration is determined.\n\nTo determine the remuneration levels of the new ELT members since December 9, 2023, a benchmarking assessment was conducted against a revised peer group. Solvay's updated peer group mirrors the company's redefined scope and executive talent pool, offering a wellrounded selection of companies across diverse countries and industries, encompassing varying sizes and levels of complexity. The results of this benchmarking exercise suggested that discretion is needed to be applied by the Compensation Committee to reduce the award opportunities available for the CEO under both short- and long-term incentives. The Board of Directors does not foresee a revision to the base salary of the CEO and other ELT members in 2024 as it remains aligned with the market median. Details of remuneration payable to ELT members are set out on the following pages.\n\n## Our commitment to shareholder alignment with the new Solvay\n\nThe Compensation Committee, and the Board as a whole, have taken note of the concerns raised by some of the shareholders and proxy advisors regarding pay decisions made in the lead up to the Partial Demerger to retain key employees as well as recognize tremendous efforts to successfully deliver on communicated objectives. Solvay's new Compensation Committee will gather feedback from its shareholders and proxy advisors to better refine its practices and disclosures.\n\nSolvay's Compensation Committee, and the Board as a whole, will also review the Remuneration Policy in 2024 and assess whether any amendment would be necessary for the Company's remuneration practices and disclosures taking into account the peer practices, global best practice recommendations, as well as direct feedback from shareholders and proxy advisors.\n\n## 6.2.  Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nSolvay Directors are remunerated, in line with Solvay's Remuneration Policy, with fixed emoluments, the common basis for which is set at the Ordinary Shareholders Meeting. Any additional remuneration is decided by the Board. The process is based on Article 24 of our Articles of Association (Articles), which states that:\n\n- \u00b7 'Directors shall receive fixed emoluments, the amount and terms of which shall be determined by the General Meeting. The decision of the General Meeting shall stand until otherwise decided.\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors is authorized to grant fixed emoluments in addition to the emoluments provided for in the preceding paragraph to Directors entrusted with special duties, distinct from their directorship.\n- \u00b7 The Directors responsible for day-to-day management and the members of the Executive Committee, are also each entitled to a variable remuneration determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of their individual performance and the consolidated performance of the Solvay Group.'\n\nBoard fees are determined after considering the roles and responsibilities of each director, and the practices of companies of a similar size and international complexity. An assessment of market practice is conducted on a regular basis and the fees are disclosed in the Remuneration Report each year.",

        "page_content": "## 6.2.1. Board of Directors individual remuneration\n\nThe Ordinary Shareholders Meetings of June 2005 and May 2012, which introduced membership and attendance fees respectively, approved directors' pay to be set as follows, starting from the financial year 2005. The Board fees have not been increased since 2005.\n\nBoard members that were appointed by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of December 8, 2023, will be entitled to the same fees.\n\n| Board fees by type                                                               | Gross amount   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Annual gross fixed remuneration                                                  | \u20ac35,000        |\n| Board meeting attendance fee                                                     | \u20ac4,000         |\n| Audit and Risk Committee Chairperson attendance fee                              | \u20ac6,000         |\n| Audit and Risk Committee Member attendance fee                                   | \u20ac4,000         |\n| Compensation, Nomination, ESG, and Finance Committees Chairperson attendance fee | \u20ac4,000         |\n| Compensation, Nomination, ESG, and Finance Committees Member attendance fee      | \u20ac2,500         |\n\nAdditional considerations in relation to the Board of Directors' remuneration:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors sitting on both the Compensation Committee and the Nomination Committee do not receive double remuneration if the meetings happen on the same date.\n- \u00b7 In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, the annual gross fixed remuneration for the CEO is offset in the annual remuneration fees as an ELT member, and the Board meeting attendance fees are paid for the board meetings attended.\n- \u00b7 There are no committee attendance fees for the Chairman of the Board, nor the CEO.\n- \u00b7 For the Chairman of the Board, the Board used its authorization under Article 24 of its Articles to grant an additional yearly fixed remuneration compensation of \u20ac250,000 gross, paid in monthly installments, unchanged since 2012.\n- \u00b7 Non-executive directors do not receive any additional remuneration linked to results or other performance criteria. More specifically, nonexecutive directors are not entitled to annual bonuses, stock options, or performance share units, or to any supplemental pension scheme.\n- \u00b7 Solvay reimburses directors' travel and expenses for meetings related to their Board and Board Committee functions.\n- \u00b7 The Group provides administrative support, in the form of an office, and use of the General Secretariat to the Chairman of the Board only. The other non-executive directors receive logistical support from the General Secretariat when needed.\n- \u00b7 Solvay also provides customary insurance policies covering the Board of Directors' activities when they are carrying out their duties.\n\n## 6.2.2. Share ownership guidelines for the Board\n\nSolvay acknowledges that the Belgian Governance Code recommends that a portion of the remuneration paid to Board members be in shares (Principle 7.6), and that Solvay's Remuneration Policy does not provide for this. However, the Compensation Committee considers that the current Remuneration Policy complies with the spirit of Principle 7.6 of the Belgian Governance Code, because of the Share Ownership Guidelines applicable to non-executive directors requiring them to hold shares equivalent to 100% of their gross annual fixed board fees. These shares should be held until at least one year after the non-executive director leaves the Board of Directors and, in any case, for at least three years after the shares were acquired. The dividends attached to these shares are paid at the same time as for the other shareholders.\n\nThe Compensation Committee regularly reviews Solvay's remuneration practices, disclosures and market practices to determine whether the Remuneration Policy currently in practice remains appropriate. Any changes to the Remuneration Policy regarding the Board's remuneration will be submitted to shareholders in accordance with the BCCA.\n\n## 6.2.3. Amount of remuneration and other benefits granted directly or indirectly to Board members by the Company or by an affiliated company\n\n## GROSS REMUNERATION AND OTHER BENEFITS GRANTED TO DIRECTORS\n\nAs described in section 2 of the Corporate Governance Statement, in the context of the Partial Demerger, the composition of the Board of Directors of Solvay changed. This section presents the amount of remuneration and other benefits granted directly or indirectly to the members of the Board before and after the Partial Demerger date.",

        "page_content": "## 6.3.  Remuneration of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT)\n\n## 6.3.1. Solvay's remuneration philosophy and policy\n\nSolvay's Remuneration Policy is designed to appropriately reward the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) based on their expertise, responsibilities, and individual performance. The Policy emphasizes meritocracy and performance, striving to optimize returns responsibly and sustainably for the benefit of all stakeholders. It aims to attract, motivate, and retain top executive talent, aligning with market standards and the long-term interests of shareholders. These guiding principles also shape the remuneration policies and programs extended to Solvay employees worldwide.\n\nThe remuneration structure is designed in line with the following principles, which apply both to ELT members and other senior executives:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration aims to provide market-aligned cash income, which is regularly reviewed by the Compensation Committee considering positioning relative to the peer market median, performance, indexation, and role changes.\n- \u00b7 Short- and long-term variable remuneration is tied to the achievement of strategic objectives, including driving sustainable performance, and recognizes excellent results once delivered.\n- \u00b7 Total remuneration is set at a level that is competitive in the relevant market and sector, in order to attract, retain, and motivate the high-caliber talent needed to deliver the Group's strategy and drive business performance.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration decisions are compliant and equitable, keeping in mind pay levels within the wider workforce, and balance cost and value appropriately.\n\nThe following table summarizes the core elements and key principles of Solvay's Remuneration Policy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Compensation Committee retains discretion to adjust performance outcomes under the Short-term Incentive (STI) and Long-term Incentive (LTI) programs based on various factors, including unforeseen circumstances, shareholder experience, and other relevant considerations, with explanations provided in the annual Remuneration Report. Additionally, the Committee may apply discretion to adjust award opportunities, with details as to how discretion was applied to be disclosed in the Remuneration Report for shareholder approval. To this end, the Compensation Committee used its discretionary power to reduce award opportunities under the STI and LTI programs for the new ELT to ensure total remuneration offered remained within the new benchmark .\n\n## 6.3.2. Use of market data\n\nIn alignment with the Remuneration Policy, remuneration of ELT members is benchmarked against a peer group. Although the peer group had generally remained unchanged over the years, in light of Solvay's new scope of activities after the Partial Demerger, a review of the peer group was imperative to select companies that better reflected Solvay's size and business, while also ensuring that it could offer competitive remuneration to attract the relevant talent for the nomination of new ELT members.\n\nSolvay's peer group is built around a selection of relevant European chemical and industrial companies whose international operational footprint and model, as well as annual revenues and headcount, positions Solvay broadly at the median of the peer group. The Compensation Committee aims to position Solvay's remuneration at the market median for all key elements of the package.",

As mentioned earlier, the new peer group positions Solvay at median of the peer group in terms of its attributes, while the Compensation Committee aims to position remuneration offered at market median.\n\nACEA\n\nAlfa Laval\n\nDrax Group\n\nIMI plc\n\nOCI\n\nValeo SE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvonik\n\nK+S\n\nSaint-Gobain\n\nWacker Chemie AG\n\n(In blue are companies which have been added to the new Peers Group.)\n\n## 6.3.3. Pay mix and remuneration opportunities for the ELT members\n\nThe pay mix of ELT members at the end of the reporting period is outlined below, and displays their Total Direct Remuneration at target. As described in Section 2 of the Corporate Governance Statement, in the context of the Partial Demerger, the composition of Solvay's ELT has wholly changed with a new ELT that is being led by Philippe Kehren, who has been internally promoted and recognized for his successful transformation of the Soda Ash and Bicarbonates business. This Section therefore presents the amount of remuneration of ELT members before and after the Partial Demerger Date.\n\n## 6.3.3.1 Solvay's ELT before the Partial Demerger Date\n\n## Overview\n\nThe below table provides the pay mix of the members of the Pre-Demerger ELT, which covers base remuneration and both short-term and long-term incentives at target for the full year 2023 (but excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, any extraordinary items granted in relation to the transformation project). It is also worth highlighting that the below tables display the aforementioned components of the remuneration to which ELT members would have been entitled, at target, for the period from January 1, 2023, until December 31, 2023. The below table does not take into account the ELT's transfer to Syensqo or resignation as ELT members upon completion of the Partial Demerger and any proratisation resulting therefrom. Actual remuneration paid to ELT members before the Partial Demerger Date is described in section 6.3.6.\n\nCovestro\n\nHolcim Ltd\n\nLanxess\n\nUmicore SA",

It is also worth highlighting that the below tables display the aforementioned components of the remuneration to which ELT members would have been entitled, at target, for the period from January 1, 2023 until December 31, 2023. It does not take into account that they were appointed as ELT members upon completion of the Partial Demerger and any proratisation resulting therefrom, nor any remuneration to which they would have been entitled in their prior roles at Solvay. Actual remuneration paid to ELT members after the Partial Demerger Date is described in section 6.3.6.",

        "page_content": "## 6.3.4. Base remuneration and benefits\n\n## Fixed base remuneration\n\nFixed base remuneration reflects an individual's experience, skills, responsibilities, and performance. It is reviewed annually and may be adjusted, taking into consideration a number of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 comparable salaries in appropriate comparator groups;\n- \u00b7 changes within the scope of the role;\n- \u00b7 changes in the Group's size and profile; and\n- \u00b7 inflation following legal requirements in different countries.\n\nBase remuneration, which does not include the value of any benefits offered to ELT Members, is used to calculate targets for variable remuneration. Details of the base remuneration of the CEO and ELT Members are disclosed in sections 6.3.2. and 6.3.6. of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed base remuneration for the new ELT members in 2024.\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors does not foresee, in 2024, increases to the base salary of the CEO and other ELT members, as disclosed in the table above, as it remains aligned with the market median of the new peer group.\n\n## Benefits, including pension\n\nIn alignment with the Solvay Cares aspirations, benefits are seen as a critical part of Solvay's remuneration offering and are not dependent on an individual's performance. Solvay aims to ensure that the nature and level of these other benefits are in line with market practice and what is provided to other executives in the Group.\n\nThe CEO of the Company before the Partial Demerger date, Ilham Kadri, was self-employed and had entered into a contractual agreement with the Company, which provided for specific provisions with respect to pension contributions, death-in-service, and disability benefits. Such agreement was transferred to Syensqo as part of the Partial Demerger.\n\nThe CEO since the Partial Demerger date, Philippe Kehren, is self-employed and has entered into a contractual agreement with the Company in Belgium. This agreement includes pension contributions, death-in-service, and disability benefits.\n\nThe other ELT members can either work under local employment contract as employee of the company, or enter into separate contractual agreements with the Company, giving them self-employed status in Belgium.\n\n- \u00b7 ELT members who are employees under a local contract are granted benefits such as a pension, death-in-service, and disability benefits according to the provisions of the plans applicable in line with home country market practice.\n- \u00b7 Self-employed ELT members (other than the CEO) are entitled to the payment of an annual fixed base fee under their contractual agreement with the Company, which also covers pension contributions, death-in-service, disability, and healthcare benefits, as well as certain benefitsin-kind (e.g., company car).\n\nAs from the Partial Demerger date, ELT members Alexandre Blum (CFO) and Lisa Brown (General Counsel and Corporate Secretary) have entered into separate contractual agreements with the Company, giving them self-employed status in Belgium. Mark Van Bijsterveld (Chief People Officer) based in the Netherlands, is under a local employment contract. As the change of status from employee to self-employed under a management agreement requires a change in immigration status, the transition from employee status to self-employed for Lanny Duvall (Chief Operations Officer), based in Belgium, will enter into force in the following months once the required documents are granted from the Belgian authorities. In the meantime, Lanny Duvall remains an employee.\n\n## 6.3.5. Short- and long-term variable play\n\n## 6.3.5.1. Short-term Incentive (STI) plan\n\n## Maximum award opportunities\n\nAs per the Remuneration Policy, the STI target is 120% of fixed base remuneration for the CEO and up to 70% of fixed base remuneration for other ELT members. The minimum payout is 0% and maximum is 200% of target STI.\n\nIn line with the Remuneration Policy, the target opportunity provided by the STI plan for the CEO before the Partial Demerger date, Ilham Kadri, was 120% of fixed base remuneration, and up to 70% of fixed base remuneration for other former ELT members.",

        "page_content": "## 2024 STI award opportunity for new ELT members\n\nThe Compensation Committee used its discretionary power to reduce STI award opportunities for ELT members following the Partial Demerger, to align with peer practice to better reflect Solvay's new scope. To this end, the target award opportunity provided by the STI plan for the CEO, Philippe Kehren,  since the Partial Demerger Date, is 95% of fixed base remuneration, and 65% of fixed base remuneration for other current ELT members.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nAs per the Remuneration Policy, the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion to activate malus and clawback provisions in exceptional circumstances, such as serious reputational damage, risk management failures, financial errors, misconduct, regulatory breaches, significant losses, or deteriorating financial health, with clawback potentially extending up to three years for awards under the Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Setting STI performance objectives\n\nAnnually, the Board establishes performance objectives for both the Group and the CEO, a process typically conducted during the February Board meeting. The performance objective-setting aims to establish challenging yet achievable targets, incorporating input from various perspectives within the business while ensuring alignment with Solvay's long-term growth and sustainability goals communicated to the market. Moreover, this process is also mindful of not incentivizing executives to take excessive risks that could jeopardize the company's stability, reputation, and long-term sustainability.\n\nSolvay's strategy for performance objectives tied to Short-term Incentives (STIs) involves establishing ambitious, growth-focused targets for the target award level, while maximum awards are reserved for achieving exceptionally high performance levels, ensuring adherence to the principle of pay-for-performance.\n\nIn line with market practice, and due to the commercial sensitivity of disclosing short-term targets prospectively, Solvay discloses the performance objectives set and the performance against them on a retrospective basis only. The next section provides a breakdown of how the CEO performed against the targets set under the STI plan for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## 2023 STI performance objectives\n\nThe STI plan provides a cash opportunity that is based solely on the achievement of pre-determined annual financial, non-financial, and individual objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The STI plan focuses on three broad performance categories with the following weightings for all ELT members:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial objectives (65% of the STI): Underlying EBITDA organic growth and free cash flow (FCF) conversion.\n- \u00b7 Solvay One Planet objectives (15% of the STI): Solvay One Planet is structured around the three major pillars of Climate, Resources, and Better Life, and serves as our roadmap toward a sustainable future. Specific KPIs are selected under each major pillar to measure our performance in ways that are material, quantifiable, and relevant to driving long-term value for all stakeholders. More information on Solvay One Planet can be found on our corporate website.\n- \u00b7 Individual objectives (20% of the STI): Customized for each ELT member to align with their specific roles and responsibilities within the organization. They may include objectives related to areas such as project milestones, innovation initiatives, leadership development, or any other relevant metrics that measure the ELT member's impact on the Company's success. These objectives are pre-determined, and may be quantitative and/ or qualitative. These are defined by the Board for the CEO and then cascaded down to other ELT members by the CEO. The CEO assesses the achievement of individual objectives by ELT members, and this assessment is then reviewed and validated by the Board. The individual performance of the CEO is assessed by the Compensation Committee, and this is then reviewed and validated by the Board. The CEO is absent from the Compensation Committee and Board meetings during all discussions relating to CEO pay. Details of the individual performance of the CEO, including the targets set and their achievement, are explained below.\n\n## Group performance 2023\n\nThe Group's 2023 performance results are based on the Solvay perimeter prior to the Partial Demerger, which includes the Specialty Businesses presented as \"discontinued operations\" in the consolidated financial statements. The final scores have been approved by the Board of Directors at the time of the Partial Demerger and based on the best available forecasts of the financial performance.\n\n## GROUP PERFORMANCE 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Actual performance",

Following a record 2022, Solvay showcased its resilience and protected its position. Our margins rose to 25%, limiting EBITDA erosion to 4.9% and we sustained strong cash generation and cost discipline, securing dividends distribution, and allowing us to stand out against our peers. Solvay's strong TSR performance is another external measurement of success that establishes a clear focus for the ELT and has a direct link with the value being delivered to shareholders. More information can be found in the Performance Review section of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\nThe Solvay One Planet targets for 2023 apply to the former Solvay scope (before the Partial Demerger). They were composed of seven targets with an equal weight:\n\n- \u00b7 Five quantitative targets measuring the performance in terms of GHG emissions (result 2), sustainable solutions (result 1.4), industrial waste without valorization (result 0), circular business (result 0), and safety (result 1.5).\n- \u00b7 Two qualitative targets measuring the progress in the execution of action plans regarding water (result 1) and diversity (result 1.35). The strong performance on GHG is due to emission-reduction projects which started to deliver savings in 2023 as well as some drop of production. We're progressing as expected with plans to mitigate the risk of water scarcity on critical sites. However, the act of substituting lower-quality coal banned Russian sources and generated more wastes which we were not able to fully valorize in 2023.",

The good performance on safety reflects our continued efforts to deploy a safety culture among Solvay employees and contractors while we've been successfully deploying our action plan to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\n## Summary of CEO STI objectives for 2023\n\nThe below section provides an overview of the STI objectives set for the CEO before the Partial Demerger date, Ilham

are best-in-class in all areas.\n\nThe overall performance of the CEO, during an unprecedented transformational year, was recognized as exceptional by the Board. Despite strong headwinds of stagnating key economies, the business results were broadly in line with market guidance. This is significant considering a number of key competitors having issued profit warnings during 2023. Ilham Kadri managed to deliver the Partial Demerger on time and with key stakeholder backing. She drove a boost in reputation by engaging with stakeholders on sustainability issues, receiving SBTi validation on the Climate Objectives of Solvay before the Partial Demerger, boosting our Chemscore to rank sixth among 50 peers, marking a gain of nine positions from 2022 and the safety record continued to improve. For this exceptional performance the Board agreed a 200% individual performance factor which is 20% of the target amount, resulting in a bonus award for 2023 of \u20ac2,135,000.",

However, as in previous years, due to the commercial sensitivity surrounding the short-term targets set, Solvay will disclose on a retrospective basis the performance achieved against the specific performance objectives set by the Board.\n\n## CEO'S PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND WEIGHTINGS FOR THE 2024 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\n| Objectives                                        | Performance measures   | Weighting   | Sub-weighting   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n|                                                   |                        | 5%          |                 |\n| Free Cash Flow \u20ac                                  |                        | 65% 25%     |                 |\n| Cost savings \u20ac                                    |                        | 15%         |                 |\n| One Planet - Diversity progress                   | 15%                    | 5%          |                 |\n| One Planet - Safety (RIIR)                        | 15%                    |             |                 |\n| One Planet - GHG emissions                        | 15%                    | 5%          |                 |\n| Build credibility of the new Solvay on the market | 20%                    | 10%         | Individual      |\n| Achieve the transformation of the Group           | 20%                    | 10%         | Individual      |\n\n## 6.3.5.2. Long-term Incentive (LTI)\n\nSolvay aims to incentivize its ELT members by implementing a Long-term Incentive (LTI), wherein a substantial portion of equity awards is contingent upon performance criteria aligned with the Company's communicated strategy. This approach fosters alignment with shareholder interests, promoting accountability and driving long-term value creation through strategic execution and performance excellence.\n\nSolvay uses two equity programs to incentivize its ELT members. The first is through the Performance-based Share Units (PSUs) which vest by meeting pre-defined long-term financial and non-financial objectives over a three-year performance period to promote a focus on long-term enterprise value growth and sustainability. The second equity program is comprised of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) which vests over three years and aims to align ELT members' interests with that of shareholders and foster the retention of key personnel.\n\nAs per the Remuneration Policy, LTI grants for ELT members were offered with the following split:\n\n- \u00b7 70% of the annual grant value delivered in the form of Performance-based Share Units (PSU); and\n- \u00b7 30% of the award offered in the form of Restricted Share Units (RSU).\n\n## 2024 LTI structure for new ELT members.\n\nThe Board has decided, in line with the Remuneration Policy, to maintain the same split of long-term incentive programs for new ELT members for the 2024 financial year - 70% in the form of PSUs and the remaining 30% in the form of RSUs.\n\n## LTI award opportunity\n\nAs per the Remuneration Policy, the LTI target is 150% of fixed base remuneration for the CEO and up to 125% of fixed base remuneration for other ELT members. Outcomes range from zero if the minimum targets are not met, to maximum of 150% of target if all plan objectives are achieved.\n\nThe CEO before the Partial Demerger, Ilham Kadri, had an LTI grant target of 150% of fixed base remuneration. For all other former ELT members, the grant target value was up to 125% of the fixed based remuneration.\n\nThe actual annual grant value, within the limits of the Remuneration Policy as explained above, is determined and approved by the Board.\n\nIn February 2023, the Board granted a total of 43,610 PSUs and 18,692 RSUs to ELT members. Approximately 360 executives and high-potential employees also participated in the LTI Plan.",

        "page_content": "## 2024 LTI award opportunity for new ELT members\n\nThe Compensation Committee used its discretionary power to reduce LTI award opportunities for ELT members following the Partial Demerger to align with peer practice to better reflect Solvay's new scope. The CEO after the Partial Demerger, Philippe Kehren, has an LTI grant target of 115% of fixed base remuneration. For all other current ELT members, the grant target value is up to 95% of the fixed based remuneration.\n\n## Performance Share Units (PSUs)\n\nThe PSUs determine 70% of the annual LTI grant, which vest three years from the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the pre-set performance objectives. The opportunity varies from a minimum of zero, if the minimum target is not met, to a maximum payout of 150%, if the maximum target is achieved.\n\nPerformance objectives are distributed across financial (60% to 80% of the award) and One Planet (20% to 40% of the award) categories, with targets and their respective weights established to align with the Group's mid- and long-term strategy. In addition, when determining the level of vesting for PSUs, an additional performance measure was introduced as of 2023 to compare the performance of the Group to the TSR performance of the Stoxx 600 Index ensuring a clear focus within the ELT to create shareholder value. Where the PSU result is above zero, the TSR measure can decrease the PSU outcome by 25% when the TSR is in the lower quartile of the Stoxx 600 Index, and increase the PSU result by 25% when the TSR is in the top quartile of the Stoxx 600 Index.\n\nThe Board assesses the achievement of the targets set, based as a rule on the audited results of the Group.\n\nEvery year, the Board determines the budget available for distribution and the total volume of PSUs available is subsequently allocated to the eligible population.\n\n## Restricted Share Units (RSUs)\n\nThe remaining portion of the LTI grant is in RSUs (30%), where executives receive shares that vest after three years. RSUs feature employment or presence conditions, and dividends accrue solely on vested awards, paid out at the conclusion of the three-year vesting period.\n\n## PSUS, RSUS ALLOTTED IN 2023 (UNTIL DECEMBER 8, 2023) TO ELT MEMBERS BEFORE THE PARTIAL DEMERGER DATE\n\n| Country   | Name                    | Function                                             | Number of PSUs (1)   | Number of RSUs (2)   |\n|-----------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Belgium   | Ilham Kadri             | CEO/Chair of the ELT until the Partial Demerger date | 20,295               | 8,698                |\n| Belgium   | Karim Hajjar            | ELT member until the Partial Demerger date           | 5,898                | 2,528                |\n| Belgium   | Augusto Di Donfrancesco | ELT member until the Partial Demerger date           | 5,898                | 2,528                |\n| Belgium   | Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien        | ELT member until the Partial Demerger date           | 4,302                | 1,844                |\n| Belgium   | Dominique Golsong       | ELT member until the Partial Demerger date           | 3,400                | 1,458                |\n| France    | Marc Chollet            | ELT member until the Partial Demerger date           | 3,817                | 1,636                |\n| Total     |                         |                                                      | 43,610               | 18,692               |\n\n- (1) PSUs share price for March 2023 grant was \u20ac100.89.\n- (2) RSUs share price for March 2023 grant was \u20ac100.89.\n\nNo PSUs or RSUs were granted to ELT members between December 9 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThe 2023 PSU and RSU plans, among other LTI plans, were adjusted in the context of the Partial Demerger. Such adjustments are described below under the Adjustments to the outstanding SOPs and PSUs and RSUs plans section.\n\n## Clawback provisions relating to LTI\n\nSolvay has the right to claim reimbursement of any amounts paid in accordance with the plan from any PSU and RSU plan participant, during a period of three years from the date of the payment, on the basis of erroneous results that were subsequently adjusted or corrected. This clawback clause has not been applied in the past because there have not been any instances where such events occurred.\n\n## 2020-2022 LTI Performance Share Unit plan performance results\n\nThe results of the 2020 PSU grant were calculated in April 2023 and paid in June 2023, based on a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2022, with a vesting factor of 100% of target.",

However as of December 31, 2023, stock options remained outstanding under the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 SOPs and the rules thereof are reiterated below.\n\nUnder Belgian law, unlike most other jurisdictions, taxes on stock options are due at the time of grant. Solvay, like other Belgian companies, had therefore set no additional performance criteria for determining the vesting of stock options. The options have a vesting period of three full calendar years, meaning that options will vest on the first day of the fourth year after the grant year, followed by a four-year exercise period.\n\nWhen they were granted, the SOPs gave each beneficiary the right to buy Solvay shares at a strike price corresponding to the fair market value of the shares upon grant. Every year, the Board determined the volume of stock options available for distribution, based on an assessment of the economic fair value at grant, using the Black Scholes valuation formula. The total volume of options available was subsequently allocated to the eligible population.\n\n## Features:\n\n- \u00b7 Options are granted at money or fair market value.\n- \u00b7 They become exercisable for the first time three full calendar years after they are granted.\n- \u00b7 They have a maximum term of eight years.\n- \u00b7 They are not transferable inter vivos.\n- \u00b7 The plan includes a bad leaver clause.\n\nThe outstanding SOPs were adjusted in the context of the Partial Demerger with a view to safeguard the interests of the beneficiaries. Such adjustments are described in the Adjustments to the outstanding SOPs and PSUs and RSUs plans section.\n\nIn addition, SOPs also remain outstanding under the 2022 SOP, which was approved by shareholders at the May 9, 2023, Annual General Meeting with the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 Stock options were subject to performance conditions - implementation of separation and value creation - and would have been forfeited in full if the Partial Demerger had not occurred by 2025.\n- \u00b7 The combined share prices of Solvay and Syensqo following completion of the Partial Demerger had to be above \u20ac100 for at least 15 trading days in total (not required to be consecutive days) for the options to become exercisable as from January 1, 2026, and deliver value. If this criteria had not been met, the award would have lapsed.\n- \u00b7 The options may be exercised by beneficiaries between January 1, 2026, and December 31, 2027, inclusive, providing presence and performance criteria are met.\n- \u00b7 Taxes are paid at the time of the grant in Belgium and cannot be recouped if the options do not vest or upon voluntary departure, demonstrating executives' commitment and belief in the success of the Partial Demerger and value creation for both companies.\n- \u00b7 The Exercise Price of each option is \u20ac84.34, which was the fair market value of the Solvay share at the time of the grant (August 2022).\n- \u00b7 Each stock option entitles its holder to acquire one Solvay share and one Syensqo share against payment of the exercise price (basket option).\n- \u00b7 Stock options were determined as a multiple of annual base salary in a range between 50% and 200%, depending on the Board's view of how critical the role of the beneficiary was for the Partial Demerger.\n\nThe 2022 SOP plan was not adjusted in the context of the Partial Demerger. Accordingly, the 2022 stock options remain basket options, entitling their holders to acquire one Solvay share and one Syensqo against payment of the exercise price.",

The initial exercise price of the stock options was split between both the Solvay share and the Syensqo share, based, as a rule, on the closing prices of the Solvay share (\u20ac20.62) and of the Syensqo share (\u20ac98.93) on the first trading day following the Partial Demerger Date (December 11, 2023).\n- \u00b7 The 2021 cash-settled PSU plan was adjusted so that (i) the performance for the 2023 financial year would be assessed based on the data available as of the time of the Partial Demerger and (ii) the payout would be determined based on the average of the last ten closing prices of the Solvay share for the period ending on November 30, 2023 (from November 17-30, 2023 included). Payout will occur in June 2024 in accordance with the original plan rules.\n- \u00b7 The 2022 PSU plan was adjusted to allow the relevant beneficiaries to receive for each 2022 PSU held, entitling them to receive one Solvay share and one PSU entitling them to receive one Syensqo share (in addition to the 2022 PSU entitling them to receive one Solvay share they already held). In addition, the Board of Directors decided that (i) the performance for year 2024 would be extrapolated from the performance for the years 2022 and 2023, and (ii) the vesting multiplier dependent on Solvay's performance against the median of total shareholders return of the Stoxx 600 Index peer group (TSR) would be measured on the basis of the average closing prices of the Solvay share over the three-month period ending on November 30, 2023. The vesting period and conditions remain unchanged.\n- \u00b7 The terms of the 2022 RSU plan were adjusted to allow the relevant beneficiaries to receive for each RSU held, entitling them to receive one Solvay share and one RSU entitling them to receive one Syensqo share (in addition to the RSU entitling them to receive one Solvay share they already held).\n- \u00b7 The 2023 PSU plan was adjusted so that the number of PSUs held at the time of the Partial Demerger by participants who would remain employees of Solvay or any of its affiliates following the Partial Demerger, or were former employees of Solvay or any of its affiliates as of the Partial Demerger date, would be multiplied by a factor determined based on the average closing prices of the Solvay share relative to the combined average closing prices of the Solvay share and the Syensqo share over the 30 trading days starting immediately following the completion of the Partial Demerger. In addition, the performance conditions linked to the 2024 and 2025 performance years are being adjusted to reflect the strategy of Solvay and the impact of the Partial Demerger. The vesting period and conditions remain unchanged.\n- \u00b7 The 2023 RSU plan was adjusted so that the number of RSUs held at the time of the Partial Demerger by participants who would remain employees of Solvay or any of its affiliates following completion of the Partial Demerger, or were former employees of Solvay or any of its affiliates as of the Partial Demerger date, would be multiplied by a factor determined based on average closing prices of the Solvay share relative to the combined average closing prices of the Solvay share and the Syensqo share over the 30 trading days starting immediately following the completion of the Partial Demerger.\n\nAs part of the Partial Demerger, Solvay transferred to Syensqo its rights and obligations under its outstanding incentive plans (including the 2022 stock option grant), in each case to the extent the beneficiaries of such plans (including members of the ELT before the Partial Demerger date) are employed by Syensqo or one of its affiliates following completion of the Partial Demerger. Specific adjustments were made to the 2023 PSU and RSU plans for such beneficiaries.\n\n## Stock options and share plans granted and held in 2023 by ELT members\n\nThe table below shows the evolution of outstanding balances of stock options, RSUs, and PSUs issued and held by:\n\n- \u00b7 ELT members before the Partial Demerger date as of December 8, 2023, (i.e., before the adjustments described above became effective); and\n- \u00b7 ELT members following the Partial Demerger as of December 31, 2023. No new stock options were granted in 2023 (i.e., after the adjustments described above became effective).",

This shareholding should normally be built up over a period not exceeding five years.\n\nAny shares acquired to meet this requirement should be held until at least one year after the ELT member leaves the Group and, in any case, for at least three years after the shares were acquired.\n\nAt this stage every ELT member is building his or her shareholding.\n\n## 6.3.5.3 Extraordinary items\n\n## Retention premium relating to the Group Portfolio Transformation\n\nIn 2022, the Group announced plans to create two distinct, independent, publicly listed industry leaders. The successful implementation of this project depended on the performance of Solvay's ELT and key senior executives. As the Solvay Group moved forward with the Partial Demerger it was considered critical by the Board to retain those key leaders.\n\nFor this reason, next to an incentive element for the success of the Partial Demerger consisting in a share option plan, and upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee of March 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of March 14, 2022 approved a cash retention plan to Solvay's ELT members, including the CEO, other executive officers, Global Business Unit (GBU) presidents, and heads of key functions.\n\nThe retention plans, crafted in alignment with the Remuneration Policy, were strategically devised to retain pivotal individuals crucial for spearheading the transformation project during a period of significant personal uncertainty. Their retention was considered imperative by the Board to maintain unwavering focus, mitigate distractions, and safeguard business continuity. Importantly, the payout of the retention bonus was contingent upon meeting performance criteria and maintaining active involvement within the Group up to the time of the Partial Demerger.",

        "page_content": "The premium amount was calculated based on a multiple of the monthly base salary as of April 2022 and the short-term incentive at target for 2022, ranging from 12-18 months.\n\nThis retention premium for those who were eligible are disclosed under the table in the section 6.3.6.1.\n\n## Exceptional bonus for the CEO before the Partial Demerger date, Ilham Kadri\n\nUpon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee on October 30, 2023, the Board approved an extraordinary bonus of \u20ac12,000,000 (gross) for Ilham Kadri. This decision was based on the Board's acknowledgment, afforded through the Remuneration Policy and the spirit of the Corporate Governance Code, of Ilham Kadri's instrumental role in both devising and executing the transformational project, overcoming stringent deadlines, and unprecedented challenges. This transformational project, notable for its scale, underscored a significant leap in sustainable value creation for all stakeholders, marking a historic moment in the Group's 160-year history through the creation of two industry-leading champions in essential and specialty chemical products. Since the announcement of the Partial Demerger on March 25, 2022, Ilham Kadri's steadfast commitment to the Group played a pivotal role in successfully concluding the separation within the allotted time frame, while maintaining high team engagement levels, close to 80%.\n\nDuring her tenure as CEO of Solvay, Ilham Kadri consistently delivered exceptional performance, navigating the company through a volatile environment marked by inflation, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainties. Despite these hurdles, Ilham Kadri's disciplined cost and cash management, alongside her efforts in reducing the company's indebtedness, accelerated the Group's transformation while solidifying its financial position, bolstering a robust balance sheet and industry-leading sustainability credentials. These efforts laid the groundwork for the Partial Demerger which culminated in the emergence of two distinct business entities, achieving a milestone three years ahead of the original schedule outlined in the G.R.O.W. strategy.\n\nGiven the direct link between this exceptional bonus and the success of the Partial Demerger, its grant was subject to approval by the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on December 8, 2023, which was approved by shareholders.",

The CEO remuneration for 2023 is calculated as the sum of the remuneration of the CEO before the Partial Demerger, Ilham Kadri, from January 1, 2023, until December 8, 2023, and the remuneration of the CEO after the Partial Demerger, Philippe Kehren, from December 9, 2023, until December 31, 2023.\n\nThe lowest paid employee is defined as a full-time employee in Belgium who has worked for a full year and holds the lowest base salary at year end. The actual total remuneration received by this employee is considered in the calculation of the ratio.",

        "page_content": "## 6.4.  Statements of compliance of remuneration for Chairman and ELT members\n\nThis report has been prepared by the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe remuneration packages of the former and actual CEO and the other former or actual ELT members, are in compliance with Article 7:91 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, which provides that, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary or express approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, at least 25% of the variable remuneration shall be linked to predetermined performance criteria that are objectively measurable over a period of at least two years, and at least another 25% should be based on predetermined performance criteria that are objectively measurable over a period of at least three years.\n\nThe remuneration packages are set by the Board, based on recommendations from the Compensation Committee. These remuneration packages are also compliant with the Belgian Code of Corporate Governance (2020).\n\nVariable remuneration consisted of an annual incentive based on the performance achieved relative to the Group's economic and sustainable development performance objectives, and on the performance of the individual as measured against a set of pre-determined individual objectives.\n\nSince 2022, ELT members, including the CEO, receive PSUs and RSUs in the form of shares.\n\nThe expenses of the ELT members, including those of its Chairman (the CEO), are governed by the same rules that apply to all senior management staff, namely the justification of all business expenses, item by item. Private expenses are not reimbursed. In the case of mixed business and private expenses, such as cars, a proportionate rule is applied in the same way as to all management staff in the same position.\n\nAccording to Belgian Law, any changes to our Remuneration Policy need to be submitted to shareholders for approval before implementation.\n\n## 6.5.  Key provisions of Executive Leadership Team members' contractual relationships with the Company and/or an affiliated company, including provisions relating to remuneration in the event of early departure\n\nELT members, including the Chairman (or CEO), have directorships in Group subsidiaries as a function of their responsibilities. Where such directorships are compensated, they are included in the amounts given above, regardless of whether the position is deemed to be salaried or undertaken on a self-employed basis under local legislation.\n\n## 6.5.1. ELT members from January 1, 2023 until December 8, 2023 (before the Partial Demerger Date)\n\nThe key provisions of the contracts with the members of the ELT of Solvay until December 8, 2023, including those relating to remuneration in the event of early departure, have been reported under section 6.5 of the previous remuneration reports.\n\nIn the context of the Partial Demerger, and as announced on November 3, 2023, three members of the ELT of Solvay have joined the ELT of Syensqo: Dr. Ilham Kadri, Mr. Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien, and Mr. Marc Chollet. Mr. Augusto Di Donfrancesco joined Syensqo after the Partial Demerger, without being a member of the ELT. They have therefore left the ELT of Solvay on December 8, 2023.\n\nAs they joined Syensqo as of December 9, 2023, Dr. Ilham Kadri, Mr. Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien, Mr. Marc Chollet, and Mr. Di Donfrancesco have not received any termination payment when leaving the ELT of Solvay in 2023. However, Mr. Tiberghien received mandatory elements related to the mutual termination of his employment contract (holiday pay upon termination and balance of end year premium) on December 8, 2023, due to his change of status under new standalone Syensqo.\n\n- Mr. Karim Hajjar left the ELT of Solvay on December 8, 2023. He received a contractual departure indemnity of 12 months remuneration (computed on his total remuneration), in compliance with Belgian law and the terms of his employment contract, disclosed in the previous report (p. 147).\n- Mr. Dominique Golsong left the ELT of Solvay on December 8, 2023. He received a contractual departure indemnity of three months (fixed) remuneration, in compliance with the terms of his service contract, disclosed in the previous report (p. 147). Mr. Golsong shall be entitled to an additional indemnity in an amount of \u20ac 775.000 (equivalent to nine months remuneration, computed on his total remuneration), payable in 2024.\n\nSolvay waived the non-competition clauses for Mr. Golsong and Mr. Hajjar. Hence, no non-competition payment has been made.",

        "page_content": "## 6.5.2. ELT members as of December 9, 2023 (after the Partial Demerger Date)\n\nELT members of the new standalone Solvay as of December 9, 2023, have been appointed under a self-employed status and have a management agreement of Belgian law with Solvay for a definite period of four years that is tacitly renewed when their mandate is renewed. By way of exception, the CPO (Mr. Mark Van Bijsterveld) has an employment contract of Dutch law and the COO (Mr. Lanny Duvall) has an employment contract of Belgian law, both for an indefinite period (as mentioned above the intention is to move to a self-employment contract when the change in immigration status of Mr. Lanny Duvall will be completed).\n\nThe following termination arrangements have been agreed upon with the ELT members of the new standalone Solvay:\n\nFor the CEO it was decided to apply a severance fee equivalent to 12 months of remuneration in case Solvay terminates the agreement. This deviates from the provisions of the agreement with the former CEO as set out in the Remuneration Policy which provided for a fee equivalent to 18 months. Despite a technical deviation from the Remuneration Policy, this reduction better aligns to practice under the Belgian Corporate Governance Code.\n\nAdditionally, for the new ELT members the following provisions apply:\n\nIn the event that Solvay terminates the contract of the CEO (Mr. Philippe Kehren), the CFO (Mr. Alexandre Blum), or the General Counsel (Ms. Lisa Brown), or if their mandate is not renewed at the end of a four-year period, they will be eligible for a contractual termination indemnity equal to six months remuneration (calculated on the basis of the annual fixed fees and the short-term variable fees at target) for a seniority of less than one year within the Solvay Group at the time of the termination, or 12 months for a seniority of more than one year. Their management contracts provide for a non-competition period of 12 months after termination, with an indemnity equal to 50% of the remuneration for the non-competition period unless Solvay waives the application of the clause. This indemnity, if due by the Company, is included in the termination indemnity, from which it shall be deducted.\n\nIn the event that Solvay terminates the employment contract of the CPO (Mr. Mark Van Bijsterveld) he will receive a severance package equal to the higher of the statutory transition payment according to Dutch law or 12 months gross salary (the basis for the calculation of this severance package is the annual gross salary and the average of the STIs received in the past three years). His employment contract provides for a noncompetition period of 12 months after termination.\n\nIn the event that Solvay terminates the employment contract of the COO (Mr. Lanny Duvall), the legal system according to Belgian law applies. A non-competition period of 12 months after termination applies, with an indemnity equal to the higher of (i) 60% of his gross remuneration (including fixed remuneration, non-fixed remuneration, and benefits) and (ii) 80% of the gross fixed remuneration (if Solvay does not waive the application of the clause).\n\nIn the event that Mr. Philippe Kehren resigns, he has to respect a notice period of six months. In the event that Mr. Alexandre Blum, Ms. Lisa Brown, and Mr. Mark Van Bijsterveld resign, they have to respect a notice period of three months. In the event that Mr. Lanny Duvall resigns, Belgian law applies.\n\nAll ELT members are subject to the non-competition agreements described above in the event of resignation, unless Solvay waives the application of the clauses.\n\nIn the event of a change in control over the Company, Ms. Lisa Brown may terminate the management agreement with three months notice to the Company within six months after the occurrence of such change in control. In such event, she will receive a termination indemnity at the same conditions as in case of termination by Solvay (the non-competition indemnity, if due by the Company, is included in the termination indemnity, from which it shall be deducted).\n\n## 7. MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF RISK MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL CONTROL AND INTERNAL AUDIT\n\n## 7.1.  Roles and responsibilities\n\nSolvay leaders and managers are accountable for ensuring the adequacy of the risk management and internal control framework in their respective Global Business Units (GBUs) and Functions.\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risk Management department (IA/RM) organizes internal audit, internal control and risk management activities in a global assurance function to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems.\n\nThe Risk Management and Internal Control teams provide advice and ensure that leaders address the challenges at stake. They are in charge of setting up and maintaining a comprehensive and consistent system for risk management and internal control across the Group, which is independently reviewed by the Internal Audit team.",

        "page_content": "TITLE INFOGRAPHIC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe extent to which Solvay is willing to take risk in pursuit of the Group's business strategy and the objective to create shareholder value is defined and managed by a number of qualitative and quantitative measures such as limits, triggers and indicators according to its risk appetite. The IA/ RM department communicates directly with the Audit and Risk Committee on a regular basis to ensure that risk management activities by Solvay management are aligned with the Board.\n\nSolvay has set up an internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- \u00b7 current laws and regulations are respected;\n- \u00b7 policies and objectives set by general management are implemented;\n- \u00b7 financial and extra-financial information is accurate; and\n- \u00b7 internal processes are efficient and effective, particularly those contributing to the protection of Solvay's assets.\n\nThe five components of the internal control system and the role of internal audit as an independent assurance provider are described below.\n\n## 7.2.  The control e nvi ronment\n\nAs the foundation of the internal control system, the control environment reflects the tone from the top, thus promoting awareness and compliant behavior among all employees. Its various elements create a clear structure of principles, rules, roles and responsibilities, while demonstrating management's commitment to compliance.\n\n- \u00b7 The Code of Business Integrity is available on Solvay's website. It refers to underlying policies and procedures. Employees regularly receive training on the Code. More information can be found in the Extra-Financial Statements section of this report.\n- \u00b7 An Ethics Hotline, managed by a third party, enables employees to report potential Code of Business Integrity violations if they cannot approach their managers or the compliance organization, or if they wish to remain anonymous. More information can be found in the Extra-Financial Statements section of this report.\n- \u00b7 Standardized processes and controls, including delegations of authority and signature rules, as well as the application of the segregation of duties principle, are in place for financial and non-financial activities and transactions.\n\n## 7.3.  The risk assessment process\n\nThe Group-wide risk management process takes into account the organization's strategic objectives and is structured into the following phases:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk analysis (identification and evaluation), risk assessment and decision on how to manage the critical risks\n- \u00b7 Implementation of mitigation plans with risk owners accountable for delivery\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of risk mitigation plans to ensure adequacy and effectiveness",

        "page_content": "The Audit and Risk Committee meets with the CEO and all other members of the Board once a year to discuss and approve the major risks facing the Group ('Group Risks'). During the year, the Audit and Risk Committee systematically reviews progress and regularly invites the relevant leaders and risk owners to provide overviews of their risk assessments and progress on mitigating actions. In accordance with the defined Group Risks, topics such as industrial safety, physical security, cybersecurity, ESG-related subjects, or ethics and compliance matters are addressed.\n\nMore information on Enterprise Risk Management, including a description of the Group's main risks and the actions taken to avoid or mitigate them at different levels in the organization can be found in the Risk Management section of this report.\n\n## 7.4.  Control activities\n\nSolvay uses a systematic approach to design and implement internal control activities for the Group's most relevant processes. It includes a risk assessment step to define the key control objectives for processes at corporate, global shared services platforms named Global Business Services (GBS), Global Business Unit (GBU) and site level to ensure the production of reliable Financial Statements. Under the sponsorship of the CFO, a network of corporate process owners and GBU representatives has been set up to promote an internal control system tailored to the risks of each GBU and corporate function.\n\nFollowing the risk assessment phase, the controls are designed and described by the corporate process owners with the support of the Internal Control team. The control descriptions are used as a reference for the internal control roll-out and assessment across the Group. At each level in the organization, the manager in charge of the process is responsible for control execution.\n\nSolvay implements policies and processes applicable to all employees in the following financial domains: management control, financing and cash flow; financial control; financial communication; tax and insurance policies. Control activities are defined for all of these financial processes and for major Group-wide projects, like acquisitions and divestitures. Furthermore, an online Financial Reporting Guide explains how the IFRS rules should be applied throughout the Group.\n\nFinancial elements are consolidated monthly and analyzed by Controlling teams at all levels in the organization, as well as by Group Accounting and Reporting and the Executive Leadership Team. Elements are analyzed using plausibility and consistency checks, as well as various other methods, such as variance analysis, ratio analysis and comparison with forecasts.\n\nIn addition to the monthly reporting analysis, the Executive Leadership Team thoroughly reviews GBU performance every quarter in the context of business forecast reviews.\n\n## 7.5.  Internal control monitoring\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee monitors and assesses the effectiveness of the internal control system. It supervises the work of the Internal Audit and Risk Management team relating to financial, operational and compliance monitoring. It is kept informed of the scope, programs and results of internal control testing, internal control self-assessments, and internal audit work. It also verifies that audit recommendations are properly implemented (for additional information on the work of Internal Audit see section below). The role and responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee are detailed in the Audit and Risk Committee Charter included in the Governance Charter.\n\nBesides that, the Ethics and Compliance department coordinates investigations of potential Code of Business Integrity violations. More information on the work of the Ethics and Compliance department can be found in the Extra-financial Statements section of this report.\n\n## 7.6.  Information and communication\n\nGroup-wide information systems are operated by the IT department. A large majority of Group operations are supported by a small number of integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Financial consolidation is supported by a dedicated tool.\n\nFinancial reporting procedures and internal controls ensure that all material information disclosed by Solvay to investors, creditors and regulators is accurate, transparent and timely, and that it fairly represents the Group's most relevant developments, financial fundamentals and performance.\n\nThe Group Accounting and Reporting department provides detailed written instructions to all financial actors involved before each quarterly closing.\n\nThe publication of the quarterly financial results is subject to various review and approval steps:\n\n- \u00b7 The Investor Relations team designs, develops and issues messages and information about the Group with the needs of financial markets in mind. It does so under the supervision and control of the Executive Leadership Team.\n- \u00b7 The Audit and Risk Committee ensures that financial statements and communications by Solvay SA and the Group conform to generally accepted accounting principles (IFRS for the Group, Belgian accounting law for Solvay SA).\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors approves the consolidated periodic financial statements and those of Solvay SA (quarterly, semi-annual and annual) and all related communications.",

It uses a systematic and methodological approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal control processes and procedures, helping the organization accomplish its objectives.\n\nThe team performs internal audit assignments across the entire Group on the basis of its Audit Charter and the risk-based annual internal audit plan approved by the Audit and Risk Committee. The audit plan takes into consideration internal and external data, risk factors and benchmarks. It includes both entity-level audits and group-wide transversal assignments to address the Group's main risks, which are identified as part of the enterprise risk management process. Internal Audit aims to inspect consolidated entities within the Group at least every five years.\n\nThe assignments are scoped, planned and defined on the basis of a risk analysis focusing on key risk areas. It is the management's responsibility to ensure that internal audit recommendations are translated into action plans and implemented. The implementation status is monitored by the Internal Audit team and reported to the Executive Leadership Team, senior management, and the Audit and Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\nIn 2023, the Internal Audit team conducted 17 assignments across all Solvay regions relating to the efficiency of operations and internal controls, as well as to governance, compliance, business integrity, ESG, safety of operations, information security and value protection topics.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management reports to the Chief Financial Officer and maintains reporting relationships with the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and the CEO. She attends all Audit and Risk Committee meetings and periodically presents an activity report summarizing audit missions performed, the follow-up of recommendations and the annual audit program. She has direct access at all times to the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and the CEO.\n\n## 8. EXTERNAL AUDIT\n\nThe audit of the Company's financial situation, financial statements, extra-financial statements and the conformity of these statements - and the entries to be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with the Code of Companies and Associations and the bylaws - are entrusted to one or more auditors. The auditors are appointed at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and chosen from among the members, either natural or legal persons, of the Belgian Institute of Company Auditors.\n\nThe responsibilities and powers of the auditor(s) are set by law.\n\n- \u00b7 The Annual Shareholders' Meeting sets the number of auditors and their emoluments in accordance with the law. Auditors are also entitled to reimbursement of their travel expenses for auditing the Company's sites and administrative offices.\n- \u00b7 The Annual Shareholders' Meeting may also appoint one or more alternate auditors. Auditors are appointed for three-year renewable terms, which cannot be revoked by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting without good reason.\n- \u00b7 The Audit and Risk Committee assesses the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditor with regard to the:\n- -content, quality and insights provided in key external auditor plans and reports, in particular those summarizing audit work performed on risks identified by the Company\n- -engagement with the external auditor during Committee meetings\n- -robustness of the external auditor in their handling of key accounting principles\n- -provision of non-audit services\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2023, professional services were performed by Ernst and Young R\u00e9viseurs d'Entreprises SRL, duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Belgium, whose registered office is at Kouterveldstraat 7b, 1831 Diegem, Belgium, registered in the register of legal entities of Brussels under business registration number 0446.334.711, and their respective affiliates.\n\nThe yearly 2023 audit fees for Solvay SA were set at \u20ac1.3 million. They include the audit of the statutory and consolidated accounts of Solvay SA. Audit fees for Solvay affiliates in 2023 amount to \u20ac2.2 million. Additionally, audit fees for affiliates that were discontinued as a result of the Syensqo Group demerger amount to \u20ac2 million. Supplementary non-audit fees of \u20ac3.5 million were engaged in 2023 by Solvay SA and affiliates (out of which \u20ac0.5 million non-audit services for affiliates that were discontinued as a result of the Syensqo Group demerger) of which:\n\n- \u00b7 Other assurance service missions:\n- -Invoiced by the statutory auditor of the Group: \u20ac2.8 million.\n- -Invoiced by other EY entities: \u20ac0.4 million.\n- \u00b7 Other services: \u20ac0.3 million.\n\nThe Ernst & Young mandate has started at the date of the Shareholders' meeting of May 10, 2022. EY is the statutory auditor of the company for a duration of three years, ending after the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 2025, which will be called upon to approve the accounts for the year 2024.",

DEVIATION FROM THE 2020 CODE\n\nThe Company deviates from Rule 7.6 of the Corporate Governance Code which recommends that a portion of the remuneration paid to nonexecutive directors be in shares. The Company considers however that its remuneration practices remain relevant and comply with the spirit of Rule 7.6 because non-executive directors are required to hold a number of Company shares equivalent to 100% of their gross annual fixed board fees.\n\nFor further details, please see section 6 of the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\n## 10. ITEMS TO BE DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 34 OF THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE OF NOVEMBER 14, 2007\n\nAccording to Article 34 of the Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 2007, the Company hereby discloses the following items:\n\n## Capital structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the capital of the Company amounted to \u20ac236,583,447.18, represented by 105,876,416 ordinary shares with no designated par value, fully paid up.\n\nAll Solvay shares are entitled to the same rights. There are no different classes of shares.\n\n## Transfer of shares and shareholders' arrangements\n\nSolvay's Articles of Association do not contain any restriction on the transfer of shares.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, there are no binding agreements among shareholders relating to the Company that may result in restrictions on the transferability of the Company's shares, or the exercise of voting rights. However, the Company is informed that certain individual shareholders who hold shares directly in Solvay may decide to consult one another when questions of particular strategic importance are submitted by the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting. Each of these shareholders, however, remains free to vote as he or she chooses. None of these individuals, either individually or in concert with others, reaches the initial 3% transparency notification threshold (as Solvay has not been notified of any such holding).\n\nSolvay is not aware of any voting agreements among our shareholders or of the existence of a concert between our shareholders.\n\n## Holders of securities with special control rights\n\nThere are no such securities.\n\n## Control mechanism of any employee share scheme where the control rights are not exercised directly by the employees\n\nThere is no employee share scheme with such a mechanism.\n\n## Restrictions on the exercise of voting rights\n\nEach Solvay share entitles its holder to exercise one vote at shareholder Meetings.\n\nArticle 10 of the Company's Articles of Association provides that the exercise of voting rights and other rights attached to shares that are jointly owned, or of which the usufruct and bare ownership rights have been separated or are pledged, are suspended pending the appointment of a single representative to exercise the rights attached to the shares.\n\nThe voting rights attached to the shares in Solvay held by Solvay Stock Option Management, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the company, are, as a matter of law, suspended.\n\n## Appointment, renewal, resignation and dismissal of directors\n\nThe Articles of Association of the Company provide that the Company is to be managed by a Board of Directors composed of no less than five members, their number being determined by the Shareholders' Meeting (Article 12). Directors are, in principle, appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting for four years, and may be reappointed (Article 13).\n\nThe Board of Directors submits directors' appointments, renewals, resignations or dismissals to the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\nThe Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting decides on proposals made by the Board of Directors on this matter by a simple majority.\n\nIf a directorship becomes vacant during a term of office, the Board of Directors may appoint a new member, subject to ratification at the next Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Amendment of Solvay's Articles of Association\n\nAmendments to the Company's Articles of Association must be submitted as a resolution to the Shareholders' Meeting, at which at least 50% of the share capital of Solvay must be present or represented. In principle, amendments must be passed by a 75% majority of the votes cast.",

Under Section 4.2 of the Separation Agreement, Syensqo has the right to terminate (for the future) its indemnification undertakings towards Solvay for environmental liabilities allocable to Syensqo for which Solvay would remain liable notwithstanding the Partial Demerger, in the event of a change of control over Solvay (defined as the case where a third party reaches or crosses, alone or in concert, the threshold of 25% of voting securities of the Company, irrespective of whether this threshold is reached or crossed as a result of an acquisition of voting securities or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions relating to Solvac). The change of control clause was approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of December 8, 2023.\n\n## \u00b7 U.S. Tax Matters Agreement dated October 31, 2023\n\nIn the context of the Partial Demerger, Solvay and Syensqo entered into a U.S. tax matters agreement, governing the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of the Company and Syensqo with respect to certain U.S. tax matters, including with respect to U.S. tax liabilities (including, generally, responsibility and potential indemnification obligations for U.S. taxes attributable to each company's business and taxes and losses arising, under certain circumstances, in connection with the intragroup spin-off of certain U.S. entities (the ' U.S. Spin-Off ') and the Partial Demerger (and certain related transactions), U.S. tax attributes, U.S. tax contests and U.S. tax returns (the ' U.S. Tax Matters Agreement '). Under Section 3.02 of the U.S. Tax Matters Agreement, the Company may be required to indemnify Syensqo or Solvay Holding, Inc. for certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences that may result from (i) certain future actions or omissions that could reasonably be expected to cause the Partial Demerger or the U.S. Spin-Off (or certain associated transactions) to fail to qualify for their intended U.S. tax treatment, including actions or omissions which lead to or may lead to a change of control over the Company (within the meaning of Article 1:14 and following of the BCCA), or (ii) the acquisition by one or more persons of a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the capital of the Company, including for the avoidance of doubt pursuant to a takeover bid (even if Solvay does not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition).

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nIn a context of elevated global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, increasingly volatile market cycles, supply chain constraints, and heightened sensitivity and expectations related to climate change and sustainability, we believe that effectively monitoring and managing risks is key to achieving Solvay's strategic objectives.\n\n## 1. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nValue can be created when risk is well understood and managed. Anticipating, mitigating, measuring, and monitoring risks is as important to Solvay as the related activity of identifying, managing, and optimizing opportunities. The extensive risk-related processes that we apply to everyone across the entire organization and value chain, from the Board of Directors and frontline workers to supply chain partners and customers demonstrates this. These processes are outlined below.\n\n## 1.1.  Risk analysis and decisions on how to manage critical risks\n\nWe analyze risks in three steps. First, we establish their level of priority for Solvay, which means categorizing them as 'main risks' (most critical), 'emerging risks,' or 'other risks.' Second, we identify in which area the risk would have the most impact: the environment, people, economic, or reputation. And third, we classify risks according to their time horizon: short term (up to one year), medium term (more than one year and less than five), and long term (more than five years).\n\nIn accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the EU Taxonomy frameworks and upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requirements, we also assess and categorize our main risks as 'Environmental (E),' 'Social (S)' or 'Governance (G),' where applicable.\n\n## 1.2.  Risk management in action\n\nSolvay's Enterprise Risk Management methodology, which is inspired by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) principles, requires our Global Business Units (GBUs) and Functions - and the Group as a whole - to prioritize risks, develop and deliver on mitigation plans, and continually scan the environment to assess whether risks and exposures are changing and test whether priorities and plans remain appropriate. This process is closely followed by the Risk Management team, with systematically recorded assessments enabling us to monitor decisions and measure actions and progress.\n\nThe process we use is regularly adjusted, in order to constantly improve the identification and classification of risks. In 2023, we generalized the use of a systematic classification process to help us integrate ESG risks into our Enterprise Risk Management methodology, by establishing a catalog of typical ESG risk categories. This tool embeds typical risks for climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation risks following the TCFD framework. It also comprises items from the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, at the time when drafts were available for the risk review exercise in 2023. This enabled us to further improve the completeness of our ESG risk universe.\n\nCritical risks for the Group are closely and systematically monitored by the Group Risk Committee, which ensures that these risks are assessed for materiality and adequately addressed. The Committee is composed of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), establishing a direct link between the Group's strategy and the risk management process, the Chief Sustainability Officer, the Senior Vice President of Communication and Public Affairs, and the Capital Markets Director. Group Risk Committee meetings are facilitated by the Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management.\n\n## Global Business Unit and Function leaders integrate risk management into decision-making to support delivery of objectives\n\nLeaders of GBUs and Functions are responsible for identifying, monitoring, and managing the key risks in their scope of responsibility. Risk management is embedded in the day-to-day operations of each entity, and operational managers are expected to anticipate and react rapidly when circumstances change. The GBU risk matrices and follow-up actions needed to mitigate any critical risks are formally presented to the ELT.\n\n## Group risks are overseen at Executive Leadership Team level\n\nGroup-level risks are managed and monitored at the top level. The Group Risk Committee contributes to identifying and assessing risks and the ELT members act as risk sponsors contributing to risk treatment and response. Board Members also provide independent input based on their broad expertise. Additional input may be provided by the Corporate Internal Audit and Risk Management Department, which scans external sources, such as the World Economic Forum Global Risks report, the Risk in Focus report from the ECIIA 1 , the AXA Future Risks Report, or the Economist Intelligence Unit Risk Outlook for relevant information. In principle, this input is reviewed and validated by the ELT once a year, while risk-mitigating initiatives are presented at least twice a year. More frequent updates are prepared and reviewed when necessary.",

This was, amongst others, the case for the successful Partial Demerger project, splitting the Group into the two independent publicly traded companies Solvay and Syensqo, for which a distinct organization and governance structure had been implemented and a dedicated risk identification, mitigation, and monitoring process had been established.\n\n## Internal control\n\nInternal control is a key aspect of risk management. The Corporate Governance chapter of this report provides a detailed description of Solvay's risk management and internal control system (see chapter 6).\n\n## 1.3.  Crisis preparedness\n\nThere is a structured network within the Group to ensure crisis preparedness. Members of this network perform tasks and implement programs in order to ensure that their business units and functions are prepared for specific crisis situations. These programs include crisis simulations, media training for potential spokespersons, maintenance of key databases, and analysis of relevant internal and external events. The risks identified using our Enterprise Risk Management methodology influence the scenarios used in our simulations.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Failure to comply with chemical product usage standards, such as:\n- -Inappropriate use of a Solvay product by Solvay personnel or customers, which can lead to adverse health and environmental impacts, property damage and resulting litigation.\n- -Production of faulty products, which can result in exposure to liability for injury, health impairment and damage, or product recalls. Product liability risk is generally higher for products used in medical devices, healthcare, food contact and feed applications, and sensitive applications in general.\n- -Failure to comply with chemical and market regulations in countries where a product is sold. There are a lot of regulatory activities worldwide, in particular, we are closely monitoring the upcoming European Union Chemical Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) regulatory framework, including its possible impact on our business and operations and potential opportunities stemming from it. The U.S. Administration is also developing a stricter regulatory framework for chemicals, as well as a framework relating to environmental justice.\n\n## 2.1.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, policies, and procedures\n\nOur Code of Business Integrity includes a wide range of topics, among those listed above. It applies to all employees and majority-owned joint venture partners. Our Supplier Code of Business Integrity applies to suppliers.\n\nWe introduced training courses which all employees are required to attend and obtain a certificate of completion. We require that all employees certify through an annual acknowledgement integrated in the Code of Business Integrity training that they have read and understood the Code, that they are in compliance with its requirements, and that they have nothing to report. We have created increased awareness through training courses and communication to address specific behavioral risks. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 a culture of business integrity;\n- \u00b7 anti-bribery and anti-corruption;\n- \u00b7 anti-competitive activity;\n- \u00b7 confidential and proprietary information;\n- \u00b7 data protection and privacy;\n- \u00b7 reporting non-compliance with human rights in business policy;\n- \u00b7 use of a gifts and entertainment tracking system;\n- \u00b7 use of third-party reporting hotlines and a Group-wide 'Speak Up' program to report non-compliance;\n- \u00b7 sanctions and export control.\n\nBefore entering into a business relationship, our suppliers are required to sign our Supplier Code of Business Integrity and commit to its principles.\n\nIn addition, we are increasing our oversight on third parties and suppliers in the field of human rights, anti-bribery and corruption, and environmental breaches through proactive screening by third-party service providers. Human rights has now been integrated in our Ethics Helpline as a matter type and is also open to the employees of our suppliers.\n\n## Product and markets regulated risks\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay Safety Data Sheets (SDS) ensure harmonized content by implementing a common worldwide SAP system for the Group. This SAP system is fully implemented across the company.\n- \u00b7 SDS are constantly maintained for all products and are distributed worldwide to all customers, in compliance with local regulations and in the local language. Our GBUs ensure that SDS are revised at least once every three years for all the products they sell.\n- \u00b7 All GBUs perform an annual inventory of Solvay - Substances of Very High Concern (Solvay - SVHC) -defined by Solvay, in the marketed products and in raw materials. A risk assessment and analysis of any available safer alternatives is being performed for each Solvay - SVHC identified in the inventory of marketed products. Solvay also takes a phase-out approach on top of the analysis of safer alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Recall procedures are developed and deployed as prescribed by the product stewardship programs.\n- \u00b7 Insurance reduces the financial impact of a product liability risk, including first-party and third-party product recalls.\n\n## 2.1.3. Main developments in 2023\n\n## Business integrity\n\nMandatory annual training and certification ensures all Solvay employees know our Code of Business Integrity. We measure performance not only by what people deliver, but also on how they deliver, in line with the Group's values and behaviors.\n\nIn 2023 our training focused on protecting a culture of integrity at Solvay, on speaking up and listening, on non-retaliation, on data privacy, and on gifts, entertainment, and charitable donations. All employees are required to take the training and to certify that they have read the Code of Business Integrity and will apply it.",

        "page_content": "We continued increasing awareness about speaking up and raising concerns when people notice a potential breach of regulation, our policies, or our Code of Business Integrity, without fear of retaliation. Our Ethics Helpline was further upgraded and made more accessible in 2023, ensuring that incidents can be easily reported and investigated as required. Fraud was added as a new topic to our Ethics Helpline. The Speak Up program was also part of the annual mandatory training for all our employees, and we raised awareness amongst employees that they can speak up about the full spectrum of topics referenced in the Code of Business Integrity. This resulted in a continued increase of reported incidents and increased our ability to detect, identify, and address issues and risks at an early stage. The increase in reported incidents does not imply that there were more incidents in 2023 than before, but shows that employees reach out more to report potential breaches, enabling us to investigate and address those breaches, identify root causes, adapt processes, or take disciplinary actions when necessary. Specific training modules for managers increased awareness on their role in a culture of integrity and how to listen and act on employees' concerns.\n\nTo tackle human rights and environmental impacts across our upstream value chains, Solvay further improved our ESG risk management approach for our supply chain. It provides a systematic approach for identifying risks and assessing their severity in more than 60 upstream value chains, and triggers risk mitigation action plans. In 2023, we increased our efforts towards our suppliers to identify the human rights risks based on an internal analysis by country and value chain and we started to work with an external provider to screen against adverse media. This allowed us to categorize our suppliers in high, medium, and low risk clusters. Ensuring compliance with social and environmental standards, including respect for human rights, in our supplier network is important to us.\n\nWe developed a new external Ethics and Compliance website that was launched in 2023, ensuring that information on the program, the Code of Business Integrity, ethics and compliance policies, as well as our Ethics Helpline are available and easily accessible to employees and externals. This increases awareness of Solvay's culture of integrity and the detection, identification, and addressing of potential issues and risks, as concerns or potential breaches that relate to our supply chain can be reported by any third party, including by the employees of our suppliers, also on Human Rights and Environmental violations. Reported incidents are investigated and preventive and corrective actions implemented when required.\n\nIn 2023, we also conducted an internal audit exclusively focused on ESG matters where we reviewed the commitment of our suppliers to our Supplier Code of Business Integrity and also conducted a compliance audit on business integrity, bribery and corruption, and travel and expenses in APAC.\n\n## Product and markets regulated risks\n\nThe Solvay Product Safety Management Process (PSMP) identifies risks relating to products marketed by Solvay. All GBUs use this process, which involves prioritizing the required risk assessments in the product portfolio and carrying out risk assessments for the most sensitive product applications.\n\nMore information on this can be found in the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 5.5 Hazardous materials.\n\n## 2.2.  Security\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TERM TREND: IMPROVEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1. Risk description\n\nCertain security threats can have negative consequences for our business. These include terrorism, crime, violence, vandalism, theft, and cyberattacks, which impact employees or other stakeholders, sites, assets, critical information, or intellectual property.\n\nSolvay is exposed to physical security risks because it has 45 industrial sites, a large part of which have a high Seveso level (number of sites considered post Partial Demerger). A number of our products, if mishandled, can cause severe damage.\n\nFor more information on this, see the Extra-financial statements section of the report: 5.5 Hazardous materials.\n\nWe also have sites located in countries where security concerns are rated high by International SOS. Forty-five industrial and fourteen administrative and R&I sites (number of sites considered post Partial Demerger) have undergone a Security Vulnerability Self-Assessment (SVSA) and only one industrial site has been assessed as having the highest level of security risk - Level 1 - since the previous SVSA.\n\nSolvay's exposure to cyber risk, as for most major companies, stems from our extensive use of information and communication technologies and the gradually increasing automation level of our sites. Following the Partial Demerger, Solvay is also exposed to this risk in connection with major group transformations and reorganizations, as well as the services it provides to Syensqo under the Master Transition Services Agreement (MTSA).  Like most multinationals, Solvay experiences cyber incidents and actively responds to those incidents to limit the impact. The Solvay management team is not aware of any incident that would have significant consequences for our financial statements or our business.\n\n## 2.2.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nSolvay has a risk-based security approach to protecting sites, information, and people.\n\n- \u00b7 A Chief Security Officer (CSO) coordinates all security activities globally in order to ensure efficient security risk mitigation. A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), reporting to the Chief Security Officer, coordinates all related cyber security activities.",

This includes controls such as endpoint detection and response, multi-factor authentication, immutable back-ups and a stronger network segregation.\n\nA significant cyberattack could negatively impact Solvay in many ways, including people, operations and results, and services we deliver to Syensqo under the MTSA entered into in connection with the Partial Demerger, as well as know-how and intellectual property. We will therefore continue to solidify our cyber defenses so that we are able to manage the evolving cyber threat landscape.\n\n## Insurance\n\nSolvay is insured against the potential financial impact of a cyberattack. This insurance covers damage to assets, business interruption, ransomware, and third-party liability in case of loss of confidential third-party information. Solvay is also a founding member of MIRIS (Mutual of Cyber Insurance) that provides exclusive additional capacity and loss prevention advice to their members.\n\n## 2.2.3. Main developments in 2023\n\nOur commitment to managing the security-related risks remains solid, guided by efficiency and by the belief that proactive measures are vital in safeguarding our assets and ensuring the resilience of our operations.\n\nAs we navigate the evolving threat landscape, we acknowledge the need for a security governance model that is aligned with the new organization. Therefore, in anticipation of the challenges that lie ahead, we have defined a new governance model that is meticulously crafted to seamlessly integrate with our business strategy, ensuring that security is not a standalone function. The collaboration is at the heart of our approach, encouraging a culture where expertise from various facets of security converges to create a robust defense strategy.\n\nMoreover, the year 2023 provided us with a unique opportunity to review and fortify our network segregation and access rights as well as revamping our security awareness strategy.\n\nIn terms of personnel security, we ensured a greater visibility on business travel and set up active monitoring for all medium- and high-risk countries where Solvay employees travel to in order to better anticipate threats and be able to alert accordingly. This was enabled by working on our reporting tools as well as by reaching out to travelers individually to ensure that they have the necessary tools to receive live alerts in the unfortunate event of a security-related incident.\n\nDirect lines of communication have also been opened between Group Security and site managers, making an early warning system possible, and ensuring greater reactivity at site level as well as at the Group Security level.\n\nIn 2023, Solvay kept the commitment of the previous years to enhance physical security measures, recognizing the importance of safeguarding our assets and sensitive sites. We prioritized standardization to ensure a robust and consistent security infrastructure across all our facilities. Our dedicated projects aimed at elevating security levels involved the integration of advanced surveillance systems, access control mechanisms, and intrusion detection technologies. We tailored our strategies and investments to create a layered defense that not only deters potential threats but also promptly responds to any security incidents.",

Risk description\n\nA major accident on site (occupational, process) or a chronic exposure of employees (industrial hygiene) causes fatalities, irreversible injuries, environmental damages, or asset damages.\n\nAn accident off site (transportation, warehousing, tolling) causes fatalities/irreversible injuries or environmental damages.\n\nThe safety of our people is a core value for Solvay, as is specified in our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap. A major accident - whether occupational, process, or transport related - that is linked to our internal or outsourced activities may cause human, environmental, or asset damages, lead to significant exposure or cause injuries or fatalities. Solvay's industrial sites, like most industrial operations, carry out high pressure and high temperature processes. We also use chemical substances that have risks associated with their chemical composition.\n\nFor more information about Solvay's management approach, see the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 6.1 Employee Health and Safety, 6.2. Critical incident risk management (process safety), 5.5 Hazardous materials.\n\nWe have identified four major operational safety risks:\n\n- \u00b7 An occupational safety incident which results in a fatality or irreversible (life-altering) injury.\n- \u00b7 A severe process safety incident which results in fatalities, irreversible injuries, environmental harm, and/or loss of physical assets.\n- \u00b7 Chronic exposure to occupational agents - chemical, physical, biological or psychological - known to cause work-related disease.\n- \u00b7 A severe transport accident in connection with hazardous chemical transportation which results in irreversible injuries, fatalities, or environmental damages.\n\n## 2.3.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nSolvay issued a new set of minimum requirements to create a shared understanding and approach to mitigating major operational safety risks. As part of this approach, we also introduced a new way of working, including a more collaborative and supportive approach to health, safety, and the environment (HSE) across the Group.\n\nOur HSE strategy is based on the following four levers:\n\n- \u00b7  Culture: Promoting a culture of safety for all employees and contractors.\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement: Utilizing networking, scaling best practices, common methods and tools, Solvay HSE minimum requirements, external monitoring, and benchmarking to improve our HSE performance. Sites are audited on Group HSE procedures at least once every five years.\n- \u00b7   Competency: Ensuring all employees have the right level of knowledge and skills to put in place the HSE minimum requirements starting with those working in key positions.\n- \u00b7 Compliance: Detecting and mitigating regulatory and non-regulatory compliance issues, with a focus on priority risks, both in our operations and commercialized products.\n\n## Occupational safety\n\nSolvay has consistently prioritized occupational safety. Our efforts to create a safety culture where all employees work together and care for one another are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay's Safety Plan, which involves and engages all Solvay employees. It includes activities such as Safety Days, Leadership Safety Visits, BehaviorBased Safety programs, Safety dialogues, and Safety Culture training.\n- \u00b7 The Solvay HSE minimum requirements for the Solvay Life Saving Rules (SLSR).\n- \u00b7 The Creating Safety program for leadership teams, aimed at changing mindsets and behavior.\n- \u00b7 A monthly review of occupational safety results by the relevant GBUs and at the Executive Leadership Team level.\n\n## Industrial hygiene and occupational health\n\nSolvay has implemented a comprehensive approach to reducing risks in the workplace. Our approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk assessments and risk-based medical surveillance, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, with a focus on chemicals;\n- \u00b7 Pandemic preparedness and mitigation plans;\n- \u00b7 Human biomonitoring, when warranted;\n- \u00b7 Improving and adapting working conditions;\n- \u00b7 Deployment of a well-being at work program;\n- \u00b7 Promoting general physical and mental health;\n- \u00b7 Setting more conservative in-house exposure limits for critical substances.",

Risk description\n\nThe Group strategy to address climate-related risks, as defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, could be ineffective and damage the environment, the lives of current and later generations, and Solvay's reputation. This, in turn, could cause business losses, undervaluation and difficulties in attracting long-term investors. The possible risks to Solvay that we have identified are as follows:\n\n## A - Transition risks:\n\nAs we embark on a transition path, more transition risks will materialize which will have strategic implications for the Group. Solvay's energy mix (which uses coal, our raw materials (including petrochemicals) and our end markets (including the automotive, aerospace, and building and construction industries) mean that it is exposed to risks and opportunities as part of the energy transition. These transition risks include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Policies and legal context: regulations and actions to limit CO 2 emissions, such as increasing carbon taxes, barring internal combustion engines, mandating the use of certain fuel types, and tightening environmental standards;\n- \u00b7 Technology: unsuccessful investment in new, lower-emission technologies;\n- \u00b7 Markets: failure to adapt to changing customer behavior;\n- \u00b7 Financial: inability to cope with the influence of climate change on investors' and lenders' decisions;\n- \u00b7 Changed climate: failing to adequately anticipate the impact of upcoming changes on industrial operations and in the value chain or the tightening of environmental standards;\n- \u00b7 Reputation: negative stakeholder attitudes caused by failing to address stakeholder climate change concerns effectively.\n\n## B - Physical risks:\n\nIf we do not contain climate change, more physical risks will materialize. Those risks concern our assets and operations and will influence our investment decisions.\n\n## Acute\n\n- \u00b7 Sites in flood zones;\n- \u00b7 Sites in drought zones;\n- \u00b7 Sites in cyclones and hurricanes regions.",

Main developments and results in 2023\n\n## A - Transition risks:\n\nThe Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) global and systematic assessment helps alert our businesses to sustainability market signals, in particular on climate risk and opportunities, to anticipate their impact and develop the right answers in a timely manner. SPM is a robust, fact-based, future-oriented compass that allows us to take a snapshot of products' sustainability risks and opportunities in their business environment.\n\nSPM informs us about the contributions Solvay's products make to sustainability along the value chain considering both:\n\n- \u00b7 their environmental manufacturing footprint and the associated risks and opportunities - vertical axis - with a quantitative assessment using 21 impact indicators; and\n- \u00b7 how their applications bring benefits or face challenges from a holistic market perspective - horizontal axis - with a qualitative assessment of social and environmental topics covering four main themes, namely health and safety, climate change, resources, and opinion leaders.\n\nFor more details about SPM, see section 7.1 Product design and life cycle management and the SPM guide published on Solvay's website.\n\nClimate change is one of the focus areas for SPM assessment. This involves identifying if a product in a given application brings a climate change benefit or challenge. Product-Application Combinations (PACs) that lead to benefits are identified as \"climate solutions,\" while those that pose challenges are considered \"climate challenges.\"\n\nSolvay's SPM tool classifies a sustainable solution as a product in a given application that makes a significant climate change contribution to the customer's performance while also demonstrating a lower carbon impact in its production phase. The SPM methodology is also used to identify eligible enabling activities, requested under the Taxonomy's Delegated Act 2021.\n\nFor more details about Taxonomy reporting, see section 7.3 EU Taxonomy.\n\nSPM is a key tool for enabling Solvay to integrate the sustainability dimension into strategic and operational decision-making in key business processes, such as strategy, research and innovation, investment, marketing and sales, and mergers and acquisitions. We also apply the SPM tool to strategic projects, using the same logic as for our portfolio, to make sure that these projects are heading toward business solutions that support growth and value creation. This makes SPM a key tool for Solvay to identify if an investment or a strategic or innovation project can be considered a climate transition opportunity for Solvay.\n\nClimate emissions reduction actions are described in detail in the Extra-financial section of the Annual Integrated Report. Among the numerous actions taken is the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In Devnya, Bulgaria, we have adapted one of the existing boilers to increase its co-combustion rate with non-recyclable biomass. Powered by 30% biomass fuel from a variety of sources, including locally-sourced sunflower husk pellets, it reduces our plant's CO 2 emissions by 20% from 2023.\n\nSee other examples and details in  Greenhouse gas emissions section , 4.2.4 Key achievements of the Extra-financial statements.\n\n## B - Physical risks:\n\nThe current risk linked to floods and hurricanes is assessed annually with our insurers. This exercise identifies sites in risk areas with a maximum foreseeable loss greater than $10 million. Five Solvay sites (number of sites considered in post Partial Demerger scope) are located in high frequency (2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of $15-168 million. Nine Solvay sites (number of sites considered in post Partial Demerger scope) are located in low frequency (0.2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of $15-208 million. One site is located in a wind-exposed area, with a loss expectancy of $16 million. Solvay has a damage insurance program in place to cover catastrophic risks, while covering smaller losses through self-insurance.\n\nA lot of prevention efforts have been deployed to protect sites against flood risks. These efforts have been concentrated on improving the human procedure in case of flood (risk assessment, flood emergency response) but also in physical protection. The Torrelavega site that was one of the most exposed is now out of the list thanks to a strong levee now surrounding the site. A plan has been developed for all sites to solve key exposures.\n\nSites in areas of water scarcity have been identified, and the risks have been assessed based on their water consumption and maximum foreseeable loss. Fourteen Solvay sites (number of sites considered in post Partial Demerger scope) are located in areas subject to hydric stress, of which four have been identified as having a high business impact. The highest annual business interruption value is \u20ac152 million.\n\nMore information can be found in the Climate change section , 4.1.2 Physical risks of the Extra-financial statements.",

Risk description\n\nFailure to meet evolving regulatory obligations and growing societal expectations related to human health and the environment, may lead to significant reputational damages, third-party claims, and liabilities.\n\nSolvay's activities impact the environment through:\n\n- \u00b7 our use of raw materials based on fossil or non-renewable resources and our consumption of energy;\n- \u00b7 our access to scarce resources, including water;\n- \u00b7 our management of waste, by-products, emissions, and effluents.\n\nSolvay manages or remediates historical soil contamination at all sites for which we are responsible, including divested or discontinued operations (including, under the Separation Agreement entered into between Solvay and Syensqo, with respect to certain sites that became part of the Syensqo group upon completion of the Partial Demerger), ensuring continuous compliance with the applicable environmental legislation. More information can be found in the Extra-financial section of the Annual Integrated Report.\n\nThese impacts on the environment, in turn, create the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenges and expenses related to meeting increasingly strict regulatory standards and changing customer expectations, standards, and purchasing decisions;\n- \u00b7 Changes in investor sentiment and preferences as a result of the changing investor environment;\n- \u00b7 Impact on our ability to recruit employees due to negative public perceptions of environmental issues.\n\n## 2.5.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nSince 2021, an Environmental SteerCo meets quarterly and addresses all environmental topics, including remediation, operations, and potential risks. Prevention and mitigation activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Careful monitoring and management of sites with a history of soil contamination by a dedicated expert team. We follow up on approximately 150 locations across the world.\n- \u00b7 Rolling out a risk characterization approach at every affected site, when relevant.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory monitoring to proactively assess and address upcoming changes in legislation.\n- \u00b7 Our Group strategy for managing chemicals of concern and developing alternatives with a reduced human and environmental impact, or phasing them out completely.\n\nWe have also implemented a comprehensive program to reduce workplace chemical exposure using:\n\n- \u00b7 chemical risk assessments and risk-based medical surveillance, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies;\n- \u00b7 pandemic preparedness and mitigation plans;\n- \u00b7 human biomonitoring, when warranted;\n- \u00b7 improving and adapting working conditions;\n- \u00b7 promoting general physical and mental health;\n- \u00b7 setting more conservative in-house exposure limits for critical substances.\n\nWe regularly review and update standards governing discharge from plants and we use our Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) tool to help identify substances that can deliver the needed results but with a more limited environmental impact. We revise our materiality analysis on a yearly basis to align with evolving stakeholder expectations, including environmental impacts.\n\nSolvay is insured up to \u20ac200 million per claim and in the annual aggregate for unknown gradual pollution and sudden and accidental pollution. Coverage includes defense costs, clean-up costs, and third-party liability.\n\n## 2.5.3. Main developments in 2023\n\nWe continued to execute our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap in 2023, featuring programs that:\n\n- \u00b7 identify substances of concern and develop alternatives, with a focus on Product Stewardship and industrial environmental emissions;\n- \u00b7 ongoing carbon neutrality ambition, with energy transition projects either completed or underway (more details in the  extra-financial report for Greenhouse Gas emissions section 4.2 and Energy section 4.3);\n- \u00b7 focus on improving our investment portfolio with regard to water consumption, to meet our 2030 ambitions;\n- \u00b7 systematically collect fines and settlements received at our sites and quarterly reporting to the ELT;\n- \u00b7 approve sustainable investment projects using a Solvay One Planet profile review;\n- \u00b7 identify and launch R&I projects that tackle potential risks;\n- \u00b7 reduce our pressure on biodiversity by 30% by 2030, which includes assessing our impact on climate change, terrestrial acidification, water eutrophication, and marine ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 address the Solvay sites most at risk of drought;\n- \u00b7 roll out the STAR Factory program site roadmaps (50% completed), which include a sustainability pillar.",

Risk description\n\nGeopolitical rivalries can cause trade wars, supply chain constraints, and regulatory deadlocks, leading to an inability or impairment to trade and develop our businesses across the key regions of the world.\n\n## 2.6.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nThe geographical balance of our Group activities across the major regions of the world, and the fact that in many of our global businesses we serve our customers locally, mitigate these risks up to a certain point, but this is nevertheless limited by the characteristics of our business supply chains.\n\n## 2.6.3. Main actions in 2023\n\nThe consequences of the war that erupted in Ukraine in 2022, continued to be felt in 2023. The Group continued to take action on several topics:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the safety of the few Solvay employees based in Ukraine.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the continuity of raw material supply by selecting alternative sources to Russia.\n- \u00b7 Implementing contingency plans for energy restrictions in Europe, including restrictions to access natural gas. Every European site has developed a contingency plan.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that we comply with the export controls and sanctions enforced by the EU, the U.S. and other countries.\n\nIn 2023, new geopolitical events had the potential to impact our business.\n\nChina reopening after the end of the zero-COVID policy created expectations that global demand would be driven up, but for the most part this failed to materialize. At the same time, tensions between U.S. and China contributed to an increased polarization of the world, triggering an initial internal assessment of its long term implications for Solvay. Our relatively small exposure to China, as well as the fact that many of our customers are served locally from plants located in each region, provided a relative protection from the situation in the short term.\n\nThe terror attacks in Israel and the ensuing war with Hamas created another source of instability and tension for the world but the direct impact on our business was relatively limited. The more recent attacks of Houthis in the Red Sea may have more impactful consequences if the induced increase in shipping costs does not abate quickly. In the meantime, the short-term impact is somewhat positive as those higher shipping costs protect some of our markets from low-cost Chinese competitors' products.\n\n## 2.7.  Digital and people transformation (new risk)\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM\n\n## 2.7.1. Risk description\n\nFailure to achieve our digital transformation and attract, retain, and diversify human capital may jeopardize our competitive edge.\n\nSolvay, like the rest of the chemical industry, is undergoing significant changes due to technology evolution which result in important investments in digitalization to further enhance operational efficiency, support sustainability standards, promote business resilience, and create competitive advantages. However, the implementation of these transformation initiatives, may sometimes not occur at the envisaged pace and/or their full potential may not always lead immediately to the desired results. In addition, the required changes could potentially influence employment trends and lead to shifts in job profiles due to automation and artificial intelligence (AI). This will make it even more necessary to rethink talent attraction, retention, and diversification strategies.\n\n## 2.7.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Deployment of the STAR Factory program as a response to the fast-changing world to transform our manufacturing sites into industry benchmarks. Successfully launched in 2021 and based on a pilot approach at two sites, the program is being rolled out to all Solvay sites. A 'Forum & Field' approach is used to support the sites in their journey and to roll out STAR Factory in a harmonized way across the company. This will further be supported by a STAR Academy to provide dedicated learning and sharing.\n- \u00b7 Dedicated training and development initiatives as well as regular best practice sharing to ensure that our employees actively engage in our digital initiatives and remain at the forefront of digital competencies.\n- \u00b7 Systematic talent development initiatives at all levels in the organization based on an early identification process, quarterly performance reviews, dedicated training modules for subject-matter experts and first-line managers, as well as for more senior managers, Young Professionals Network, Future Top-leader Community (FTL community), bonding sessions with senior leaders in the organization, and internal and external mentoring programs.\n- \u00b7 Active monitoring of key employee attrition rates and implementation of appropriate measures, such as incentive and retention plans, as well increased management involvement in maintaining an active dialogue with employees.",

OTHER RISKS\n\n## 3.1.  Market- and growth-strategic risk\n\n## RISK HORIZON: MEDIUM TO LONG TERM\n\n## 3.1.1. Risk description\n\nSolvay is exposed to a wide range of end markets and as a result targets a growth more or less in line with GDP. The ability to capture that growth relies on our relative cost competitiveness and on having production capacity available to supply the market. Strategic risks related to markets and growth concern Solvay's exposure to cyclical or phasing out applications or our competitive environment (for example, exposure to high energy or raw materials costs), and the risk of making erroneous strategic decisions (for example, failing to invest at the right time or in the right geographies, selection of new business development opportunities), etc.\n\n## 3.1.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Continuous investment in innovation and process improvement to achieve and/or defend benchmark performance. This is what we do, for instance, with the introduction of the next generation soda ash process, eSolvay.\n- \u00b7 Long-term contract agreement with large global or regional customers to secure stable market positions and prices.\n- \u00b7 Built-in energy component in our price mechanisms to hedge our exposure to energy costs.\n- \u00b7 Continuous cost improvement projects (STAR Factory program, operating model optimization) to improve and defend our cost competitiveness.\n- \u00b7 Capture new applications opportunities for our products (for instance, sodium bicarbonate used for flue gas treatment or rare earths for permanent magnets applications) in fast-growing end markets.\n- \u00b7 Introduction of sustainable offers to differentiate from competitor's products (for instance, investment in rice husk-derived Silica or in biobased solvents).\n- \u00b7 Adaptation of our operations to new energy and CO 2 markets leveraging third parties to reduce cost and optimize investment efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Systematic and formal analysis of markets and marketing challenges with respect to investments and innovation project ramp-ups.\n- \u00b7 Rigorous allocation of our capex and strong focus on cash generation.\n- \u00b7 Adjustment of our production capacity to adapt to market demand and balance offer when needed (for instance, reduction of production capacity of soda ash in Torrelavega).",

Risk description\n\nThere are several risks related to raw materials, energy, materials and equipment for construction and maintenance, suppliers, production, storage units, and inbound and outbound transportation. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Inability of suppliers to deliver contracted volumes or capacities in line with required specifications, due to force majeure, for example, or because the supplier has insufficient access to Logistic Service Provider capacities.\n- \u00b7 Insufficient contracting of volumes or capacities, from both a volume and delivery timing perspective, to fulfill our demand.\n- \u00b7 Delayed delivery of volumes or capacities.\n\n## 3.2.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nIn order to ensure manufacturing reliability, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure our production units are distributed across the world.\n- \u00b7 Use Process Safety Management.\n- \u00b7 Define equipment and materials as critical elements to be ordered ahead for projects and maintenance.\n- \u00b7 Organize regular performance reviews with our key suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Establish the Group property loss prevention program, which focuses on the prevention and mitigation of damage to assets and loss of profit due to fire, explosion, accidental chemical release, and other adverse events, like natural catastrophes.\n\nTo mitigate risks in our supply chain we:\n\n- \u00b7 Use third-party corporate social responsibility assessments and ask that our suppliers adhere to the Solvay Supplier Code of Business Integrity.\n- \u00b7 Continuously focus on improving our planning processes to help us anticipate demand, both in terms of volume and timing.\n- \u00b7 Maintain contingency plans for the most critical suppliers.\n\n## 3.2.3. Main developments and results in 2023\n\nWith uncertainty and volatility continuing to prevail, supply chains need to continue their transformation toward additional agility using end-to-end process revision and the implementation of new tools.\n\nBased on our experience in 2022, we have tested several options which would give us increased flexibility in sourcing, providing us with opportunities should risk materialize. Our inventory management has also improved toward a more segmented approach better visibility with better end-to-end alignment. Additional efforts are planned in 2024.\n\nMore information can be found in the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 3.4. Supply Chain and Procurement.\n\n## 3.3.  Financial risk\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM\n\n## 3.3.1. Risk description\n\nWe face various different types of financial risk. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk (see note F32 in the consolidated financial statements : Financial instruments and financial risk management).\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange risk (see note F32 in the consolidated financial statements: Financial instruments and financial risk management).\n- \u00b7 Interest-rate risk (see note F32 in the consolidated financial statements: Financial instruments and financial risk management).\n- \u00b7 Counterparty risk (see note F32 in the consolidated financial statements: Financial instruments and financial risk management).\n- \u00b7 Pension obligation risk (see note F30 in the consolidated financial statements: Employee benefits).\n- \u00b7 Tax litigation risk (see note F31 in the consolidated financial statements: Provisions).\n\n## 3.3.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n## A prudent financial profile and conservative financial discipline\n\nInvestment grade status: BBB-/A3 (stable outlook) by Standard & Poor's as of the Partial Demerger that occurred on December 11, 2023. Before completion of the Partial Demerger, Solvay's rating by Standard & Poor's was BBB/A-2. While Solvay's long-term senior debt has been assigned an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's, no assurance can be given that Solvay will be able to receive or maintain such a rating. A decrease in the ratings assigned to Solvay by a rating agency may negatively impact Solvay's access to the debt markets and increase its cost of borrowing.\n\nSolvay promotes transparency of information and engages in regular discussions with credit rating agencies.",

The company has an unconditional right to extend two times the maturity by 6 months, until October 2025. The Group has access to a Belgium Treasury Bill program for \u20ac1 billion, unused at the end of 2023.\n\n## Currency hedging policy\n\nSolvay monitors the foreign exchange market closely and takes hedging measures to:\n\n- \u00b7 Limit the fluctuation of the Group's forecasted gross margin caused by currency volatility for material exposures.\n- \u00b7 Mitigate the foreign exchange transactional risk at Group level by limiting the profit and loss (P&L) impact of rate fluctuations between the time of invoicing and the time of cash settlement.\n\n## Interest rate hedging policy\n\nThe Group locks in the majority of its net indebtedness at fixed interest rates. Solvay monitors the interest rate market closely and enters into derivative instruments (interest rate swaps and zero cost collars) whenever they are deemed appropriate.\n\n## Energy and CO 2 hedging policy\n\nSolvay hedges energy prices - gas and electricity - based on the net exposure of our sales not indexed on energy prices. This policy includes multiyear hedging transactions. The Group net exposure to carbon pricing is managed through hedging transactions spanning the time horizon of the European Union Emissions Trading Systems.\n\n## Monitoring of Group counterparties' ratings\n\nFor our treasury activities, Solvay works with banking institutions of high creditworthiness (investment grade, selected based on major rating systems) and minimizes the concentration of risk by limiting our exposure to each of these banks to a predefined threshold. We regularly monitor trends in credit default swaps to assess changes in bank creditworthiness and take rapid action if required.\n\nFor our commercial activities, Solvay's external customer risk and cash collection is monitored by a professional network of credit managers and cash collectors located in the Group's various operating regions and countries. Their controls are supported by a set of detailed procedures and managed through Corporate and GBU Credit Committees. These loss mitigation measures have led, over the past few years, to a record low rate of customer defaults.\n\n## Pension governance and pension plan optimization\n\nWith regard to pension governance, Solvay engages proactively and constructively with trustees and stakeholders to ensure that funding, liability management, and investment policies are appropriate, in line with best practices and in full compliance with domestic regulatory expectations and laws.\n\nIn terms of pension plan optimization, we reduce the Group's exposure to defined benefit plans by either converting existing plans into pension plans with a lower risk profile for future services or closing them to new entrants.\n\nFor each of the main Group pension plans, which represent about 90% of the Group's gross or net pension obligations, Asset Liability Management (ALM) analyses are performed at least once every three years to identify and manage corresponding risks.\n\n## Control processes for tax regulation compliance and transfer pricing policies\n\nOur control processes for tax regulation compliance involve monitoring procedures and systems, which we carry out through internal reviews and audits performed by reputable external consultants.\n\nOur transfer pricing policies, procedures, and controls are aimed at meeting the requirements of the authorities.\n\nSolvay's Tax Department pays close attention to the correct interpretation and application of new tax rules. This ensures compliance with applicable rules and regulations and avoids tax and future litigation risks.\n\n## 3.3.3. Main actions in 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Successful liability management exercise before completion of the Partial Demerger to implement the target, post-spin-off capital structure of Solvay and Syensqo.\n- \u00b7 Set up of new liquidity reserves following the execution of the Partial Demerger.\n- \u00b7 Further contribution in the Solvay UK pension funds of \u20ac11 million in Q2 and a contribution in France of \u20ac18 million in Q4 in the AXA pension fund for Rhodia Chimie.\n- \u00b7 Compliance for IBOR-transition rates to risk-free rates and adjustments of financial documentation.",

        "page_content": "## Litigation section\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nAs a result of the diverse nature of its activities, and the geographic footprint of its operations, the Solvay Group is exposed to legal risks, particularly in the areas of product liability, contractual relations, antitrust laws, patent disputes, tax assessments and health, safety and environment (HSE) matters.\n\nIn this context, litigation is a normal recurring feature of the Solvay Group's operating businesses, both to protect against claims, some of which we believe to be without merit, and to defend the rights and interests of the Solvay Group.\n\nOngoing legal proceedings involving the Solvay Group that are currently considered to potentially involve significant risks are outlined below. The legal proceedings described below do not constitute an exhaustive list.\n\nThe proceedings summarized below represent the material matters pending against Solvay or its subsidiaries regardless of the merits of the claims and the strengths of Solvay's defenses. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any proceeding described below; the Solvay Group will continue to vigorously defend itself based on the merits of its defenses while opportunistically seeking consensual resolution in appropriate cases.\n\nFor certain cases, we have created reserves or provisions in accordance with appropriate accounting rules and policies, to cover financial risk and defense costs. Please refer to Notes F8, 'Discontinued Operations', F31 'Provisions' and F36 'Contingent Assets, Liabilities and Financial Guarantees' to Solvay's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding such reserves or provisions. In doing so, we do not ordinarily disclose the extent to which provisions are made in relation to individual proceedings, because to do so would be prejudicial to Solvay's interests. In addition, we maximize all available insurance coverage. Adverse outcomes of material contested matters, individually or in the aggregate, could exceed the amounts of applicable provisions or insurance coverage, and could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and earnings of the Group.\n\n## ANTITRUST PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn Brazil, CADE (the Brazilian antitrust authority) levied fines against subsidiaries of Solvay and other third parties in May 2012, relating to hydrogen peroxide activities, and in May 2016, relating to sodium perborate activities. Solvay's aggregate share of these fines amounts to \u20ac29.6 million and \u20ac3.99 million respectively. We have since brought a lawsuit before the Brazilian Federal Court to contest these administrative fines.\n\n## HSE-RELATED PROCEEDINGS\n\n- \u00b7 Asbestos Cases: Twenty-nine civil proceedings have been brought before Italian courts by past workers and relatives of deceased workers at Solvay sites seeking damages, currently estimated at approximately \u20ac32 million, in relation to diseases allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos. Thirteen proceedings are still pending before courts of first instance, Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) whilst the remaining 16 proceedings definitively ended as a result of dismissals, court settlements, and condemnations to pay damages.\n- \u00b7 Rosignano site: The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of Livorno, Italy initiated preliminary criminal investigations in 2019 regarding the alleged contamination of certain water tables outside our site and in our former landfill of Rosignano, Italy site. These investigations are still ongoing.\n\n## BULGARIA\n\nIn Bulgaria, Solvay Sodi AD, a subsidiary of Solvay, is subject to certain state-imposed obligations for emergency oil stocks (reserves) for 2021 through 2023, for which it was not able to comply. As a result, the competent Bulgarian authority imposed fines for 2021 and 2022 on Solvay Sodi AD of approximately \u20ac15 million for our share of the penalties which were fully provisioned. For 2023, the order is suspended and as a result no fine is imposed and therefore no provision has been recorded.\n\nShould this suspension be lifted, an additional penalty of \u20ac9 million may be imposed on Solvay Sodi AD. Solvay Sodi AD has brought a lawsuit to contest these fines and is seeking relief through national authorities pleading that the existing Bulgarian emergency stocks system is not compatible with the EU law.",

        "page_content": "## PHARMACEUTICAL ACTIVITIES (DISCONTINUED)\n\nThe contractual arrangements for the sale of our pharmaceutical activities in February 2010 established the terms and conditions for the allocation and sharing of liability arising out of activities carried out before the sale. Subject to limited exceptions, Solvay's exposure for indemnification to Abbott for liabilities arising out of sold activities is limited to an aggregate amount of \u20ac500 million, with limited duration. All post-closing indemnification claims made against Solvay have now been resolved except liabilities arising from private civil antitrust claims made against the buyer of the business. Solvay's potential exposure is limited to a possible clawback of up to the \u20ac300 million received by Solvay as an additional purchase price based on post-closing ANDROGEL\u00ae sales.\n\n## SPECIALTY BUSINESSES TRANSFERRED TO SYENSQO AS PART OF THE PARTIAL DEMERGER (DISCONTINUED)\n\nOn December 8, 2023, the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of the Company and Syensqo SA/NV ('Syensqo') approved the partial demerger of the Company whereby the shares and other interests the Company held in the legal entities operating the so-called 'Specialty Businesses', its rights and obligations under the agreements entered into with those legal entities, as well as certain other assets and liabilities were transferred to Syensqo (the 'Partial Demerger'), with 99.53 % of positive votes. The Partial Demerger was completed on December 9, 2023.\n\nWith effect from December 9, 2023, as a result of the Partial Demerger, Syensqo owns certain legal entities which were involved in ongoing proceedings prior to the Partial Demerger. Accordingly, as part of the deconsolidation of the Specialty businesses of Solvay (including the legal entities transferred to Syensqo as part of the Partial Demerger) as from December 9, 2023, the provisions booked in Solvay's consolidated financial statements, prior to completion of the Partial Demerger, in respect of proceedings involving legal entities transferred to Syensqo are no longer reflected in Solvay's consolidated financial statements. For additional information, please refer to Section 1 of the consolidated financial statements and Notes F8, 'Discontinued Operations' and F40 'List of Companies included in the Consolidation Scope' for the year ended December 31, 2023.  Proceedings involving legal entities transferred to Syensqo included, in particular, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 US PFAS-related proceedings, including West Deptford site: Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC (Specialty Polymers), a former subsidiary of Solvay transferred to Syensqo as part of the Partial Demerger, owns and operates the West Deptford, New Jersey site. In 2023, Specialty Polymers was a defendant in 36 separate lawsuits in the United States relating to such subsidiary's alleged use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Of these 36 cases, 15 reached resolution in 2023 and are expected to be dismissed in 2024, including the litigation filed by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP). On June 28, 2023, Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC and the NJDEP announced they reached a settlement resolving certain PFAS-related claims in New Jersey. As a result of this settlement, Solvay increased its existing provision by around $250 million as of June 30, 2023, with $175 million cash out in 2024 and the balance over a 30-year period. This additional provision was included within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2023. [As noted above, as a result of the deconsolidation of the Specialty businesses of Solvay as from December 9, 2023, the amounts provisioned in respect of the abovementioned PFAS-related proceedings are no longer reflected in Solvay's consolidated financial statements.]\n- \u00b7 Edison-related proceedings: Syensqo received compensation of \u20ac91.6 million after decisions by the International Chamber of Commerce, Commerce's Arbitration Court, the Swiss Supreme Court, and the Milan Court of Appeal, all of which ruled in favor of Solvay Specialty Polymers Italy S.p.A. The compensation relates to losses, damages and costs incurred up to the end of 2016 in relation to certain environmental issues at the Spinetta Marengo and Bussi sites, previously owned and operated by (Mont)Edison S.p.A. and Ausimont S.p.A. The compensation received in 2023 was included within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement.",

BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## 2.1.  Reporting frameworks\n\nThe main reporting frameworks used to prepare the Annual Integrated Report are:\n\n- \u00b7 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): The GRI standards are the main reference for Solvay's sustainability reporting; the latest edition of the standards is used, including the new GRI-1 and GRI-2 universal standards.\n- \u00b7 2014/95/EU: Solvay uses the GRI Standards to comply with Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information. The Directive was transposed into Belgian law in September 2017.\n- \u00b7 EU Taxonomy: A first estimate of eligible activities as defined by the EU Taxonomy in the delegated act of April 2021 is presented in 7.3. EU Taxonomy.\n- \u00b7 United Nations Global Compact: The information provided serves as a progress report on implementation of the United Nations Global Compact's 10 principles.\n- \u00b7 Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Solvay reports on our alignment with the 11 recommendations of the TCFD.\n- \u00b7 Responsible Care \u00ae : Solvay is a signatory to the International Council of Chemical Associations' (ICCA) Responsible Care Global Charter \u00ae .\n- \u00b7 Integrated Reporting Framework: Solvay adheres to the principles and content elements of Integrated Reporting, as described in the 'International Framework' published by the IFRS Foundation.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB): Solvay aligns our materiality analysis with the SASB approach to prepare the SASB Materiality Map\u2122. For more details, see the Materiality Analysis section of this chapter.\n- \u00b7 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Solvay has identified the nine Sustainable Development Goals on which it can have the most impact, through its operations or across the value chain, in line with the materiality analysis.\n- \u00b7 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD): Solvay's report aligns with the WBCSD ESG Disclosure Handbook guidance in terms of process and content selection.\n\nSolvay also monitors developments in the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), included in the new European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, as well as the IFRS Sustainability Standards.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.  Reporting scope and boundaries\n\n## GRI DIsclosuRes 2-2 2-3 2-4 2-7\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the environmental and social reporting boundaries are consistent with the financial reporting scope and boundaries, as described in the 'List of companies included in the consolidation scope' in the financial statements. In other words, in line with the approach described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, sustainability indicators consolidation include fully consolidated companies (subsidiaries), and companies that qualify as joint-operations. Apart from exceptions listed below, joint operations are consolidated in line with the Group contractual share of the joint operations' assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, which is generally aligned with the ownership interest in the joint operations. Companies consolidated by applying the equity method of accounting (joint-ventures and associates) are excluded from the environmental and social reporting boundaries.\n\nMore specifically, indicators linked to operations (greenhouse gas emissions, energy, air, water, waste, and critical incident risk management) are covering only production and research and innovation sites on which Solvay has operational control or exercises joint control that qualify as joint operation.\n\nAs an exception to the above rules, air, water, and waste indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 for Zhenjiang company (fully integrated in Syensqo but in which Solvay has a minority share), have been split based on actual emissions by Syensqo and Solvay workshops; and\n- \u00b7 for Devnya, Bulgaria, have been consolidated at 75%.\n\nEmployee health and safety indicators encompass all sites on which Solvay has operational control, regardless of the site's company consolidation method. The data is calculated on a monthly basis.\n\nCritical incident risk management indicators encompass all industrial functions and sites at which Solvay has operational control, regardless of the site's company consolidation method. The data is calculated on a monthly basis.\n\nThe other Better Life social indicators include all Solvay employees (regardless of the employee's company consolidation method) who have an employment contract with Solvay and are classified as active, as they have a position in the organizational chart on December 31, 2023.\n\nEmployee health & safety indicators encompass all sites on which Solvay has operational control, regardless of the site's company consolidation method.\n\nThe other Better Life social indicators include all Solvay employees (regardless of the employee's company consolidation method) who have an employment contract with Solvay and are classified as active, as they have a position in the organizational chart.\n\nCollective agreements cover all Solvay employees in companies in which Solvay has a majority stake.\n\nSolvay uses the 'rolling base year' approach described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate target achievements.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, past years have not been restated for extra-financial indicators, with the major exception of Solvay-Syensqo impact, where 2022 and 2023 data have been split with Solvay scope and boundaries. Other exceptions are documented in the KPI section.\n\nBefore the December 2023 spin-off, Solvay Group was including Syensqo perimeter. Therefore, indicators related to the pre spin-off period have been split between Syensqo and the remaining Solvay Group, based on the following simplified approach inspired by the approach used for the combined financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Each business unit was allocated 100% to either Solvay or Syensqo.\n- \u00b7 Corporate and shared Research and Innovation services were allocated 100% to Syensqo (except for the Paulinia site, allocated to Solvay).\n- \u00b7 Digital Technology Function and Shared Business Services were allocated 100% to Solvay (those Solvay teams are engaged in the Transition Service Agreement with Syensqo).\n- \u00b7 The remainder (mainly Corporate and Business Services perimeter not covered above, or elements that were not tracked by business units) was allocated 39.55% to Solvay and 60.45% to Syensqo. This allocation rule was also applied for Citizen Days participation (participation to Citizen Days is in 6.6. Corporate Citizenship).\n\nThose rules may cause a rounding error on indicators without decimals (for instance the Speak Up program, or number of accidents). The actual indicator before the split may differ by one unit from the consolidation of Solvay and Syensqo split indicators.\n\nThere is an exception to the above rules for sites shared between Solvay and Syensqo. In 2023, both Tavaux and Zhenjiang plants are allocated fully to Syensqo, except for air, water, waste, process safety, speak-up claims, and employee health and safety indicators, which are split based on actual workshops allocation.\n\nAdministrative sites that are part of greenhouse gas emissions and energy reportings are split as follows: Watford site and Brussels campus in Neder-Over-Heembeek are included in Solvay perimeter; while Aubervilliers, St-Fons Research and Innovation center, Bristol, and Butte sites are allocated to Syensqo.",

Materiality analysis process\n\nSolvay's Sustainable Development Function coordinates materiality analysis with an internal network of Sustainability Champions in the Global Business Units and Functions. Experts in each Corporate Function review the analysis of each aspect, paying particular attention to ensuring consistency with the Group's risk analysis. These assessments are then reviewed and validated by the relevant business leadership teams, which is a critical step in ensuring that business priorities and decisions reflect sustainability matters appropriately.\n\n| Identification of aspects                                | Use of the SASB list of sustainability-related risks and opportunities as presented on the SASB Standards website.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prioritization of aspects                                | \u00b7 Use of the SASB Materiality Map prioritization criteria: - Demonstration of interest, for Solvay and/or for Solvay stakeholders, including evidence of potential impacts. - Demonstration of financial impact, actual or potential: sales, profit, return or risk profile. - Forward-looking adjustment. \u00b7 The network of Sustainability Champions and internal experts for each high materiality aspect was involved in the  prioritization analysis. \u00b7 In addition to the SASB prioritization criteria, an additional focus on external impacts has been included in the assess- ment since the publication of Solvay's Purpose in 2019.

This led to an increased focus on potential impacts (economic, social, and environmental) in addition to existing impacts.\n- \u00b7 Stricter alignment to the 'SASB list of sustainability-related risks and opportunities' as presented on the SASB Standards website.\n- \u00b7 Preliminary assessment focusing on the new Solvay scope of activities on the basis of our perception of impact severity.\n\nThe following corrections have been made compared to the 2022 materiality table:\n\n- \u00b7 'Data security' has been identified as material, as it is part of one of Solvay's main risks (security - physical and information).\n- \u00b7 'Physical impacts of climate change' has been identified as material, as it is part of one of Solvay's main risks (climate change).\n- \u00b7 'Product quality and safety' has been identified as material, as it is part of one of Solvay's main risks (products and regulated market risks).\n- \u00b7 ' Customer Welfare' was considered not material, as the elements covered under this SASB topic are already covered under 'Product quality and safety' for a chemical company.\n\nThe analysis was carried out by Solvay's Sustainable Development team, involving in-house experts of each topic. It is considered a preliminary analysis, as stakeholders have not been engaged yet. The analysis was presented to Solvay's Executive Leadership team in September 2023.\n\n## 2.3.4. Why is it material?\n\nThe tables below summarize Solvay's assessment of high materiality aspects for each category. The corresponding United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are used to describe what impacts are considered, where they may occur, and how they may be caused.

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure\n\nThe Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) developed voluntary, consistent, climate-related financial risk disclosures, which can be used by companies to provide information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Task Force structured its recommendations around four themes that represent key aspects of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nThis section addresses the disclosures, with links to the relevant sections of the Annual Integrated Report, and provides a self-assessment of Solvay's level of alignment with the TCFD recommendations.",

Solvay will also not build new coal-powered plants and has committed to coal phase- out in energy production by 2030 wherever renewable alternatives exist. Solvay has  also set a 2030 target to reduce by 20% Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from its   Focus 5 categories both upstream and downstream in the value chain.

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n\nIn 2015, the United Nations established a set of goals to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Each of these 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include specific targets to be achieved by 2030. Achieving the SDGs requires efforts by governments, the private sector, civil society, communities, and individuals.\n\nNine leading chemical companies, including Solvay, and two industry associations formed a working group dedicated to the SDGs, convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). This working group took a leadership role in piloting and refining the three-step framework described in the WBCSD's SDG Sector Roadmap Guidelines.\n\nAs part of this exercise, Solvay identified the Sustainable Development Goals on which we could have a material impact, positive or negative. We then integrated these sustainable development goals into our materiality analysis as the official agenda of the 'Planet' (Governments and NGOs) stakeholder group.\n\nThis preliminary list was reviewed in 2019, within the context of the Solvay One Planet sustainability ambition, with an increasing focus on the impact of products and operations.\n\nSolvay's main areas of impact can be grouped into three categories: climate, nature, and better life. The corresponding list of SDGs on which Solvay can have the most impact, positive or negative, through our operations and the products we sell, is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate, which includes the Group's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, but also products that may impact customers' energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions:\n- -SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy\n- -SDG 13: Climate action\n- \u00b7 Nature, which includes the Group's raw material consumption, water consumption, effluents, emissions and waste generation, management of hazardous materials, and other emissions or effluents that put pressure on biodiversity:\n- -SDG 14: Life below water\n- -SDG 15: Life on land\n- \u00b7 Better life, which includes the Group's management of people, process and product safety, social dialogue initiatives, and potential social impacts of our product portfolio:\n- -SDG 3: Good health and well-being\n- -SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation\n- -SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth\n- -SDG 17: Partnership for the goals\n- \u00b7 Sustainable portfolio, which includes products' life cycles and end-of-life management social impacts of our product portfolio:\n- -SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production",

Definition\n\nOne Planet is our roadmap for a sustainable future that provides shared value for all. Solvay has always been best-in-class regarding its ESG initiatives and ESG will remain at the core of our business. We remain committed to the actions we started since we launched ONE Planet in 2019, tailored to the remaining business of the new Solvay.\n\nOne Planet is sorted per impact category, namely climate, nature, and better life, and for each category we describe:\n\n- \u00b7 What we are talking about, why it is important, and the main legislation, where relevant.\n- \u00b7 What we want to achieve: Internal definitions which are relevant for the category, our footprint, our actions and ambitions, and key contacts.\n\n## 3.1.2. Management approach\n\nAn effective governance is in place at different levels and covers the three pillars: Climate, Nature and Better life. It involves integrating environmental, social, and governance factors into decision-making processes, ensuring accountability, transparency, and ethical behavior throughout the organization. To do so, we have set up three steering committees including members of the ELT, governing each pillar of our ESG strategy: Climate Steering Committee, Nature Steering Committee, and Better Life Steering Committee.\n\nOn top we have the Ethics and Compliance Board and the Safety monthly review by the ELT. We further describe their respective governance in \u00a73.2.2. and \u00a73.3.2.\n\nOur ELT chaired by our CEO, defines the ESG orientations and sets sustainability targets for the Group. Additionally, it oversees annual reporting and disclosures as well as the company culture and values.\n\nBeing strategic for the Group we have set up at the Supervisory Board level an ESG Committee. The ESG Committee considers the material ESG issues relevant to the group's business activities; provides guidance and recommendations to the board, including in the context of the implementation and potential review of 'One Planet' sustainability strategy and the Group's non-financial reporting; and ensures the implementation of the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), when applicable . The ESG Committee meets three times a year.\n\nThe management approach and metrics have been deployed in all entities of the Group. Each Global Business Unit (GBU) president is accountable for the progress of One Planet in their business, and delegates the coordination of the roadmap to a senior executive in their leadership team.\n\nA network of Sustainability Champions and correspondents ensures that the Guide is deployed in all Solvay sites, GBUs, and Corporate Functions. They inform their entity about any changes to the strategy and objectives, ensure necessary training is organized, and develop an annual and multiyear roadmap to meet final objectives. They are then responsible for implementing the roadmap in their entity, though the leaders of every entity take full ultimate responsibility for performance, also taking into account that progress relative to targets impacts the variable remuneration of all senior staff in the entity.\n\nDefinitions, management approach, indicators and targets, and main actions specific to each topic are described in the corresponding sections of the Extra-financial statements. The management approach is adjusted each year based on the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 feedback from employees, suppliers, and customers;\n- \u00b7 knowledge gained from performance and progress in relation to strategic commitments;\n- \u00b7 challenges orchestrated by the Executive Leadership Team, facilitated by the Sustainable Development Function, taking into account changes in the marketplace and higher expectations from Solvay executives;\n- \u00b7 the evolution of frameworks and reporting standards, such as GRI Standards;\n- \u00b7 the auditors' report on high materiality aspects;\n- \u00b7 feedback from practitioners;\n- \u00b7 feedback from sustainability rating agencies; and\n- \u00b7 feedback received on the Annual Integrated Report, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's 'Reporting Matters' yearly analysis.",

Indicators and targets\n\nPerformance is monitored through a dashboard with the results of One Planet for the entire group.\n\n- \u00b7 We look to be leading when it comes to climate, with bold commitments. We aim at:\n- -carbon neutrality (Scope 1 & 2) by 2050;\n- -reducing Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 30% by 2030 and Scope 3 by 20% by 2030 (Focus 5 categories); and\n- -phasing out coal by 2030 when renewable alternatives are possible.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, since the creation of Solvay, we have pioneered social welfare. We aim to remain outstanding on better life with:\n- -zero accidents;\n- -gender balance in top and mid management within 10 years; and\n- -a living wage to 100% of the workforce by 2026.\n\n## 3.2.  Management of the legal, ethics, and regulatory framework\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-26 2-27 3-3 205-2 205-3 406-1 412-1 412-2 415-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH\n\nManagement of the legal, ethics, and regulatory framework encompasses business ethics, namely human rights, anti-corruption, non-discrimination, and anti-competitive behavior.\n\n## 3.2.1. Commitments and policies\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity\n\nSolvay's Code of Business Integrity and the policies and procedures adopted to enhance good governance apply to all employees wherever they are located. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 third parties are expected to act within the framework of the Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 all core suppliers must confirm that they adhere to the principles set out in the Solvay Supplier Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 majority-owned joint-ventures are held to the Solvay Code of Business Integrity, or to a separate code adopted based on similar principles;\n- \u00b7 Solvay's Code of Business Integrity and Solvay's Supplier Code of Business Integrity are available on Solvay's website; and data security.\n\n## Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Policy on Gifts and Entertainment\n\nSolvay's Code of Business Integrity expressly states that the Group prohibits bribery in any form. Solvay and our employees do not use gifts or entertainment to gain competitive advantage. Facilitation payments are not permitted by Solvay and disguising gifts or entertainment as charitable donations is also a violation of the Code of Business Integrity.\n\nThe Code is supported by more detailed policies. At the end of 2020, Solvay split its Gifts, Entertainment, and Anti-Bribery Policy into two separate policies: an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and a Policy on Gifts, Entertainment, Charitable Donations, and Sponsorship.\n\nThe Group employs an internal tracking system to record gifts and entertainment that exceed the acceptable reasonable value as indicated in the Policy, as well as charitable donations and sponsorship with charitable purpose, and requires managerial approval for accepting or giving them. Ethics and Compliance Department analysis and prior approval is also required when the gift or entertainment is to be offered to a Government Official, as well as for charitable donations exceeding a defined threshold, ensuring adherence to the policy and compliance with the law. The use of the Gift and Entertainment Tracking System (GETS) is part of Solvay's Internal Audit review process.\n\nSolvay is also a member of Transparency International Belgium.\n\n## Human Rights in Business Policy\n\nSolvay's Human Rights in Business Policy, published on our website, sets out Solvay's commitment to respecting human rights and acting with due diligence to avoid any infringement of human rights or any adverse impact on or abuses of such rights. The policy emphasizes Solvay's commitments to our stakeholders, namely our employees and business partners, the communities and environment in which we operate, and children. Solvay's policies on human rights are under review to ensure it is reflecting Solvay's commitment to the evolving regulatory standards.\n\n## Human rights due diligence and risk assessment\n\nHuman rights risks at Solvay sites are assessed with a main focus on our business partners, namely suppliers and contractors identified according to the risk associated with the country they operate in.",

        "page_content": "To assess human rights risks and impacts across our upstream value chains, Solvay developed an ESG risk management approach for our supply chain. This provides a systematic approach for identifying risks and assessing their severity in more than 60 upstream value chains. Using the results of this exercise, Solvay has subscribed to a third-party risk management platform for adverse media screening in order to monitor and identify risks and impacts related to different matters such as modern slavery and human rights (including forced labor and child labor); anti-bribery and corruption; and environmental, social, and governance. This provides transparency through its value chain, enabling Solvay to develop risks mitigation action and remediation plans.\n\nIn addition, the Internal Audit team gathers assessments to determine if the site has established policies and processes for addressing impacts on value chain workers. This includes evaluating engagement, decision-making, remediation of negative impacts, and the presence of channels for worker concerns. The assessment also covers planned actions and the percentage of suppliers committed to the Supplier Code of Business Integrity.\n\n## Competition Law Policy\n\nSolvay's goal is to conduct business ethically and not to enter into any business arrangements that eliminate or distort competition. Solvay develops and maintains a culture of compliance to keep the company and our people on the right side of the law. Solvay has a formal Competition Law Policy that stresses the importance of strict adherence to all competition laws. It has been approved by Solvay's Executive Committee and is published on Solvay's intranet, to which all our employees have access. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, subject to, and in conformity with, applicable laws.\n\n## Implementation of the Competition Law Policy\n\nSolvay has put in place a Competition Law Compliance Program that has a zero-tolerance approach to competition law infringements. As part of our Competition Law Compliance Program, we provide a competition law toolkit on the Solvay intranet that includes up-to-date guidelines on specific areas of competition law, including guidance on dealing with competitors, dawn raids, information exchange on mergers and acquisitions transactions, swaps, price announcements, and vertical relationships.\n\nTo minimize cartel risks, Solvay has put in place a computer-based system that tracks all contacts relevant employees have with competitors through a procedure based on managerial approval.\n\n## 3.2.2. Resources and responsibilities\n\nSolvay set up a compliance organization to reinforce a group-wide culture based on ethics and compliance. The Ethics and Compliance Department operates under the leadership of the Group General Counsel and Corporate Secretary General. It consists of Regional Compliance Officers who are located in the regions in which the Group operates, reporting to the Chief Compliance Officer. This department is responsible for fostering Solvay's culture of integrity, overseeing the implementation of Solvay's Ethics and Compliance Program, providing guidance and advice to the Group leadership and operations, and investigating, either alone or with the assistance of other departments, all reports that are brought to its attention. The Chief Compliance Officer chairs the Business Ethics Board and reports annually to the Audit Committee of Solvay's Board of Directors on general ethics and compliance matters and on trends and data related to the Speak Up Program in accordance with confidentiality standards.\n\nSolvay has a dedicated team of legal experts for competition law within the General Counsel Function. They are responsible for implementing the Competition Law Compliance Program and are in charge of providing competition law advice and guidance, as well as deploying effective and regular communication and training on subjects related to competition law.\n\n## 3.2.3. Grievance mechanisms\n\nEmployees have various internal channels through which they are encouraged to report suspected violations or concerns. These include line management, Ethics and Compliance, the General Counsel Function, Internal Audit, Human Resources, and employees' representatives.\n\nA group-wide Speak Up program is in place and overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. An external, third-party helpline, active 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, allows employees to ask questions, raise concerns, or file reports. The helpline is open to internal and external parties, available in 19 languages covering Solvay's locations. The helpline can be found in the Ethics and Compliance section of Solvay's website.\n\nThe following table shows the types of reports made from January to December 2023 through Solvay's Speak Up program.",

This rounding caused negligible distortions between totals and breakdowns in below tables.\n\nReports in process respective to functions not allocated between Solvay and Syensqo were not split according to the distribution key for Speak Up program reports of paragraph 2.2 (\"Reporting scope and boundaries\"), but attributed to the company actually managing the report after the separation.\n\n| Number of reports                                                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Misconduct or inappropriate behavior                                                | 16     | 12     |\n| Discrimination                                                                      | 3      | 2      |\n| Harassment including retaliation                                                    | 12     | 6      |\n| Previously: Discrimination including harassment and retaliation                     |        |        |\n| Conflict of interest                                                                | 5      | 6      |\n| Computer, email, internet use, and social media                                     | 1      | 2      |\n| Previously: Computer, email, internet                                               |        |        |\n| Environmental, health, or safety                                                    | 1      | 2      |\n| Previously: Environmental, health, or safety law                                    |        |        |\n| Accounting, auditing matters, finance and banking                                   | 3      | 2      |\n| Previously: Auditing matters, financial records and banking, accounting or auditing |        |        |\n| Bribery/Corruption                                                                  | 2      | 1      |\n| Antitrust/Competition                                                               | 1      | 0      |\n| Previously: Anti-bribery                                                            |        |        |\n| Confidentiality and misappropriation                                                | 0      | 4      |\n| Previously: Confidentiality/Misappropriation                                        |        |        |\n| Data privacy                                                                        | 2      | 2      |\n| International trade/Trade compliance                                                | 1      | 0      |\n| Previously: International trade compliance                                          |        |        |\n| Substance abuse                                                                     | 0      | 2      |\n| Embezzlement, theft, robbery                                                        | 1      | 0      |\n| Previously: Theft                                                                   |        |        |\n| Violence or threat                                                                  | 0      | 0      |\n| HR matters                                                                          | 10     | 10     |\n| Diversity, equity, and inclusion                                                    | 5      | 5      |\n| Human rights violations                                                             | 1      | 0      |\n| New category: Fraud                                                                 | 1      | 0      |\n| Other                                                                               | 4      | 3      |\n| Total                                                                               | 69     | 59     |\n\nThrough the Speak Up program, any concerns relating to a breach are followed-up on and investigated as appropriate by Ethics and Compliance. In keeping with our commitment to transparency, the Ethics Helpline is used to report progress on investigations and give feedback to those concerned as appropriate. The Ethics Helpline is easily accessible through Solvay's website, a toll free number, or a QR-Code, and is available to employees and third parties.\n\nWe continued increasing awareness about speaking up and raising concerns without fear of retaliation when people notice a potential breach of our Code of Business Integrity. Speak Up was also part of the annual mandatory training for all our employees, in order to raise awareness that speaking up applies to the full spectrum of topics referenced in the Code of Business Integrity. This led to a continuous increase in reported incidents, as reflected in the overview, improving our ability to detect, identify, and address breaches. The increase in reported incidents does not imply that there were more incidents or issues in 2023 than before, but shows that employees report concerns or potential breaches, enabling Ethics and Compliance to investigate and address them. A new topic, Fraud, was added to our Ethics Helpline.",

Communication and training\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity\n\nMandatory Code of Business Integrity training, both in person and web-based, is organized for all employees to ensure a strong culture of integrity at Solvay, to understand and address behavioral risks, such as bribery and corruption, conflict of interest, and harassment. As part of this training, employees are also trained on the Speak Up culture and Ethics Helpline. Specific training modules are tailored to the leadership, including Listening Up. In the period 2022-2023, 99.6% of the target population was trained on the Code of Business Integrity, which is available in 18 languages. To complete the training, employees must certify that they are in compliance with the Code of Business Integrity, understand their role in protecting a culture of integrity, and can report any violations to the available channels and Ethics Helpline. Internal Audit regularly reviews the implementation and completion rate of training modules as part of their audit engagements.\n\n## Competition law and antitrust\n\nSolvay has a concrete Competition Law Compliance Action Plan, designed to mitigate the specific risks the Group has identified in this field of law. It has been in force since 2003 and is updated yearly. In 2023, it covered e-learnings on competition law in general, on competitive intelligence gathering, and on the use of the above-mentioned computerized tracking system of meetings with competitors. We also organized ad hoc training for specific high-risk target population. The participation rate of the relevant training campaign in 2023 was above 95%.\n\n## Anti-bribery and anti-corruption\n\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption web-based training is carried out on a two-year cycle for a pre-identified target population, which includes all employees grade S15 and above. The most recent online training course, available in 16 languages, took place in 2023; 98.68% of the target population was trained. The training will be rolled out again in 2025.",

        "page_content": "## Public policy\n\nSolvay pursues a constructive dialogue with governmental and political stakeholders, both to ensure and improve our license to operate and as part of our commitment to developing sustainable solutions with partners. This exchange helps us to understand societal trends and anticipate legislative and regulatory expectations and developments as well as to advocate for and communicate our views in support of Solvay's interests. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting sustainable solutions to act on climate change and facilitate the energy transition: Solvay supports the UN Paris Climate Agreement and contributes to implementing it. We therefore argue for the development of a clear and predictable legislative framework that promotes sustainable growth while maintaining industry competitiveness and ensuring a balanced transition to a low-carbon economy.\n- \u00b7 Competitiveness: Solvay advocates for a regulatory system that fosters entrepreneurship and industrial innovation by safeguarding or improving competitiveness, and that creates highly skilled jobs worldwide.\n- \u00b7 Environmental and chemical policy: Solvay collaborates with trade associations, public authorities, and other stakeholders to develop science- and risk-based regulations and standards that promote a more sustainable industry and products.\n- \u00b7 Promoting global trade: As an international company, Solvay recognizes the importance of free trade based on a multilateral and rules-based trading system. Reducing trade barriers is essential for economic growth and thus for industrial activity.\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical assessment: Solvay assesses the geopolitical situation in order to better understand the potential impact, in relation to trade, logistics, investments and security, on our businesses.\n\nSolvay's Government Affairs and Country Management Function is responsible for coordinating our relations with government and political officials. In line with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, and with the aim of ensuring the best possible business environment, the Government Affairs and Country Management team works to foster long-term partnerships with public authorities and other relevant stakeholders. They do this by building a transparent and constructive dialogue that supports company strategy.\n\nIn our relations with government officials, we commit ourselves to responsible, honest, and transparent action based on our values and principles. We are committed to ensuring that our dialogue and advocacy complies with our Code of Business Integrity and the rules and principles set out in our policies. Employees involved in relations with government officials have to take mandatory training on business integrity, competition law, and antitrust and anti-corruption. In addition, we welcome initiatives for greater transparency in the area of interest representation and are listed as a company in the Lobby and Transparency registers of the European Commission, the United States, France, and Germany.\n\nSolvay's public policy activities include participation in industry and trade associations, as outlined in section 3.6. Membership of associations. We aim to conduct political relations and advocacy with our own staff resources, meaning that relevant contacts and meetings between Solvay and political stakeholders are made and held by Solvay representatives in person, and not by agency or partner staff acting on behalf of Solvay.\n\nThe Group does not take part in political party activities, nor do we make corporate donations to political parties or candidates, as indicated in the Group's Policy on Gifts, Entertainment, Charitable Donations, and Sponsorship. We engage in constructive debate with public authorities on subjects of legitimate interest to Solvay, where necessary, but only those employees specifically authorized to do so may carry out such activities.\n\nSolvay respects the freedom of our employees to make their own political decisions. Any personal participation or involvement by an employee in the political process must be done on an individual basis, on the employee's own time, and at the employee's personal expense.\n\n## Ethics and Compliance website\n\nSolvay has implemented and launched in 2023 an Ethics and Compliance section on its website. The pages provide information on Solvay's Ethics and Compliance program, including its four pillars structure and alignment with our Core Beliefs, make the Code of Business Integrity and additional Ethics and Compliance policies available and accessible, and provides information on the Ethics Helpline, as well as the link for employees and externals to access the third-party helpline through which questions, concerns, or reports can be registered.\n\n## 3.2.5. Animal testing\n\nSolvay provides innovative products for a wide variety of uses and a large number of users. The Group must have a proper understanding of the hazards of our products in order to carry out our activities and protect users, the general public, Solvay personnel, and the environment. With society continually pushing for new, better, and safer chemicals and plastics, there is growing demand from both regulatory authorities and the public for product risk and hazard assessments. These require testing, both with and without the use of animals.\n\n## Testing\n\nTo comply with new and existing chemical regulations, or to further consolidate safety data, Solvay commissioned animal tests in 2023. Solvay avoids animal testing whenever possible, but in cases in which animal testing is required we commit to conducting studies that treat animals humanely, giving them the best care possible, and using all animals responsibly, with great regard for their welfare. In compliance with European cosmetic regulations, Solvay does not perform specific testing solely to support cosmetic uses.\n\n## Substance-based testing for multiple applications\n\nSolvay carries out tests required for all regulations and applications relating to a given substance just once. We avoid the need for new studies by actively advocating for the reuse of data from studies conducted within a given framework, such as REACH, for other registration systems.",

All of our studies comply with international standards, such as Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. The AAALAC accreditation is one of our selection criteria for labs performing toxicological studies. For labs performing only ecotoxicological studies (with fish as vertebrates) this is not common . This worldwide organization sets quality standards for testing laboratories and ensures responsible and humane treatment of laboratory animals. Before they start, all studies commissioned by Solvay are subject to an ethical assessment at local or national level by the laboratory conducting the study.\n\nOnce a study is underway, Solvay staff monitor the execution and quality of the studies and maintain a continuous qualification and evaluation program for the laboratories. A dedicated Solvay corporate committee reviewed the animal testing activities commissioned by Solvay during 2023, verifying conformity with the principles and mandatory elements of Solvay's Animal Care and Use Procedure.\n\n## VERTEBRATE ANIMAL TESTS COMMISSIONED BY SOLVAY IN 2023\n\n|                                                                | Number of studies   | Number of vertebrates (*)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Registration obligations (EU, China, Korea, US)                | 10                  | 4,236                       |\n| Additional product safety questions (toxicity, classification) |                     |                             |\n| Total                                                          | 10                  | 4,236                       |\n\n- (*) Includes all animals, including control animals not being exposed to test substances and used as reference.\n\n## Regulatory testing\n\nIn 2023, 100% of the vertebrate animals were used to address mandatory requirements from authorities. In total, 4,236 vertebrate animals (96% rats, 4% rabbits) were used. Solvay did not commission any studies on dogs, cats, pigs, or non-human primates. Most vertebrate animals (95%) were used in tests required by the EU REACH Regulation, although these studies will also be valid for demonstrating compliance with chemical regulations elsewhere in the world. The number of vertebrate animals used in 2023 was at a similar level as previous year with the same scope (without Syensqo).\n\n## Drivers for the future\n\nWhile studies are needed for regulatory and scientific purposes, Solvay continues to strengthen its capabilities and understanding of alternative methodologies that do not involve vertebrate animals. In addition, QSARs and Read-across approaches are applied to avoid new studies on vertebrate animals to be launched.\n\nHowever, the higher tier animal studies requested by authorities, which required the largest number of animals in 2023, will continue to be the major driver for animal tests in the near future. A significantly higher number of these studies is already ongoing and it is therefore expected that the number animals in 2024 will increase in comparison with 2023.\n\nAdvances in the implementation of non-animal methods and alternative hazard identification strategies are crucial if a reduction of animal use in hazard assessment is to be achieved. For instance, with the upcoming information requirements for endocrine disruptors and aquatic chronic toxicity, more, rather than less, animal testing appears to be required in Europe.",

Definition\n\nSolvay's health, safety, and environment (HSE) management system is aligned with ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 definitions and our Responsible Care Policy.\n\nThrough our Responsible Care Policy, we commit to safeguarding people and the environment, by continuously improving our environmental, health and safety performance, the security of our facilities, processes, technologies, and chemical product safety and stewardship throughout the supply chain. This reflects Solvay's position as a signatory to the ICCA's Responsible Care Global Charter \u00ae .\n\n## 3.3.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay's HSE strategy relies on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 An approved HSE management system, which is implemented at every industrial (manufacturing and research and innovation) site. This includes a Responsible Care Policy and a set of risk-based procedures that apply to all areas, including health monitoring, industrial hygiene, occupational safety, process safety, transport safety, and environment and product safety. For each domain, a network is organized at group level to ensure implementation of the procedures, compliance with regulations and sharing of good practice.\n- \u00b7 A Product Safety Management System (PSMS), applied in every Global Business Unit.\n- \u00b7 A safety culture approach, which ensures people's safety, health, and well-being. It relies on a safety leadership style, where managers act as mentors and demonstrate genuine care for all.\n- \u00b7 A reporting process used to evaluate performance, analyze events, and define short- and long-term improvement plans.\n\nSafety is supervised by the ELT as part of its monthly session agenda. Performance is reviewed including the analysis and learnings of most recent events and ELT provides its orientations.\n\n## Industrial sites\n\nEach industrial site:\n\n- \u00b7 Implements at least one approved health, safety and/or environment management system, in compliance with Solvay's Responsible Care Policy.\n- \u00b7 Sets up a dedicated, systematic regulatory watch mechanism.\n- \u00b7 Undergoes a compliance audit conducted by an internal or external third party at least once every five years, addressing both regulatory and internal requirements.\n- \u00b7 Addresses all identified risks, areas for improvement and gaps in compliance.\n\n## Environmental rehabilitation\n\nSolvay's HSER Department is responsible for managing the environmental liabilities resulting from the Group's industrial and mining activities. HSER helps the sites and GBUs manage their environmental legacy, whether historical or recent, providing them with technical expertise and cash management through environmental provisions. Where local regulations allow, a risk-based approach is used to define management actions. For our operational sites, HSER collaborates with the local HSE team. Our closed sites are managed directly by the HSER team on behalf of the relevant legal entities. HSER is also responsible and accountable for managing group environmental provisions.\n\n## 3.3.3.

Supply chain and procurement\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 308-1 308-2 407-1 414-1 MATERIALITY: MODERATE\n\n## 3.4.1. Definition\n\nOur supply chain organization accounts for about 850 people. Almost all of them are located in the GBUs, where they are in charge of planning, customer care, logistics operations, and improvement projects. We also have programs in place to foster continuous improvement in the value chain performance of our GBUs, while also contributing positively to cost and cash management, as well as fulfillment at the service of customers.\n\nOur procurement organization consists of about 450 people, located in Corporate Procurement and the Purchasing Service Line support teams. Their mission is to source products and services leveraging scale and expertise, and to secure sustainable value creation and supply security to directly support Solvay's strategy and One Planet agenda.\n\n## 3.4.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay integrates our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) principles and One Planet ambition into our procurement processes and strategies in order to create sustainable business value in collaboration with our suppliers.\n\n## Procurement strategy\n\nProcurement resources and capabilities are shared across an international network of category and sourcing managers, and individuals responsible for site procurement, all of whom follow a common way of working known as the Solvay global procurement process.\n\nOur procurement strategies are defined by category experts in collaboration with the GBUs. These strategies are then executed and deployed at global, regional, or local level, depending on the category specifics and suppliers' market structure. Our strategies include ESG elements and criteria.\n\n## Core suppliers\n\nSolvay applies supplier segmentation in order to identify key suppliers, which we refer to as core suppliers. Core suppliers encompass three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic Alliances: Strategic suppliers at group level that contribute to Solvay's growth, market differentiation, and innovation.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Partners: Suppliers that deliver strategic materials or services to Solvay that can have a possible business impact.\n- \u00b7 Bottlenecks: Suppliers that represent a high potential risk to Solvay or the business.\n\nThis approach enables Solvay to focus on managing performance, mitigating supply risk, and improving relationships, while also forming the basis for collaboration and stimulating innovation.\n\nActions to be performed, such as carrying out a supplier evaluation survey, or requesting a mandatory third-party sustainability assessment, are defined according to the type of supplier. Key Account Managers are appointed for some of our core suppliers, allowing us to generate additional value and mitigate risk through strategic relationships. We have identified 232 suppliers as core suppliers and 92% of them are currently covered by a third-party sustainability assessment.\n\n## Together for Sustainability initiative\n\nSolvay is a founding member of Together for Sustainability (TfS), a global procurement-driven initiative that aims to improve the sustainability performance of chemical companies and their suppliers.\n\nThe TfS program is based on the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care \u00ae principles. It provides a framework and tools - TfS Assessments and TfS Audits - that enable TFS member companies to assess, drive, and improve the sustainability performance of chemical supply chains through a shared infrastructure. TfS assessments are carried out by the initiative's key partner EcoVadis, a global service provider specialized in sustainability performance assessments. For audits, TfS cooperates with TfS-approved audit companies.\n\nSince last year TfS also provides Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Guidelines which enable chemical companies and our suppliers to share and develop high-quality carbon footprint data, which is an essential tool to drive decarbonization initiatives in the industry.\n\nIn the meantime, in 2023, the TfS Academy, which was rolled out the previous year, extended to more than 390 capability building courses in 11 languages.\n\nFurthermore, membership in TfS grew to 50 by the end of 2023. This increased the reach and impact on the sustainability performance of chemical supply chains, covering over \u20ac500 billion of combined spend and over \u20ac800 billion of global turnover.",

        "page_content": "## ESG risk in the supply chain\n\nTo tackle human rights and environmental impacts across our value chains and to comply with the dynamic regulatory landscape, Solvay has developed an ESG risk management approach for our supply chain. The aim is to comply with the existing and upcoming ESG regulations, especially on environment and human rights (e.g., EU Mandatory Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence Legislation and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act). This requires corporate governance practices to better integrate risk management and risk mitigation in their processes. Our policy for ESG Risk Management (build and maintain overall ESG risk matrix and supplier risk management) provides a systematic approach for risk identification and risk severity assessment of more than 60 upstream value chains and triggers risk mitigation action plans. In addition to the internal risk management framework, we have also incorporated a third-party risk management tool for adverse media screening on:\n\n- \u00b7 environmental, social, and governance;\n- \u00b7 anti-bribery and corruption; and\n- \u00b7 human rights.\n\nWe have already incorporated around 5,000 suppliers in the tool. The suppliers were screened and are monitored on a permanent basis. We will extend the suppliers number in 2024 and the following years. The suppliers we have selected are our core suppliers and the ones we consider under high ESG risk.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to our due diligence process, 20 suppliers conducted a TfS audit in 2023 and 1,600* suppliers performed an EcoVadis assessment.\n\n## Supplier Code of Business Integrity\n\nOur Supplier Code of Business Integrity is key for the implementation of our Responsible Procurement Policy. It is fully aligned with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity and inspired by the UN Global Compact principles and Responsible Care \u00ae practices.\n\nAll written procurement contracts must make reference to the Supplier Code of Business Integrity or an acceptable alternative. Suppliers or partners are invited to report any breach of Solvay's ethical policies or Supplier Code of Business Integrity through the Solvay Ethics Helpline. Every report is carefully reviewed by the Ethics and Compliance team, who review the case and conduct an investigation as appropriate.\n\nSolvay is concerned that the trade in tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold, and the metals known as 3TGs that are refined from such minerals and mined in certain conflict-affected and high-risk regions, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries, may be contributing to human rights abuses. We are continuously working to improve our overview on 3TGs included in products, components, and materials supplied to Solvay. Consistent with Solvay's Supplier Code of Business Integrity, we require the cooperation of our suppliers in the implementation of Solvay Policy on Conflict Minerals. As part of that process, we conduct due diligence concerning the necessary conflict minerals in the products it manufactures or contracts to manufacture in accordance with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (the 'OECD Guidance').\n\nWe continue to work to verify the integrity of our sourcing, and to support the actions of governments, our customers, and suppliers toward achieving this aim globally. If our suppliers fail to meet our expectations in this regard, we will take these factors into consideration when making future business and sourcing decisions.\n\n## Renewable Raw Materials Platform\n\nIn 2023 we launched the Eiffel database - a collaborative online platform which allows everyone at Solvay to find renewable alternatives to conventional raw materials. It helps us to speed our transition towards a more sustainable and circular raw materials portfolio. Switching to mass balance, bio-based, recycled, or CO 2 derived raw materials is key to help us develop lower carbon footprint solutions. The platform enables us to find renewable alternatives that could be of interest in both the short and long term. It features an interactive and user-friendly dashboard with key information such as the type of material and feedstock, certification details, suppliers, the region it is sourced from, how long Solvay has been sourcing it, and the end product it is used in.\n\n## One Buyer One Project\n\nIn 2023 we also launched the One Buyer One Project initiative aimed at reinforcing sustainability culture at Solvay and promoting best practices. This ambition encourages each buyer to initiate and lead at least one sustainability project. Currently, there are 120 projects at different stages of maturity and impact. The projects are related to different areas in sustainability - from CO 2 , water, or waste reduction to renewable energy to circular economy, biodiversity, etc. Many of these projects are replicable. We continue ramping up the projects and leveraging the initiative.\n\n## 3.4.3. Indicators\n\n## EcoVadis assessment\n\nOne of our main priorities for 2023 was to assess our core suppliers and suppliers identified via ESG risk management. During the year, a total of 1,600* Solvay suppliers were assessed through EcoVadis. These assessments currently cover 215 of our 232 core suppliers.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nAs a large chemical manufacturer, Solvay uses raw materials from a range of suppliers and sources: the overall volume purchased in 2023 was over 2.86 million metric tons.",

We have contacted 34 suppliers who together emit around 80% of the CO 2 in our upstream Scope 3 raw materials GHG emissions targeted scope as per secondary data. With an objective to collect 35% of the product carbon footprint of the targeted scope, we have outperformed our target by reaching 54%.\n\nTo make further progress in reaching our Scope 3 target, in Q4 2023 we called on some of our top materials' suppliers to share their climate strategy and actions towards decarbonization so that we could understand how their plans would positively impact the carbon footprint of our products. The first wave consisted of eight suppliers. A second wave of requests is planned for 2024.\n\n## Procurement Sustainability Training\n\nThree hundred and thirty Sustainability Training sessions have been followed by our procurement organization employees. Every new hired employee in Procurement follows all Procurement Sustainability Training modules. In 2024 we will update the training modules and launch a new training campaign.\n\n*Due to the split of the company, this number is based on an assumption (55% of the total number of evaluated suppliers before the split).\n\n## 3.5.  Main partnerships\n\n## 25. SDG 17\n\n## IndustriALL Global Union\n\nBuilding on 20 years of strong industrial relations between IndustriALL and Solvay, we signed an improved Global Framework Agreement (GFA) on March 31, 2022. The content of the agreement was strengthened around several important areas, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Telework rights\n- \u00b7 C190\n- \u00b7 EU due diligence and UN binding treaty - supply chain oversight\n- \u00b7 Just transition\n- \u00b7 Conflict resolution\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the agreement following the upcoming split of the company\n- \u00b7 Workers' rights to health and safety\n- \u00b7 Skills transfer\n- \u00b7 Battery supply chain\n- \u00b7 US Taskforce Agreement renewed for the duration of the GFA\n\nThe four-year agreement includes serious commitments on due diligence along the supply chain. Taking note of the different international standards on this issue, including the upcoming EU Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, the agreement establishes a new working group of workers and management to investigate supplier respect for core labor rights and seek remediation where problems are found. Solvay commits to suspend contracts with suppliers that fail to remedy human rights and environmental abuses following warnings.\n\n## Wildlife Habitat Council\n\nIn 2021 we joined the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), an international NGO that works with businesses to encourage, promote, and certify biodiversity conservation. The partnership helps us to better focus our efforts on biodiversity and identify areas for improvement, both at our sites and in collaboration with our customers.\n\nWHC is the only international conservation NGO focused exclusively on the private sector and is a leader in taking bold action for biodiversity conservation through partnerships and education. WHC provides a framework for voluntary conservation action on a wide variety of corporate lands, promoting a collaborative and comprehensive approach to conservation activities around the world.\n\nMembership in the WHC helps us to implement conservation projects that are locally relevant, practical and adaptable to any regulatory requirements, but which don't conflict with operations. As part of our partnership, we work to mainstream biodiversity across sectors, in collaboration with our partners and sites, taking concrete actions to protect species and habitats, and deliver impact through biodiversity restoration and enhancement at a local level.",

Association of International Chemical Manufacturers\n\nThe Association of International Chemical Manufacturers (AICM) represents nearly 70 major multinational companies in the Chinese chemical industry active in the manufacture, transportation, distribution, and disposal of chemicals. Together with other leading international chemical players in China, Solvay helps promote Responsible Care \u00ae and other globally recognized chemical management principles among all stakeholders, advocates cost-effective, science- and risk-based policies to policymakers, and strengthens the contributions made by the chemical industry to the economy.\n\n## 3.6.9. BusinessEurope\n\nBusinessEurope is the leading European business trade association. Its direct members are national business federations, but selected companies may participate in BusinessEurope through the Advisory and Support group (ASG). BusinessEurope and its members campaign on the issues that most influence the business performance and growth of European companies, in Europe and globally. Solvay provides input through participation in working groups dealing with energy, environment and research, as well as trade policy. Solvay's position on climate is more ambitious than the federation position.\n\n## 3.6.10.  European Round Table of Industrialists\n\nThe European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT) is a forum that brings together around 50 CEOs of European companies. Among its activities, the ERT advocates policies to improve European competitiveness, growth, and employment. In particular, Solvay actively participates in the working groups dealing with energy, trade, competitiveness and innovation, jobs and skills, and finance, as well as competition policies. In the ERT, Solvay focused in particular on promoting the human skills agenda, supporting the creation of new jobs through the transition to a more sustainable economy, as well as participated in a study on decarbonization and competitiveness for the energy intensive industry.\n\n## 4.

Transition risks and opportunities\n\nIf we embark on a transition path, more transition risks and opportunities will materialize which will have strategic implications for the Group. With Solvay's energy mix, which uses coal; our raw materials which include petrochemicals; and our end markets, which include the automotive, building and construction industries; means that we are exposed to risks and opportunities:\n\n- \u00b7 Policies and legal context: Regulations and actions to limit CO 2 emissions, such as increasing carbon taxes, banning internal combustion engines, mandating the use of certain fuel types, and tightening environmental standards.\n- \u00b7 Technology: Investment in new, lower-emission technologies.\n- \u00b7 Markets: Adaptation to changing customer behavior.\n- \u00b7 Financial: Ability to cope with the influence of climate change on investors' and lenders' decisions.\n- \u00b7 Changed climate: Impact of upcoming changes on industrial operations and in the value chain.\n- \u00b7 Reputation: Stakeholder attitudes caused by ability to address stakeholder climate change concerns effectively.\n\n## Mapping transition risks and opportunities\n\nThe Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) global and systematic assessment helps alert our businesses to sustainability market signals, in particular on climate risk and opportunities, to anticipate their impact and develop the right answers in a timely manner. SPM is a robust, fact-based, future-oriented compass that allows us to take a snapshot of products' sustainability risks and opportunities in their business environment.\n\nSPM informs us about the contribution Solvay's products make to sustainability along the value chain considering both:\n\n- \u00b7 their environmental manufacturing footprint and the associated risks and opportunities - vertical axis - with a quantitative assessment using 21 impact indicators; and\n- \u00b7 how their applications bring benefits or face challenges from a holistic market perspective - horizontal axis - with a qualitative assessment of social and environmental topics covering four main themes, namely health and safety, climate change, resources and opinion leaders.\n\nFor more details about SPM, see section 7.1 Product design and life-cycle management and the SPM guide published on Solvay's website.\n\nClimate change is one of the focus areas for SPM assessment. This involves identifying if a product in a given application brings a climate change benefit or challenge. Product-Application Combinations (PACs) that lead to benefits are identified as \"climate solutions,\" while those that pose challenges are considered \"climate challenges.\"",

        "page_content": "Solvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management tool classifies a sustainable solution as a product in a given application that makes a significant climate change contribution to the customer's performance while also demonstrating a lower carbon impact in its production phase. The SPM methodology is also used to identify eligible enabling activities, requested under the Taxonomy's Delegated Act 2021. For more details about Taxonomy reporting, see section 7.3 EU Taxonomy Eligible Activities.\n\nSPM is a key tool for enabling Solvay to integrate the sustainability dimension into strategic and operational decision making in key business processes, such as strategy, research and innovation, investment, marketing and sales, and mergers and acquisitions. We also apply the SPM tool to strategic projects, using the same logic as for our portfolio, to make sure that these projects are heading toward business solutions that support growth and value creation. This makes SPM a key tool for Solvay to identify if an investment, or a strategic or innovation project, can be considered a climate transition opportunity for Solvay.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, we revised our scenario analysis under the following scope:\n\n- \u00b7 Focusing on the three business units (Soda Ash and Derivatives, Peroxides, and Special Chem) representing 73% of Solvay's 2022 sales.\n- \u00b7 Two International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios: 1.5\u00b0C Scenario (IEA Net Zero Emissions Scenario 2021) and 3\u00b0C Scenario (IEA Stated Policy Scenario 2021).\n- \u00b7 Using a leading audit, tax and consulting service company's tool for climate scenario analyses.\n- \u00b7 Assumptions of price and cost changes, volume changes, and adaptation potential (cost pass-through) were taken from the consultant's models.\n\nThis included price trajectories up to 2050 for oil, coal, gas, CO\n\n2\n\n, electricity, and energy usage in transport, in our own operations and upstream.\n\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the market dynamics and identification of the essential characteristics of individual sites was based on the consultant and Solvay sector and climate expertise, considering products sold in main markets, namely construction, packaging, automotive, oil and gas, home and personal care, food and feed, and electronics.\n\nThe conclusions of the scenario analysis confirm the robustness of our business portfolio supported by positive drivers overcoming the negative ones as summarized below with impacts quantified from (-3) to +3:\n\n| Financial impact drivers   |                          | 1.5\u00b0C scenario   | 3\u00b0C scenario   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n|                            | Green hydrogen           | (-2)             | 0              |\n| Technology                 | Coal phase-out           | +2               | +1             |\n|                            | Oil and gas              | +1               | (-2)           |\n| Market                     | Electronics              | +2               | +2             |\n| Market                     | Automotive               | (-2)             | +1             |\n| Market                     | Buildings                | +2               | +1             |\n| Policy                     | CO 2  price              | (-3)             | (-2)           |\n| Reputation                 | CO 2  emission reduction | +2               | +1             |\n| Reputation                 | Supply chain engagements | +1               | +1             |\n\n## 4.1.2. Physical risks\n\n## Acute risks\n\nSolvay sites in areas currently exposed to natural hazards, with loss expectancy, calculated by our insurers, of higher than \u20ac10 million (physical damage and contribution margin loss):\n\n- \u00b7 Five Solvay sites are located in 100-year frequency (2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of \u20ac15-168 million.\n- \u00b7 Nine Solvay sites are located in 500-year frequency (0.2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of \u20ac15-208 million.\n- \u00b7 One site is in a wind exposed area, with a loss expectancy of \u20ac16 million.\n\nSolvay has a property damage and business interruption insurance program in place to cover catastrophic risks, and covers smaller losses through self-insurance.\n\nThe risk is continually assessed throughout the year, with the support of Solvay's Property insurer FM Global and reinsurers, like Swiss Re, based on their proprietary flood modeling. Each site with reported insured values greater than \u20ac50 million is visited by FM Global loss prevention engineers and benchmarked with FM Global's resilience index, which takes into account inherent risks and completion of any recommendations.\n\nEach site has received a list of recommendations to prioritize to reduce the risk. Recommendations can be related to procedural improvements, like developing a flood, drought, freeze, or wind response plan, or physical improvements, like installing flood barriers or improving levees. The Torrelavega site was one of the most exposed to flood and has made significant improvements by raising the level of their flood dike.",

(2016), in conjunction with QGIS, a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System, to identify areas subject to water scarcity.\n\n- \u00b7 Of the 45 production sites, 14 are in areas subject to water stress. These sites withdraw a total of 36.8 million cubic meters of water, out of a total of 247.5 million cubic meters (14.5 %) withdrawn by Solvay sites.\n- \u00b7 Four sites have been prioritized based on a risk analysis combining three criteria: location, freshwater intake, and business interruption value.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nOn top of the annual risk assessment carried out with our insurers, a climate physical risks scenario analysis focusing on future climate impacts has been performed in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Considering two scenarios: >4\u00b0C of global warming (corresponding with the IPCC's RCP 8.5 and SSP-5.85) and 3\u00b0C of global warming (corresponding with the IPCC's RCP 4.5 and SSP-2.45), corresponding to a \"business as usual\" reference scenario.\n- \u00b7 Time horizons: 2030, 2050 and 2100.\n- \u00b7 Qualitative analysis considering own operations countries: All countries in which Solvay has a site; procurement countries: top 25 by procurement amount (EUR) and headquarter country; market countries: top 25 by revenue.\n- \u00b7 Considering changes in hazard frequency in the scenarios for 2030, 2050 and 2100 per country, versus a 2020 basis, using the World Bank Knowledge Portal and scientific papers.\n- \u00b7 Using a leading audit firm's tool for climate scenario analysis, which allows to include an external perspective and challenge Solvay's assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Using sector vulnerabilities to each hazard as assessed by the leading audit firm based on literature review.\n- \u00b7 Computing Risk scores based on the statistical global distribution per hazard. The thresholds for each risk category are hazard specific.\n- \u00b7 Quantitative analysis focusing on the sites with the highest contribution margin (including impacts on other sites): Green River (US), Linne Herten (NL), Paulinia (BR), Devnya (BG)\n\nThe main conclusions of the analysis are:\n\n- \u00b7 The difference between the 3\u00b0C scenario and the >4\u00b0C scenario for the selected sites is marginal.\n- \u00b7 Solvay's main physical risks lie mainly around flooding, particularly in Brazil.\n- \u00b7 Flood and convective storms might cause the highest damages until 2090.\n- \u00b7 Flood damage increase compared to today is minimal.\n- \u00b7 Tropical cyclone and wildfire do not pose a considerable financial impact across all locations.\n- \u00b7 Overall risk levels are moderate:\n- -Paulinia is the most impacted site.\n- -The other sites are significantly less impacted by both asset damage and business interruption with values ranging below 5% of the site value or contribution margin, respectively.\n- -Business interruption in absolute terms is generally lower than asset damage.\n\n## 4.2.

Based on a World Resources Institute (WRI) recommendation, Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) emission factors published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency are used for the US, instead of the state emission factor. Similarly, grid emission factors published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment are used for China, instead of the state emission factors.\n\n## 4.2.2. Management approach\n\nFollowing the spin-off of Syensqo in December 2023, Solvay has confirmed its commitment to reduce its CO 2 emissions. Our new baseline has shifted from 2018 to 2021 while maintaining a goal of a 30% reduction on Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a reduction of 20% of Scope 3 (upstream and downstream) emissions by 2030. We also pursue our objective to phase out coal by 2030 wherever an alternative exists. In addition, carbon neutrality by 2050 remains an overarching objective.\n\nSolvay joined SBTi in October 2020, receiving a formal approval from the Initiative in early 2023 for its climate targets. The spin-off of Syensqo has triggered the need for a reassessment that will start with SBTi in 2024.\n\nOur current objectives are supported by a global energy transition roadmap made of already validated and financed projects (with a strong delivery anticipated in 2025), as well as a portfolio of projects (still under validation process) clustered by typology:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy transition project for which a significant investment is necessary to use less emitting primary source of energy.\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency project which allows to consume less energy per production unit.\n- \u00b7 Decarbonized sourcing consisting of the substitution of current fossil energy by a renewable one or low carbon one.\n\nAn externally verified greenhouse gas emission reporting system and responses to rating agencies, such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, help the Group align our efforts with the magnitude of the greenhouse gas challenges we face.\n\nIn 2023, four new projects have been validated. Overall, we have more than 26 projects around the world that are either completed or underway.\n\nIn terms of methodology, STAR Factory program deployment at site level enables identification of energy transition opportunities through collaboration between a dedicated team of experts in energy transition and site operational industrial teams.\n\nThese opportunities are then evaluated, challenged and prioritized by business from an affordability point of view, including an internal carbon price of \u20ac100 per metric ton of CO 2 to all greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe execution of roadmaps depends on the category of the projects. Energy efficiency projects are managed at site level whereas energy transition and renewable sourcing projects are managed at central level.\n\n## 4.2.3. Indicators\n\nSolvay targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030, compared to the 2021 baseline, and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Solvay also targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions (focus five categories) by 20% by 2030.\n\n## GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1 AND 2)\n\n| Total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in 2023                                           | Mt CO 2 eq   |   7.3 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|\n| Total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in 2022                                           | Mt CO 2 eq   |   8.5 |\n| Total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in 2021 - as published                            | Mt CO 2 eq   |   9   |\n| Variation due to changes in reporting scope (structural changes)                                 | Mt CO 2 eq   |  -0.1 |\n| Variation due to changes in methodology or improvements in data accuracy                         | Mt CO 2 eq   |   0   |\n| Emissions increase or reduction at constant scope year on year                                   | Mt CO 2 eq   |  -1.2 |\n| Cumulative emissions increase or reduction since 2021 at constant scope                          | Mt CO 2 eq   |  -1.7 |\n| Percentage increase or reduction since 2021 at constant scope   (reference 2021: 9.0 Mt CO 2 eq) | %            | -19   |\n|                                                                                                  | -1.1         |  -1.1 |\n\nThe cumulative emissions reduction since 2021 at constant scope is -1.6 Mt CO 2 eq.\n\nDecreased emissions of 1.2 Mt CO 2 eq in 2023, as compared to 2022, can be explained by lower activity (-0,9 Mt CO 2 eq), new GHG reduction projects (-0.3 Mt CO 2 eq), including biomass consumption in Devnya in substitution to coal, better mine gas usage in Green River, and Voikkaa's 100% renewable electricity consumption.\n\nThe GHG emissions in 2022 do not consider the changes in the scope of Tavaux and Zhenjiang, unlike 2023. This change has an impact on Scope 1 and 2 of 2022 (-0.1 MtCO 2 eq), mainly on Scope 2. Variation due to changes in reporting scope (structural changes) is explained by Tavaux and Zhenjiang consolidated at 100% for Syensqo.",

the reasonable assurance report from our independent auditor while Scope 3 Focus 5 categories greenhouse gas emissions indicator is not in the scope of our independent auditor.\n\nNote: Solvay will continue working on aligning its methodology with the Scope 3 GHG Protocol for scope 3.1 (purchased goods and services), scope 3.4 (upstream transportation and distribution) and scope 3.5 (waste generated in operations) and disaggregating emissions in its inventory for these categories by end of 2024. Emissions reported herein under category 3.1 (purchased goods and services) include emissions from categories 3.4 (upstream transportation and distribution) and 3.5 (waste generated in operations). They are calculated by the difference between the cradleto-gate emissions of our products (including manufacturing) and on the Scope 1, Scope 2, and emissions from category 3 (fuel and energy-related activities). We have identified a limit in the accuracy of the methodology with the reconciliation between energy bill of materials in life cycle assessments and energy in Scope 1 and 2 emissions which affects the categories of emissions scope 3.1, scope 3.4, and scope 3.5 (purchased goods and services, upstream transportation, distribution, and waste generated in operations). The revision of the methodology for the three categories will include their direct determination (based on raw materials quantities purchased x emission factor), address the identified limitation in accuracy and increase the use of suppliers' specific emission factors.",

        "page_content": "Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as follows:\n\n- 1.  Purchased goods and services: We carry out a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for most of our products, representing 94% of our total net sales. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions are extrapolated to reach the totality of our purchases. They include all emissions related to raw material extraction and precursor processing, indirect emissions from energy use for these operations, and transport between suppliers and to our plants.\n\nNote: In 2023, a change in methodology has taken place for emissions reported in category 3.1, which includes emissions in categories 3.4 and 3.5, by excluding emissions related to energy sales to third parties from Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3.3, thereby aligning with the boundary for cradleto-gate LCA emissions of products. It has induced + 1 MT\\_CO2 eq.\n\n- 2.  Capital goods: We have used the emission factors of the WBCSD Guidance for Accounting and Reporting Corporate GHG Emissions in the Chemical Sector Value Chain, assuming that capital goods are a mix of concrete and steel.\n- 3.  Fuel-and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2: They represent GHG emissions that occur during the extraction and transport of energy.\n- 4.  Upstream transportation and distribution: This is included in category 1 (see above), purchased goods and services.\n- 5. Waste generated in operations: This is included in category 1 (see above).\n- 6.  Business travel: Business travel undertaken by Solvay employees is recorded by our travel agency and monitored by our purchasing department. For air and rail travel, travel mileage is recorded. This covers more than 95% of our air and rail travel. The calculated greenhouse gas emissions are extrapolated to represent the totality of our travel. For each transportation mode, mileage is converted into CO 2 equivalent using emission factors from Ecoinvent.\n- 7.  Employee commuting: The estimation is based on assuming that Solvay employees based in industrial sites commute every day in an average diesel or petrol car. Employees at administrative and R&I sites commute three times per week (i.e., home office two days per week).\n- 8. Upstream leased assets: This is not applicable as we have no upstream leased assets.\n- 9.  Downstream transportation and distribution: Greenhouse gas emission during transportation of our products from our plants to our customers are reported and monitored by our supply chain excellence department. Emissions factors from the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) are used to calculate total emissions.\n- 10.  Processing of sold products: 11. Use of sold products; and 12. End-of-life treatment of sold products: the computation principles for these three categories are the same. The emissions due to product processing and transformation by third parties subsequent to sale by Solvay are calculated according to product chemical composition and expected chemical reactions likely to generate emissions during the transformation, the usage, and end-of-life of our product.\n\nNote: The methodology, developed in 2018, for the accounting of SF6 impacts in categories 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 has been revised. It aligns with the change in business good practices (best estimates or latest standards of the emission factors during the processing, use, and end of life of the equipment filled with SF6 and update of the market segmentation based on interviews with the most representative customer) and in the regulatory environment. Global warming potentials are taken from the reference table used in the current version of the European Regulation on the fluorinated greenhouse gases (Regulation EU No 517/2014), meaning the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5). It has induced -0.8 MT CO 2 eq in category 3.10 and -1.3 MT CO 2 eq in category 3.11.\n\n- 13.  Downstream leased assets: This is not applicable as Solvay has no leased assets.\n- 14. Franchises: This is not applicable as Solvay has no franchises.\n- 15.  Investments: Scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-consolidated entities (that are not consolidated in Solvay's Scope 1 and 2) are reported according to Solvay's financial interest in these entities, to ensure consistency with our financial statements.",

Key achievements\n\nIn 2023, the roll-out of the STAR Factory program (which started in 2022) led to an acceleration of initiatives identification through deployment on about half of the sites.\n\nThe structural GHG reduction of 0.3 Mt CO 2 eq in 2023 are mainly due to following achievements:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy transition (0.1 Mt CO 2 eq)\n- -At our soda ash Devnya, BG, site, an existing boiler has been adapted to increase its co-combustion rate with non-recyclable biomass.\n- -In Torrelavega, we started from the second quarter of 2023 to operate a small biomass co-firing boiler with coal (3% mass or 1.4% energy substitution).\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency (0.2 Mt CO 2 eq)\n- -Among 60+ projects implemented, Green-River site from soda ash business significantly improved its mine gas usage (reducing direct CH4 emission in the atmosphere).\n- -Another soda ash site, Bernburg, worked on the optimization of energy production and consumptions.\n- \u00b7 Decarbonized sourcing\n- -Voikkaa, F.I., production site, began operating on 100% renewable electricity in 2023. This is a significant step in decarbonizing the production of hydrogen peroxide at Voikkaa.\n\n## In Scope 3:\n\n- \u00b7 We have active collaboration with our most GHG-emitting raw materials suppliers to collect data on the product carbon footprint (PCF) of the raw materials they supply to us - a preliminary step that enables us to track and manage progress in our purchased goods and services emissions (category 1). In 2023 we collected more than 50% of the PCF coverage of our raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Looking to engage its own employees in the reduction of Scope 3 emissions linked to business travel (category 6), from January 2023, a monetary amount based on the entity's travel footprint calculated at \u20ac100 per ton of CO 2 is charged to each GBU to finance a Travel Carbon Fund. It will be used in 2024 for sponsoring sustainability projects with a carbon-offset focus wherever feasible.\n\n## 4.3.

Definitions\n\nThe different components of Solvay's energy consumption are converted into primary energy sources as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 fuels, using the net calorific values;\n- \u00b7 steam purchased, taking into account the boiler efficiency reference value for the type of fuel used to generate the steam, for example 90% efficiency based on the net calorific value for natural gas; and\n- \u00b7 electricity purchased, assuming an average efficiency of 39.5% for all types of power production except for nuclear power (33%), hydro (100%), solar (100%), and wind (100%), based on net calorific value (source: International Energy Agency - IEA).\n\n## 4.3.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay considers it particularly important to swiftly transition our energy consumption toward zero- or low-carbon sources without compromising on competitiveness or supply security.\n\nIn order to avoid conflicts of interest, the Sustainability team who sets the Group's guidelines and targets is separated from the Energy team which is in charge of the execution.\n\nDifferent expertises are in place to accelerate projects execution:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy department\n- -Energy sourcing with long-term partnerships and medium- to long-term contracts, and price-hedging protection mechanisms when needed.\n- -Market intelligence and direct access to energy markets.\n- -Dedicated services aimed at optimizing energy purchasing and helping Global Business Units manage energy and greenhouse gas emissions.\n- -Energy transition roadmap execution.\n- \u00b7 Industrials sites expertise\n- \u00b7 Technological expertise in processes and process innovation",

Key achievements\n\nIn 2023, the roll-out of the STAR Factory program (which started in 2022) led to an acceleration of initiatives identification through deployment on about half of the sites.\n\nThanks to a standardized methodology, 60+ projects have been implemented saving fossil-based heat and electricity for a total CO 2 savings of 300 ktCO 2 which leads to 1 PJ fossil energy savings. Replacement of dysfunctional steam traps which started in 2022, continued in 2023. In some other plants, operations on distillation columns have been improved. Electricity consumptions have been reduced thanks to process control actions and installation of variable frequency drives.\n\nIn 2023, 100% of our operations in China are still supplied by renewable electricity - 0.2 PJ.\n\nThe substitution of coal by biomass in our Devyna and Torrelavega soda ash plants has an impact of 0.6 PJ in 2023.",

Definitions\n\nWater management encompasses the management of water flows and water quality, from extraction from the natural environment to restitution in the same or another part of the environment.\n\nFreshwater withdrawal, measured in millions of cubic meters per year, is the amount of incoming freshwater purchased from third parties, such as drinking water from the public network, or pumped by Solvay from freshwater systems, such as rivers and lakes, and from groundwater sources, such as aquifers, or supplied from the public network (drinking water).\n\nFreshwater consumption, also measured in millions of cubic meters per year, is calculated as the sum of water lost through evaporation, leakage, and exportation of products and waste. Water purchased or pumped for third parties are included in freshwater withdrawals. For example, water that is taken from a river for cooling and returned after use counts as freshwater withdrawal but not as freshwater consumption. Solvay's main areas of water consumption are in production, or what is known as industrial water.\n\nAreas subject to hydric stress are identified using the Aqueduct database, a Free and Open Source Geographic Information System.\n\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is the amount of oxygen-reducing substances, mainly dissolved organic matter, discharged into aqueous receivers. COD is expressed as metric tons of oxygen. In addition to nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, COD also contributes to aquatic eutrophication.\n\nPersistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are toxic chemicals that are persistent in the environment and able to last for several years before breaking down (UNEP/GPA 2006a). POPs circulate globally and chemicals released in one part of the world can be deposited at far distances from their original source through a repeated process of evaporation and deposition. Persistent organic pollutants (POP) expressed in grams per year, are the summed emissions from substances included in lists A, B, and C under The Stockholm Convention. For Solvay, POP in 2023 are specifically dioxins and furans and are expressed in ton-equivalent toxicity per year (see chapter 5.3.3). POPs are reported by sites, according to their permit.\n\n## 5.1.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay has a company-wide approach to water that includes limiting freshwater withdrawal and consumption, particularly in locations subject to hydric stress, and ensuring that the water quality remains good in bodies of water in which effluents are discharged, so that the impact on downstream users and natural biota is minimized. Specifically, we focus on reducing the impact of freshwater withdrawal and Chemical Oxygen Demand releases.\n\nThe water balance of the Group for 2023 is shown in the table below.\n\n| Water input from (Mm 3 )    |     | Water discharge to (Mm 3 )   |     |\n|-----------------------------|-----|------------------------------|-----|\n| Surface water (freshwater)  | 187 | Surface water (freshwater)   | 164 |\n| Surface water (other water) |     | Surface water (other water)  |     |\n| Groundwater (freshwater)    | 19  | Groundwater (freshwater)     | 0.1 |\n| Groundwater (other water)   | 0.6 | Groundwater (other water)    |     |\n| Sea water                   | 72  | Sea water                    | 79  |\n| Third party (freshwater)    | 20  | Third party (freshwater)     | 21  |\n| Third party (other water)   | 7   | Third party (other water)    | 30  |\n| Other sources               | 12  | All losses                   | 26  |\n| TOTAL                       | 318 | TOTAL                        | 319 |",

The freshwater intake for our own operations decreased from 207 million cubic meters in 2022 to 186 million cubic meters in 2023 (-10%). This decrease is thanks to improvement initiatives deployed across our production sites (e.g., water reuse/recycling and cooling tower optimization) but mostly due to a reduction in production volumes. From this 186 million cubic meters, 26 million cubic meters (7%) is lost: 16 million cubic meters through evaporation from industrial cooling towers and eight million cubic meters through exportation with aqueous end products, such as hydrogen peroxide. The remaining volume is lost with exported wastes or through leakages from underground piping networks.\n\nThe table below shows the number and percentage of sites located in areas subject to hydric stress and gives the freshwater withdrawal and freshwater consumption for these in 2023 compared to the areas not subject to hydric stress.\n\n| 2023                                                     | Units                | Areas subject to  water stress   | Areas not subject  to water stress   | All areas   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Number of sites                                          | Number               | 14*                              | 31                                   | 45          |\n| Percentage of industrial sites under operational control | %                    | 31%                              | 69%                                  | 100%        |\n| Freshwater withdrawal                                    | Million cubic meters | 33                               | 190                                  | 223         |\n| Freshwater consumption                                   | Million cubic meters | 5                                | 21                                   | 26          |\n\n(*) For 2023, the sites in areas subject to hydric stress have been determined using the Aqueduct tool included in WWF Water Risk Filter.

This increase was mainly due to a new COD monitoring and increase in monitoring frequency in Devnya, which leads to more precise data compared to 2022. The persistent organic pollutants (POP) in wastewater decreased from 1.6E-05 metrics tons in 2022 to a non-detectable emission in 2023. This POP is a chlorinated aromatic no more used/produced in a Solvay European platform. The emission value for this substance has been permanently decreasing since 2018.\n\n## CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND AND PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS\n\n|                                     | Units           | 2023                     | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Chemical oxygen demand (COD)        | Metric tons O 2 | 1,970                    | 1,848   |\n| Persistent organic pollutants (POP) | Metric tons     | Below detec- tion limits | 1.6E-05 |",

Definitions\n\nIndustrial waste is defined as the waste resulting from our regular manufacturing and research activities. It does not include domestic waste or waste from demolition or construction projects. Mining waste, which results from the prospecting and extraction of minerals, is reported separately from industrial waste. All our waste volumes are expressed as dry matter.\n\nFor EU sites, Hazardous Industrial Waste (HIW) is defined according to Appendix III of the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). For non-EU countries, classification follows local legislation.\n\nNon-sustainably treated waste comprises waste that is landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. It includes the waste with unknown final treatment at the time of reporting.\n\n## 5.2.2. Management approach\n\nFor industrial waste, and hazardous industrial waste in particular, Solvay's focus is on switching to more sustainable disposal methods that avoid landfill or incineration without energy recovery and therefore promote material or thermal recovery.\n\nFor non-hazardous waste, mostly mineral, Solvay is launching material recovery initiatives aligned with our ambition to contribute to the circular economy.\n\n## 5.2.3.

NOx are reported due to their impact on acidification. NOx emissions from Solvay's operations result mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are excluded from this definition, as they have no impact on acidification. The impact of our N2O emissions is taken into account when assessing Solvay's contribution to climate change.",

Other changes are minor at the Group level.\n\nThe emission of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) emissions more than halved in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly thanks to the optimized abatement of N2O in the Coatis Paulinia plant.\n\nThe value of persistent organic pollutants (POP) emitted to air is related to dioxin and the measured value is close to the detection limit.

Definitions\n\n## Biodiversity around our sites\n\nTo assess the sensitivity of Solvay sites toward biodiversity, we use two international reference tools that help us understand and assess biodiversityrelated risks at Solvay's operational locations:\n\n- \u00b7 The Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT), a web-based map and reporting tool developed by the IBAT Alliance (BirdLife International, Conservation International), UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The IBAT tools provide integrated access to three of the world's most authoritative global biodiversity datasets:\n- -The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). The IUCN defines a Protected Area as a 'clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.'\n- -Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), which are sites recognized as contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems.\n- -The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered species are considered to potentially be on the path to global extinction.\n- \u00b7 The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Biodiversity Risk Filter (BrF), a web-based tool covering physical and reputational biodiversity-related risks that may affect our operational sites. These risks are evaluated through databases that provide 33 different indicators covering several aspects of biodiversity. A final score is then calculated for each location, ranging from zero (very low risk) to five (very high risk).\n\n## Measurement of a global impact on biodiversity\n\nThe calculation of the Solvay Group's pressure on biodiversity is performed along the value chain, from cradle-to-gate (from resource extraction to the factory gate, before it is transported to the consumer), for our portfolio of products. This is a global approach that is based on a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology. This method translates emissions and resource extractions into a limited number of environmental impact scores through what are known as 'characterization factors.'\n\nThe first step in this method is using emissions from environmental reporting that are linked with the following 'midpoint impact categories':\n\n- \u00b7 global warming, e.g., from CO 2 and greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u00b7 water use;\n- \u00b7 freshwater ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 freshwater eutrophication;\n- \u00b7 photochemical oxidation;\n- \u00b7 terrestrial acidification;\n- \u00b7 terrestrial ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 marine ecotoxicity; and\n- \u00b7 land use.\n\nThe potential damage to nature is then calculated by connecting the midpoint indicator to an endpoint factor using the method ReCiPe 2016 Damage to freshwater, marine, and terrestrial species refers to the aggregated local loss of species. The unit for measuring impact on biodiversity is a theoretical number of potential species affected in respective ecosystems, measured over space and time.\n\n## 5.4.2. Management approach\n\n## Local biodiversity\n\nWe screened 45 operational sites with both the IBAT and BrF tools to assess their biodiversity risks.\n\nOn the basis of the screening exercise, and considering other criteria such as climate change, environmental impact, and strategic dimensions, 16 sites were prioritized for the development of biodiversity roadmap. The first step consists in identifying a vision for the site based on the longterm goals it wants to achieve. In a second step, the site identifies possible actions that would support nature conservation and the restoration of biodiversity. This involves identifying the stakeholders supporting each action, such as employees, local communities, nature conservation associations, and universities. Timeline, indicators, and associated budget are characterized as well. Each action is linked with an objective and when possible a method to monitor progress. Finally, governance and planification are key milestones to establish before the implementation phase.\n\nThe local assessment of the biodiversity-related risks related to Solvay's operations is integrated into the STAR Factory program. Priority sites involved in STAR Factory are developing a biodiversity roadmap as part of the sustainability workstream of the program.",

We found that greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity, and soil acidification represent 90% of the drivers affecting biodiversity.\n\nWith the adoption of the 'Global Biodiversity Framework' at COP 15 in December 2022, the parties set an ambitious program of targets and recommendations relating to biodiversity conservation and restoration where the private sector has an important role to play. Solvay's activities on nature are willing to support the implementation of the Framework.\n\nAs part of our efforts to contribute to biodiversity preservation, Solvay is a founding member of Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE), which was created in 1992. This is a think tank and platform for expertise, bringing together around 60 large French and international companies from all sectors of the economy to work together to better integrate the environment into both their strategies and their day-to-day management. Within the EpE, Solvay is an active member of the Commission on Biodiversity and is committed to act4nature International.\n\nFinally, Solvay is connected with scientific organizations working on Biodiversity like IPBES07 and IUCN by participating in the IUCN Leaders Forum in Geneva, in October 2023. The Forum was a great opportunity to connect with decision makers and CEOs to further integrate biodiversity conservation into our strategy. The program included meetings with the Young Changemakers bringing a message of hope that demonstrates the importance of empowering the next generation through business engagement.\n\n## 5.4.3. Indicators\n\n## Local biodiversity\n\nAssessing our 45 operational sites for biodiversity risks using the IBAT and BrF tools revealed that:\n\n- \u00b7 36 were within 5 km of a protected area;\n- \u00b7 eighteen sites were within 5km of a Key Biodiversity Area; and\n- \u00b7 more than 3,700 vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered species are potentially present within 50 km of our sites.\n\n## IBAT AND BRF RESULTS FOR 16 PRIORITY SITES\n\n| Site         |   Number of  protected areas  within 5 km |   Number of key  biodiversity areas  within 5 km |   Number of endangered  species within 50 km |   BrF biodiversity-related  risk score (0-15) |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Anan         |                                         4 |                                                1 |                                          160 |                                           7.1 |\n| Bad Wimpfen  |                                        13 |                                                2 |                                           86 |                                           7.9 |\n| Bernburg     |                                         8 |                                                0 |                                           63 |                                           8.7 |\n| Devnya       |                                         6 |                                                1 |                                           67 |                                           8.3 |\n| Dombasle     |                                         1 |                                                0 |                                           55 |                                           8.3 |\n| Gunsan       |                                         0 |                                                2 |                                          103 |                                           8.9 |\n| La Rochelle  |                                         8 |                                                1 |                                           92 |                                           9   |\n| Linne Herten |                                         3 |                                                3 |                                           64 |                                           8.4 |\n| Livorno      |                                        17 |                                                1 |                                          140 |                                           9   |\n| Map Ta-Phut  |                                         0 |                                                0 |                                          187 |                                           8.2 |\n| Paulinia     |                                         1 |                                                0 |                                           59 |                                           8.2 |\n| Rheinberg    |                                        39 |                                                1 |                                           57 |                                           9.1 |\n| Rosignano    |                                         8 |                                                0 |                                          135 |                                           9   |\n| Torrelavega  |                                         2 |                                                0 |                                          121 |                                           7.8 |\n| W\u0142oc\u0142awek    |                                         3 |                                                1 |                                           41 |                                           8.5 |\n| Zandvliet    |                                        16 |                                                2 |                                           80 |                                           9.4 |",

Nevertheless, Solvay has been able to decrease by 19.9% its impact along the value chain in reference to 2018 this is still in line with the ambition to decrease the impact by 30% by 2030.\n\n## 5.4.4. Key achievements\n\nOur Paulinia site in Brazil was awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's (WHC) Gold Certificate in 2021. This is the highest level of certification awarded by the WHC, which is an international organization that promotes biodiversity conservation practices in the private sector. Following several decades of work to promote harmonious coexistence with nature, the site has become a hub for wildlife in the region. The certification has given the site a boost to continue increasing biodiversity protection and restoration. In 2022, a biologist was hired to conduct two inventories of species. These inventories led to the identification of 183 native fauna species, including reptiles, amphibians, insects, mammals, and birds. Endangered species were also identified, allowing us to plan conservation actions. For example, the puma which was specifically studied in order to help us protect its habitat.\n\nOur efforts to restore the Cuchia Quarry in Spain received a Cefic 08 recognition in 2021. The quarry supplied our site in Torrelavega with limestone for almost 80 years - from 1927 to 2006. Restoration efforts have been underway for the last 30 years, including when the quarry was still in operation.\n\nBiodiversity roadmap development and implementation has progressed well at two other European sites.\n\nAt Dombasle, a site located Eastern of France in the 'Lorraine' industrial emblematic area, several projects have been launched to protect species: the great horned owl in a quarry, fish and flora species in proximity with salt mines, and reptiles and amphibians on the production plant. A comprehensive project to restore an ecological corridor through several actions has also started. This includes biodiversity restoration around a water storage pond, management of invasive species and vegetation to allow migratory bird nesting in reed beds, planting hedges, and building wildlife shelters. The actions are going beyond compliance requirements and they are representing a great opportunity to sensitize employees, local communities, and to allow them to become actors of their natural environment.\n\nRegarding the Rosignano site located in the Tuscany region of Italy, pursuant to the September 5, 2022, cooperation and settlement agreement entered into between Solvay and one of its partner, Solvay undertook to publicly report on the implementation of its action plan regarding its soda ash operations at least annually, through its annual report or otherwise.\n\nThe action plan announced on September 6, 2022, to reduce limestone residues released into the sea from Solvay Chimica Italia's soda ash production in Rosignano, as part of the Group's efforts to continually optimize the efficiency and sustainability of its operations, and in line with the IPPC* permit renewed in January 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Represents an estimated \u20ac15 million investment in new technical and process solutions, some of which will require approval by the authorities. The plan will include targeted improvements at different steps of the production process, as well as an optimization of the limestone granulometry and quality.\n- \u00b7 By 2030, Solvay's objective is to lower by 20% the maximum volume of discharge currently set by its IPPC permit. Solvay will provide biannual progress updates to the authorities.\n- \u00b7 By 2040, Solvay's ambition is to reduce the discharge of limestone to 40% versus IPPC permit, through investment in research and innovation, in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, subject to permit granting and public interest priorities.",

Implementation of the roadmap started with several projects on the site and its surroundings, including reshaping and vegetation of a storage area, planting programs around the site, supportive actions towards several nature protection associations, and training/sensitization activities for the employees.\n\nIn addition, the Santa Luce Lake built in the 1960s to provide water to the plant has become a natural reserve. Certified as a Natura 2000 protected area, the reserve is also used for educational and scientific projects, including studies by the LIPU bird protection association. The reserve is fully connected with the local community in Santa Luce, which recognizes the importance of this reserve for economic, environmental, and social activities. The project was chosen to test the IUCN 09 Nature-based Solution standards - a tool used for projects providing environmental, economic, and social benefits.\n\n## 5.5.  Hazardous materials\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-23 3-3 403-7 416-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 3 6 12 14 15\n\n## 5.5.1. Definitions\n\nProduct stewardship means managing risks throughout a product's entire life cycle, from the design stage to end of life. Risks include the possibility of injury or impact on health for a third party or damage to third-party property arising from the misuse of Solvay products in a customer's plant or use in an application for which the product is not designed. Risk management is particularly important for products used in sensitive applications like healthcare or food and feed.\n\n## 5.5.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay's Responsible Care policy requires the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain a comprehensive understanding of each product's hazards, risks, and impacts related to all life-cycle steps and intended applications.\n- \u00b7 Manage product knowledge so as to comply with local requirements on product information, while ensuring worldwide consistency.\n- \u00b7 Keep records of all necessary and required product safety information to ensure availability throughout the full life cycle, beyond the commercialization period.\n- \u00b7 Send standardized product safety data sheets to customers along with the first delivery and when required by local regulations. This key information is consistently maintained and distributed worldwide for all products to all customers, in compliance with local regulations and in the local languages.\n\nIn line with our Responsible Care commitment, we are constantly improving our knowledge of how Solvay products are used and the associated risks. The extensive knowledge this represents allows Solvay to characterize and manage risks related to product handling and to prioritize mitigation actions related to potential inappropriate use. The management of Safety Data Sheets reflects this commitment to ensuring the information on hazards associated with our products is readily available to our employees and customers.\n\nSolvay ensures that our product portfolio complies with all the relevant regional and national chemical regulations such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances 10 ) in the European Union, UK REACH in the United Kingdom, K-REACH in South Korea, Chinese MEE order N\u00b012 in China, KKDIK in Turkey, and TSCA in the US.\n\nIn addition, Solvay has a strategy to decrease the use of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in marketed products and more broadly throughout the entire value chain. We consider the SVHCs on the EU REACH authorization list (annex XIV) and EU REACH candidate list, but we also go beyond this by including several lists coming from other countries (e.g., POP Stockholm Convention or Harmful Substances Prohibited from Manufacturing - ISHA, Korea), following an internal process in our operations worldwide. Specifically, we have set up our own reference list of SVHCs, the SolvaySVHC and Substance Requiring Attention (SRA). This was established in 2015 and includes three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Black list Solvay-SVHCs: Already undergoing a regulatory phase out process with a known deadline in at least one country or zone, or a restriction for uses relevant to Solvay.\n- \u00b7 Red list Solvay-SVHCs: Currently included in regulatory lists of substances that could enter into a process of special authorization or restriction in the medium term.\n- \u00b7 Yellow list S-SRAs: Substances requiring specific attention, such as substances under scrutiny by authorities, NGOs, scientists, and industries due to their known hazardous properties or potential effects.",

        "page_content": "Risk studies and Analysis of Safer Alternatives (ASA) for red and black Solvay-SVHCs placed on the market are underway, and substances are replaced with safer alternatives where feasible.\n\nNew ASA covering newly identified listed SVHC are being performed within one year. All current Analysis of Safer Alternatives are being reviewed every three years.\n\n## 5.5.3. Indicators\n\n## SAFETY DATA SHEETS\n\nSolvay currently places over 1,000 products on the market and produces safety data sheets (SDS) in 41 languages, as well as specific SDS for 63 countries. Product Stewardship programs give adequate information and technical assistance to customers, ensuring a good understanding of products and how to safely use and handle them. Each of our Global Business Units are responsible for ensuring that SDS are revised at least once every three years, or every time a substance undergoes significant modifications. Solvay manages product information centrally and as legislation continues to evolve the Group learns more about the conditions under which products are used, so as to record and assess any associated risks.\n\nTo make sure that customers are receiving new and updated Safety Data Sheets, and to limit the quantity of paper printed, Solvay uses an automatic system to send SDS by email. In 2023, this automated shipping function was activated for 100% of Solvay sales. This automatic delivery of the SDS was successful for 97.8% of shipments, where SDS were available for the delivery country and the customer's email address was also available. When errors occur, corrections are done and the SDS are automatically or manually sent.\n\n## PRODUCT REGISTRATION\n\nREACH is an advanced European framework regulation requiring companies to have detailed knowledge of substances, their hazards, and risks during use. This knowledge must be collected and organized into reliable and systematic safety information that includes all uses and risks incurred along the value chain. Solvay fully complies with the extensive REACH requirements for product registrations. We have registered 233 dossiers and are the lead or sole registrant for 95 substances. In accordance with the Cefic Action Plan program, we are also dedicated to improving the quality of REACH dossiers.\n\nRegular updates of dossiers are performed according to REACH obligations, either as new information becomes available or at the request of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA). We have carried out 20 REACH dossiers updates in 2022 and 19 in 2023.\n\nIn addition, Solvay continues to adapt to new product regulations in many countries, notably to cope with emerging, REACH-like regulations in non-European countries. More specifically we have:\n\n- \u00b7 registered 22 in 2021 for TIER One in the framework of Korean REACH and registered eight dossiers in 2023 for the next registration deadline in 2024 (TIER Two);\n- \u00b7 reported 64 substances or polymers to be registered in the framework of KKDIK Reach Turkey by December 31, 2023 (active dossiers), and registered 11 lead dossiers;\n- \u00b7 for UK REACH, Solvay successfully completed one new registration and 253 Downstream User Import Notifications (DUIN); and\n- \u00b7 submitted two substances in the framework of the new Chinese MEE order N\u00b012 in 2023.\n\n## Safer alternatives for marketed products: beyond legislative requirements\n\nSolvay is closely monitoring the Solvay-SVHCs on several worldwide relevant lists (banishment, restriction, etc.) including EU candidate list and EU authorization list by identifying all marketed products containing a concentration above 0.1% of those substances, sold not only in the EU but worldwide.\n\nWe go beyond what is required by regulation, screening our own broader internal reference list of substances of very high concern (Solvay-SVHCs, as described above) for our products marketed worldwide.\n\n|                                                                                   | Units   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| All Solvay-SVHCs (1) present in marketed products above 0.1% on a worldwide scope | Number  |     26 |     24 |\n| Analysis of safer alternatives required (2)                                       | Number  |     17 |     19 |\n| Of which completed                                                                | %       |     94 |     68 |\n| Of which effective replacement achieved                                           | %       |     13 |     15 |\n\n- (1)  According to the black and red Solvay-SVHC lists.

Of the 16 analyses of safer alternatives completed as of December 31, 2023, since the start of the program:\n\n- \u00b7 two have led to effective replacement, either through SVHC substitution or reduction below required threshold, or through stopping production.\n- \u00b7 two are ongoing, meaning that an alternative has been identified and discussed with customers for implementation.\n- \u00b7 twelve have resulted in no available alternatives, either because no substitute is available, there are regulatory obligations to use SVHC for some applications, or because an alternative has not been requested due to the application in the final product.\n\nThere is only one substance listed on the EU candidate list (Bisphenol A). It appears on the Solvay-SVHCs inventory because the analysis is done worldwide. However, it is neither marketed nor sold in the EU.\n\n## Solvay's ambition to phase out substances of very high concern\n\nSolvay aims to phase out the Solvay substances of very high concern (Solvay SVHC) present in marketed products at a quantity of more than 0.1%, whenever feasible.\n\n## 6. BETTER LIFE\n\n## 6.1.  Employee health and safety\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-25 3-3 403-1 403-2 403-3 403-4 403-5 403-6 403-7 403-8 403-9 403-10 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 3\n\n## 6.1.1. Definitions\n\nEmployee health and safety management encompasses occupational safety, industrial hygiene, and occupational health.\n\nOccupational safety is about preventing work-related injuries. Accidents are mostly linked to falls at the same level, human energy, such as pushing, pulling or striking an object, and exposure while opening a line or system.\n\nIndustrial hygiene management encompasses the assessment, monitoring, and management of workers' potential exposures to ergonomic, chemical, and physical hazards.\n\nOccupational health includes all the preventive actions undertaken in order to protect and promote physical and psychological health at work, both collectively and for each individual Solvay employee.\n\nIn mid-2020, Solvay began using the OSHA definitions of occupational accidents in order to comply with GRI and enable comparisons outside Solvay. These are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Occupational accident: A work-related unexpected and undesirable event resulting in damage or harm, namely injury or illness. Accidents on the way to or from home are not considered work-related unless the worker was traveling for Solvay at the time of the accident.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury or Illness (LTII): A work-related injury or illness that results in a work interruption of one or more days, not including the day of the accident.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury and Illness Rate (LTIIR): The number of LTIIs resulting from an accident per 200,000 work hours.\n- \u00b7 Reportable Injury and Illness (RII): Work-related injury or illness resulting from an accident with severity above first aid, according to US OSHA 29 CFR 1904.\n- \u00b7 Reportable Injury and Illness rate (RIIR): The number of reportable injuries or illnesses per 200,000 work hours.\n\n## 6.1.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay requirements for implementing management systems on our sites are covered under section 3.3. Health, safety, and environment management. The occupational health and safety management systems cover all Solvay employees, while external visitors, parcel delivery people, and transport drivers not performing loading or unloading on-site fall outside the scope. In addition, our safety management system applies to contractors.\n\nHazard identification and risk assessments are performed according to group procedures, which define minimum requirements for methods and the hierarchy of controls. They cover the following topics or activities:\n\n- \u00b7 chemical hazard communication;\n- \u00b7 chemical risk assessment and management;\n- \u00b7 hearing conservation (noise exposure management);\n- \u00b7 prevention of legionellosis;\n- \u00b7 managing asbestos in buildings and facilities;\n- \u00b7 respiratory protection equipment;\n- \u00b7 Group requirements for occupational health;",

Quality, evaluations, and process improvements are ensured through the sites' management systems. Site reporting processes identify unsafe situations, near-misses, incidents, or accidents, as well as those cases with potentially high severity, and also set guidelines for investigating incidents and taking corrective actions.\n\nRisk assessments are performed in collaboration with occupational health experts. Occupational physicians perform risk-based medical surveillance, provide advice on improving and adapting working conditions, and promote physical and mental health. All these processes contribute to managing and minimizing risks at work.\n\nOn the shop floor, workers collaborate with industrial hygienists on risk assessments using SOCRATES (Solvay Occupational Risk Assessment Tool for Employees). This tool gives widespread, easy access to IH methods, tools and databases, consistently performs and documents IH risk assessments, and enhances traceability of an individual's potential exposures throughout their working life. Workers are informed of their workrelated risks by supervisors, industrial hygienists, and occupational physicians or nurses.\n\nFormal joint management-worker health and safety committees are established on our sites according to country legislation. Solvay also contributes to complementary health insurance, for which the terms vary according to the country.\n\nInitiatives to promote health are taken at site level, in collaboration with local physicians and nurses. Examples of such initiatives include nutritional advice, cardiovascular prevention programs, general check-ups, and fitness sessions led by trainers.\n\n## 6.1.3. Indicators\n\nThe occupational health and safety indicators result from the safety culture approach implemented to protect everyone working at Solvay. This approach is explained in the Risk Management chapter of this Annual Integrated Report.\n\nSolvay started recording reportable injuries and illnesses on July 1, 2020.\n\nThe reporting scope covers all sites under Solvay's operational control for which the Group manages and monitors safety performance. This includes our manufacturing, research and innovation, and administrative sites, as well as a series of closed sites with limited activities, and covers Solvay employees and contractors working on these sites.\n\n## NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS\n\n|                                   | Units   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Fatal accidents - Employees       | Number  |      0 |      0 |\n| Fatal accidents - Contractors     | Number  |      0 |      0 |\n| H-RII - Employees                 | Number  |      7 |      7 |\n| H-RII - Contractors               | Number  |      4 |      4 |\n| H-RII - Employees and contractors | Number  |     11 |     11 |\n| RII - Employees                   | Number  |     27 |     25 |\n| RII - Contractors                 | Number  |     18 |     22 |\n| RII - Employees and contractors   | Number  |     45 |     47 |\n| LTII - Employees                  | Number  |     17 |     14 |\n| LTII - Contractors                | Number  |     12 |     17 |\n| LTII - Employees and contractors  | Number  |     30 |     31 |\n\nNote: RII was introduced in mid-2020.

The 0.27 performance is the result of the following actions implemented in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Interactive safety dialogues in the field.\n- \u00b7 Site leadership spending more time in the field.\n- \u00b7 Near misses reporting.\n- \u00b7 Process safety reporting including low events and actions.\n- \u00b7 Solvay Life Saving Rules improvement initiatives with a focus on the top three based on incidents and audit findings to focus efforts on management of change, work on powered systems, and line breaking. Engage everyone at the site level.\n- \u00b7 Field check assessment on a quarterly basis.\n- \u00b7 Interactive workshops on these three Solvay Life Saving Rules to discuss each identified Solvay Life Saving Rules.\n\n## Industrial hygiene (IH)\n\nA key aspect of our approach to protecting health is the systematic assessment and management of workers' potential exposure to ergonomic, chemical, and physical hazards. Global industrial hygiene (IH) procedures define minimum requirements for Solvay's IH risk assessments and management strategies, including the hierarchy of controls. The IH program encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive chemical inventories established and reviewed at site level, with screening and priority ranking of substances that carry potential health impacts.\n- \u00b7 Solvay Acceptable Exposure Limits (SAELs) developed internally for insufficient or outdated established Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs).\n- \u00b7 Occupational Exposure Banding (OEB) in cases where no established OEL exists or there is limited toxicological data. Solvay's OEB approach provides a simple, quick, and easy-to-understand hazard ranking.\n- \u00b7 Implementation of SOCRATES, a global tool at identified sites, ensuring:\n- -widespread and easy access to IH methods, tools, and databases;\n- -consistent performance and documentation of IH risk assessments; and\n- -enhanced traceability of an individual's potential exposures throughout their working life.\n- \u00b7 Established KPIs that allow for identification and tracking of the completion of site chemical and noise risk assessments.",

The number of occupational illnesses covers Solvay workers who are active, retired, or have left the company. In 2023, four of the five recognized occupational diseases were in retired workers, related to past asbestos exposure. One case of hearing loss was found in an active worker.\n\nThe figures of 2022 and 2021 have been recalculated for the new Solvay Company.\n\nThe majority of the recognized Occupational Illnesses from previous years (2022 and 2021) have been allocated to the perimeter of the new Solvay Company, while the number of hours worked concerns only the new Solvay Company.

        "page_content": "Transport safety incidents are incidents occurring during the movement of a chemical product such as:\n\n- \u00b7 loading or unloading at a Solvay site;\n- \u00b7 circulating inside a Solvay site in a vehicle, on the way in or out of the site;\n- \u00b7 circulating on public roads, rail, air, inland waterways or sea; and\n- \u00b7 loading or unloading at an off-site location, if Solvay or a logistics provider contracted by Solvay is performing the loading or unloading.\n\n## 6.2.2. Management approach\n\n## Process safety\n\nProcess Safety Management is a management system for designing and operating industrial processes that handle large quantities of hazardous chemicals. The topic applies to production sites and research and innovation center sites under operational control where a process risk may be identified. This is an operational perimeter excluding all sites that are not in the process scope: administrative sites, business, engineering, corporate, environmental rehabilitation, etc., but also external warehouses, quarries, and mines, among others. For preventing and controlling incidents in industrial processes, Solvay applies the Process Safety Management PSM Principles on all industrial sites, regardless of whether the site is covered by regulatory requirements.\n\n## Key elements are:\n\n- \u00b7 Completion of Process Hazard Analyses to identify high-risk situations. These are performed on each unit with a unique risk matrix to quantify the risk level of every potential accidental scenario, combining severity and probability factors.\n- \u00b7 Activation of an Emergency Response Plan in case of severe incidents on site. Relevant internal and external parties are informed through the application of Solvay's crisis management procedure. If needed, the Corporate Crisis Cell (crisis alert duty 24/7) is also activated.\n- \u00b7 Systematic analysis of each incident is carried out as soon as possible, in order to identify root causes and implement preventive actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.\n- \u00b7 Central reporting of Process Safety Incidents. The incident severity - medium, high, or catastrophic - is assessed by applying internal criteria, including consequences on-site or off-site, damage to the immediate vicinity, and quantity of spilled material.\n- \u00b7 Publication of process safety bulletins for significant incidents, distributed to all sites. These bulletins are used by the sites as support materials for safety talks to increase the process safety knowledge of employees.\n\n## Transport safety\n\nThe major goal of the Transport Safety Management system is a reduction in incidents that could lead to catastrophic consequences.

Root cause analysis, including actions to prevent recurrence and lessons-learned bulletins are mandatory for all high and catastrophic severity incidents, and for medium severity incidents resulting in a fire or an explosion, as well as for HSPos (High Severity Potential) Incidents. These are low or medium severity incidents or near misses that might have been worse (high or catastrophic) if the circumstances had been slightly different.\n\n## TRANSPORT SAFETY INCIDENTS\n\n|                 | Units   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Medium severity | Number  |      4 |      4 |\n| High severity   | Number  |      1 |      0 |\n| Catastrophic    | Number  |      0 |      0 |\n\n## 6.3.  Labor practices\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-30 3-3 401-2 403-4 407-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 3 8\n\n## 6.3.1. Definitions\n\nEmployee engagement is the level of commitment, passion, and loyalty an employee has toward their work, team, and company. Solvay believes that engagement increases performance through higher productivity and employee retention and that engagement is fostered by fair labor practices and well-being at work.\n\nA constructive relationship with employees and their representatives, built on trust, is considered the basis of fair labor practices at Solvay. This relationship reflects the Group's commitment to respect employees' fundamental human rights and guarantee their social rights.\n\nWell-being at work is a holistic concept which relates to all aspects of the quality of working life that ensure workers are safe, physically and mentally healthy, satisfied, engaged, and efficient. It addresses recognition and support, work-life balance, employee growth and development, and good communication and collaboration, based on International Labor Organization and World Health Organization definitions.\n\n## 6.3.2. Management approach\n\n## Pulse surveys\n\nEmployee engagement is measured through confidential surveys open to all employees. This includes global surveys as well as local initiatives, such as 'Voice of the People' surveys. The results of our surveys enable the Group, local management, and all operational managers to identify strengths and areas where the working environment and employee experience can be improved.\n\nIn 2023 we continued our series of short Pulse surveys. Two surveys took place in March and September 2023. Available in 14 languages, the Pulse surveys enable us to listen to the feedback and opinions of Solvay employees around the world. This not only promotes a feedback culture, where everyone can safely share their opinions and have open conversations with their team and leaders, but also helps to improve employee experience at work. Our objective was to equip leaders at all levels in the organization with insights about the well-being and experience of their team, foster open dialogue, and ensure continuous improvement throughout the year.\n\nIn November 2022, we conducted a survey for a diagnosis on well-being at work and DEI in collaboration with the University Jaume I. The data was analyzed in 2023, group and site reports were done, and actions were defined accordingly. More detail is provided in the next section 'Better Life at work.'",

        "page_content": "## Better Life at Work\n\nSince October 2016, a multidisciplinary Committee on Better Life at Work (BLAW) has been in place to define and promote a well-being at work (WBAW) program. It includes occupational physicians and psychologists, human resources experts, health, safety, and environment experts, Global Business Unit representatives, and sustainable development experts, representing all regions.\n\nIn 2021, a new Better Life at Work strategy was launched, focused on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance: A multidisciplinary Better Life at Work Steering Committee, including representatives from our Human Resources (HR), Occupational Medicine, Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE), and Sustainable Development Functions, and an employee representative. Solvay's Chief People Officer serves as the Sponsor.\n- \u00b7 Observatory: The Better Life at Work Observatory includes (1) indicators gathered from HR and HSE data (absenteeism, accidentability, turnover, and diversity) displayed in the Better Life dashboard, (2) the quarterly Pulse surveys, (3) diagnosis and assessment on well-being at work and DEI (HERO-DEI, see below), and (4) the Burnout Observatory. Managers can consult the indicators in the dashboard.\n- \u00b7 Positive actions: These are defined using the information gathered through the Observatory. In 2023, training sessions on well-being at work were provided to employees and managers (see below). Solvay offers mental health support for employees thanks to a global contract with WorkPlace Options, also covering employees' family members, and the global network of occupational physicians and nurses.\n\nFor diagnosis and assessment on well-being at work we have collaborated with the University of Jaume I in Spain since 2001. They are involved with a similar approach in the European H-Work Project aiming to promote mental health in small- and medium-sized enterprises and public workplaces, drawing on funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, we carried out a HERODEI survey in November 2022, which included a diagnosis on well-being at work (HERO model) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion). This helps us to assess which risk factors we need to address for well-being at work, as well as the positive factors that we can build on to create a sustainable Better Life at Work. The participation rate was 64.7%. The results at company and site level were analyzed at the beginning of 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Each site with a participation rate above 40% received its own report in order to set their action plan. This is also included in our project STAR Factory. Seventy sites of the new Solvay received their report. In each report there was a benchmark with Solvay, an identification of the key drivers for engagement and burnout risk, and recommendations by priorities. Several explicative and sharing sessions were organized, as well as support.\n- \u00b7 At company level the main drivers impacting well-being were:\n\n1) Positive drivers (Resources): Support to individual development, Recognition from the leader, Inclusive leader; and\n\n2) Negative drivers (Demands): Role ambiguity, Mobbing risk, Emotional dissonance.\n\nRecommended actions were mainly oriented on Positive and Inclusive leadership, and on increasing Engagement and decreasing Burnout risk by acting in the main drivers mentioned above. That is why we decided to put a focus on leaders, offering worldwide training about 'Leading with a well-being mindset.'\n\nBetween October 2022 and May 2023, workshops on leading with a well-being mindset were provided to leaders in all countries in collaboration with Empreinte Humaine. In total, 1,438 leaders were trained, in 150 sessions, 13 languages, and 18 countries, being the majority of them presential (these figures also include Syensqo). They covered topics such as healthy work, healthy leadership, and providing healthy support to collaborators. More than 75% of leaders rated the workshop very useful.\n\n## Solvay Global Forum\n\nRegarding labor relations, discussions and activities are held at four levels: site, country, European, and global.\n\nIn 2015, Solvay created a global employee representative body, the Solvay Global Forum, composed of employee representatives from the main areas where Solvay operates, namely Europe, the US, Brazil, and China. Video conferences are held quarterly, bringing together the Solvay Global Forum and the Group's top management to comment on and discuss the Group's quarterly results and to keep everyone informed of the main new projects, like the Partial Demerger project. Two agreements have been signed with the Solvay Global Forum: Global Performance Sharing 2023 and Solvay Cares, the latter of which extended maternity and co-parent leave to 16 weeks. An ad hoc spin-off committee has also been set up, bringing together members of the Solvay Global Forum and the European Works Council to cover this major project.\n\n## European Works Council\n\nWe have been in permanent dialogue with our European Works Council (EWC) for more than 20 years. In 2023, the EWC met physically on several occasions and the EWC Secretariat met on a monthly basis, either virtually or physically, with senior group management, to help steer Solvay's evolution. The main topics discussed were the Partial Demerger project and Solvay's and Syensqo's new operating models, actions taken by the Group to face the consequences of the Ukraine war, the energy crisis, the support given to employees to cope with high inflation, the Group Sustainable Development strategy, and Solvay's financial results.",

        "page_content": "## Solvay Cares\n\nIn February 2017 Solvay signed a global agreement guaranteeing a minimum level of welfare and healthcare protection for companies in which Solvay SA owns a share, directly or indirectly, of more than 50%. Solvay Cares was fully deployed in 2019 and aims to provide four major benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 full income protection during parental leave, with 16 weeks for both parents;\n- \u00b7 a minimum coverage of 75% of medical fees in the event of hospitalization or severe illness;\n- \u00b7 disability insurance in the event of lasting incapacity; and\n- \u00b7 life insurance, including coverage for the family or partner.\n\nAn addendum to the agreement was signed in December 2021, introducing more flexibility for parents to enjoy parental leave according to family needs, and adding the Employee Well-being Support program, through which we committed to giving all employees access to confidential mental health support as of December 2021. Since January 2023, globally aligned standards of the Employee Well-being Support Program have been applied, ensuring coverage not only for the employee, but also for all members of the employee's household. In 2023, a task force has been set up to initiate a Fair Living Wage program with a pilot in three countries: US, China, and UK. The initiative will be continued in 2024 and extended to other countries with a commitment to cover 100% of Solvay employees by 2026. In 2023, we have also introduced the caregiver leave: a maximum of five days to support or care for a loved one.\n\n## The IndustriALL Global Union Framework Agreement\n\nOn December 17, 2013, Solvay signed a Corporate Social and Environmental Agreement for the whole group with IndustriALL Global Union. This agreement is based on International Labor Organization standards and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. It is a tangible expression of Solvay's determination to ensure that basic labor rights and the Group's social standards in the areas of health, safety, and environmental protection are respected at all of our sites.\n\nIn March 2022, we renewed our Global Framework Agreement with IndustriALL. We strengthened the content of the agreement in several important areas, including teleworking rights, EU due diligence and UN binding treaty relating to the supply chain, just transition, skills transfer, and workers' rights to health and safety.\n\nWith this renewed and strengthened agreement, Solvay commits to respecting the international social standards defined by the International Labor Organization and the principles of the UN Global Compact, including in countries that have not ratified it, as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nThe four-year agreement includes serious commitments on due diligence along the supply chain. The agreement establishes a new working group of workers and management to investigate suppliers' respect for core labor rights and seek remediation where problems are found. Solvay commits to suspend contracts with suppliers that fail to remedy human rights and environmental abuses following warnings.\n\nIn 2023, IndustriALL representatives, together with Solvay management, visited three of our German subsidiaries in order to assess labor relations. It was an opportunity to confirm the positive working atmosphere, safety situation and industrial relations, and to identify areas for improvement.\n\n## 6.3.3. Indicators\n\nIn 2023, two Pulse surveys were launched in March and September to measure employee engagement worldwide. An average of 6,000 responses were gathered with a response rate of around 67%.\n\nEach survey asked ~15 questions measuring several topics important to the organization such as well-being, motivation, performance and recognition, safety, ethics and compliance, and organizational transformation.\n\nAdditionally, employees were asked how they were feeling with over 77% on average feeling 'OK or better' which is slightly better than last year. In addition to our Employee Assistance Program, Solvay has put together a guide for managers to help them better support their teams and a flier for all employees, available in multiple languages. These provide guidance and suggestions about where to turn for help and encouragement, in order to better support individuals who have reported feeling 'less than OK.'\n\n## DURING THE LAST FOUR WEEKS, IN GENERAL, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING?\n\n|              | Units   |   March 23 |   Sept. 2023 |\n|--------------|---------|------------|--------------|\n| OK or better | %       |         77 |           78 |\n| Less than OK | %       |         23 |           22 |\n\nWe also include two engagement questions in our Pulse survey annually. This revealed that about 76% of employees were satisfied with Solvay as an employer and that about 72% would recommend the company as a great place to work.",

This is the IndustriALL Global Union Framework Agreement which is behind the creation of the Solvay Global Forum, and a signatory to agreements such as the Solvay Care Agreement and the Solvay Profit Sharing plan.\n\nTrade unions are present at a majority of Solvay sites around the world. Union membership is estimated at 30% in Europe, 25% in South America, 6% in the US, 40% in Mexico and 45% in APAC (AU, JP, KR) with the exception of China (99%).\n\n## 6.3.4. Key achievements\n\n## First Employee Share Purchase Plan launched with high level of subscription\n\nIn December 2021, the Group launched a Global employee shareholding initiative that the Solvay Global forum wished to be an inclusive, simple, and meaningful way to create sustainable shared value for all. The Solvay Shares program is now operational to employees around the world, irrespective of their position or grading (excluding executive management). Employees get one free share on registration, then one free share for every two shares purchased. For every two shares they own after a lock-in period. Of our employees, 38% from 22 countries have subscribed to these shares, and get the same rights as every other shareholder. This program should increase employees' understanding of the Group's performance, as well as their sense of belonging.\n\n## 2023 Solvay Cares Agreement: A new commitment that supports caregiving\n\nIn 2023, Solvay CEO and Solvay Global Forum Coordinator have signed a new Solvay Cares Agreement. In addition to the current benefits, Solvay now supports employees with caregiving duties. Employees can take a maximum of five days a year to handle unexpected situations where they must care for a loved one.\n\nSolvay opened a bank of days off and offered 40 days off to launch the program. Employees can also donate days off to their colleagues.\n\nSolvay Cares already offers a minimum level of protection in terms of welfare and healthcare for all its employees worldwide. This protection includes major healthcare costs, disability leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption leave, support of the family in the case of the death of an employee, and employee well-being support - and now caregiving is included. One of the key measures we took recently was to broaden our Solvay Cares benefits by providing 16 weeks of parental leave to all co-parents employed by the company regardless of gender.\n\n## 6.4.  Diversity and inclusion\n\nGRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 405-1 405-2 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 8\n\n## 6.4.1. Definitions\n\nSolvay defines diversity, equity, and inclusion in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity: The representation of various identities and differences of individuals in a group.\n- \u00b7 Equity: Creating equal access to opportunity by recognizing the existence of advantages for some and barriers for others, promoting justice, impartiality and fairness within procedures, processes and distribution of resources by institutions and systems.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion: Actively and intentionally engaging people with different identities and enabling them to feel valued, able to fully contribute, and be welcomed within a given setting.\n\nManagement categories are defined on the basis of the Hay Job Evaluation Methodology:\n\n- \u00b7 Senior management: Hay points 924 and above.\n- \u00b7 Middle management: Hay points from 531 to 923.\n- \u00b7 Junior management: Hay points from 304 to 530.\n\nFor the Diversity and inclusion indicators, the active internal workforce on the December 31, 2023, has been considered.\n\n## 6.4.2. Management approach\n\nWe have identified nine action plans to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity\n- -Accelerate gender parity at all mid and senior levels.\n- -Make our workplace more accessible for people with disabilities.\n- -Develop Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to create both a diverse work environment and an inclusive culture within the organization.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity\n\n- -Assess if there are undesired pay gaps and close them.\n- -Ensure fair recruitment: all mid and senior level job openings to have a shortlist comprising 50% of under-represented groups, including women.\n- -Ensure equitable access to career opportunities and development: set up mentor/mentee programs starting with under-represented groups.",

This 49 headcount gap has been allocated Syensqo (60.45%, i.e., -30 headcounts) and the new Solvay (39.55%, i.e., -19 headcounts).\n\nAccording to the above table, the age structure is currently:\n\n- \u00b7 34% older than 50;\n- \u00b7 56% between the ages of 30 and 49; and\n- \u00b7 11% younger than 30.\n\nSolvay performs regular employee surveys to take the pulse of its workforce. Once per year, the survey is dedicated to measuring the feeling of inclusion and well-being; however, due to the Solvay spin-off in 2023, the next inclusion and well-being survey was postponed to 2024.\n\nEmployees have the ability to self-identify, allowing the identification of any inclusion experience gaps. Based on the 2022 survey, which was answered by 64.6% of Solvay's workforce:\n\n- \u00b7 4% of respondents self-identified as having a disability (visible or invisible, such as mental health challenges);\n- \u00b7 2% of respondents self-identified as LGBTQ+; and\n- \u00b7 8% of respondents self-identified as a member of an ethnically under-represented group in the country that they live in.\n\n## RATIO OF BASIC SALARY OF WOMEN TO MEN BY MANAGEMENT CATEGORY\n\nThe table below represents the ratio of unadjusted (without correction for seniority) average pay between male and female employees where the average pay of male employees is 1.00:\n\n| Country   |   Junior management |   Middle management | Senior management   |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Belgium   |                1.19 |                0.94 | 0.66                |\n| Brazil    |                1    |                1.05 | 1.07                |\n| China     |                1.11 |                0.97 | ND                  |\n| France    |                0.97 |                0.98 | 0.62                |\n| Italy     |                0.96 |                0.89 | ND                  |\n| US        |                1    |                1.01 | ND                  |\n\n- **Not Disclosed (ND): Too few data points in one or two measurement groups to make a statistically meaningful measurement.\n\nWe created a statistically-sound model for computing an 'expected salary' by country and job class, against which we measured pay gaps. On that basis a pay gap review was conducted for 951 employees that were identified as priority for manual analysis. When the pay gap could not be objectively justified by performance, seniority, or another objective reason, it led to an off-cycle salary increase, performed in January 2023. This exercise was conducted in a gender neutral manner.\n\n## 6.4.4. Key achievements\n\n## Driving momentum and engagement through our Employee Resource groups (ERGs)\n\nThis year, we had a total of nine employee resource groups (ERGs) led and driven by our employees to create a network and community for the diversity of our company. The Voice of Asia ERG, aimed at establishing mutual understanding between Asian and Western cultures, officially launched, sharing their mission with individuals with the company. In addition, our LGBTQ+ Alliance ERG created the Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Support group and spearheaded a new partnership with The GenderCool Project, a US non-profit helping replace negative stereotypes and misinformation about being transgender and non-binary, presenting the world with positive stories about young non-binary and transgender people who are thriving.\n\nCo-sponsored by the LGBTQ+ Alliance ERG, our site in Anan, Japan, collaborated with the Japan LGBT Association to further engage employees on DEI. A seminar was held in which over 70 participants attended both on-site and virtually. In addition, the Japan LGBT Association welcomed a member of the LGBTQ+ Alliance to speak on their radio show to discuss Solvay and its DEI activities.",

Key achievements\n\nIn 2023, Solvay made a significant push towards DEI, through different initiatives such as the collection of information from candidates and employees - on a voluntary and self-declaration basis - to better understand the strengths and room for actions. Additionally, two major partnerships were built with major DEI associations to better diffuse inclusion culture within the Group and promote our engagement on this important matter.\n\nOn the recruitment angle, the Group started to develop an in-depth workforce needs planning, to accelerate both internal movement, and offer more opportunities to our people, as well as external hiring to secure attracting the best talent on the market.\n\nAs a recognition of our people strategy, Solvay has been awarded as a Great Place to Work \u00ae for three of our most important countries around the globe. This recognition is granted following a survey conducted among all local employees, assessing various angles of our HR practices.\n\nLinked with our Partial Demerger roadmap, special care was provided for employees in order to mitigate the changes and impact, while ensuring business continuity, through access to dedicated well-being moments, peer-to-peer sessions, and deepened HR support. This was also a major opportunity for many colleagues to take part of once-in-a-lifetime projects and acquire new skills.\n\nOne of the most powerful enablers for employees has been the rollout of our STAR Factory massive investment program. Aiming to reshape the future of our manufacturing sites, it has proven to be a unique learning experience for hundreds of people at all levels, discovering new skills, enhancing digital capabilities, and opening new career paths.\n\nOver the past year, our organization has made remarkable progress in advancing the skills and knowledge of our team. The Sales Academy launched 15 extensive courses, blending e-learning with instructor-led sessions, attracting 424 unique participants for a total of 1,035 course completions, highlighting our commitment to ongoing learning and professional growth.\n\nOur Leadership Academy's journey saw 222 leaders participate, reflecting our dedication to cultivating leadership excellence. The involvement of eight ambassadors significantly enhanced our global presence and organizational growth. The Career Catalyst Program, offering self-reflection and career development resources, engaged 172 employees in 2023. Additionally, language development through Rosetta Stone was utilized by 718 employees and their families, covering 14 languages.\n\nIn 2023, our workforce at Solvay dedicated 4,771 hours to skill enhancement via the digital platform, averaging 2.3 hours per person. This substantial commitment to skill development projects demonstrates Solvay's focus on nurturing a knowledgeable and adaptable workforce ready to meet the dynamic demands of the industry.\n\n## 6.6.

Our initiatives in each of these three categories are closely aligned with our business, including our active involvement in several flagship endeavors that truly reflect the way we partner with our stakeholders.\n\n## 6.6.2. Management approach\n\nThe Corporate Citizenship Steering Committee is composed of five members and chaired by Solvay's Chief Executive Officer. The Committee gathers three times a year, approves budgets, and decides on projects costing \u20ac50,000 or more.\n\nBusiness Programs for Social Needs are programs that generate business value through addressing social needs. These programs fall under the governance of the relevant GBU.\n\nSite directors are accountable for developing and implementing each site's societal actions plan. This involves assembling a dedicated working group including the site director, HR manager, communication manager, local sustainability correspondent, and employee representatives. Employee initiatives are encouraged and supported. An example of this is our Citizen Day actions: the concept is proposed by the Corporate Citizenship committee, but implemented by the individual sites.\n\n## 6.6.3. Indicators\n\n## Citizen Day 2023\n\nCitizen Day gives employees around the world the opportunity to engage in actions with local communities. The event was created in 2019 to encourage employees to act for the planet and local communities.\n\nCitizen Day 2023 focused on our 160th anniversary celebration. Over the course of the year, we've taken a closer look at the early days of Solvay, the role of women in Solvay's history, and our commitment to science, social responsibility, and sustainability, and the spirit of mentorship.\n\nCitizen Day 2023 saw employees across all sites worldwide take action to create a better future through mentorship, hosting open days with local communities, hosting a webcast with a top expert on the chemistry of cooking, and organizing workshops and games for employees to re-discover and celebrate Solvay's major milestones. Citizen Day activities took place at global, site, team, and individual levels, and in both virtual and in-person formats.\n\nKey figures from Citizen Day 2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 6,900 participations, of which 2,600 external people from local communities taking part in our open days, volunteering or mentoring events;\n- \u00b7 more than 40 activities across the board; and\n- \u00b7 21 participating sites.\n\n## Local societal actions in 2023\n\nSolvay defines societal actions as a volunteer activity developed by our sites, extending beyond our established boundaries, with the goal of generating positive impact on society or addressing social and environmental challenges. These actions are carried out and designed to promote well-being, contribute to the betterment of communities, and align with one or more of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIn 2023, on the basis of voluntary reporting, 35 sites reported that more than 4,000 participants had participated in societal actions, while noting that an employee may have participated in several actions.\n\nThe total amount donated through societal actions is around \u20ac400,000, on the basis of voluntary reporting.\n\nSocietal actions invested in education, mentoring, and training for students and children. Sites opened their doors to the community, offered students training programs, and training to raise awareness on sustainable development. Societal actions supported local communities through investments in accessibility and landscaping, food donations, blood donations, clothing collections, and essential goods distributions.\n\n## 6.6.4. Major projects\n\n## CERN: Fostering interest in STEM and STEM careers\n\nThe CERN-Solvay Education Programme was launched in January 2022. Designed to foster interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and STEM careers, the program combines both online and on-site learning at CERN, starting with education content aimed at a global online audience and progressing to an opportunity for students to engage more deeply with research at CERN.\n\nThe program is part of the education portfolio of Science Gateway, CERN's new flagship project for science education and outreach. The program has three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Online social media education content.\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Online courses for high school students.\n- \u00b7 Level 3: On-site international Solvay camp.",

It consists of a 16-meter long, 32-tonne truck that unfolds into a laboratory capable of accommodating a complete class of 10-14-year-old students, giving them an opportunity to experience science in a positive way, encouraging them to consider scientific and technological careers as a serious option. The laboratory truck goes from school to school, getting young people in Belgium involved in science. The approach is supported by the Ministers of Education of the three Belgian communities and the objective is to welcome three classes to the truck per day.\n\n## 7. SUSTAINABLE PORTFOLIO\n\n## 7.1.

The SPM methodology is designed to boost Solvay's business performance and deliver higher growth, by letting decision makers know how our products contribute to sustainability with regard to two factors:\n\n- \u00b7 The environmental footprint related to their production and associated risks and opportunities, based on cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessments (from resource extraction to the factory gate, before it is transported to the consumer).\n- \u00b7 How their applications create benefits or challenges from a market perspective, based on a qualitative assessment using a cradle-to-cradle scope.\n\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for compiling inputs and outputs, along with an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle. LCA methodologies follow international standards, namely ISO 14040, ISO 14044, and ISO 14046 norms.\n\nA sustainable solution is defined by Solvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management tool as a product in a given application that makes a greater social and environmental contribution to the customer's performance and, at the same time, demonstrates a lower environmental impact in its production phase.\n\n## 7.1.2. Management approach\n\nSPM assessments are performed every year in order to capture the most recent signals from the market and cover more than 80% of group revenue. Since its implementation in 2009, the Sustainable Portfolio Management tool has been widely adopted by Solvay Global Business Units and Functions to integrate sustainability into their key processes:\n\n- \u00b7 The Sustainable Portfolio Management profile is an integral part of strategic discussions between Global Business Units and the Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 The SPM tool is used to evaluate merger and acquisition projects, to determine whether an investment is feasible in light of Sustainable Portfolio targets.\n- \u00b7 Investment decisions (capital expenditure above \u20ac4 million and acquisitions) made by the Executive Committee or the Board of Directors include a sustainability aspect that involves an exhaustive SPM analysis of the potential investment.\n- \u00b7 All research and innovation projects are evaluated using SPM.\n- \u00b7 SPM is used in marketing and sales to engage customers on fact-based sustainability topics, such as climate change action, renewable energy, recycling, and air quality, with the goal of differentiating and creating value for Solvay and the customer.\n\nSolvay Life Cycle Assessments are managed by a dedicated corporate team with direct links to all business units and services. Having a dedicated LCA team makes it possible to maintain a high level of staff competency and coordinate updates of the main methodologies used based on best practice. Core LCA activity is based on recognized tools, software, and databases, and we also have our own database, specific to Solvay business and innovation segments.\n\nThe LCA team is also called upon to support business activity concerning customer relations, by sharing environmental and LCA data on products to enhance understanding and environmental impact assessments along the value chain, from cradle-to-grave or recycling. Examples include the automotive sector, the construction sector, and Product Carbon Footprint declarations for our customers.",

        "page_content": "## Taking part in world class Life Cycle Assessment platforms\n\nTo maintain a high level of LCA expertise, we participated in 2023 in the following collaborative platforms:\n\n- \u00b7 International Reference Centre for the Life Cycle of Products, Processes and Services (CIRAIG): Solvay joined CIRAIG in 2012 as an industrial partner, ensuring access to high level research and expertise on Life Cycle Assessment methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Association Chimie du V\u00e9g\u00e9tal: Solvay is a member of this association in France focused on the use of bio-sourced materials in chemistry.\n- \u00b7 SCORE Life Cycle Assessment platform: This platform was created in March 2012 to promote collaboration between industrial, institutional, and scientific actors, and to foster positive developments in environmental quantification methods, particularly in Life Cycle Assessments, to be shared and recognized at European and international levels.\n- \u00b7 Roundtable for Product Social Metrics: This association of industry representatives and consultants establishes guidelines for assessing the social impacts of industrial product life cycles.\n- \u00b7 SETAC: Solvay has been a member of the SETAC LCA steering committee, an incubator for developing life cycle assessment (LCA) to advance the science, practice, and application of LCAs to reduce the resource consumption and environmental burdens associated with products, packaging, processes, or activities.\n\n## 7.1.3. Indicators\n\nIn 2023, we continued to perform cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessments to cover our new products and the product changes. LCA team manages a product database which is continuously updated to include the most recent industrial or innovation data.\n\n## REVENUE BREAKDOWN BY SPM HEAT MAP CATEGORIES\n\n|               | Units   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Solutions     | %       |     44 |     43 |\n| Potentials    | %       |     15 |     15 |\n| Transitions   | %       |     23 |     26 |\n| Challenges    | %       |     10 |      8 |\n| Not evaluated | %       |      8 |      9 |\n\nIn 2023, the proportion of net sales from sustainable solutions improved by one percentage point. Although the net sales decreased about 12% between 2022 and 2023, our sales of products in Solutions decreased only by 9%, explaining this increase and showing that those products are offering a unique solution in the market. This is driven by the automotive market with Silica, the air and water treatments with Soda Ash and Peroxides, and better market alignment of our solutions toward sustainability with Peroxides.\n\nLast year, we substituted the Neutral category with two new categories: Transitions and Potentials. The Potentials category mirrors the potential to join the Solutions category by acting on the manufacturing environmental footprint which do not have negative nor outstanding sustainability performance, if any. These are products that consumers need, but which environmental footprint can be improved. The Transitions category identifies low negative sustainability.\n\nStarting in 2024, the SPM tool will be reviewed in order to help us to track and follow new ESG material risks and opportunities. All the analysis and results will also help to support the Group strategy.\n\n## External validation\n\nSince 2009, with the exception of 2019 and 2020, Arthur D. Little (ADL), our partner in developing and improving our SPM methodology, has performed an in-depth verification of our market alignment results. In 2022, ADL screened every Product Application Combination in the database and 70 PACs were selected for deeper review, covering about 15% of the global net sales. In 2023, there was no review performed by Arthur D. Little (ADL).",

Definitions\n\nCircular economy is a sustainable approach to business that aims to decouple economic growth from consumption of natural resources. Solvay's Circular Economy Business Solution Program is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources. It is based on three principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Shifting our product portfolio to bio-based feedstocks, recycled-based feedstock, and CO 2 -captured based feedstock.\n- \u00b7 Retaining the value of the products and materials currently in use by enabling product recycling (process additives and technology) or recyclability by design.\n- \u00b7 Designing products that increase the longevity of reusable materials.\n\nWe use the following definitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable resources: Materials that are continually replenished at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of depletion. This includes plant-based materials from cultivation and animal-based materials from breeding. To fit in a circular economy, the material should be produced from food waste or using regenerative production practices.\n- \u00b7 Renewable energy: Energy produced from renewable resources, namely solar, wind, hydroelectric power, biomass, or geothermal. Energy provided by technological waste, such as solid recovered fuels, is not considered. Sales of energy to third parties are not included.\n- \u00b7 Products enabling increased durability: Products designed to increase the longevity and durability of other products further down in the value chain in such a way that encourages longer use than the industry standard and at scale, without compromising circularity at the end of the product's functional life.\n- \u00b7 Products enabling recycling: Products designed to increase the recycling yield, with regard to quality and quantity.\n\nThe measurement of products based on recycled or renewable materials and renewable energy is weighted by applying a factor of 85% to renewable materials and 15% to renewable energy, according to the average manufacturing cost weight. A similar approach has been defined at the research and innovation level to monitor the contribution of innovation projects to Solvay's circularity ambition.\n\n## 7.2.2. Management approach\n\nWe define circular revenues as revenues generated with products and solutions that meet the following specific requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 made of bio-based, recycled-based, and CO 2 captured carbon based raw materials, or produced with renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 designed to increase the lifespan of end-products in such a way that encourages longer use than the industry standard in practice and at scale (e.g., marketing repair rather than replacement, timeless design with durable material choices) and in such a way that does not compromise circular treatment at the end of functional life; and\n- \u00b7 innovative with regards to the recycling of materials in closed and open loops, and business models: designed to increase the recycling yield (quantity and quality) of the customers products.\n\nThe transformation of Solvay into a circular economy model is embedded in our business strategy. We are working individually and with customers, suppliers, and partners to identify opportunities where we can leverage our capabilities.\n\nChemistry, as a science and an industry, is a tremendously relevant and powerful enabler of material transformation and re-use.\n\n## Indicators\n\nWe monitor our progress in circular sales in accordance with the three principles of Solvay's circular business solutions, outlined above.\n\n|                                                                                                               | Units   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Sales of products contributing to the circular economy (% Group sales)                                        | %       |      4 |      5 |\n| Sales of products based on recycled or bio-based resources or produced with renewable  energy (% Group sales) | %       |      3 |      3 |\n| Sales of products increasing longevity (% Group sales)                                                        | %       |      2 |      1 |\n| Sales of products enabling recycling (% Group sales)                                                          | %       |      0 |      0 |\n\nThese indicators were deployed in 2022. Solvay notably measures final products' circularity based on their renewable content. As of now, we calculate the renewable content using the mass of renewable reactants (as shown in our bills of materials) over the mass of the final product. This approach has been reviewed by Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Circulytics team and has been applied consistently over the years. We identified limits in accuracy to this approach as the cumulated mass of all reactants might be higher than the final mass of products for some products (due to evaporation processes, waste, and by-product generation) leading to a potential uncertainty of the final renewable content. Therefore, for 2024, if we keep the same KPs, we will review the approach in order to bring the accuracy of renewable content measurement to the highest standard and better reflect our contribution to circularity in our supply chain.",

        "page_content": "The Circularity KPI 'share in circular revenues' is calculated by adding:\n\n- \u00b7 sales of products increasing longevity in the use phase downstream in the value chain;\n- \u00b7 sales based on recycled or renewable materials (85%) and renewable energy (15%); and\n- \u00b7 sales enabling recycling at the end-of-life downstream in the value chain.\n\nPotential double counting is avoided by considering the above mentioned order of priority.\n\n## 7.2.3. Key achievements\n\nTo meet the unmet needs of our customers and to address the transition of our strategic markets in a circular economy, we accelerated our transformation.\n\nAt the Torrelavega site we used to send bottom ashes to a landfill. Four years ago, we started discussions about byproduct circularity. We stopped thinking about the ashes as a waste and we started thinking about them as an opportunity for value creation. We needed to create an external collaboration to develop a second life for our byproducts. We did so with a cement plant partner, with whom we worked closely to sort, adapt, and upgrade our ashes in order to meet their needs and quality specifications. Today it results in a win-win situation that is possible thanks to transparency, flexibility, and agility.\n\nWe launched our new SOLSYS \u00ae Bio Etac solvent. To advance sustainability in the field of oxygenated solvents, Solvay has developed SOLSYS \u00ae Bio Etac, an ethyl acetate made entirely from renewable sources with the raw material being ethanol derived from sugarcane. The ethanol used is sourced in Brazil, where SOLSYS \u00ae Bio Etac is produced and is obtained without causing deforestation.\n\nWe achieved the SCS Global Services certification for our Recycled Polymers. Solvay, a leader of high-performance and sustainable polyamide 6.6 polymers, continues to drive innovation in its portfolio with the introduction of a new, specialized grade of Rhodianyl, made of 100% pre-consumer recycled polyamide, which is produced at its Santo Andre plant in Brazil. The product has achieved SCS Recycled Content Certification, reaffirming Solvay's commitment to circular economy. The internationally recognized third-party certification body SCS Global Services performed a rigorous audit to verify the traceability of the Group's entire manufacturing process, including scrap management and the cutting-edge depolymerization reaction, which generates the final 100% recycled polymer.\n\nSolvay is investing at its Livorno site, in Italy, to launch the company's first unit of circular highly dispersible silica (HDS), made with bio-based sodium silicate derived from rice husk ash. This new breakthrough silicate process provides a circular solution as it gives a second life to rice husk in a local value chain. Coupled with renewable energy integration at the plant, it will allow Solvay to achieve a 50% reduction in CO 2 per ton of silica. This will make the Livorno site Europe's best-in-class silica production site in terms of CO 2 footprint. Production is expected to start by the end of 2024.\n\n## 7.3.  EU taxonomy activities\n\nThe EU taxonomy (2020/852) is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It is intended to play an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment and implement the European Green Deal. The EU taxonomy would provide companies, investors, and policymakers with appropriate definitions under which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable.\n\nIn order to be taxonomy-eligible, an economic activity must contribute substantially to at least one of the six environmental objectives - climate mitigation, climate adaptation, water, circular economy, pollution prevention, and biodiversity - and do no significant harm to the others.\n\nAs such, the taxonomy only addresses a limited number of Solvay activities.\n\nIn order to be taxonomy-aligned, an economic activity needs first to be eligible as described above, and then fulfill the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 The economic activity must make a substantial contribution to one or more of the climate and environmental objectives relevant to that activity.\n- \u00b7 The activity should do no significant harm to the other remaining objectives.\n- \u00b7 The activity should fulfill the minimum social safeguard standards based on OECD and UN guidelines.\n\nOur calculation of the share of 2023 Solvay sales eligible for, or aligned with the EU taxonomy, is based on our best interpretation of the EU taxonomy texts, including the 2023 version of Technical Annex of the Taxonomy Report.\n\nFigures reported for soda ash correspond to our Soda Ash and Derivatives business, which is a mono-technology business, as described on Solvay's website.\n\nEnabling economic activities, as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, do not substantially contribute to climate change mitigation on their own. Such activities play a crucial role in the decarbonization of the economy by directly enabling other activities to be carried out at a low carbon level of environmental performance.\n\nWe identified eligible enabling activities using our Sustainable Portfolio Management methodology, taking into account product and application combinations identified as 'climate solutions,' as described above. This enables us to avoid double counting, as double counting is neutralized in the Sustainable Portfolio Management reporting of solutions for each impact category, as described above. Possible double counting between transition activities and enabling activities are detailed in the table.",

        "page_content": "Some of our activities, such soda ash for glass in double glazing, may be eligible both as transitional and enabling activities. For calculating the total eligible activities and avoiding double counting, the eligible enabling activities related to eligible transitional activities are only counted once.\n\nThe basis on which the sales, capital expenditure, and operating expenditure were calculated is explained in the Financial Statements chapter of this report, note F1: revenue and segment information.\n\nCapital expenditures and operating expenditures corresponding to enabling activities are not yet available. The eligible share of investments depends on the estimation of the corresponding eligible share of future sales. The allocation rules chosen mean that we estimate that 1% of sales required 1% of capital expenditure and 1% of operational expenditure.\n\nWe also believe that the share of group capital expenditure dedicated to research and innovation should be considered as eligible as it aims to improve our product portfolio to become more sustainable. This means that our total eligible capital expenditures is the sum of eligible capital expenditures from transition activities, the capital expenditures estimated for enabling activities, and the amount dedicated to the capital expenditures spent on research and innovation. Similarly the total eligible operating expenses are calculated as the sum of eligible operational expenditure from transition activities, the operational expenditures estimated for enabling activities, and the amount dedicated to the operational expenditures spent on research and innovation.\n\nRegarding reporting on our aligned activities, our only manufacturing activities eligible as \"transition activities\" is soda ash, and it is not considered aligned for their sales as it does not meet the technical criteria. The activities eligible as 'enabling activities' were also not considered for their sales as we cannot demonstrate that they fulfill the 'do no significant harm' criteria for water, biodiversity, circular economy, or pollution. However, Solvay has launched our STAR Factory Program, which aims to fully implement our Solvay One Planet at site level. STAR Factory will progressively be deployed in all our plants and we believe that it will gradually deliver the required data to qualify our activities as aligned.\n\nAbout the calculation of the share of capital expenditures aligned with the EU taxonomy, we consider the capital expenditures spent on decreasing the environmental footprint of our soda ash production plus the amount spent on research and innovation.\n\nFollowing a similar reasoning, the calculation of operational expenditures aligned with the EU taxonomy mainly considers the share of operational expenditures spent on research and innovation.\n\nThe Group works hard to constantly improve our share of economic activities considered eligible for, or aligned with, the EU taxonomy. We believe that STAR Factory and other major programs will deliver on these objectives in the coming years.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSolvay SA/NV (the 'Company' or 'Solvay') is a public limited liability company governed by Belgian law and listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris. The principal activities of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates (jointly the 'Group') are described in note F1 Revenue and Segment Information.\n\nThe Solvay Group operates in 45 industrial sites and 6 research centers and over 40 countries, employs approximately 9,000 employees and delivered net sales of \u20ac4.9 billion in 2023. Solvay SA/NV is the Solvay Group's ultimate parent with its registered office located at Rue Ransbeek 310, B-1120 Brussels, Belgium.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the consolidated financial statements for issuance.\n\n## MAIN EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\n## Partial Demerger of the Specialty Businesses\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Group announced that it was reviewing plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies:\n\n- \u00b7 'EssentialCo', which comprised the leading mono-technology businesses in the Group's Chemicals segment and the Special Chem business. Following the Partial Demerger (as defined below), the Group consists of EssentialCo.\n- \u00b7 'SpecialtyCo' (now renamed to 'Syensqo' or the 'Syensqo Group'), which comprises the Group's Materials segment, and the majority of the Group's Solutions segment: Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma Performance, and Oil and Gas (together the 'Specialty Businesses').\n\nThe separation was effected by means of a partial demerger ('scission partielle') of Solvay SA/NV, under Belgian law, whereby the shares and other interests the Company held in the legal entities operating the so-called 'Specialty Businesses,' its rights and obligations under the agreements entered into with those legal entities, as well as certain other assets and liabilities were contributed under a universal succession regime ('transmission \u00e0 titre universel') to Syensqo SA/NV (the 'Partial Demerger').\n\nThe Partial Demerger was approved by Solvay SA/NV's shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting held on December 8, 2023. The Partial Demerger became effective on December 9, 2023, at 00:00 a.m. CET. In connection with the Partial Demerger, Syensqo became a public company, independent from Solvay, with its ordinary shares trading on the regulated markets of Euronext in Brussels and Paris starting on December 11, 2023. As a consequence, the Group presents the Specialty Businesses as discontinued operations:\n\n- \u00b7 In the consolidated income statement for the periods prior to, and until the effectiveness of, the Partial Demerger - that is the previous year's financial performance figures (the comparatives) have been restated. For 2023 financial year, the discontinued operations are included for the period until December 8, 2023.\n- \u00b7 In the consolidated statement of financial position, the assets and liabilities related to the Specialty Businesses have been derecognized from the consolidated statements as a part of the deconsolidation of the Specialty Businesses from the Group; the amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position of the previous year are presented in line with the previous method of presentation and are not restated in accordance with IFRS 5.\n- \u00b7 In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the cash-flows were not restated and present both continuing and discontinued operations in the primary statement. For 2023 financial year, the cash flows from discontinued operations are included for the period until December 8, 2023, However, below the statement, Solvay separately presented the consolidated cash flows from discontinued operations.\n\nFurther information on the accounting treatment of Partial Demerger is provided in note F8.\n\n## The Separation Agreement\n\nSolvay SA/NV and Syensqo SA/NV entered into a Separation Agreement on December 4, 2023, and effective from the completion of the Partial Demerger, to govern certain practical aspects of the separation of the two groups, as well as the allocation of certain liabilities, including environmental liabilities. The Separation Agreement will be effective until the thirtieth anniversary of December 9, 2023, except with respect to claims relating to environmental liabilities, which can be made until 12 months after the relevant statute of limitations expires. The Separation Agreement may not be terminated early without written consent of each party.",

        "page_content": "The Separation Agreement governs certain aspects of the separation of Syensqo from the Solvay Group, including, among other arrangements, those relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 (i) the settlement and termination of certain intercompany balances and arrangements - see note F37 Related parties, note F32 Financial instruments;\n- \u00b7 (ii) the substitution, removal or release of legal entities that are part of the Solvay Group or the Syensqo Group, as applicable, in respect of certain third-party credit or other support obligations, as well as the provision of counter guarantees - see note F32 Financial instruments and note F36 Contingent liabilities;\n- \u00b7 (iii) the allocation of certain fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Partial Demerger - see note F8;\n- \u00b7 (iv) the transfer to the other party of any assets (identified within 24 months of the completion of the Partial Demerger) allocated erroneously to the Syensqo Group or the Solvay Group;\n- \u00b7 (v) the transfer of all rights and obligations to Syensqo in relation to certain transferred employees' supplementary pension schemes in Belgium - see note F30 Employee benefits.\n\nThe Separation Agreement contains provisions to allocate to the Solvay Group or the Syensqo Group environmental liabilities for certain operating, closed or divested sites, including sites for which provisions have been established in the Solvay Group's consolidated financial statements, and cross-indemnity obligations applicable where a party incurs claims, liabilities or expenses for sites allocated to the other party in the Separation Agreement.\n\nUnder the cross-indemnity provisions, each of the Solvay Group, on the one hand, and the Syensqo Group, on the other hand, have agreed to indemnify the other party for certain environmental liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation Agreement includes provisions regarding the management of environmental claims, remediation obligations and related actions. The Separation Agreement also provides that claims will be deemed to have been made, automatically, under the cross-indemnity provisions for specifically allocated environmental liabilities that are the subject of existing provisions as set forth in the Solvay Group consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023. For all other environmental liabilities that are subject to the cross-indemnity provisions, claims may be submitted for up to 12 months following the expiry of the relevant statute of limitations. The Separation Agreement also contains customary provisions aimed at avoiding double recoveries. See note F31 Provisions for further details on provisions.\n\n## U.S. Tax Matters Agreement\n\nThe rules for determining whether a distribution such as the Partial Demerger and the internal separation of the U.S. Specialty Businesses and the U.S. Essential Businesses (the 'U.S. Spin-Off') qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes are complex and depend on all the relevant facts and circumstances. Solvay intends for the Partial Demerger and the U.S. Spin-Off to each qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'U.S. IRC'). Solvay has received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the 'IRS') confirming such qualification (except with respect to certain requirements under Section 355 of the U.S. IRC on which the IRS does not rule). Solvay also received a tax opinion from US tax counsel addressing those matters upon which the IRS would not rule, and relying on the IRS' ruling as to matters covered by the ruling.\n\nIn connection with the U.S. Spin-Off and the Partial Demerger, Solvay and Syensqo entered into a U.S. Tax Matters Agreement (the 'U.S. TMA') intended to (among other things) preserve the tax-free treatment of the Partial Demerger and the U.S. Spin-Off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the U.S. TMA, Solvay and Syensqo will generally be required to indemnify the other for any U.S. taxes and certain related losses resulting from (or relating to) the failure of the U.S. Spin-Off and the Partial Demerger (and certain associated transactions) to qualify for their intended U.S. tax treatment, where such taxes or losses are attributable to (1) untrue representations and breaches of covenants made in connection with the U.S. Spin-Off, the Partial Demerger or the U.S. TMA (including in the IRS ruling and tax opinion described above), (2) the application of certain provisions of U.S. federal income tax law to the U.S. Spin-Off or the Partial Demerger (for example, in connection with a change of control of either party) or (3) other actions or omissions within the party's control which give rise to U.S. taxes (or related losses) in connection with the U.S. Spin-Off and the Partial Demerger.\n\nUnder the U.S. TMA, Solvay and Syensqo are prohibited from taking actions that are reasonably expected to cause the Partial Demerger or U.S. Spin-Off (or certain associated transactions) to fail to qualify for their intended U.S. tax treatment, or that could jeopardize the conclusions of, or that are inconsistent with, the IRS ruling or the tax opinion discussed above. Additionally, the parties are generally prohibited (subject to certain exceptions in the U.S. TMA), for the two-year period following completion of the Partial Demerger, from engaging in certain acquisitions, mergers, liquidations, sales, and redemption transactions with respect to their respective stock and assets that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Partial Demerger or the U.S. Spin-Off for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Neither Solvay's nor Syensqo's obligations under the U.S. TMA are limited in amount or subject to any cap.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, Solvay was not aware of any breach or alleged breach by it of its obligations under the U.S. TMA, and had not received any notice from Syensqo relating to a breach or alleged breach thereof.",

        "page_content": "## The Transition Services Agreement\n\nSolvay SA/NV and Syensqo SA/NV entered into a transition services agreement (the 'TSA'), effective from the completion of the Partial Demerger for a non-renewable term of 24 months, whereby the Solvay Group and the Syensqo Group will, to the extent that certain business functions and corporate functions have not been separated prior to the completion of the Partial Demerger, each provide to the other (or the other's respective subsidiaries) various services and support on an interim transitional basis. In particular, given that the Syensqo Group will not have certain internal corporate functions fully in place upon completion of the Partial Demerger (such as finance, legal, tax, human resources, payroll, information technology and other support services), the Solvay Group will provide support with such matters under the terms of the TSA. Upon termination of the TSA, the Syensqo Group will bear wind-down charges covering certain restructuring costs incurred by the Solvay Group.\n\nFrom the completion of the Partial Demerger and going forward, the fees payable by the Syensqo Group to the Solvay Group have been determined internally using a limited mark-up, in line with the Solvay Group's practice for internal servicing, and have not been the subject of independent bids. It is expected that, based on the assumed scope of services and related underlying cost structure, the annual aggregate fees for the services provided by the Solvay Group under the TSA will amount to between \u20ac150 million and \u20ac200 million.\n\nSee note F37 Related Parties for further details on related party transactions.\n\n## Restructuring provision\n\nIn the context of the Group's plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, new restructuring initiatives were launched in 2023. These initiatives lead to the net suppression of approximately 224 roles at the end of 2023. As a consequence, a restructuring provision of \u20ac83 million was recognized in 2023, prior to the Partial Demerger date out of which \u20ac67 million for continuing operations.\n\n## Group portfolio management\n\n## RusVinyl equity investment\n\nRusVinyl is a former Russian joint venture in chlorovinyls in which Solvay held a 50% equity interest, together with Sibur who held the remaining 50% equity interest. On March 24, 2023, the Group announced the completion of the sale of its 50% stake in RusVinyl, to its joint venture partner, Sibur. At the time of closing, the Group received \u20ac432 million in cash proceeds in Belgium, which have been reported as cash flow from investing activities in Q1 2023. A capital loss of \u20ac176 million has been recognized in Q1 2023, mainly reflecting recycling of the historical currency translation balances to the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Liability management\n\nPrior to the Partial Demerger, Solvay undertook various liability management exercises in respect of certain of its outstanding debt securities. The purpose of the liability management exercises was to repurchase or redeem certain debt securities, and to transfer liability for the remaining relevant debt securities or related guarantees to the Syensqo Group upon the Partial Demerger becoming effective. The liability management exercises were also intended to amend certain contractual provisions in certain of the debt securities to facilitate the implementation of the Partial Demerger.\n\n- On September 4 and 5, 2023, Solvay announced the results of liability management transactions relating to certain senior and hybrid bonds denominated in euros. The transactions included:\n- \u00b7 a request for consent of bondholders to the substitution, effective upon completion of the Partial Demerger, of Syensqo SA/NV for Solvay SA/ NV as issuer of (i) the \u20ac500,000,000 Undated Deeply Subordinated Fixed to Reset Rate Perp-NC5.5 Bonds with first call date on December 2, 2025 (ISIN: BE6324000858) (the '2025 Hybrid Bonds'), and (ii) the \u20ac500,000,000 2.750% Fixed Rate Bonds due December 2, 2027 (ISIN: BE6282460615) (the '2027 Bonds').\n- \u00b7 a tender offer relating to the \u20ac500,000,000 Undated Deeply Subordinated Fixed to Reset Rate Bonds with first optional redemption date of June 3, 2024 (ISIN: XS1323897725) (the '2024 Hybrid Bonds') issued by Solvay Finance S.A. and irrevocably guaranteed on a subordinated basis by Solvay (the 'Tender Offer').\n\n## The 2025 Hybrid Bonds, the 2027 Bonds and the 2024 Hybrid Bonds\n\nAt the meeting in respect of the 2025 Hybrid Bonds, the necessary quorum was achieved, the relevant extraordinary resolution was passed and the relevant condition was satisfied. As a result, Syensqo SA/NV was substituted for Solvay SA/NV as issuer of the 2025 Hybrid Bonds, effective upon completion of the Partial Demerger, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set out in the consent solicitation notice.\n\nAt the meeting of the holders of the 2027 Bonds, the necessary quorum was achieved, the relevant extraordinary resolution was passed and the relevant condition was satisfied. As a result, Syensqo SA/NV was substituted for Solvay SA/NV as issuer of the 2027 Bonds, effective upon completion of the Partial Demerger, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set out in the consent solicitation notice.\n\nOn September 8, 2023, Solvay Finance S.A. accepted all validly tendered 2024 Hybrid Bonds pursuant to the Tender Offer for purchase in cash in an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac452,613,000 (representing approximately 90.52% in aggregate nominal amount of the outstanding 2024 Hybrid Bonds). Because it has purchased more than 90% of the initial aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Hybrid Bonds, Solvay Finance S.A. had the option, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2024 Hybrid Bonds, at any time, to redeem all of the remaining outstanding 2024 Hybrid Bonds that were not validly tendered for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer at their principal amount together with any accrued and unpaid interest (including any deferred interest) up to the redemption date. Solvay Finance S.A. exercised this option on September 6, 2023, and redeemed the relevant 2024 Hybrid Bonds on September 13, 2023, in cash and for an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac47,387,000.",

        "page_content": "## 2. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## IFRS GENERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThis information was prepared in accordance with European Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 on the application of international accounting standards dated July 19, 2002. The Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, were prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and endorsed by the European Union.\n\nThe accounting standards applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, are consistent with those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments applicable for the first time in 2023\n\nThe standards, interpretations and amendments that became effective as of January 1, 2023, and which are relevant to the Group are presented below. An assessment was made that these amendments had no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n\nThe amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning liabilities.\n\nThe Group assessed that the amendments had no material impact on its year-end report.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n\nThe amendments provide guidance on the application of materiality judgments to accounting policy disclosures. In IAS 1, the amendments replace the requirement to disclose 'significant' accounting policies with a requirement to disclose 'material' accounting policies. Guidance and illustrative examples are added in the Practice Statement 2 to assist in the application of the materiality concept when making judgments about accounting policy disclosures. The Group assessed that the amendments had no material impact on its year-end report.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates\n\nThe amendments to IAS 8 clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. They also clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.\n\nThe amendments had no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB issued the amendments to clarify the application of IAS 12 requirements to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two model rules (Pillar Two income taxes).\n\nThe amendments introduce:\n\n- \u00b7 A mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules; and\n- \u00b7 Disclosure requirements for affected entities to help users of the financial statements better understand an entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date.\n\nThe mandatory temporary exception - the use of which is required to be disclosed - applies immediately. The remaining disclosure requirements apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nThe Group applied the mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred taxes. The management is currently assessing the accounting implications and the jurisdictions that could give rise to additional taxation as a result of the implementation of the Pillar Two Model Rules in national laws, which is not expected to be material for the Group. See more information on International Tax Reform in Note F7.A.\n\nThere are other IFRS amendments applicable for the first time in 2023, but do not have a material impact on, or are not relevant for, the consolidated financial statements of the Group and therefore have not been disclosed.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments applicable for the first time after 2023\n\nThe new and amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group's financial statements and which may have an impact on the Group are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these new and amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.",

        "page_content": "## Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\n\nOn September 22, 2022, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback. The amendments clarify how a seller-lessee subsequently measures sale and leaseback transactions that satisfy the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers to be accounted for as a sale. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024, and are not yet endorsed by the EU. The Group is currently assessing the impact the amendments will have on its current accounting practices.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n\nThese amendments provide a more general approach to the classification of liabilities under IAS 1 based on the contractual arrangements in place at the reporting date. The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine whether, in the statement of financial position, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non-current. The amendments were originally effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, however, their effective date has been delayed to January 1, 2024. The amendments are not yet endorsed by the EU. This amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 to clarify the characteristics of supplier finance arrangements and require additional disclosure of such arrangements. The disclosure requirements in the amendments are intended to assist users of financial statements in understanding the effects of supplier finance arrangements on an entity's liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted, but will need to be disclosed. The Group is still assessing the impact the amendments will have on its current accounting practices and disclosures. These amendments are not yet endorsed by the EU.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability\n\nOn August 15, 2023, the IASB issued the amendments to IAS 21 which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and specify when a currency is exchangeable into another currency and, consequently, when it is not, how an entity determines the exchange rate to apply when a currency is not exchangeable, and the disclosures an entity provides when a currency is not exchangeable. The Group is still assessing the impact the amendments will have on its current accounting practices and disclosures. These amendments are not yet endorsed by the EU.\n\n## Basis of measurement and presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of euros, which is also the functional currency of the parent company. Rounding differences may occur in respect of individual amounts or percentages.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the application of accounting policies and the measurement of amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The areas for which the estimates and assumptions are material with respect to the consolidated financial statements are presented in the section Critical accounting judgments and Key sources of estimation uncertainty.",

General\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, and:\n\n- \u00b7 entities controlled by the Company (including through its subsidiaries) and that hence qualify as subsidiaries (see 3.1.2. below);\n- \u00b7 arrangements over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) exercises joint control, and that qualify as joint operations (see 3.1.3. below);\n- \u00b7 arrangements over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) exercises joint control, and that qualify as joint ventures (see 3.1.4. below);\n- \u00b7 entities over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) has significant influence and that hence qualify as associates (see 3.1.4. below).\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the investees so as to align their accounting policies with those of the Group.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of materiality, certain companies, which are not of a significant size, have not been included in the consolidation scope. Companies are deemed not to be significant when, during two consecutive years, they do not exceed any of the three following thresholds in terms of their contribution to the Group's accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 sales of \u20ac30 million;\n- \u00b7 total assets of \u20ac15 million;\n- \u00b7 headcount of 150 persons.\n\nCompanies that do not meet these criteria are, nevertheless, consolidated where the Group believes that they have a potential for rapid development, or where they hold shares in other companies that are consolidated based on the above criteria.\n\nIn the aggregate, the non-consolidated companies have an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\nThe full list of companies can be obtained at the Company's head office.\n\n## 2.1.2. Investments in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group has (a) power over an investee, (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. To assess whether the Group has control, potential voting rights are taken into account. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal.\n\nIntra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group's equity. Non-controlling interests are initially measured, either at fair value (full goodwill method), or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (proportionate goodwill method). The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nChanges in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest, and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. Reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is considered to be the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture in accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.3. Investments in joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In its consolidated financial statements, the Group recognizes its contractual share of the joint operations' assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, which is generally aligned with the ownership interest in the joint operations.\n\n## 2.1.4. Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary, nor an interest in a joint arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Under the equity method, on initial recognition, investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, and the carrying amount is adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment of the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint venture) are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and (contingent) liabilities of the associate or joint venture recognized at the date of acquisition is goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.\n\nWhere a Group entity transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the relevant associate or joint venture.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group reviews its investments in associates and joint ventures for impairment. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group performs its analysis and calculates any impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognizes the loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group entity are expressed in euros (EUR), which is the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entities' functional currency are recognized at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate when the fair value was measured. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions.\n\nExchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognized initially in other comprehensive income under 'currency translation differences;' and\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see note F32 Financial instruments and financial risk management for hedge accounting policies).",

They are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at their expected value at the moment of initial recognition. The grant is recognized in profit or loss over the depreciation period of the underlying assets as a reduction of depreciation expense.\n\nOther government grants are recognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related costs, which they are intended to compensate for, are recognized. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\n## Climate change\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has considered the impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of the disclosures included in the Risk Report and Extra-financial Statements and the Group's progression towards the ambitious 2030 goals to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 30% and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2040, Solvay plans to invest up to \u20ac200 million to reach carbon neutrality for all its businesses other than Soda Ash with an additional investment of \u20ac1 billion identified for Soda Ash until 2040 to pave its path towards full carbon neutrality for the Group by 2050 (with approximately \u20ac250 million spent of the more than \u20ac600 million already engaged between Soda Ash and the rest). These investments are partially supported by external parties through equity-accounted investments and include non-recourse financing and government subsidies, enabling Solvay to remain competitive. Further studies on technology innovation will determine the future investment needs beyond 2040.\n\nSince 2015 the Group has adopted an internal carbon price and it has imputed that as an input cost into all investment decisions, irrespective of prevailing market prices. The internal cost was originally set at \u20ac25 per metric ton in 2015, and was doubled to \u20ac50 in 2019. In 2021 it was then decided to be raised to \u20ac100 per metric ton of CO 2 with implementation in 2022. This approach ensures that all investments contribute positively to the resilience of the Group in the face of climate change risk and are also oriented towards achieving carbon neutrality.\n\nIn addition to the strategic direction, policies and commitments, it is important to note that Solvay is taking concrete actions aligned with its climate change commitments. These are extensively developed in the Sustainability Report. As an example of the Group's commitment to phase out of coal in the Soda Ash business, several projects were initiated comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 The construction of two waste-wood boilers accounted for as finance leases in Rheinberg, Germany; the first of the two boilers was commissioned in 2021. The second boiler will enter into operation by the end of 2024.\n- \u00b7 In Devnya, Bulgaria, a variety of renewable sources including sunflower husk pellets will be used to power production processes at our largest soda ash European site and reduce emissions related to energy production by 20%. As a consequence of this investment 130 kt CO 2 were not emitted in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Already equipped with a waste to energy power plant since 2006, we recently further invested to modernize our gas cogeneration unit in Bernburg, Germany, to maintain our low CO 2 footprint at the site.\n- \u00b7 In Green River, Wyoming, USA, our calciners and boilers are switching from coal to gas, a readily-available local resource, which will save 280 kilotons of CO 2 per year. This is in addition to the new project Solvay launched to deploy a new breakthrough technology that will abate greenhouse gas emissions originating from Trona mining operations. This will reduce the site's greenhouse gas emissions by 28% while growing its capacity. It will also make Solvay the first company to implement regenerative thermal oxidation technology to cut emissions from a trona mine. In 2023, about 100 kt CO 2 emissions were avoided.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 An equity investment in Dombasle Energy, France, of which Solvay has a 10% share. The project is largely financed through non-recourse debt executed in February 2022 and government subsidies. Included in the investment are two refuse derived fuel boilers. The project is expected to be fully deployed in 2025.\n\nWhen such investments are made, the Group verifies the useful life of the assets that are replaced and adjusts the estimated useful life if necessary.\n\nThe Group is also actively working on sourcing its energy needs from more environmentally friendly resources including long-term renewable energy generation solutions both onsite and offsite at certain facilities. These include long-term solar and wind power purchase agreements generally accounted for as executory own use contracts. In addition, the Group has entered into long-term contracts to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates, which will cover almost one quarter of the electricity purchased and consumed in the United States. The latter are recorded in operating expenses. In 2023, 100% of our operations in China are still supplied by renewable electricity (1.3 PJ) (see Chapter 4.2 Energy of the extra-financial statements). From 6.3% of our renewable energy purchased versus our total amount of energy purchased in 2022, Solvay has improved its figure and has acquired 8.2% renewable energy purchased in 2023 versus total amount of energy purchased.\n\nIn addition the Star Factory program that embeds the design and execution of the ESG roadmap of each industrial sites including a specific effort on energy efficiency initiatives on the top of Energy transition projects. It was decided to extend the methodology of Star Factory to include other shared function (Supply Chain & Procurement particularly) in order to develop the complementary roadmaps to tackle Scope 3 emission on the top of improving competitiveness.\n\nManagement has also considered the impact of climate change in making some key estimates within the consolidated financial statements, including the execution of the Solvay One Planet strategy, which is included in the budgets, mid-term plan and long-term forecasts, which are used to:\n\n- \u00b7 estimate future cash flows used in impairment assessments of the carrying value of non-current assets (such as intangible assets and goodwill) (see Note F23 Impairment);\n- \u00b7 estimate future profitability used in the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see Note F7.C. Deferred taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position);\n- \u00b7 estimate provisions (see Note F31);\n- \u00b7 estimate the long-term accounting assumptions, including CO 2 emission rights and energy prices for the energy intensive Soda Ash GBU (see Note F23 Impairment).\n\nThe Group's CO 2 emission rights and energy prices (gas/electricity/coal) are an important element of the cost structure, especially for the Soda Ash business. The Group has hedged a significant portion of its expected use through 2030. The hedges were taken into consideration in the goodwill impairment test performed and the long-term assumptions considered the higher capital expenditure required by the energy transition of the business after the hedged period. Considering the significant headroom on the Soda Ash CGU, no sensitivity is provided. See Note F23 Impairment.\n\nThe same exercise was done for the other cash generating units and management believes there are no realistic scenarios regarding climate change today, which would lead to an impairment of these assets.\n\nIn summary, the Group's climate change considerations mentioned above did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments and estimates during the year. Further, the Group concludes that the climate change risk does not impact the going concern assessment for December 2023.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\n\n## Critical accounting judgments\n\n## Partial Demerger of Syensqo\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Group announced its plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. On December 9, 2023, the separation was effectuated through the means of the Partial Demerger. The Specialty Businesses were classified as discontinued operations following the approval of Partial Demerger by the shareholders and the net assets were distributed. The 2022 Consolidated Statement of Income was restated to reflect this classification. Solvay applied IFRIC 17 Distribution of Non cash-Assets to Owners to determine how to present the Partial Demerger which included estimating the fair value of the distribution. Solvay estimated the fair value of Syensqo by taking an average of the closing price of the first 30 days of trading activity of Syensqo to prevent distortions from short-term trading activity in the first weeks of trading. This being a fair value with observable inputs and was considered to be representative of the fair value at the distribution date.\n\nThe fair value was determined to be \u20ac9.5 billion which resulted in a gain of \u20ac1.65 billion over the then carrying amount of the net assets. The impact was recorded to the consolidated income statement in discontinued operations.\n\nNo other critical accounting judgments have been identified for the year ended December 31, 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Group performs annual impairment tests on (groups of) CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, and each time there are indicators that their carrying amount might be higher than their recoverable amount. This analysis requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The recoverable amount is highly sensitive to discount and growth rates.\n\nFurther details are provided in note F19 Goodwill and Business Combinations and F23 Impairment.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets (DTA) are recognized for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits.\n\nThe Group has \u20ac1,520 million (2022: \u20ac5,203 million) of tax losses carried forward for which no deferred tax assets were recognized. These losses relate to subsidiaries that have a history of losses, do not expire, and may not be used to offset taxable income elsewhere in the Group. The subsidiaries do not have any taxable temporary differences that could partly support the recognition of these losses as deferred tax assets. On this basis, the Group has determined that it cannot recognize deferred tax assets on these tax losses carried forward.\n\nThe goals referred to in Climate Change note may have an impact on the estimate of future probability used in the DTA recoverability assessment - see the note, above.\n\nFurther details are provided in Note F7.C. Deferred taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position and F7.D Other Information.\n\n## Defined benefit obligations - General\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used in determining the defined benefit obligations at December 31 as well as the annual cost can be found in note F30 Provisions for employee benefits. All main employee benefits plans are assessed annually by independent actuaries. Discount rates and inflation rates are defined centrally by management. The other assumptions (such as future salary increases and expected rates of medical care cost increases) are defined at a local level. All plans are supervised by the Group's central Human Resources department with the help of a central actuary to check the reasonableness of the results and ensure consistency in reporting. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\nFurther details are provided in note F30 Employee benefits.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental provisions are managed and coordinated jointly by the Environmental Rehabilitation department and the Finance department. In case of environmental impacts stemming from historical production activities, generally, no provision is recognized for remediation works beyond the 20 years due to the inherent high level of uncertainty as to the timing and amount.\n\nThe forecasts of expenses are discounted to their present value. The discount rates fixed by geographical area correspond to the average risk-free rate on 10-year government bonds or the inflation rate if higher. These rates are set annually by the Finance department and can be revised based on the evolution of economic parameters of the country involved. To reflect the passage of time, the provisions are increased each year at the discount rates described above.\n\nFurther details are provided in note F31 Provisions.\n\n## Provisions for litigations\n\nAny significant litigations (post M&A and other, including threat of litigation) are reviewed by Solvay's in-house lawyers with the support, when appropriate, of external counsels at least every quarter together with the Finance and Insurance Departments. This review includes an assessment of the need to recognize provisions, disclose contingent liabilities and/or contingent assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in note F31 Provisions and F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\n## Leases - Identifying whether a contract includes a lease\n\nThe Group enters into various contracts to obtain goods and services. Determining whether those contracts include a lease requires judgment. Elements that are considered include assessing whether or not there is an identified asset. To make the determination the Group considers whether or not it has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit of the asset(s) throughout the period of use. Additionally, the Group assesses the extent of its decision-making rights and the existence of any substantive substitution rights. All facts and circumstances relevant to the assessment are considered and the identification of a lease is determined with the support of the departments that have the relevant knowledge, and which mainly includes the GBU management. Refer to note F21 Right-of-use assets and lease obligations for the leases that were identified by the Group and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases.",

Lease terms are determined with the support of the departments that have the relevant knowledge, and that mainly includes the Purchasing department, and the Facilities department.\n\n## NON-IFRS (UNDERLYING) METRICS\n\nIn addition to IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents alternative performance indicators to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of the Group's underlying financial performance and financial position, as well as cash flows. These indicators provide a balanced view of the Group's operations and are considered useful to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies as these measures provide relevant information on the Group's past or future performance, position or cash flows. These indicators are generally used in the sector it operates in and therefore serve as a useful aid for investors to compare the Group's performance with its peers.\n\nSee note F1 Revenue and Segment Information for the reconciliation of the underlying EBITDA measure.

        "page_content": "## NOTE F1\n\n## REVENUE AND SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify the contract,\n- \u00b7 Identify the performance obligations,\n- \u00b7 Determine the transaction price,\n- \u00b7 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n- \u00b7 Recognize revenue when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation.\n\nUnder IFRS 15, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.\n\nSale of goods: Contracts can be short term (including based only on a purchase order) or long term, some have minimum off-take requirements. Contracts that contain take-or-pay provisions obligate customers to pay shortfall payments if the required volumes, as defined in the contracts, are not purchased. Shortfall payments are recognized as revenues when the likelihood of the customer purchasing the minimum volume becomes remote subject to renegotiation of the contract and collectability. As the Group is in the business of selling essential chemicals, and performance chemicals, contracts with customers generally concern the sale of goods. As a result, revenue recognition generally occurs at a point in time when control of the chemicals is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.\n\nDistinct elements: a good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: (a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e. The good or service is capable of being distinct); and (b) the Group's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e. The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\n\nThe revenue of the Group consists mainly of sales of chemicals, which qualify as separate performance obligations. Value-added services - mainly customer assistance services - corresponding to Solvay's know-how are rendered predominantly over the period that the corresponding goods are sold to the customer.\n\nVariable consideration: some contracts with customers provide trade discounts or volume rebates. Trade discounts and volume rebates give rise to variable consideration under IFRS 15, and are required to be estimated at contract inception and subsequently at each reporting date. IFRS 15 requires the estimated variable consideration to be constrained to prevent overstatement of revenue.\n\nMoment of recognition of revenue: revenue is recognized when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (i.e. an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. Substantially all revenue stems from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, i.e. The sale of goods. Revenue recognition for those takes into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has a present right to payment for the asset;\n- \u00b7 The customer has legal title to the asset;\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred physical possession of the asset;\n- \u00b7 The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset (in this respect, incoterms are considered); and\n- \u00b7 The customer has accepted the asset.\n\nProducts sold to customers generally cannot be returned, other than for performance deficiencies. Customer acceptance clauses are in many cases a formality that would not affect the Group's determination of when the customer has obtained control of the goods. Revenue from services is recognized in the period those services have been rendered.\n\nThe Group sells its chemicals to its customers, (a) directly, (b) through distributors, and (c) with the assistance of agents. When the Group delivers a product to distributors for sale to end customers, the Group evaluates whether that distributor has obtained control of the product at that point in time. No revenue is recognized upon delivery of a product to a customer or distributor if the delivered product is held on consignment. Indicators of consignment inventory include:\n\n- \u00b7 The product is controlled by the Group until a specified event occurs, such as the sale of the product to a customer of the distributor or until a specified period expires;\n- \u00b7 The Group is able to require the return of the product or transfer the product to a third party (such as another distributor); and\n- \u00b7 The distributor does not have an unconditional obligation to pay for the product (although he might be required to pay a deposit).\n- \u00b7 Agents facilitate sales and do not purchase and resell the goods to the end customer.",

        "page_content": "Warranties: warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Substantially all warranties do not provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, and are hence accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\nLicensing: In case of performance obligations relating to licensing intellectual property (IP), the Group assesses if it grants a right to access the IP as it exists throughout the license period or a right to use the IP as it exists at the point in time at which the license is granted. If the performance obligation is to grant a right to access, then the related revenue is recognized over the license period; otherwise, it is recognized at a point in time, i.e. when the license period starts or when the customer starts using the IP. The Group assesses if the license provided can be considered as being distinct in the context of the contract. If not, the license will have to be bundled with other goods or services provided in the contract. Currently the Group grants a right to use IP, which means that revenue recognition occurs at a point in time.\n\nAn Operating Segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available.\n\n## General\n\nFollowing the completion of the Partial Demerger of the Specialty Businesses on December 9, 2023, the structure of the internal organization changed what impacted the composition of the segments. Consequently, Solvay restructured its operating segments to better align with the Group's strategy and is organized in the following reportable segments\n\n- \u00b7 Basic Chemicals: host chemical intermediate businesses focused on mature and resilient markets. Solvay is a world leader in soda ash, bicarbonate, and peroxides. These global businesses share similar economic characteristics and serve major markets that include building and construction, consumer goods, and food.\n- \u00b7 Performance Chemicals: hosts a wider range of products (in our Silica, Coatis and Special Chem businesses) that are subject to customization based on unique formulations and application expertise. These businesses share similar economic characteristics and are also high-quality assets with strong positions in their markets.\n- \u00b7 Corporate: comprises corporate and other business services, such as Group research & innovation.\n\nSolvay organizes its structure and groups the businesses around their similarities in financial performance which is systematically reviewed by the Chief Operational Decision Maker, products and production processes. Solvay's chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPrior year results were restated to align with the new reportable segments.",

Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities are recognized following the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized with respect to the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures, and associates, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets other than tax loss carryforwards are analyzed on a case by case basis, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. For example, a zero taxable profit, after deducting the amounts paid to retirees under a defined benefit plan and for which a deductible temporary difference existed, can justify the recognition of the underlying deferred tax assets. Recognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards requires a positive taxable profit during the year that enables the utilization of tax losses that originated in the past. Because of uncertainties inherent to predicting such positive taxable profit, recognition of deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards is based on a case by case analysis, which is usually based on five-year profit forecasts, except with respect to any financial company for which ten-year financial profit forecasts are considered highly predictable and are consequently used.\n\nThe corporate tax reporting team, which monitors the Group deferred tax positions, is involved in assessing deferred tax assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in note F7.C.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",

In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in the accounting for the business combination.\n\nException to the above, as from January 1, 2019, the Group applies the amendments to IAS 12, that apply to the income tax consequences of dividends recognized on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period, i.e. January 1, 2018. In 2018, the income tax consequences of the coupons on perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity were recognized in equity. As a result of the adoption of the amendment, those income tax consequences are now recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## F7.A.

The income taxes (net expense) recognized in other comprehensive income decreased by \u20ac58 million in 2023 compared to 2022, mainly due to the movement in employee benefit provisions (see note F30 Employee benefits) and due to the variation of the CO 2 emission rights contracts (see note F32 Financial instruments and Financial risk management).\n\n| In \u20acmillion                                                    |   2023 |   2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current taxes related to current year                          |   -180 |   -107 |\n| Provisions for tax litigations                                 |      1 |     11 |\n| Other current taxes related to prior years                     |      5 |      4 |\n| Current taxes                                                  |   -174 |    -92 |\n| Changes in unrecognized deferred tax assets (a)                |    -91 |     -7 |\n| Deferred tax income on amortization of PPA step-ups            |      2 |      3 |\n| Deferred tax impact of changes in the nominal tax rates        |      2 |      4 |\n| Deferred taxes related to prior years                          |     -5 |      3 |\n| Other deferred taxes (b)                                       |     59 |   -138 |\n| Deferred taxes                                                 |    -34 |   -135 |\n| Income taxes recognized in the consolidated income statement   |   -208 |   -228 |\n| Income taxes on items recognized in other comprehensive income |      2 |    -66 |\n\nThe current taxes (net expense) related to the current year increased by \u20ac(73) million due to higher taxable profits in countries with high effective tax rates (e.g. Italy, Belgium, and Germany) slightly offset by the reversal of provisions for tax litigation.\n\n(a)  In 2023, the change in unrecognized deferred tax assets amounted to \u20ac91 million resulting mainly from a revision of the forecasted taxable results mainly due to the exit from the tax unit in France as a consequence of the Partial Demerger of the Group.\n\n(b) In 2023, the other deferred taxes (\u20ac63 million) mainly relate to provisions other than employee benefits and tangible assets.",

A preliminary assessment of this potential impact, which has been conducted with support of an independent advisor using financial information of financial year 2022 of Solvay SA/NV (prior to the partial demerger of December 8, 2023), indicated that no material tax impact is reasonably to be expected. Because of the complexity of the Pillar Two rules, the continued further guidance and supplementation of the legislation and the complexity of Solvay's partial demerger from both a financial and transactional perspective, the financial year 2023 is considered not a suitable reference and the impact assessment will continue in the course of 2024.\n\nSolvay SA/NV will continue to conduct tax technical analyses and further develop its tools and processes over the next few months and continue to involve, inform and educate key stakeholders, both internal and external.\n\n## F7.B. Reconciliation of the income tax expense\n\nThe effective income tax expense has been reconciled with the theoretical tax expense obtained by applying to the pre-tax profit of each Group entity the nominal tax rate prevailing in the country in which it operates.\n\n| In \u20acmillion                                                                                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit/(Loss) for the year before taxes                                                                       | 180    | 1,132  |\n| Earnings from associates and joint ventures                                                                   | 53     | 153    |\n| Profit/(Loss) for the year before taxes excluding earnings from associates and joint ventures                 | 127    | 979    |\n| Reconciliation of the tax income/(expense)                                                                    |        |        |\n| Total tax income/(expense) of the Group entities computed on the basis of the respective local nominal  rates | -27    | -222   |\n| Weighted average nominal rate                                                                                 | 21%    | 25%    |\n| Withholding taxes                                                                                             | -31    | -21    |\n| Tax effect of changes in nominal tax rates                                                                    | 2      | 4      |\n| Changes in unrecognized deferred tax assets                                                                   | -91    | -7     |\n| Tax effect of permanent differences                                                                           | -36    | 17     |\n| Gain and losses with no tax expense and income                                                                | -20    | -12    |\n| Provisions for tax litigations                                                                                | 1      | 11     |\n| Other tax effect of current and deferred tax adjustments related to prior years                               | 0      | 7      |\n| Tax effect on distribution of dividends                                                                       | -4     | -4     |\n| Effective tax income/(expense)                                                                                | -208   | -227   |\n| Effective tax rate                                                                                            | 116%   | 20%    |\n\nThe weighted average nominal rate decreased from 2022 (25%) to 2023 (21%).\n\nThe higher effective tax rate is mainly due to the changes in recognition of deferred tax assets in France and the impact of the RusVinyl disinvestment.",

        "page_content": "The evolution of the net deferred taxes between 2023 and 2022 mainly relates to the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 The total net deferred taxes of \u20ac186 million at year-end 2023 are \u20ac188 million lower than in 2022.\n- \u00b7 The main changes in 2023 are related to the following items:\n- \u00b7 Deferred taxes on employee benefit obligations: \u20ac98 million at year-end 2023 - \u20ac136 million lower than in 2022, explained by the non-recognition of deferred taxes in France (\u20ac(48) million in income statement and \u20ac(28) million in other comprehensive income) and by the decrease of postemployment benefits obligations mainly in France.\n- \u00b7 Deferred taxes on provisions other than employee benefits: \u20ac35 million at year-end 2023 - \u20ac140 million lower than in 2022; mainly due to the Partial Demerger (\u20ac164 million)\n- \u00b7 Deferred taxes on intangible assets: \u20ac7 million at year-end 2023 - \u20ac203 million lower than in 2022. The decrease in these liabilities in 2023 is mainly due to the Partial Demerger (\u20ac178 million)\n- \u00b7 deferred taxes on operational and non-operational tax losses: \u20ac99 million at year-end 2023 - \u20ac276 million lower than in 2022 mainly due to the Partial Demerger (\u20ac257 million) and less recognition in Belgium (\u20ac6 million).\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax assets on other temporary differences: \u20ac(14) million at year-end 2023 - \u20ac52 million lower than in 2022 mainly due to the derecognition of the CO 2 emission rights contracts in several legal entities.\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings were recognized in the Other Temporary differences for \u20ac(16) million at year-end 2023 (\u20ac(56) million at year-end 2022). The amounts of deferred tax liabilities not recognized, provided that the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future were \u20ac36 million at year-end 2023 (\u20ac32 million at yearend 2022).\n\nRecognized deferred taxes for which utilization depends on future taxable profits in excess of the profit arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences within entities that have suffered a tax loss in either current or preceding years in the related tax jurisdiction, amount to \u20ac187 million (\u20ac134 million in 2022). This recognition is supported by favorable expectations of future taxable profits.\n\n## F7.D. Other information\n\nFor the majority of the Group's tax loss carryforwards, no deferred tax assets have been recognized. The unrecognized tax losses are mainly located in countries where they can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThe tax losses carried forward generating deferred tax assets are given below by expiration date.\n\n| In \u20acmillion                                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Within 1 year                                                                       | 13     | 0      |\n| Within 2 years                                                                      | 7      | 1      |\n| Within 3 years                                                                      | 2      | 1      |\n| Within 4 years                                                                      | 0      | 0      |\n| Within 5 or more years                                                              | 53     | 12     |\n| No time limit                                                                       | 316    | 1,402  |\n| Total of losses carried forward which have generated recognized deferred tax assets | 391    | 1,417  |\n| Tax losses carried forward for which deferred tax assets were written-down          | 1,520  | 5,203  |\n| Total of tax losses carried forward                                                 | 1,911  | 6,620  |\n\nThe tax losses carried forward of \u20ac391 million (\u20ac1,417 million in 2022) have generated deferred tax assets for \u20ac100 million (\u20ac375 million in 2022).\n\nThe decrease of tax losses carried forward which have generated a reduction of tax assets, is largely due to the Partial Demerger of the Group",

Solvay uses the observable values as input for such valuation techniques.\n\nSolvay applies IFRS 5 requirements after intercompany elimination.\n\n## F8.A. Partial Demerger of the Specialty Businesses\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Group announced that it was reviewing plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies. Effective December 9, 2023, at 00:00 a.m. CET, the Group's Materials segment, and the majority of the Group's Solutions segment (i.e., Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma Performance, and Oil and Gas) (together the 'Specialty Businesses') were separated from Solvay SA/NV by way of a partial demerger of Solvay SA/NV under Belgian law (the 'Partial Demerger'), whereby the shares and other interests held by Solvay SA/NV in the legal entities operating the Specialty Businesses, Solvay SA/NV's rights and obligations under the agreements entered into with those legal entities, as well as certain other assets and liabilities were contributed to Syensqo SA/NV.\n\nThe Partial Demerger had not satisfied the criteria of discontinued operations until the decision of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting held on December 8, 2023, to approve the Partial Demerger. In consequence, the Specialty Businesses were not presented as discontinued operations in the Group's 2022 annual integrated report. As mentioned above, the effective date of the Partial Demerger was December 9, 2023.\n\nDiscontinued operations include the operational results of the Specialty Businesses, mentioned above, certain corporate activities attributable to these businesses business prior to the Partial Demerger, and the gain on non-cash distribution of Specialty Businesses to Syensqo shareholders. The operations of Specialty Businesses are presented as discontinued operations in these financial statements.\n\nThe energy and CO 2 contracts related to the Specialty Businesses were transferred during the Partial Demerger.\n\nSolvay SA/NV and Syensqo SA/NV entered into a Separation Agreement on December 4, 2023, to govern (i) certain practical aspects of the separation of the two groups, as well as the (ii) creation of cross indemnities to adjust, where necessary, the allocation of certain liabilities resulting from the legal structuring, and (iii) the allocation of certain liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Please refer to 'Main Events and Changes in the Consolidation Scope' for further details on the 'Separation Agreement' and 'Liability management.'\n\nThe Partial Demerger impacted the market value of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Solvay SA and the options on these shares. This includes the shares held by Solvay Stock Option Management SRL ('SSOM\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Solvay, for the purposes of hedging its exposure under LTI plans. For each share of Solvay SA/NV held by SSOM upon completion of the Partial Demerger, SSOM received one newly issued share of Syensqo SA/NV; the newly issued Syensqo shares were classified as investments at fair value through profit or loss and reclassified out of equity. The details on treasury shares and equity investments at fair value through profit or loss are provided in Notes F30 Equity, and F32 Financial Instruments.",

Other information relevant to discontinued operations\n\n## Edison\n\nIn February 2023, Solvay Specialty Polymers Italy S.p.A., a former subsidiary of Solvay transferred to Syensqo as part of the Partial Demerger, received compensation of \u20ac91.6 million after decisions by the International Chamber of Commerce's Arbitration Court, the Swiss Supreme Court, and the Milan Court of Appeal, all of which ruled in favor of Solvay Specialty Polymers Italy S.p.A. The compensation relates to losses, damages and costs incurred up to the end of 2016 in relation to certain environmental issues at the Spinetta Marengo and Bussi sites, previously owned and operated by (Mont)Edison S.p.A. and Ausimont S.p.A. The compensation received in 2023 was included within discontinued operations in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Environmental liabilities\n\nOn June 28, 2023, Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC, a former subsidiary of Solvay transferred to Syensqo as part of the Partial Demerger, and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) announced they reached a settlement resolving certain PFAS-related claims in New Jersey. As a result of this settlement, Solvay increased its existing provision by around US$250 million as of June 30, 2023, with US$175 million cash out in 2024 and the balance over a 30-year period. There were no further changes prior to the Partial Demerger. The provision was derecognized as a part of the Partial Demerger and transferred to Syensqo as from December 9, 2023.\n\n## NOTE F9\n\n## EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe basic earnings per share are obtained by dividing profit for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. The weighted average number of ordinary shares excludes the treasury shares held by the Group over the reporting period.\n\nThe diluted earnings per share are obtained by dividing profit for the year, adjusted for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, also adjusted by the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares attached to the issuance of share options.\n\nThe number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated for the weighted average number of share options outstanding during the reporting period as the difference between the average market price of ordinary shares during the reporting period and the exercise price of the share option. Share options have a dilutive effect only when the average market price is above the exercise price (share options are 'in the money').\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, there were no adjusting elements to the profit for the year (Solvay share).\n\nBasic and diluted amounts per share for discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated income statement.",

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period except when the impact of applying the average rate is materially different from applying the spot rate at the respective transactions' dates, in which case the latter is applied. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income as 'currency translation differences'.\n\nCurrency translation differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss, on:\n\n- \u00b7 A disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation. In this case, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to noncontrolling interests are derecognized, but they are not reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the carrying amount of Currency Translation consists of \u20ac(288) million on BRL, \u20ac(211) linked to the conversion of Member States' currencies to Euro, and \u20ac256 million on USD.",

These deals are subject to margin calls. To cover the credit risk of the counterparty, brokers pay a margin call to Solvay in case the instrument is in the money for Solvay. If the instrument is out of the money for Solvay, Solvay pays a margin call to the brokers. The margin calls are presented as part of financial debt (see note F33 Net indebtedness). Cash flows from margin calls are recognized as financing cash flows that fluctuate with the fair value of the instrument. The actual settlement of these commodity derivatives is net of margin calls and the gross amount (including margin calls that are reclassified from financing cash flows) is recognized in operating cash flows.\n\n## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n## NOTE F18\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nAn intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. It is identifiable when it is separable, i.e. Is capable of being separated or divided from the Group, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. An intangible asset shall be recognized if, and only if:\n\n- \u00b7 (a) it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group; and\n- \u00b7 (b) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets acquired or developed internally are initially measured at cost. The cost of an acquired intangible asset comprises its purchase price, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, and any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalized only if it is probable that it will increase the future economic benefits associated with the specific asset. Other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\nAfter initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.\n\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed the contractual period, if any. The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at each year-end, and any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.\n\n| Patents and trademarks                 | 2-20   | years   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Software                               | 3-5    | years   |\n| Development expenditures               | 2-5    | years   |\n| Customer relationships                 | 5-29   | years   |\n| Other intangible assets - Technologies | 5-20   | years   |\n\nAmortization expense is included in the consolidated income statement within the cost of goods sold, administrative costs, research and development costs and other operating gains and losses.\n\nThe asset is tested for impairment if (a) there is a trigger for impairment, and (b) annually for projects under development (see note F23 Impairment).",

The gain or loss arising from derecognition of an intangible asset is recognized in profit or loss at the moment of derecognition.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized if, and only if, all the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 the cost of the asset can be reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical feasibility of the product has been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the product or process will be placed on the market or used internally;\n- \u00b7 the assets will generate future economic benefits (a potential market exists for the product or, where it is to be used internally, its future utility has been demonstrated);\n- \u00b7 the technical, financial and other resources required to complete the project are available.\n\nDevelopment costs comprise employee expenses, the cost of materials and services directly attributable to the projects, and an appropriate share of directly attributable fixed costs including, and where applicable, borrowing costs. The intangible assets are amortized as from the moment they are available for use, i.e. When they are in the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Development costs, which do not satisfy the above conditions are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Patents, trademarks and customer relationships\n\nThose intangible assets have mainly been acquired through business combinations. Customer relationships consist of customer lists.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets mainly include technology acquired separately or in a business combination.",

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 (a) the consideration transferred;\n- \u00b7 (b) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; and\n- \u00b7 (c) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree, over the share acquired by the Group in the fair value of the entity's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if there are any impairment triggers identified.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.\n\nA cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other group(s) of assets.\n\nThese tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of the assets or (groups of) CGUs with their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a (group of) CGU(s) is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized on goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nAssets held for sale include their related goodwill.\n\nOn disposal of an operation within a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. It is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained, unless another method better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.\n\n## Goodwill - overview\n\n| In \u20acmillion                      | Total   |\n|----------------------------------|---------|\n| December 31, 2021                | 3,379   |\n| Currency translation differences | 94      |\n| Disposals                        | 0       |\n| December 31, 2022                | 3,472   |\n| Addition                         | 2       |\n| Currency translation differences | -36     |\n| Disposals                        | 0       |\n| Impairment                       | -38     |\n| Partial Demerger                 | -2,637  |\n| December 31, 2023                | 764     |\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the currency translation differences mainly relate to goodwill expressed in US dollars.

The realignment resulted in the reallocation of segment level goodwill of \u20ac186 million (see column Transfer). The goodwill was reallocated to the CGUs using a relative value approach (respective fair values). The reallocation did not have any significant impact on the impairment analysis performed.\n\n| In \u20acmillion                         | At beginning  of the period         | Additions   | Impairment   | Currency  translation  differences   | Transfer   | Partial  Demerger   | At the  end of the  period   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| Operating segments - Groups of CGUs | Operating segments - Groups of CGUs |             |              |                                      |            |                     |                              |\n| - Materials                         | 341                                 |             |              |                                      |            | -341                | 0                            |\n| - Chemicals                         | 121                                 |             |              |                                      | -121       |                     | 0                            |\n| - Solutions                         | 264                                 |             |              |                                      | -65        | -199                | 0                            |\n| (Groups of) CGUs                    |                                     |             |              |                                      |            |                     |                              |\n| - Composite Materials               | 591                                 |             |              | -15                                  |            | -577                | 0                            |\n| - Novecare                          | 565                                 | 2           |              | -3                                   |            | -564                | 0                            |\n| - Technology Solutions              | 734                                 |             |              | -17                                  |            | -716                | 0                            |\n| - Special Chem                      | 210                                 |             |              | 0                                    | 65         |                     | 275                          |\n| - Specialty Polymers                | 181                                 |             |              | -1                                   |            | -180                | 0                            |\n| - Soda Ash and Derivatives          | 162                                 |             |              |                                      | 75         |                     | 237                          |\n| - Coatis                            | 82                                  |             |              |                                      |            |                     | 82                           |\n| - Silica                            | 72                                  |             |              |                                      |            |                     | 72                           |\n| - Aroma Performance                 | 49                                  |             |              |                                      |            | -49                 | 0                            |\n| - Energy Services                   | 50                                  |             | -38          |                                      |            | -12                 | 0                            |\n| -  Hydrogen Peroxide Europe         | 21                                  |             |              |                                      | 17         |                     | 37                           |\n| -  Hydrogen Peroxide Mercosul       | 14                                  |             |              |                                      | 14         |                     | 27                           |\n| - Hydrogen Peroxide Nafta           | 7                                   |             |              |                                      | 8          |                     | 15                           |\n| - Hydrogen Peroxide Asia            | 11                                  |             |              | 0                                    | 8          |                     | 19                           |\n| Total goodwill                      | 3,472                               | 2           | -38          | -35                                  | 0          | -2,637              | 764                          |",

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. If applicable, the cost comprises borrowing costs during the construction period.\n\nAfter initial recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.",

        "page_content": "Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The components of an item of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are depreciated separately. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, also taking into account the potential impact of climate change including the execution of the Solvay One Planet Strategy (see Note on Climate Change in the IFRS general accounting policies). Any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.\n\n| - Buildings                           | 30-40                                 | years                                 |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Within  Fixtures and equipment  group | Within  Fixtures and equipment  group | Within  Fixtures and equipment  group |\n| - IT equipment                        | 3-5                                   | years                                 |\n| - Machinery and equipment             | 10-20                                 | years                                 |\n| - Transportation equipment            | 5-20                                  | years                                 |\n\nDepreciation expense is included in the consolidated income statement within cost of goods sold, administrative costs, and R&D costs.\n\nThe asset is tested for impairment if there is a trigger for impairment (see note F23 Impairment).\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. The gain or loss which arises from derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss at the moment of derecognition.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure related to items of property, plant and equipment is capitalized only if it is probable that it will increase the future economic benefits associated with the specific asset. Other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Subsequent expenditure incurred for the replacement of a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is only recognized as an asset when it satisfies the recognition criteria mentioned above. The carrying amount of replaced items is derecognized.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated income statement as incurred.\n\nRegarding its industrial activity, Solvay incurs expenditure for major repairs over several years for most of its sites. The purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the proper working order of certain installations without altering their useful life. This expenditure is considered as a specific component of the item of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the period during which the economic benefits are expected to be obtained, i.e. the major repairs' intervals.\n\n## Dismantling and restoration costs\n\nDismantling and restoration costs are included in the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to dismantle or restore. They are depreciated over the useful life of the items to which they pertain.\n\nGenerally, Solvay's obligation to dismantle and/or restore its operating sites is only likely to arise upon the discontinuation of a site's activities. A provision for dismantling of discontinued sites or installations is recognized when there is a legal obligation (due to a request or injunction from the relevant authorities), or when there is no technical alternative than to dismantle, so as to ensure the safety compliance of the discontinued sites or installations.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAn asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract. However, an asset can also be identified by being implicitly specified at the time that the asset is made available for use by the customer. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified. A substantive substitution right means that (a) the supplier has the practical ability to substitute the asset throughout the period of use, and (b) would economically benefit from doing so.\n\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether, throughout the period of use, it has:\n\n- \u00b7 the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset; and\n- \u00b7 the right to direct the use of the identified asset. This is generally the case when the Group has the decision-making rights regarding how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nThe Group's leased assets relate mainly to buildings, transportation equipment, and industrial equipment.\n\n## Lease term\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both:\n\n- \u00b7 periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\nIn its assessment, the Group considers the impact of the following factors (non-exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 contractual terms and conditions for the optional periods, compared with market rates;\n- \u00b7 significant leasehold improvements undertaken (or expected to be undertaken) over the term of the contract;\n- \u00b7 costs relating to the termination of the lease, including relocation costs, costs of identifying another underlying asset suitable for the Group's needs, costs of integrating a new asset into the Group's operations, and termination penalties;\n- \u00b7 the importance of that underlying asset to the Group's operations, including the availability of suitable alternatives;\n- \u00b7 conditionality associated with exercising the option (i.e. When the option can be exercised only if one or more conditions are met), and the likelihood that those conditions will exist; and\n- \u00b7 past practice.\n\n## Right-of-use asset and lease liability\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the lessor makes the asset available for use by the Group except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. The right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, and the lease liabilities are presented as part of financial debt.",

        "page_content": "## Right-of-use asset\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentive received; and\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs incurred by the Group.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method, from the commencement date to (a) the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, in case the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term, or the lease contains a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, or (b) the earlier of the end of the useful life and the end of the lease term, in all other cases.\n\n## Lease liability\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the respective Group entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for early terminating the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to early terminate the lease.\n\nService components (e.g. utilities, maintenance, insurance) are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is measured by:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and\n- \u00b7 remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to reflect the impact from a revised index or rate.\n\n## Leasing of Palladium\n\nThe Group uses palladium, a precious metal, for certain of its operations. Next to purchasing this palladium, the Group also enters into various 'leasing' agreements with financial institutions that give the Group the right to use palladium for a certain period and then return it at the end of the \"lease\". Based on our analysis of these agreements, these contracts are not in the scope of IFRS 16 Leases or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Due to the lack of clear IFRS guidance, the Group applied judgment to determine whether these rights and obligations shall be accounted for on a gross or a net basis. Considering that the Group bears no price risk during the \"lease\" term and is not in full control of the asset (in accordance with the IFRS Conceptual Framework), the Group believes a net presentation gives a better view on the economic substance of the transaction. As a result, only accruals are recorded for the production losses and regeneration costs and the 'lease' fee is recognized within cost of sales.",

Many lease contracts contain extension options and/or early termination options to provide the Group with operational flexibility. Such options are taken into account when determining the lease term and the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\n\nIf the Group exercised its extension options not currently included in the lease liability, the present value of additional payments would amount to \u20ac42 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac100 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nLease contracts signed not yet commenced amount to \u20ac210 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac137 million for 2022) and mainly relate to a second waste wood boiler, steam turbine and auxiliaries in Germany, industrial equipment in France and rail cars in the United States.\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases amount to \u20ac134 million for 2023, of which \u20ac112 million related to payment of lease liabilities and \u20ac22 million of interest expenses (including the discontinued operations of \u20ac11 million). Information on the corresponding lease liabilities (after the demerger, long-term part of \u20ac243 million and short-term part of \u20ac63 million) can be found in the note F32 Financial Instruments.

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are allocated to individual CGUs, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate. Future cash flows are adjusted for risks not incorporated into the discount rate.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\n## Assets other than non-current assets held for sale\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, CGUs or groups of CGUs, including goodwill, and equity method investees corresponds to the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal, and their value in use. The latter equals the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from each asset, CGU or group of CGUs, and equity method investees and is determined using the following inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 business plan approved by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performances, forecast changes in the economic environment and expected market developments, including opportunity and risks resulting from climate change (taking into account the Solvay One Planet strategy - see note Climate change in the IFRS general accounting policies) and environmental regulations such as products phasing out. For further details, refer to the Risk Management Section. Such business plan generally covers five years, unless management is confident that projections over a longer period are reliable;\n- \u00b7 consideration of a terminal value determined based on the cash flows generally obtained by extrapolating the cash flows of the last years of the business plan referred to above, affected by a long-term growth rate deemed appropriate for the activity and the location of the assets;\n- \u00b7 discounting of expected cash flows at a rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital formula.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nWeighted average cost of capital (WACC) was computed using a consistent methodology to account for the separation, new reference peers, and an extensive benchmarking. The short term WACC is utilized to discount the expected cash flows of the initial four years, and is computed based on prevailing discount rates. The long term WACC is utilized to discount the expected cash flows starting from the fifth year and for the Terminal Value. The long term WACC is based on the three-year averages of key parameters (risk free rates, betas, spreads). In 2022, a rolling eight-year average of historical short term WACCs was used to calculate the long term WACC.\n\n|                                 | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Short term discount rate (WACC) | 9.9%   | 6.6%   |\n| Long term discount rate (WACC)  | 8.2%   | 6.5%   |\n\nThe increase in the WACCs is mainly due to the increase in the risk free rate reflecting tightening of monetary conditions by central banks and continued high inflation expectations. These WACCs are in the low range of the observed Peers' WACC estimates.",

        "page_content": "## Long-term growth rates\n\nThe long-term growth rates used in 2023 are based on the comprehensive review of the entire business portfolio performed in 2019 with the definition of the G.R.O.W. Strategy when each CGU was assigned to one of business segments with different growth opportunities, consistent with the long term growth rates of the market they serve and the Group competitive position in those markets; and on the long term growth remains very strong.\n\nAfter the reassessment of the long-term growth prospects the Group concluded that the prior year rates are still applicable, are consistent with the rates communicated during the capital market day in November 2023, and were thus set at:\n\n- \u00b7 Coatis - 0%\n- \u00b7 Peroxides - 1%\n- \u00b7 Silica - 0%\n- \u00b7 Soda Ash - 1%\n- \u00b7 Spec Chem - 1%\n\nOther key assumptions are specific to each CGU (utility price, volumes, margin, etc.).\n\n## Impairment test 2023\n\nThe impairment tests performed at CGU level at December 31, 2023, were based on the budget 2024 and the Mid Term Plan 2025-2028. With the exception of the Energy CGU the tests did not lead to any impairment of assets, as the recoverable amounts of the (groups of) CGUs were higher than their carrying amounts. More specifically, in all cases, the difference between the (groups of) CGUs' value in use and their carrying amount (headroom) represented in all a percentage of the carrying amount significantly exceeding 10%. As a result, for these (groups of) CGUs, a reasonable change in a key assumption relating to the recoverable amount for which the (groups of) CGUs is based, would not result in an impairment loss. Given the significant headroom no sensitivities were performed.\n\nDue to the significant volatility in the Energy markets, the Group has decided to exit its external energy business. The Group's decision resulted in \u20ac38 million full impairment of the Energy CGU's goodwill. The impairment was recorded within results from portfolio management and major restructuring in the Consolidated Income Statement. The discount rate used was consistent with the Group model.\n\nAs a result of the Partial Demerger of the Specialty Business the Group realigned its Operating Segments as detailed in note F1 Revenue and Segment Information. The realignment resulted in the reallocation of segment level goodwill of \u20ac186 million. The goodwill was reallocated to the CGUs based on a relative value approach. The reallocation did not have any significant impact on the impairment analysis performed. For additional information on the reallocation of goodwill see note F19 Goodwill and Business Combinations.\n\nClimate related matters were considered in the 2023 impairment analysis, however, it did not give rise to any impairments. More specifically, the group considered capital expenditures of over \u20ac1 billion within its Soda Ash and Derivatives CGU related to its carbon neutrality initiative within annual impairment testing.\n\nAs detailed in the note on climate change, the management has considered the impact of climate change, and more specifically the impact of the execution of the Solvay One Planet strategy, in the assessment of impairment. Furthermore, the long-term accounting assumptions, including CO 2 emission rights and energy prices for the energy intensive Soda Ash GBU have been considered together with applied relevant hedges. Considering the significant headroom on the Soda Ash CGU, the management believes that this headroom is enough to absorb climate change scenarios. Consequently, no sensitivity is provided. The same exercise was done for the other cash generating units and management believes there are no realistic scenarios regarding climate change today, which would lead to an impairment of these assets.\n\n## Other small groups of assets (Performance Chemicals)\n\nIn 2023, The Group impaired the tangible assets of the underperforming production assets within the Special Chem CGU for Fluor Gases in Europe (\u20ac48 million; Operating Segment: Performance Chemicals). Following a price improvement in 2021-2022, the 2020 impairment related to Fluor Gases was partially reversed in 2022. However, in 2023, due to stronger competition, deterioration in Agro market, and volume demand reduction, the impairment was re-recognized. The impairment was recorded within Results from portfolio management and major restructuring in the Consolidated Income Statement. The discount rate used was consistent with the Group model.",

The cost of inventories is generally determined by using the weighted average cost method except for CO 2 emission rights (see below).\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of purchasing cost (raw materials and merchandise) or production cost (work in progress and finished goods) and net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price, less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## CO 2 emission rights\n\nWith respect to the mechanism set up by the European Union to encourage manufacturers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission rights are granted to the Group for free.\n\nIn the absence of any IFRS regulating the accounting treatment of CO 2 emission rights, the Group applies the Trade/Production model, according to which CO 2 emission rights are presented as inventories if they will be consumed in the production process within the next 12 months, or as derivatives if they are held for trading. Energy Services is involved in CO 2 emission rights' trading, arbitrage and hedging activities. In the inventory, each batch of EUA is tracked separately and the cost recognition formula is based on specific identification.\n\nThe net income or expense from these activities is recognized in 'other operating gains and losses' (a) for the industrial component, where Energy Services sells the excess CO 2 emission rights generated by Solvay or where a Group deficit is recognized, as well as (b) for the trading component, where Energy Services acts as a trader/broker with respect to those CO 2 emission rights.\n\nIn light of its centralized CO 2 emission rights' portfolio management, for emission rights that are substitutable between subsidiaries, the Group's financial statements reflect the Group's net position. If this net position is negative, a provision is recognized, measured based on the market price of the CO 2 emission rights at the reporting date.\n\n## Energy savings certificates (ESCs)\n\nEnergy savings certificates are presented as inventory items in finished goods. They are measured at weighted average cost. As their cost is not separately identifiable, and as they are a by-product, they are measured at their net realizable value upon initial recognition.\n\n| In \u20acmillion                |   December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Finished goods             |                 373 | 1,352               |\n| Raw materials and supplies |                 296 | 838                 |\n| Work in progress           |                   4 | 21                  |\n| Total                      |                 673 | 2,211               |\n| Write-downs                |                 -31 | -102                |\n| Net total                  |                 642 | 2,109               |\n\nThe decrease of inventory is linked to the Partial Demerger (see Note F8)\n\nThe CO 2 emission rights amount to \u20ac49 million at the end of 2023 - this includes \u20ac12 million related to 2023 obligations and is included in inventory, and \u20ac38 million related to obligations after 2023 what is included in Other non-current assets.

        "page_content": "During 2022 the Group purchased the remaining outstanding ownership interest in Solvay Soda Ash (20% for US$120 million) and Solvay Special Chem Japan (33% for \u20ac3.55 million) with the difference between the consideration paid and the net book value of the non-controlling interest being recorded as a component of equity (loss of \u20ac88 million on the purchase of Solvay Soda Ash and a gain of \u20ac9.5 million on the purchase of Special Chem Japan).\n\n## NOTE F29\n\n## SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nSolvay has set up compensation plans, including equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.\n\nIn its equity-settled plans, the Group receives services as consideration for its own equity instruments (namely through the issuance of share options). The fair value of services rendered by employees in consideration for the granting of equity-instruments represents an expense. This expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the vesting periods relating to these equityinstruments with the recognition of a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of services rendered is measured based on the fair value of the equity-instruments on the grant date. It is not subsequently remeasured. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of share options likely to vest. The impact of the revised estimates is recognized in profit or loss against a corresponding adjustment in equity.\n\nIn its cash-settled plans, the Group acquires services by incurring a liability to transfer to its employees rendering those services amounts that are based on the price (or value) of equity instruments (including shares or share options) of the Group (namely through the issuance of performance share units). The fair value of services rendered by employees in consideration for the granting of share-based payments represents an expense. This expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the vesting periods relating to these share-based payments with the recognition of a corresponding adjustment in liabilities. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of options likely to vest, with the impact of the revised estimates recognized in profit or loss. The Group measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (further details are given in Note F9 Earnings per share).\n\n## Awards on shares of Syensqo SA/NV\n\nThe awards granted on shares of the Syensqo Group are not in scope of IFRS 2 Share Based Payments. Therefore the Management has established the accounting policy for these awards.\n\nFor the awards granted on Syensqo Group shares, a liability is recognized and measured based on the fair value of the Syensqo Group awards at each reporting date. On initial recognition of the liability at the Partial Demerger date, a corresponding entry is recognized in equity for the vesting period that has passed to date and the remaining amount is recognized as Other Receivables. This asset represents the services that have yet to be rendered by the beneficiaries. The asset will be amortized to the consolidated income statement over the remaining vesting period of the plans.",

        "page_content": "The costs of the awards related to the Syensqo Group are presented within operational (Administrative) expenses. The fair value fluctuation on the liability will be presented in Financial Results together with the fair value fluctuation on the hedging options/shares, which will partially hedge the impact.\n\nThe liability will be remeasured to its fair value at each reporting date. This applies equally to vested plans so long as there remains outstanding (unexercised) options.\n\nThe liabilities related to the fully vested plans are disclosed as current given that the beneficiaries may exercise their awards at any time. The liabilities related to the unvested plans are disclosed as non-current..\n\n## Effects of the Partial Demerger - amendments to the plans\n\nAs part of the Partial Demerger, the Solvay Board approved the amendments to the existing long term incentive plans (LTI). The LTIs were adjusted based on the following approaches:\n\n- \u00b7 1.  Shareholder approach - The existing awards were adjusted to entitle beneficiaries to receive one share option of Solvay SA/NV and one share option of Syensqo SA/NV.\n- \u00b7 2.  Employer approach - The existing awards were adjusted to entitle beneficiaries to receive a certain number of awards of their future employer (i.e. either the Syensqo Group or the Solvay Group).\n- \u00b7 3.  Basket approach - The existing awards were modified to entitle beneficiaries to receive an option on both Solvay SA/NV and Syensqo SA/NV.\n\n## Stock option plans (shareholder approach)\n\nAll outstanding stock options were converted into options on both the Solvay Group and Syensqo Group shares, as described above. The options can be exercised individually on each Group's shares with the exception of the 2022 SOP, which is a basket option i.e. the option is exercised on both shares of Solvay and Syensqo simultaneously.\n\nThe 2022 SOP is no longer classified as an equity settled plan due to the basket option feature. This plan will be treated similarly to the awards on Syensqo's shares. At the date of the Partial Demerger, the fair value of the 2022 SOP was recalculated using the Monte Carlo model and the plan was reclassified. A liability of \u20ac4 million was recognized, with corresponding entries to equity (\u20ac0.6 million) and Other Receivables (\u20ac0.4 million).\n\nThe exercise prices of all the stock options (excluding the 2022 SOP) were reset at the Partial Demerger date taking into consideration the Solvay and Syensqo closing share prices at December 11, 2023. As per Belgian law requirements, the sum of new exercise prices of the Solvay and Syensqo options equal the original exercise price of the plans.\n\n## 2022 Performance Share Unit (PSU) plan (shareholder approach)\n\nThe performance metrics were measured for the full year 2022 and 2023. The PSUs were converted to RSUs by applying an extrapolation method to the third performance year (2024). The vesting period remains unchanged. The RSUs will vest at the end of December 2024 and the shares of Solvay and Syensqo Goup will be delivered to the beneficiaries in Q1 2025.\n\n## 2023 PSU and Restricted Share Unit (RSU) (employer approach)\n\nThe performance metrics were measured for the full year 2023. For the performance years 2024 and 2025, new KPIs were approved by the Group's Board. The vesting period remains unchanged. The PSUs and RSUs will vest at the end of December 2025 and the Solvay shares will be delivered to the beneficiaries in Q1 2026.\n\nTo ensure the beneficiaries were not disadvantaged by the amendments to the plan, the number of PSUs and RSUs per beneficiary was adjusted taking into account the 30 trading-days post-demerger average share price of Solvay and Syensqo.\n\n## 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) (employer approach)\n\nTo ensure the beneficiaries were not disadvantaged by the amendments to the plan, the number of free and matching shares per beneficiary was adjusted taking into account the 30 trading-days post-demerger average share price of Solvay. The vesting period remains unchanged. The ESPP free and matching shares will vest at the end of September 2024.\n\n## Awards on Solvay Group shares\n\nFor the awards granted on Syensqo shares, a liability is recognized at the Partial Demerger date based on the fair value of the Syensqo Group awards, and it was re-measured on December 31 to \u20ac36 million. A corresponding entry is recognized in equity (\u20ac25 million) for the vesting period that has passed to date and the remaining amount is recognized as Other Receivables (\u20ac4 million). This asset represents the services that have yet to be rendered by the beneficiaries. The asset will be amortized to operational (Administrative) expenses in the consolidated income statement over the remaining vesting period of the plans.",

The fair value fluctuation on the liability (\u20ac4 million) is presented in Financial Results.\n\n## Modification accounting\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 modification accounting, the Group obtained updated fair values using Black-Scholes models of all the share based payment plans at the date of the Partial Demerger based on (i) the original terms but updated to the Partial Demerger date, and (ii) the modified terms. The fair values were compared and where there was an increase in fair value under the modified terms, the Group will recognize this additional cost over the remaining vesting period for the unvested plans. The additional cost related to vested plans was recognized in full in Administrative Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023. The impact of the incremental fair value for both unvested and vested plans was not material to the Group.\n\n## The Partial Demerger\n\nAs part of the Partial Demerger, Solvay transferred to Syensqo its rights and obligations under its outstanding incentive plans (including the PO2 SOP plan), in each case to the extent the beneficiaries of such plans (including members of the ELT before the Partial Demerger Date) are employed by Syensqo or one of its affiliates following completion of the Partial Demerger. Specific adjustments were made to the 2023 PSU and RSU plans for such beneficiaries.\n\n## Stock Option Plans\n\nPrior to the Partial Demerger, all the stock option plans were equity settled. Following the Partial Demerger, the Group also has to account for awards granted on Syensqo shares (see the Shareholder approach). The table below includes both the options on Solvay shares as well as Syensqo shares. There was no stock option plan granted in 2023.\n\n| Share option plans                                                           | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     | 2018 - 2   | 2018 - 1   | 2017    | 2016     | 2015     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|------------|------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Number of share options  granted and still outstanding  at December 31, 2022 | 259,001  | 395,164  | 429,103  | 72,078     | 391,280    | 308,450 | 497,845  | 332,409  |\n| Granted share options                                                        |          |          |          |            |            |         |          |          |\n| Forfeitures of rights and  expiries                                          | -44,531  | -15,041  | -50,005  | -6,425     | -25,228    | -23,505 | -25,263  | -332,409 |\n| Share options exercised                                                      |          |          | -96,959  | -12,013    | -19,277    | -22,152 | -389,437 |          |\n| Partial Demerger of Syensqo  1)                                              | -108,876 | -208,696 | -116,300 |            | -86,164    | -46,084 | -14,210  |          |\n| Number of Solvay share  options at December 31,  2023                        | 105,594  | 171,427  | 165,839  | 53,640     | 260,611    | 216,709 | 68,935   |          |\n| Solvay share options  exercisable at December 31,  2023                      |          |          | 165,839  | 53,640     | 260,611    | 216,709 | 68,935   |          |\n| Exercise price (in \u20ac)                                                        | 16.49    | 16.52    | 16.74    | 18.69      | 19.51      | 19.19   | 13.11    |          |\n| Fair value of options at  measurement date (in \u20ac)                            | 4.56     | 4.42     | 4.16     | 2.68       | 2.68       | 2.25    | 6.30     |          |\n| Number of Syensqo share  options at December 9,  2023  2)                    | 105,594  | 171,427  | 177,109  | 65,653     | 279,888    | 238,861 | 220,140  |          |\n| Share options exercised                                                      |          |          |          |            |            |         | -51,711  |          |\n| Number of Syensqo share  options at December 31,  2023                       | 105,594  | 171,427  | 177,109  | 65,653     | 279,888    | 238,861 | 168,429  |          |\n| Syensqo share options  exercisable at December 31,  2023                     |          |          | 177,109  | 65,653     | 279,888    | 238,861 | 168,429  |          |\n| Exercise price (in \u20ac)                                                        | 79.09    | 79.28    | 80.31    | 89.69      | 93.60      | 92.08   | 62.87    |          |\n| Fair value of options at  measurement date (in \u20ac)                            | 22.45    | 21.76    | 20.5     | 13.37      | 13.37      | 11.27   | 31.22    |          |\n\n- 1)  This row presents the number of plan participants that were Syensqo Group employees.\n- 2)  On December 9, 2023, following the Partial Demerger, the number of options on Solvay SA/NV was equal to the number of options on shares of Syensqo SA/NV - see the Shareholder approach.

All the managers involved subscribed to the PSU offered to them in 2023 with a grant date fair value of \u20ac108.56 representing the average stock market price of the share for the 30 days prior to the offer. In accordance with IFRS 2 requirements, the fair value of each PSU in this plan has been updated to \u20ac23.98, being the initial grant date fair value adjusted by the weighted average closing price of both Groups for the 30 days post the Partial Demerger (22% of the initial grant date fair value allocated to Solvay). The PSU plan 2023 is an equity-settled share-based plan with a three-year vesting period, after which shares will be issued, if vesting conditions are met.\n\nThe following table on the PSU plans

        "page_content": "For the PSU plan 2023, the participants who are also members of the Executive Leadership Team (including the CEO) on the grant date must achieve an additional performance condition. If achievement of the performance conditions outlined in the above table is positive (above zero), delivery of the PSUs is subject to further adjustment based on the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance of the Group in comparison to the TSR of the Stoxx 600 index companies for the period equal to the Performance Period.\n\nThe TSR performance condition was met at the end of 2023.\n\nThe PSU plan 2021 is a cash settled plan with a three year vesting period that vested on December 31, 2023. The payout was determined on the basis of the Solvay Group average share price (\u20ac104.29) during a 10-day trading period ending on November 30, 2023.  At December 31, 2023, cumulative liability was (\u20ac9 million). At December 31, 2022, there was a liability of \u20ac39 million (this relates to all the plan members before the Partial Demerger) with the difference when compared to 2023 consists of the settlement of the 2020 PSU plan.\n\nIn 2023, the impact on the consolidated income statement regarding PSUs (net of hedging - see note F32 Financial instruments) amounts to a cost of \u20ac(12) million compared to a cost of \u20ac(20) million in 2022. Included in the 2023 PSU cost is \u20ac2 million related to the equity-settled plan.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 57,410 outstanding PSUs for the 2023 equity settled plan and 67,304 for the 2021 cash-settled plan.\n\nAs mentioned above, the PSU plan 2022 has been converted to an RSU plan at the Partial Demerger date, consequently, there are no more performance share units left in PSU 2022.\n\n## Restricted Share Units (RSU)\n\nIn 2023 prior to the Partial Demerger, the Board of Directors offered to executive staff two Restricted Share Unit Plans, with the objective of encouraging beneficiaries to remain employed by the Group by allowing them to become shareholders of the Group. All the managers involved subscribed to the RSUs offered to them in 2023 with a grant date fair value of \u20ac108.56 representing the average Solvay Group stock market price of the share for the 30 days prior to the offer. In accordance with IFRS 2 requirements, the fair value of each RSU in these plans has been updated to \u20ac23.98, being the initial grant date fair value adjusted by the weighted average closing price of both Groups for the 30 days post the Partial Demerger (22% of the initial grant date fair value allocated to Solvay).\n\nThe Restricted Share Units are equity-settled share-based plans with a vesting date of December 31, 2025, after which shares will be issued, if vesting conditions are met.\n\nIn 2023, the impact on the consolidated income statement of the RSUs amounts to a cost of \u20ac8 million and includes the cost of the converted 2022 PSU plan post the Partial Demerger. The carrying amount of the liability for the 2022 RSU plan on awards on Solvay Group shares amounts to \u20ac8 million at the end of 2023.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 25,654 RSUs 2023 options outstanding, and 85,428 RSUs 2022 options outstanding, what includes the transfer from PSU 2022 plan.\n\n## Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)\n\nIn September 2022, Solvay launched its first employee share purchase plan. By participating in the plan, employees have the opportunity to purchase Solvay Group shares on preferential terms. The grant date fair value was \u20ac82.85 representing the average stock market price of the share for the 30 days prior to the offer. In accordance with IFRS 2 requirements, the fair value of the ESPP has been updated to \u20ac18.23, being the initial grant date fair value adjusted by the weighted average closing price of both Groups for the 30 days post the Partial Demerger (22% of the initial grant date fair value allocated to Solvay).\n\nThese employees will receive one free Solvay Group share for joining the plan as well as one matching share for every two shares purchased. The ESPP is an equity-settled share-based plan with a vesting date of September 30, 2024, after which the free and matching shares will be issued, if vesting conditions are met.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, 24,493 shares are expected to be granted to the employees. The impact on the consolidated income statement of the ESPP amounts to a cost of \u20ac2 million.\n\nThere was no effect of the Partial Demerger on the ESPP plan because the plan was already fully settled.\n\n## Hedging\n\nAll hedging with call options on PSU, RSU and ESPP have been unwound in cash at the end September 2023.",

The expense is recognized when an employee has rendered services to the Group during the period.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit plans concern all plans other than defined contribution plans, and include:\n\n- \u00b7 post-employment benefits: pension plans, other post-employment obligations and supplemental benefits such as post-employment medical plans.\n\nTaking into account projected final salaries on an individual basis, post-employment benefits are measured by applying a method (projected unit credit method) using assumptions involving discount rate, life expectancy, turnover, wages, annuity revaluation and medical cost inflation. The assumptions specific to each plan take into account the local economic and demographic contexts.\n\nThe discount rates are interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized under post-employment obligations corresponds to the difference between the present value of future obligations and the fair value of the plan assets funding the plan, if any. If this calculation gives rise to a deficit, an obligation is recognized in liabilities. Otherwise, a net asset limited to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit plan and the present value of any future plan refunds or any reduction in future contributions to the plan is recognized. Therefore the amount at which such an asset is recognized in the statement of financial position may be subject to a ceiling.\n\nThe defined benefit cost consists of service cost and net interest expense (based on discount rate) on the net liability or asset, both recognized in profit or loss, and remeasurements of the net liability or asset, recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nService cost consists of current service cost, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments and settlement gains or losses.\n\nThe interest expenses arising from the reverse discounting of the benefit obligations, the financial income on plan assets (determined by multiplying the fair value of the plan assets by the discount rate) as well as interest on the effect of the asset ceiling are recognized on a net basis in the net financial charges (cost of discounting of provisions).\n\nRemeasurements of the net liability or asset consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 actuarial gains and losses on the benefit obligations arising from experience adjustments and/or changes in actuarial assumptions (including the effect of changes in the discount rate) recognized in other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 changes as a consequence of plan amendments, recognized in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 the return on plan assets (excluding amounts in net interest) and changes in the limitation of the net asset recognized.\n\n## Other long-term employee and termination benefits\n\nOther long-term employee benefits related to long service benefits granted to employees according to their seniority in the Group. Termination benefits include early pension plans. Other long-term employee and termination benefits are accounted for in the same way as post-employment benefits but remeasurements are fully recognized in the net financial charges during the period in which they occur.\n\nThe actuarial calculations of the main post-employment obligations and other long-term benefits are performed by independent actuaries.",

Management of risks\n\nOver recent years, the Group has reduced its exposure to defined benefit plan obligations stemming from future services by converting existing plans into pension plans with a lower risk profile (hybrid plans, cash balance plans and defined contribution plans) or by closing them to new entrants.\n\nSolvay continuously monitors its risk exposure, focusing on the following risks:\n\n## Asset volatility\n\nEquity instruments, even though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. To mitigate this risk, the allocation to equity instruments is monitored using Assets and Liabilities Management techniques, to ensure it remains appropriate given the respective schemes' and Group's long term objectives.\n\n## Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the carrying amount of the plans' liabilities. For funded schemes this impact will be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the plan assets.\n\nCorporate bond yields are highly dependent on global and local market situations, the decisions of central banks and the political situation.",

        "page_content": "Events that are currently impacting the financial markets are:\n\n- \u00b7 the perspective of slow growth in the world with a fragmentation by geographic zones;\n- \u00b7 the anticipation of a decrease of rates by the US and European central banks;\n- \u00b7 a reduction of the inflation but with signs of resistance of some elements of the underlying inflation;\n- \u00b7 continuing political instability due to the war in Gaza, Ukraine and tension with China plus US elections.\n\nConsequently, yields in the major currency zones (Eurozone, the UK, and the US) are decreasing since Q4 2023 and are close or below levels at the end of 2022 (see Actuarial assumptions used in determining the liability). The result is an increase in the Group's defined benefit obligations in 2023.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nThe defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and as a result, higher inflation may lead to an increase in the benefit obligation (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). A limited part of the assets are either unaffected by or only partially correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the plans' net liabilities.\n\nThe inflation rate in each country is based on the Global Economic Consensus Forecast (GCF) with the exception of the UK, where the information is derived from the Bank of England. Long-term inflation assumptions have limited downward variation in the Eurozone in comparison to 2022. In the UK, the outlook for the retail price index and consumer price index has decreased slightly from 2022.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member. Increases in life expectancy will therefore increase the plans' liabilities.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nEspecially with respect to funded plans, the Group is exposed to the risk of external funding following regulatory constraints. This should not impact the defined benefit obligation but could expose the Group to a potential significant cash outlay.\n\n## B.2. Description of obligations\n\nThe provisions have been set up to cover post-employment benefits granted by most Group companies in line, either with local rules and /or with established practices, which generate constructive obligations.\n\nThe largest post-employment plans in 2023 are in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, Belgium and Brazil. These six countries represent 91% of the total defined benefit obligations and represent 98% of the total recognized plan assets.\n\n## December 31, 2023\n\n| In \u20acmillion     | Defined bene- fit obligations   | In %   | Recognized  plan assets   |   Net liability/ (asset) | In %   | Ratio plan assets  on defined bene- fit obligations   |   of which asset surplus  recognized in the  balance sheet |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United Kingdom  | 142                             | 8%     | 139                       |                        3 | 0%     | 98%                                                   |                                                         12 |\n| United States   | 231                             | 13%    | 207                       |                       24 | 4%     | 89%                                                   |                                                         10 |\n| France          | 632                             | 34%    | 288                       |                      344 | 56%    | 46%                                                   |                                                         33 |\n| Germany         | 388                             | 21%    | 190                       |                      199 | 32%    | 49%                                                   |                                                          0 |\n| Belgium         | 274                             | 15%    | 292                       |                      -18 | -3%    | 107%                                                  |                                                         34 |\n| Brazil          | 129                             | 7%     | 90                        |                       39 | 6%     | 70%                                                   |                                                          0 |\n| Other countries | 38                              | 2%     | 16                        |                       23 | 4%     | 41%                                                   |                                                          2 |\n| Total           | 1,836                           | 100%   | 1,222                     |                      614 | 100%   | 67%                                                   |                                                         90 |\n\nThe asset surplus represents an economic benefit for the Group or can revert to the company in case of wind up of the plans.

It was closed to new entrants in 2003 and replaced by a defined contribution plan.\n\nAfter the Partial Demerger, one defined benefit plans remains with Solvay, the Solvay Defined Benefits Pension Fund. It is a final salary funded pension plan, with entitlement to accrue a percentage of salary per year of service. It was closed to new entrants in 2005 and replaced by a defined contribution plan.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, about 9% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 25% to former employees and 66% to current pensioners.\n\nPension funds in the UK function and comply with local legislation under a large regulatory framework. The Pensions Regulator has a risk-based approach to regulation and a code of practice, which provides practical guidance to trustees and employers of defined benefit schemes on how to comply with the scheme funding requirements. In accordance with UK legislation, pension funds are subject to Scheme Specific Funding, which requires that pension plans are funded prudently.\n\nEach pension fund is governed by a Board of Trustees. They manage the fund with prudent and fair judgment. The Trustees determine the liabilities used for Statutory Funding Objectives based on prudent actuarial and economic assumptions. Any shortfall or deficit once these liabilities have been deducted from the fund's assets must be reduced by additional contributions and in a time frame determined in accordance with the employer's ability to pay and the strength of covenant or contingent security being offered by the employer.\n\nPension funds are subject to a triennial valuation cycle for funding purposes. This valuation is performed by the scheme actuary in line with UK regulations and is discussed between the Trustees and the sponsoring employer to agree the valuation assumptions and a funding plan.\n\nFor the Rhodia Pension Fund the last completed valuation was as of July 1, 2021. It established a fixed contribution rate of pensionable pay for active members plus a deficit recovery plan. Recovery contributions have been increased so that the plan is expected to be fully funded by the end of 2027 in accordance with local regulations. In December 2023, before the plan was demerged, Solvay made a voluntary contribution (\u00a375 million).\n\nFor the Solvay Defined Benefits Pension Fund, the last completed valuation was as of March 31, 2022, which established a fixed contribution rate of pensionable pay for active members plus a deficit recovery plan. The current recovery plan foresees recovery contributions until June 2023. In May 2023 a voluntary contribution was paid to the fund (\u00a310 million).\n\n## France\n\nSolvay sponsors several defined benefit plans in France. The largest plans are the French compulsory retirement indemnity plan and three closed top hat plans. Solvay retains most of the liabilities for the defined benefit plans after Partial Demerger.\n\nThe main plan is for all former Rhodia employees who contributed to the plan prior to its closure in the 1970s. It offers a full benefit guarantee based on the end-of-career salary; more than 99% of the liabilities are attributable to current pensioners. The plan is partially funded. At the end of December 2023, an additional voluntary contribution was paid to the plan (\u20ac18 million).\n\nIn accordance with French legislation, adequate guarantees have been provided.",

        "page_content": "## United States\n\nBefore the Partial Demerger, Solvay sponsored four defined benefit pension plans in the United States, one qualified plan and three non-qualified plans. After the Partial Demerger, Solvay retains liabilities for members of the qualified plan and for members of one non-qualified plan.\n\nA qualified plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that qualifies for special tax treatment under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants where newly hired employees are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan. The qualified defined benefit pension plan is funded while the non-qualified defined benefit pension plan is unfunded. The qualified plan makes up most of the pension liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n\nSolvay's plans are in compliance with local laws regarding audited financial statements, governmental filings, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance premiums where applicable. The plans are reviewed and monitored locally by fiduciary committees for purposes of plan investments and administrative matters.\n\nFor the qualified plan, Solvay's contributions take into account minimum (tax-deductible) funding requirements as well as maximum tax-deductible contributions, both regulated by the tax authorities.\n\nCertain eligible participants may elect to receive their pension in a single lump sum payment instead of a monthly payment.\n\nAt year-end, about 47% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 6% to former employees for whom benefit payments have not yet commenced and 47% to current pensioners.\n\n## Germany\n\nSolvay sponsors various defined benefit plans in Germany. The largest plans are a closed final-pay plan and an open cash balance plan. Most of the liabilities were retained by Solvay after the Partial Demerger. At December 31, 2023, broadly about 78% of the liabilities are attributable to current pensioners. The plans are partially funded.\n\n## Belgium\n\nSolvay sponsors two defined benefit plans in Belgium. These are funded pension plans. The plan for executives has been closed since the end of 2006, and the plan for the white and blue collars has been closed since 2004. The past service benefits provided under these plans continue to be adapted each year considering annual salary increase and inflation ('Dynamic management'). In accordance with market practice in Belgium, because of favorable retirement lump sum taxation, most benefits are paid as lump sum.\n\nFurthermore, Solvay sponsors two open defined contribution plans, classified as defined benefit plans for accounting purposes due to the minimum guarantees explained hereafter. These are funded pension plans which are open since the beginning of 2007 for the one in favor of the executives and since the beginning of 2005 for the one in favor of the white and blue collars. Participants may choose to invest their contributions amongst four different investment funds (from 'Prudent' to 'Dynamic'). However, regardless of their choices, the Belgian law foresees that the employer must guarantee a return on employer contribution and on personal contribution, creating that way a potential liability for the Group. Since 2016 the return has been fixed at 1.75% for both types of contributions, at the minimum of the range provided by law since January 1, 2016 (1.75% to 3.75%). At the end of 2023, net liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position concerning these plans is not material.\n\nSolvay's plans are administered through the Solvay Pension Fund that operates in compliance with local laws regarding minimum funding, investments principles, audited financial statements, governmental filings, and governance principles. The Pension Fund is managed through a General Assembly and a Board of Directors delegating day-to-day activities to an operational committee.\n\nApproximately 20% of the liability and plan assets were transferred out from the Solvay Pension Fund to a separate pension fund and are included in the Partial Demerger.\n\nSolvay sponsors a few other smaller pension plans. All these plans are insured.\n\n## Other plans\n\nThe majority of the obligations relate to pension plans. In some countries (mainly Belgium, Brazil, and the United States), there are also postemployment medical plans, which represent 4% (4% in 2022) of the total defined benefit obligation.",

This assumption includes impacts of both inflation and merit increases.\n\nThe pension growth assumption defines the expected future adjustments for these annuity payments. The plan defines how these annuity payments will be adjusted, and might be linked to inflation. Pension growth assumptions mainly apply for the defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\nThe long term inflation assumption is presented separately as salary growth and pension growth assumptions encompass more variables than inflation.\n\n|                                            | Eurozone      | Eurozone      | UK    | UK            | United States   | United States   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                            | 2023          | 2022          | 2023  | 2022          | 2023            | 2022            |\n| Discount rates                             | 3.00%         | 3.75%         | 4.50% | 4.75%         | 4.75%           | 5.00%           |\n| Expected rates of future salary  increases | 2.00% - 4.00% | 2.00% - 4.25% | 2.75% | 2.50% - 3.00% | 3.75%           | 3.00% - 3.50%   |\n| Long term inflation                        | 2.00% - 2.25% | 2.00% - 2.50% | 2.75% | 3.00%         | 2.25%           | 2.50%           |\n| Expected rates of pension growth           | 0.00% - 2.25% | 0.00% - 2.50% | 2.55% | 2.80%         | NA              | NA              |\n\n## Actuarial assumptions used in determining the annual cost\n\n|                                            | Eurozone      | Eurozone      | UK            | UK            | USA   | USA           |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------|---------------|\n|                                            | 2023          | 2022          | 2023          | 2022          | 2023  | 2022          |\n| Discount rates                             | 3.75%         | 1.00%         | 4.75%         | 2.00%         | 5.00% | 2.75%         |\n| Expected rates of future salary  increases | 2.00% - 4.25% | 1.75% - 4.00% | 2.50% - 3.00% | 2.50% - 3.00% | 3.75% | 3.00% - 3.50% |\n| Long term inflation                        | 2.00% - 2.50% | 1.75% - 2.00% | 3.00%         | 3.00%         | 2.50% | 2.50%         |\n| Expected rates of pension growth           | 0.00% - 2.50% | 0.00% - 2.00% | 2.80%         | 2.80%         | NA    | NA            |\n\nActuarial assumptions regarding future mortality are based on recent country specific mortality tables.

Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount is the present value of expenditures required to settle the obligation. Impacts of changes in discount rates are generally recognized in the financial result.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received when the Group settles the obligation.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.\n\n## Environmental remediation costs\n\nEnvironmental liabilities are mainly related to non-ongoing activities (shut-down sites, discontinued activities or divested activities where Solvay maintains certain commitments) and, to a lower extent, to ongoing activities (see comments below).\n\nAn environmental provision is recognized, in accordance with IAS 37, when there is a current legal or constructive obligation resulting from past events which will result in a probable outflow of resources (expenses / cash outs) to settle it and for which a reliable estimate of such outflows and timing can be made.\n\n- \u00b7 The environmental expenses encompass, but are not limited to, the following key matters\n- \u00b7 Sampling and analytical costs for soil and ground water monitoring\n- \u00b7 Cost related to dismantling when required to meet a remediation or permit obligation\n- \u00b7 Asbestos removal when obligated by regulation\n- \u00b7 Environmental investigations and studies (Risk Assessments, Phase I and II soil and groundwater)\n\nThe closing amount of the environmental provisions is based on the net present value of the future cash flows needed, for current and future years, to settle remediation obligations. Forecast expenditures are based on external consultant estimates, where appropriate and possible. Future expenditures are forecast and revised biannually and validated quarterly by Solvay finance and suitably qualified industrial experts led by the Group Environmental Rehabilitation Director and benefit from inputs of legal department staff for the evolution of Environmental Regulations.\n\nIn the absence of probable obligations, a contingent liability may be disclosed to represent the future possible liability. In some cases, contingent liabilities cannot be quantified. See Note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.",

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nTrade receivables are initially measured at their transaction price, if they do not contain a significant financing component, which is the case for substantially all trade receivables. Other financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\n\nA financial asset is classified as current when the cash flows expected to flow from the instrument mature within one year.\n\nAll recognized financial assets will subsequently be measured at either amortized cost or fair value under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 A debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding is measured at amortized cost (net of any write down for impairment), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option.\n- \u00b7 All other debt instruments are measured at FVTPL.\n- \u00b7 All equity investments are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading, nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination, an irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to measure the investment at FVTOCI, with dividend income recognized in profit or loss. This classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to retained earnings.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments in partnerships of investment funds are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of these funds the Group determined that they were not eligible for the FVTOCI option and therefore are accounted for at FVTPL.\n\nFor instruments quoted in an active market, the fair value corresponds to a market price (level 1). For instruments that are not quoted in an active market, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques including reference to recent arm's length market transactions or transactions involving instruments which are substantially the same (level 2), or discounted cash flow analysis including, to the greatest possible extent, assumptions consistent with observable market data (level 3). However, in limited circumstances, cost of equity instruments may be an appropriate estimate of their fair value. That may be the case if insufficient more recent information is available to measure fair value, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment loss of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated based on the expected loss model, representing the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of a default occurring as the weights. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.\n\nFor trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component (i.e. substantially all trade receivables), the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Those are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of those trade receivables, using a provision matrix that takes into account historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward-looking information per customer. The Group considers a financial asset in default risk when contractual payments are 60 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is fully impaired when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.",

        "page_content": "Impairment losses are recognized in the consolidated income statement, except for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this case, the allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost, except for:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, are subsequently measured at fair value;\n- \u00b7 financial guarantee contracts. After initial recognition, guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the expected losses and the amount initially recognized.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nA derivative financial instrument is a financial instrument or other contract within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with all three of the following characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract (sometimes called the \"underlying\");\n- \u00b7 it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors;\n- \u00b7 it is settled at a future date.\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments (forward, future, option, collars and swap contracts) to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, and commodity risk (mainly utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks).\n\nAs explained above, derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in income or expense, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments of the exposure to variability in cash flows with respect to a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss (cash flow hedges).\n\nA derivative with a positive fair value is recognized as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognized as a financial liability. Derivative instruments (or portions of them) are presented as non-current assets or non-current liabilities if the remaining maturity of the underlying settlements is more than 12 months after the reporting period. Other derivative instruments (or portions of them) are presented as current assets or current liabilities.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and embedded derivatives, in respect of interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, Solvay share price risk, and commodity risk (mainly utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks), as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship.\n\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. So to apply hedge accounting: (a) there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, (b) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship, and (c) the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nThe requirement under (a) above that an economic relationship exists means that there is an expectation that the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item will systematically change in the opposite direction in response to movements in either the same underlying (or underlyings that are economically related in such a way that they respond in a similar way to the risk that is being hedged).",

        "page_content": "## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated in a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAs long as cash flow hedge qualifies, the hedging relationship is accounted for as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a) the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item (cash flow hedge reserve) is adjusted to the lower of the following (in absolute amounts):\n- -(i) the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; and\n- -(ii) the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (i.e. the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected future cash flows) from inception of the hedge.\n- \u00b7 b) the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge (i.e. The portion that is offset by the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is recognized in other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 c) any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument (or any gain or loss required to balance the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is hedge ineffectiveness that is recognized in profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 d) the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with (a) is accounted for as follows:\n- -(i) if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the Group removes that amount from the cash flow hedge reserve and includes it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or the liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence it does not affect other comprehensive income;\n- -(ii) for cash flow hedges other than those covered by i), that amount is reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss (for example, in the periods that interest income or interest expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs);\n- -(iii) however, if that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it immediately reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n\nMost hedged items are transaction related. The time value of options, forward elements of forward contracts, and foreign currency basis spreads of financial instruments that are hedging the items affect profit or loss at the same time as those hedged items.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging relationship (or a part of a hedging relationship) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after taking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\nWhen the Group discontinues hedge accounting for a cash flow hedge it accounts for the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur, that amount remains in the cash flow hedge reserve until the future cash flows occur. However, if that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it immediately reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment;\n- \u00b7 if the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, that amount is immediately reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. A hedged future cash flow that is no longer highly probable to occur may still be expected to occur.",

Fair value of financial instruments\n\nValuation techniques and assumptions used for measuring fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nQuoted market prices are available for financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions that are traded on active markets. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are equal to their quoted prices, if available. In case such quoted prices are not available, the fair value of the financial instruments is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts for non-optional derivatives. Optional derivatives are fair valued based on option pricing models, taking into account the present value of probability weighted expected future payoffs, using market reference formulas.\n\nThe fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities)\n\n| In \u20acmillion                                                                                         | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                                     | Carrying amount     | Fair value          | Carrying amount     | Fair value          |\n| Non-current assets - Financial instruments                                                          | 136                 | 136                 | 197                 | 197                 |\n| Loans and other non-current assets (except pension  fund surpluses and long-term inventory balance) | 136                 | 136                 | 197                 | 197                 |\n| Non-current liabilities - Financial instruments                                                     | -1,774              | -1,774              | -2,148              | -1,994              |\n| Bonds                                                                                               | 0                   | 0                   | -1,994              | -1,830              |\n| Other non-current debts                                                                             | -1,735              | -1,735              | -42                 | -42                 |\n| Other liabilities                                                                                   | -39                 | -39                 | -112                | -112                |\n\nThe carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities are estimated to reasonably approximate their fair values, due to the short term to maturity.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position\n\nThe table 'Financial instruments measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position' provides an analysis of financial instruments that, subsequent to their initial recognition, are measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. Financial instruments, classified as held for trading and as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges are mainly grouped into Levels 1 and 2. They are fair valued based on forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and interest rates of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity. The equity instruments measured at fair value through OCI and through profit and loss are presented within Level 1 and 3. The fair value of the instruments presented under Level 3 is measured based on the guidelines recommended by The International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV).\n\nIn accordance with the Group internal rules, the responsibility for measuring the fair value level resides with (a) the Treasury department for the nonutility derivative financial instruments, and the non-derivative financial liabilities, (b) the Sustainable Development and Energy department for the utility derivative financial instruments and (c) the Finance department for non-derivative financial assets.\n\nThe Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. During the year, no such transfers have occurred.",

The remaining amounts are related to changes in fair value of equity swaps for long-term incentives.\n\nIn 2023, in the caption other gains and losses on net indebtedness, the foreign exchange income decreased by \u20ac(13) million in comparison to 2022. The gain of \u20ac6 million (\u20ac11 million for 2022) is related to the interest element of financial derivatives (forward points). The other costs increased by \u20ac(7) million in 2023 in comparison to 2022 due to one off costs incurred in the frame of the separation plan.\n\nIncome and expenses on financial instruments recognized in other comprehensive income include the following:\n\n| In \u20acmillion                                                                                                                    | Cash flow hedges       | Cash flow hedges       | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges            | Cash flow hedges            | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                | Foreign currency  risk | Foreign currency  risk | Interest rate risk | Interest rate risk | Commodity risk     | Commodity risk     | Risk on Solvay  share price | Risk on Solvay  share price | Total              | Total              |\n|                                                                                                                                | 2023                   | 2022                   | 2023               | 2022               | 2023               | 2022               | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2023               | 2022               |\n| January 1                                                                                                                      | 13                     | -7                     |                    |                    | 67                 | 7                  |                             | 2                           | 81                 | 1                  |\n| Recycling from other comprehen- sive income of derivative financial  instruments designated in a cash  flow hedge relationship | -41                    | 31                     | 9                  |                    | 13                 | -257               |                             |                             | -20                | -226               |\n| Effective portion of changes in fair  value of cash flow hedge                                                                 | 29                     | -10                    | -70                |                    | -167               | 317                |                             | -1                          | -209               | 306                |\n| December 31                                                                                                                    | 1                      | 13                     | -61                |                    | -87                | 67                 |                             | 1                           | -148               | 81                 |\n\nConventionally, (+) indicates an increase and (-) a reduction in equity.\n\n## F32.C. Capital management\n\nSee 2 Capital, shares and shareholders in respect of capital in the Corporate Governance statement chapter of this annual report.\n\nThe Group manages its funding structure with the objective of safeguarding its ability to continue as a going concern, optimizing the return for shareholders, maintaining an investment-grade rating, and minimizing the cost of debt.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consisted of equity (including perpetual hybrid bonds on December 31, 2022 (see note F28 Equity)) and of net debt (see note F33 Net indebtedness). Perpetual hybrid bonds were nevertheless considered as debt in the Group's underlying metrics. There are no hybrid bonds at the end of 2023.\n\nBesides the statutory minimum equity funding requirements that apply to the Company's subsidiaries in the different countries, Solvay is not subject to any additional legal capital requirements.\n\nThe Treasury department reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis under the authority and the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer. As appropriate, the Legal department is involved to ensure compliance with legal and contractual requirements.\n\n## F32.D. Financial risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to market risk from movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other market prices (utility prices, CO 2 emission rights prices and equity prices). The Group's senior management oversees the management of these risks and is supported by the Treasury department (non-commodity risks) and Solvay Sustainable Development and Energy department that advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. Both departments provide assurance to the Group's senior management that the Group's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives. Solvay uses derivative financial instruments to hedge clearly identified foreign exchange, interest rate, index, utility price and CO 2 emission rights price risks (hedging instruments). All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. However, the required criteria to apply hedge accounting are not met in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, the Group is also exposed to liquidity risks and credit risks.\n\n## Foreign currency risks\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is an essential chemical company with operations worldwide, and hence undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, the Group is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. In 2023, the Group was mainly exposed to US Dollar, Chinese Yuan and Brazilian Real.\n- \u00b7 To mitigate its foreign currency risk, the Group has defined a hedging policy that is essentially based on the principles of financing its activities in local currency and hedges the transactional exchange risk at the time of invoicing (risk which is certain). The Group constantly monitors its activities in foreign currencies and hedges, where appropriate, the exchange rate exposures on expected cash flows (risk which is highly probable).",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilizing forward foreign exchange contracts or, when appropriate, other derivatives like currency options.\n- \u00b7 In the course of 2023, the \u20ac/US$ exchange rate moved from 1.0674 at the start of January to 1.1052 at the end of December (from 1.1327 to 1.0674 in 2022).\n- \u00b7 A fluctuation of (0.10) to the US$/\u20acexchange rate, would generate in 2023 about \u20ac30 million (\u20ac180 million for 2022) variation to the EBITDA; 63% of this variation is at conversion level and 37% at transaction level, the latter being mostly hedged. EBITDA is the key non-IFRS metric for operational performance as defined in the glossary.\n- \u00b7 At the end of 2023, a strengthening of the US dollar vs euro would increase the net debt by approximately \u20ac0 million (\u20ac87 million in 2022) per 0.10 US$/\u20acfluctuation. Conversely, a weakening of the US dollar vs euro would decrease the net debt by approximately \u20ac0 million (\u20ac72 million in 2022) per 0.10 US$/\u20acfluctuation.\n- \u00b7 The Group's currency risk can be split into two categories: translation and transactional risk.\n\n## Translation risk\n\n- \u00b7 The translation exchange risk is the risk affecting the Group's consolidated financial statements related to investees operating in a currency other than the euro (the Group's presentation currency).\n- \u00b7 During 2023 and 2022, the Group did not hedge the currency risk of foreign operations.\n\n## Transactional risk\n\nThe transactional risk is the exchange risk linked to a specific transaction, such as a Group entity buying or selling in a currency other than its functional currency.\n\nTo the largest extent possible, the Group manages the transactional risk on receivables and borrowings centrally and locally when centralization is not possible.\n\nThe choice of borrowing currency depends mainly on the opportunities offered by the various markets. This means that the selected currency is not necessarily that of the country in which the funds will be invested. Nonetheless, operating entities are financed essentially in their functional currencies.\n\nIn emerging countries, it is not always possible to borrow in local currency, either because funds are not available in local financial markets, or because the financial conditions are too onerous. In such a situation, the Group has to borrow in a different currency. Nonetheless, the Group considers opportunities to refinance its borrowings in emerging countries with local currency debt.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are classified into the two categories described below.\n\n## Held for trading\n\nThe transactional risk is managed either by spot or forward contracts. Unless documented as hedging instruments (see above), derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading.\n\nIn 2023, the notional amounts transacted to manage the transactional risk are:\n\n- \u00b7 a long position of \u20ac271 million (compared to \u20ac343 million in 2022);\n- \u00b7 a short position of \u20ac(284) million (compared to \u20ac(666) million in 2022);\n- \u00b7 In comparison to 2022, the separation plan that occurred in 2023 led to a decrease of the transactional risk (mainly in China) that impacted the short position by \u20ac(382) million.\n\nThe following table details the notional amounts of the Group's derivatives contracts outstanding at the end of the period:\n\n| In \u20acmillion                     |   Notional amount  (1) |   Notional amount  (1) |   Fair value assets |   Fair value assets |   Fair value liabilities |   Fair value liabilities |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| December 31                     |                   2023 |                   2022 |                2023 |                2022 |                     2023 |                     2022 |\n| Held for trading long position  |                    271 |                    343 |                   1 |                   1 |                       -1 |                       -1 |\n| Held for trading short position |                   -284 |                   -666 |                   2 |                   4 |                        0 |                       -2 |\n| Total                           |                    -13 |                   -323 |                   3 |                   5 |                       -1 |                       -3 |\n\n(1) Long/(short) positions (if the foreign exchange transaction does not involve the functional currency, both notional amounts are considered).\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge identified foreign exchange rate risks. It documents those as hedging instruments unless it hedges a recognized financial asset or liability when generally no cash flow hedge relationship is documented. Most hedges are transaction related.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Group had mainly hedged highly probable sales in foreign currencies (short position) in a nominal amount of US$203 million (\u20ac184 million) and JP\u00a5134 million (\u20ac1 million). All cash flow hedge contracts that exist at the end of December 2023 will be settled within the next 12 months, and will impact profit or loss during that period.",

Long/(short) positions.\n- (2) In compliance with Group Treasury Policy the percentage of hedged exposure will reach the progressive minimum compliance level of 60% in 2023.\n- (3) The hedging instruments are located in the line item: \"Other Receivables\" and \"Other Liabilities\" in the statement of financial position.\n- (4) In compliance with Group Treasury Policy the hedging will be stopped in 2024 due to the low materiality exposure.\n\nHedge relationships are seldom perfect. Therefore, ineffectiveness could  arise with the result that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk and the hedging instrument do not offset within a period. The sources of hedge ineffectiveness that could potentially affect the hedging relationship during its term are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 A reduction in the amount of the forecast sales resulting in quantity or notional amount differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument are based on different quantities or notional amounts.\n- \u00b7 A significant change in the credit risk of parties.\n\nTiming differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are settled at different dates.\n\nIn 2023, no hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## December 31, 2022\n\n| In \u20acmillion                                            | Notional  amount of  the instru- ment  (1)             | Notional  amount of the  risk exposure

Moreover, the Group purchases raw materials with a price formula referring to market indices. In order to reduce the cost volatility, the Group has developed a policy for exchanging variable price against fixed price through derivative financial instruments. Most of these hedging instruments can be documented as hedging instruments of the underlying purchase contracts. Utility purchase contracts at fixed price with a physical delivery for use in the Group's operations are qualified as own use contracts and constitute a natural hedge. Those have not been included in this note.\n\nFinancial hedging of utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks is managed centrally by Energy Services on behalf of the Group entities.\n\nEnergy Services also carries out trading transactions with respect to utility and CO 2 .",

Therefore, ineffectiveness could  arise with the result that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk and the hedging instrument do not offset within a period. The sources of hedge ineffectiveness that could potentially affect the hedging relationship during its term are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7 A reduction in the amount of the forecast sales resulting in quantity or notional amount differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument are based on different quantities or notional amounts.\n- \u00b7 A significant change in the credit risk of parties.\n- \u00b7 Timing differences - the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are settled at different dates.\n\nIn 2023, no hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nThe Group covered a part of its CO 2 emission rights in inventory by forward sales of CO 2 emission rights to a related party. The Group qualifies this hedging strategy as fair value hedge. The change in fair value of forward sales are accounted for in profit and loss, concomitantly with the revaluation of the CO 2 emission rights held in inventory.\n\nThe Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio for the underlying risk of the forward sales of CO 2 emission rights to the related party that is identical to the hedged risk component.\n\nThe impact of the hedging instrument on the statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023, is as follows:\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n|                                 |                                 |                     |

PSU plan 2022 hedges were unwound during the 2023 year prior separation date. The group will assess during 2024 the necessary steps to mitigate future potential risk.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nSee the Financial risk in the Management of risks section of this annual report for additional information on credit risk management.\n\nThe Group continuously monitors the credit risk of important business partners.\n\nThe Group engages in transactions only with financial institutions with a good credit rating. The Group monitors and manages exposures to financial institutions within approved counterparty credit limits and credit risk parameters in order to mitigate the risk of default. For financial guarantees, see note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\nThe Group recognizes expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables: it applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables, using a provision matrix in order to calculate the lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables, using historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group classifies the customers and their related receivables in various rating classes, based on the risks' grading attributed to the customers and on the aging balance of receivables. As such, for all receivables overdue below six months, the Group considers percentages within a range between 0.005% and 4.031%, depending on the rating class. For all receivables overdue in excess of six months, the Group considers a rate of 50% or of 100%, depending on the rating class. The customer's grading is reviewed annually for customers assessed as low risk profile, and every six months for customers assessed as higher risk profile.\n\nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk at Group level because the receivables' credit risk is spread over a large number of customers and markets.",

In addition, external factors impacting the global liquidity markets could also make financing sources less accessible.\n\nThe Finance Committee gives its opinion on the appropriate liquidity risk management for the Group's short, medium and long term funding and liquidity management requirements.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecasts and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group staggers the maturities of its financing sources over time in order to limit amounts to be refinanced each year.\n\nThe following tables detail the Group's remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with contractual repayment periods.\n\nThe tables have been prepared using the discounted cash flows of financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.\n\nThe following tables present discounted amounts (carrying amounts):\n\nIn \u20acmillion\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n| Outflows of cash:                   | Total   | Within one year   | In year two   | In years three  to five   | Beyond five years   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n| Trade payables                      | 850     | 850               |               |                           |                     |\n| Dividends payables                  | 175     | 175               |               |                           |                     |\n| Financial instruments - operational | 140     | 108               | 32            |                           |                     |\n| Other non-current liabilities       | 34      |                   | 12            | 2                         | 20                  |\n| Financial debt                      | 1,885   | 148               | 1,711         | 23                        | 3                   |\n| Leasing debt                        | 307     | 63                | 44            | 92                        | 107                 |\n| Total                               | 3,390   | 1,344             | 1,799         | 117                       | 130                 |\n\n| In \u20acmillion                         | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022       | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Outflows of cash:                   | Total               | Within one year     | In year two         | In years three  to five | Beyond five years   |\n| Trade payables                      | 2,296               | 2,296               |                     |                         |                     |\n| Dividends payables                  | 165                 | 165                 |                     |                         |                     |\n| Financial instruments - operational | 867                 | 675                 | 20                  | 172                     |                     |\n| Other non-current liabilities       | 99                  |                     | 59                  | 26                      | 14                  |\n| Financial debt                      | 2,435               | 399                 | 10                  | 1,423                   | 604                 |\n| Leasing debt                        | 524                 | 111                 | 90                  | 160                     | 164                 |\n| Total                               | 6,386               | 3,646               | 178                 | 1,781                   | 782                 |",

If the option is taken, the Group's liability is assigned by the supplier to the partner bank. The value of the Group's liability remains unchanged. The Group assesses each arrangement against indicators to determine if the liabilities which suppliers have sold to the partner bank under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as financial debt. On December 31, 2023 and 2022, the liabilities met the criteria of Trade Payables.\n\nSolvay's liquidity amounts to \u20ac2.1 billion including \u20ac0.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the statement of financial position and \u20ac1.4 billion of committed fully undrawn credit facilities (\u20ac1.1 billion multilateral RCF due 2028 with extension possibility, and \u20ac0.3 billion bilateral RCF due in 2026 with extension possibilities) unused at the end of December 2023. Solvay is negotiating two other bilateral lines for up to \u20ac0.15 billion).\n\nIn addition, Solvay has access to a Belgian Treasury Bill program for \u20ac1.0 billion (no outstanding balance on December 31, 2023). The program is covered by a back-up credit line.",

decreased by \u20ac(299) million, mainly in short term financial debt:\n\n- \u00b7 the increase in borrowings of \u20ac1,519 million is mainly explained by the drawdowns under a bridge facility (\u20ac600 million and US$816 million) and a credit facility (US$200 million).\n- \u00b7 the decrease in borrowings of \u20ac(1,500) million is explained by the repayment of the 2029 Bonds for \u20ac(600) million, the redemption of the USD 2025 Bonds for $(800) million and the repayment of the credit facility for US$200 million.\n- \u00b7 the decrease reported under other financing cash flows of \u20ac(279) million is explained by margin calls on hedging instruments as part of Energy Services' activities;\n- \u00b7 the transfer from non-current financial debt to current of \u20ac1,460 million is explained above;\n- \u00b7 the transfer to Syensqo for \u20ac(1,472) million mainly explained by the bridge facilities of \u20ac600 million and US$816 million.\n\nThe other financial instruments decreased by \u20ac(87) million, mainly for the collateral related to the margin calls on energy services, following the decrease in the energy, CO 2 and gas prices.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE F36\n\n## CONTINGENT ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nA contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.\n\nContingent assets are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realized. However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.\n\nContingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, the Group discloses the contingent asset.\n\n## A contingent liability is:\n\n- \u00b7 (a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or\n- \u00b7 (b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because:\n- -(i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or\n- -(ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability\n\nContingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements, except if they arise from a business combination. They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nFinancial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nIn order to avoid double counting, only guarantees in excess of liabilities recognized or disclosures made elsewhere in the Group's consolidated financial statements are disclosed in this note. Regarding financial guarantees, all financial guarantees of the Group are presented in this note.\n\n| In \u20acmillion                          | December 31, 2023   |   December 31, 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Contingent assets                    |                     |                  91 |\n| Guarantees for pensions              | 55                  |                 378 |\n| Environmental contingent liabilities | 271                 |                 315 |\n| Guarantee on Cytec 2025 Bonds        | 151                 |                   0 |\n| Contingent liabilities               | 477                 |                 693 |\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nThere are no contingent assets at the end of 2023. See Note F8 Discontinued operations for additional information on the collection of the contingent assets from Edison in Q1, 2023.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe guarantees for pensions are related to the main UK Pension Funds (\u20ac55 million) - See note F32.B.2. Description of obligations. Such corresponds to the recognized plan assets surplus as at December 31, 2023 or the amount by which the guarantee exceeds the recognized pension liability (as at December 31, 2022). This guarantee applies to the pension liability measured based on a local UK regulatory basis (prudential basis) plus an allocation for market risk, which is higher when compared to the IAS 19 methodology. The probability of the guarantees being called is considered to be highly remote. The decrease over the prior year is mainly attributable to the Partial Demerger of Syensqo.\n\nContingent liabilities of \u20ac271 million above relate to environmental remediation matters that can be estimated with sufficient reliability.\n\nGenerally, in line with good business practice, we are not reporting any pending or threatened proceeding, which has not matured, and where the probability of existing or future exposure is unlikely or uncertain, where financial impact is not estimable and for which we are not able to quantify contingent liabilities.\n\nSee note F31.B Provisions for additional information.",

        "page_content": "## HSE related proceedings\n\nRosignano site: The Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of Livorno, Italy initiated preliminary criminal investigations in 2019 regarding the alleged contamination of certain water tables outside our site and in our former landfill of Rosignano, Italy site. These investigations are still ongoing.\n\n## Bulgaria\n\nIn Bulgaria, Solvay Sodi AD, a subsidiary of Solvay, is subject to certain state-imposed obligations for emergency oil stocks (reserves) for 2021 through 2023, for which it was not able to comply. As a result, the competent Bulgarian authority imposed fines for 2021 and 2022 on Solvay Sodi AD of approximately \u20ac15 million for our share of the penalties which were fully provisioned. For 2023, the order is suspended and as a result no fine is imposed and therefore no provision has been recorded. Should this suspension be lifted, an additional penalty of \u20ac9 million may be imposed on Solvay Sodi AD. Solvay Sodi AD has brought a lawsuits to contest these fines and is seeking relief through national authorities pleading that the existing Bulgarian emergency stocks system is not compatible with the EU law, and in its current form obligations for emergency oil reserves should apply only to companies trading in crude oil and liquid fuels. Financial Guarantees\n\n## Cytec 2025 Bonds\n\nThe 3.95% Senior Notes due 2025 issued by Cytec Industries Inc. (the 'Cytec 2025 Bonds') were transferred to Syensqo SA/NV with Cytec Industries Inc. as of December 8, 2023, for US$163.5 million (151.2 million euros at December 31, 2023). A counter guarantee was issued from Syensqo SA/ NV in favor of Solvay SA/NV as Solvay SA/NV remained the original guarantor. As Syensqo SA/NV, the ultimate parent of Cytec Industries, Inc. is an investment grade company and due to the short period of time before the bonds are due to be repaid, the Group deemed risk of default to be remote, and as such no provision was recorded.\n\n## NOTE F37\n\n## RELATED PARTIES\n\nBalances and transactions between Solvay SA/NV and (a) its subsidiaries and (b) its joint operations for the Group's share of the respective joint operations, which are related parties of Solvay SA/NV, have been eliminated in consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties are disclosed below.\n\n## Sale and purchase transactions\n\n| In \u20acmillion           |   Sale of goods |      |      |      |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|------|------|------|\n|                       |            2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |\n| Associates            |              12 |   20 |  -35 |  -38 |\n| Joint ventures        |               8 |   31 |   -3 |  -20 |\n| Other related parties |              23 |   91 |  -45 |  -98 |\n| Total                 |              43 |  142 |  -82 | -157 |\n\n| In \u20acmillion           |   Amounts owed by related parties |   Amounts owed by related parties |   Amounts owed to related parties |   Amounts owed to related parties |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| December 31           |                              2023 |                              2022 |                              2023 |                              2022 |\n| Associates            |                                 0 |                                 0 |                                 9 |                                 4 |\n| Joint ventures        |                                 0 |                                 0 |                                 0 |                                 1 |\n| Other related parties |                                14 |                                15 |                                 4 |                                28 |\n| Total                 |                                14 |                                15 |                                13 |                                34 |",

SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF SOLVAY SA/NV\n\nThe annual financial statements of Solvay SA/NV are presented in a summary format below. In accordance with the Belgian Code of Companies and Asociations, the annual financial statements of Solvay SA/NV, the management report and the statutory auditor's report will be filed with the National Bank of Belgium.\n\nThese documents are also available free of charge on the internet or upon request sent to:\n\nSolvay SA/NV\n\nRue de Ransbeek 310\n\nB - 1120 Brussels\n\n## Introductory note\n\nUntil December 8, 2023, Solvay SA/NV ('Solvay' or the 'Company') owned and controlled the Specialty Polymers, Composites, Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma Performance and Oil and Gas Solutions businesses (together, the 'Specialty Businesses'), and the Soda Ash and Derivatives, Peroxides, Silica, Special Chem and Coatis businesses (together, the 'Essential Businesses'). Effective December 9, 2023, at 00:00 a.m. CET, the Specialty Businesses were separated from Solvay by way of a partial demerger of the Company under Belgian law (the 'Partial Demerger'), whereby the shares and other interests held by the Company in the legal entities operating the Specialty Businesses, the Company's rights and obligations under the agreements entered into with those legal entities, as well as certain other assets and liabilities were contributed to Syensqo SA/NV ('Syensqo'), and ordinary shares of Syensqo were issued and allocated directly to shareholders in Solvay on a pro rata basis.\n\nIt should be noted that from an accounting point of view, this Partial Demerger had retroactive effect to July 1, 2023. In addition, the Belgian tax authorities (Service des D\u00e9cisions Anticip\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re fiscale) agreed to consider July 1, 2023, for the purposes of the application of Belgian corporate income tax rules to Solvay. The significant variations that appear in 2023 in the accounts of Solvay SA/NV are largely justified by the effects of the Partial Demerger and the subsequent contributions to the Belgian company Syensqo SA/NV.\n\nThe balance sheet of Solvay SA/NV at the end of the year 2023 presented below is based on a dividend distribution of \u20ac2.43 per share.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Solvay SA/NV still has one Branch, Solvay S.A. Italia (Viale Lombardia 20, 20021 Bollate, Italy).\n\nThe accounts of Solvay SA/NV are prepared in accordance with Belgian generally accepted accounting principles.",

It consists of gross defined benefit obligations (\u20ac 1,836 million) offset partially by plan assets (\u20ac 1,222 million).

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISA's will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn performing our audit, we comply with the legal, regulatory and normative framework that applies to the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Belgium. However, a statutory audit does not provide assurance about the future viability of the Company and the Group, nor about the efficiency or effectiveness with which the board of directors has taken or will undertake the Company's and the Group's business operations.\n\n4",

We also perform the following tasks:\n\n- \u00b7 identification and assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, the planning and execution of audit procedures to respond to these risks and obtain audit evidence which is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than when such misstatements result from errors, since fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtaining insight in the system of internal controls that are relevant for the audit and with the objective to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the selected and applied accounting policies, and evaluating the reasonability of the accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors as well as the underlying information given by the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going-concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether or not a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's or Group's ability to continue as a going concern.

However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going-concern;\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and evaluating whether the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect a true and fair view of the underlying transactions and events.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee within the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the audits of the subsidiaries. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities.\n\nWe provide the Audit Committee within the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee within the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our report, unless the law or regulations prohibit this.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and the content of the Board of\n\nDirectors' report on the Consolidated Financial Statements, the non-financial information attached to the Board of Directors' report, and other information included in the annual report.\n\n5",

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## EY's responsibilities under a reasonable assurance engagement\n\nOur responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the presentation of Solvay SA's sustainability indicators listed in Appendix A based on the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our reasonable engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE 3000 revised').

Prior to the adoption of IFRS 16, operating lease payments were included within free cash flow. Following the application of IFRS 16, because leases are generally considered to be operating in nature, free cash flow incorporates the payment of the lease liability (excluding the interest expense). Excluding this item in the free cash flow would result in a significant improvement of free cash flow compared to prior periods, whereas the operations themselves have not been affected by the implementation of IFRS 16.
