Against this backdrop,the challenge for our nation, our industry and PPL is clear.\n\nThe U.S. has set agoal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Achieving this will require economy-wide decarbonization, resulting in a projected two- to three-foff ld increase in electricity demand.Collectively, we will need to meet this demand while aging, reliable and dispatchable fossil-fueled generation retires across the country.This, in turn, will require faster action and commercialization of new technologies than our industry has ever achieved.\n\nAbove all, for the clean energy transition to be successful and sustainable, we must maintain reliability and affoff rdabilityt for our customers. Without that, the transition will stop in its tracks.\n\nIn recent years, we've repositioned PPL with great purpose to succeed and grow in this changing landscape, to create long-term value for our customers and shareowners, to lead from a position of strength, and to create the technology-gg enabled utilities of the future necessary to deliver the clean energy transition safely, reliably and affoff rdably.\n\nBelow we offeff r a closer look at our plans, progress and performanceff .\n\n## DELIVERINGONOURCOMMITMENTS\n\n2023 was a year of challenges met and promises kept.\n\nMost importantly, we delivered electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to our more than 3.5 million customers. This included top-quartile reliabilityt at each of our utilities despite heightened storm activity, as well as generation reliability in Kentucky that was once again among the nation's best.\n\nDespite mild weather and storm impacts of more than $100 million, we delivered on all our financial commitments to shareowners. Through our strong focus on operational effiff ciency and outperformff ance in key areas, we exceeded the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast by two cents per share, achieving $1.60 per share and driving 8% growth from pro forma 2022 1 .\n\nAt the same time, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend in early 2023 in line with our 6-8% earnings and dividend growth targets. We followed that early this year with a 7.3% dividend increase paid April 1, 2024.\n\nAs we continue to invest responsibly in the future, we executed $2.4 billion in infrastructure improvements on time and on budget to advance a reliable, resilient, affoff rdable and cleaner energy future. And to help keep energy affoff rdable, we exceeded our 2023 operations and maintenance (O&M) savings target of $50-60 million, ultimately delivering $75 million in annual savings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincent Sorgi President and Chief Executive Officerff\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCraig A. Rogersono Independent Chair of the Board\n\nthrough our strong focus on technologygg and business transformatff ion.\n\nUnderpinned by sound planning and effeff ctive management of regulatory proceedings, we secured constructive regulatory outcomes in Kentucky and Rhode Island. This included approval for approximately $2 billion in generation investments to safely, reliably and affoff rdably advance a cleaner energy mix in Kentucky. In addition, it included approval to deploy advanced metering statewide in Rhode Island as we laya a foundation for a smarter,rr more resilient, more reliable and more dynamic grid that supports the state's ambitious climate goals.\n\nWe also continued to provide a smooth and seamless transition to PPL ownership for our Rhode Island Energy customers, completing all planned integration milestones for 2023 and keeping us on track to exit in 2024 the remaining transition services currently provided by National Grid.\n\nThese achievements are a direct result of our unwavering focus on execution, our disciplined investment strategy,gg our ability to adjust whenchallenges arise, our experienced leadership team and our clarity of purpose across PPL.\n\n## LEADINGFROMAPOSITIONOFSTRENGTH\n\nAs we set our sights on the remainder of 2024 and beyond, we're excited and readyd for the future, and we're built to lead from a position of strength.\n\nOur updated business plan projects 6%-8% annual earnings and dividend growth per share through at least 2027. Bolstered by actions we've taken to strategically reposition PPL in recent years, wemaintain one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector,rr one capable of funding growth without the need for equity issuances through at least 2027.\n\nMoving forward, we have a robust capital plan that features $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements through 2027 to expand and modernize the grid and advance a cleaner energy mix. These investments will deliver better outcomes for our customers while supporting continued growth for shareowners.",

        "page_content": "Meanwhile, we continue to find opportunities to drive greater efficff iencies to help keep energy affoff rdable as we invest in the clean energygg transition and improve reliability for our customers. Toward this end, we've made outstanding progress on our multi-year target of at least $175 million in annual O&M savings by 2026, with employees and teams across PPL continuously identifying opportunities to work smarter and more effiff ciently.\n\nLast but not least, we continue to foster a culture of innovation across PPL and have a proven track record of success in everything from self-healff ing grid automation to leading-edge distributed energy resource management systems. Going forward, major changes will be needed to the nation's energy networks to meet changing expectations. This is a clear area of strength and experience for PPL.\n\n## CREATINGUTILITIESOFTHEFUTURE\n\nPPL will continue to be a leader in defining and creating the utilities of the future for the benefit of all stakeholders. In fact, our utility of the future strategygg is core to everything we do.\n\nOur corresponding strategic objectives are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhance the reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas networks through innovation and strategic infrastructure investments.\n- \u00b7 Advance a cleaner energy future affoff rdably and reliably for our customers.\n- \u00b7 Deliver operational efficff iencies to support the clean energy transition and customer affoff rdability.\n- \u00b7 Engage with key stakeholders to improve resource adequacy in the deregulated markets in which we operate.\n- \u00b7 Help drive economic development and customer growth in our states and service territories.\n- \u00b7 Empower customers through digital solutions and better customer service.\n\nAdvancing this strategygg means updating our design criteria and continuing to harden our transmission and distribution systems to protect against climate change and keep our systems and data secure against cybc er threats. It involves expanding our industry-leading use of technologygg that includes smart grids, automation, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to build a self-healiff ng grid.\n\nIt means investing in research and development to drive innovation like our planned natural gas combined-cycc le carbon capture project - recently selected for negotiation of a $72 million U.S. Department of Energy award - as we seek to advance technologies that can be scaled safelff y, reliably and affoff rdably to meet our customers' evolving energy needs and achieve net-zero.\n\nAt the same time, our strategygg involves expanding transmission networks and incorporating grid-enhancing technologies to connect more renewables and improve reliability for our customers; advancing a cleaner generation mix while keeping energy safe, reliable and affoff rdable; expanding our ability to\n\nreliably manage two-waya power floff ws on distribution networks as we connect significantly more distributed energy; and driving operational efficienff cies to support an affoff rdable clean energy transition.\n\nAs we take these actions, it's important that we engage with stakeholders to drive legislative, regulatory and market design changes that ensure we preserve sufficientff dispatchable generation capacity to meet our customers' growing needs, including demand from data centers and other areas of economic growth and electrification.\n\nLastly,creating the utilities of the future means expanding self-serff vice options for our customers by using digital tools to enhance the customer experience.\n\nWe are confident that this strategy is the right approach in an increasingly dynamic energy landscape, and our business plan is built tosupport it.\n\n## BUILDINGMOMENTUM\n\nAs we advance our utility of the future strategygg in 2024 and beyond, we've structured ourselves in a waya that will drive even greater operational efficiencyff , improve our agility, and enable us to implement new and beneficial technologygg with greater speed moving forward.\n\nEarly this year,r we also created a new chief technologygg and innovation officerff position, reporting directly to the CEO, to oversee our effoff rts to deploy the latest technologygg in support of a reliable, affoff rdable clean energy transition. Dean A. Del Vecchio has extensive experience driving digital transformff ation for several iconic brands and will further energize our utility of the future strategy.gg\n\nFinancially, we're as strong as we've been in years, and our 2023 perfoff rmance and strong business outlook have resulted in positive relative share price performanceff compared to other publicly traded U.S. utilities. In fact, PPL now trades at a slight premium to our peer group average on a price-to-earnings basis as of March 20, compared to a meaningful discount just 18 months ago.\n\nAcross PPL, we're mindful of the critical role we playa in society and our responsibilities to our shareowners, customers and the communities we serve. With that in mind, our vision is to be the best utility in the U.S., and we're determined to achieve this vision.\n\nThank you for your continued support of PPL.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincent Sorgi President and Chief Executive Officff er\n\nCraig A.

KU was incorporated in Kentucky in 1912 and in Virginia in 1991.\n\n## Segment Information\n\n## (PPL)\n\nPPL is organized into three reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: Kentucky Regulated, which primarily represents the results of LG&E and KU, Pennsylvania Regulated, which primarily represents the results of PPL Electric, and Rhode Island Regulated, which primarily represents the results of RIE. \"Corporate and Other\" primarily includes corporate level financing costs, certain unallocated costs, and certain non-recoverable costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of Narragansett Electric and the financial results of Safari Energy, prior to its sale on November 1, 2022.\n\nBeginning on January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment also included the financing activities of LKE. The financing activity of LKE is presented in \"Corporate and Other\" beginning on January 1, 2023. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. As a result, PPL's segments consist of its regulated operations in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and exclude any incremental financing activities of holding companies, which Management believes is a more meaningful presentation as it provides information on the core regulated operations of PPL.\n\nAcomparison of PPL's Regulated segments is shown below.\n\n|                                         | Kentucky Regulated   | Pennsylvania Regulated   | Rhode Island Regulated   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| For the year ended December 31, 2023:   |                      |                          |                          |\n| Operating Revenues (in billions)        | $ 3.5                | $ 3.0                    | $ 1.9                    |\n| Net Income (in millions)                | $ 552                | $ 519                    | $ 96                     |\n| Electricity delivered (GWh)             | 28,809               | 35,704                   | 7,174                    |\n| Natural gas delivered (Bcf)             | 41                   | -                        | 38                       |\n| At December 31, 2023:                   |                      |                          |                          |\n| Regulatory Asset Base (in billions) (a) | $ 12.0               | $ 9.8                    | $ 3.2                    |\n| Service area (in square miles)          | 8,000                | 10,000                   | 1,200                    |\n| Customers (in millions)                 | 1.3                  | 1.5                      | 0.8                      |\n\nSee Note 2 to the Financial Statements for additional financial information by segment.

        "page_content": "## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, also Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electric service to approximately 436,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 335,000 customers in its electric service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 545,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts.\n\n## Franchises and Licenses\n\nLG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities.\n\n## Competition\n\nThere are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electric service areas of LG&E and KU. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LG&E and KU, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated.\n\nAlternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&E's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price passthrough mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.\n\n## Power Supply\n\nAt December 31, 2023, LG&E owned generating capacity of 2,760 MW and KU owned generating capacity of 4,775 MW.\n\nThe system capacity of LG&E's and KU's owned generation is based upon several factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.\n\nDuring 2023, LG&E's and KU's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity:\n\n|             | GWh    | GWh    |\n|-------------|--------|--------|\n| Fuel Source | LG&E   | KU     |\n| Coal        | 10,509 | 13,219 |\n| Gas         | 1,241  | 4,120  |\n| Hydro       | 272    | 44     |\n| Solar       | 8      | 12     |\n| Total (a)   | 12,030 | 17,395 |",

        "page_content": "The majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases.\n\nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa.\n\nDue to environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, as of December 31, 2023, LG&E and KU have retired approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generation plants since 2010.\n\nLG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW Solar Share facility to service a Solar Share program. The Solar Share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the Solar Share facility. Construction commences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. Construction of five 500-kilowatt phases was completed as of December 31, 2022. LG&E and KU continue to market the program and are accepting subscriptions for the sixth 500kilowatt phase.\n\nOn January 23, 2020, LG&E and KU applied to the KPSC for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 MW of solar power in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility and resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in early 2025. In 2020, the KPSC approved LG&E's and KU's applications. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOn October 6, 2021, LG&E and KU entered into an agreement to purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed 125 MW third-party solar generation facility in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase output of the facility and resell power as renewable energy to certain large customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2026. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that this agreement will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOn December 15, 2022, LG&E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction and purchase of various generating facilities in conjunction with the retirement of four existing coal-fired generation units and three small gasfired units. On March 24, 2023, Kentucky Senate Bill 4 (SB 4) went into effect, which requires KPSC approval of the retirement of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in the state. On May 10, 2023, LG&E and KU filed an application with the KPSC seeking approval of the retirement of seven fossil fuel-fired generating units as required by SB 4. On May 16, 2023, the KPSC entered an Order consolidating the SB 4 filing proceeding into the CPCN case.\n\nOn November 6, 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E's and KU's requests (i) to construct a 640 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine at LG&E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky, (ii) to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, (iii) to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky and (iv) to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station. The KPSC denied the request to construct a 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky at this time, based on the finding that the construction of this unit should be deferred with the construction date beginning on a date that provides for an in-service date in 2030. The order also authorized LG&E's and KU's entry into the four solar PPAs, subject to certain conditions, but deferred for future proceedings specific decisions on cost recovery treatment or mechanisms. Further, the order approved the new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs contained in the requested 2024-2030 DSM plan.\n\nThe KPSC order included approval of the requested retirements of two existing coal-fired generation units at LG&E's Mill Creek Unit 1 (300 MW) and 2 (297 MW) in 2024 and 2027, subject to certain conditions, and three small gas-fired units. The order denied approval of the retirement of KU's E.W. Brown 3 Unit (412 MW) and Ghent Unit 2 (486 MW) in 2028 at this time, citing the need for additional clarity regarding environmental compliance regulations.",

Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coalfired boilers.\n\nFuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by several factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues, high or low river level events, lock outages and other supplier or transporter operating or financial difficulties.\n\nLG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2028 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.\n\nFor their existing units, LG&E and KU expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail.\n\nTo enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity services with contracts of various durations through 2056 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7, six simple cycle combustion turbines at the Trimble County site, and the future Mill Creek Unit 5. This pipeline also serves the two simple cycle units at the Paddy's Run site. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility's connection to two interstate pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.\n\nLG&E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 through 2026. The bulk of the natural gas fuel is expected to be purchased on the spot market.\n\n## (PPL and LG&E)\n\n## Natural Gas Distribution Supply\n\nFour underground natural gas storage fields in service, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 11 Bcf, are used to provide natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases, and the cost of natural gas supply and pipeline transportation services are expected to be higher. At December 31, 2023, LG&E had 9 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $34 million. LG&E will continue work in 2024 on a multi-year project to retire",

This field had a working natural gas capacity of 4 Bcf.\n\nLG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are marketresponsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.\n\nLG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has a set of contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2025 and 2028. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. LG&E has two additional contracts with this same pipeline. One contract is for pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. The other contract is for pipeline capacity through 2028 for 30,000 MMBtu/day during the winter season. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2030.\n\nLG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Transmission\n\nLG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization.\n\n## Rates\n\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.\n\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.\n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\n\nKU's rates to two municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from thereturnonratebaseutilizedinthedevelopmentofmunicipalrates,noreturn is earned on the related assets.\n\nSee \"Financial and Operational Developments\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on current rate proceedings and rate mechanisms.",

PPL Electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act.\n\n## Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations\n\nPPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies that it has succeeded, and as a result of certification by the PAPUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.\n\n## Competition\n\nPursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PAPUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.\n\nThe PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.\n\n## Rates and Regulation\n\n## Transmission\n\nPPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.\n\nPJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.\n\nPPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, beginning in 2023, rates are put into effect on January 1st of each year based upon actual expenditures from the most recently filed FERC Form 1, forecasted capital additions, and other data based on PPL Electric's books and records. 2023 is considered a transitional period as the calendar year rate approved by FERC became effective April 1, 2023. Rates are compared during the year to the estimated annual expenses and capital additions that will be filed in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Under the mechanism, any difference between the revenue requirement in effect and actual expenditures incurred for that year",

See \"PLR\" below.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters.\n\n## Distribution\n\nPPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PAPUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.\n\nPennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electric distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PAPUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.\n\nAct 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.\n\nAct 11 authorizes the PAPUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and legislative and regulatory matters.\n\n## PLR\n\nThe Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PAPUC, to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PAPUC regulations. In 2023, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 42% of residential, 80% of small commercial and industrial and 97% of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\nPPL Electric's electricity generation costs are established based upon the results of a competitive solicitation process. In December 2020, the PAPUC approved PPL Electric's default service plan for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. Through December 31, 2023, six auctions of the plan were completed. This plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July. Through January 2024, six alternative energy credit solicitations have been completed.\n\nPursuant to the plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers who elect to take default service from PPL Electric. These solicitations contain a mix of products including 5-year block energy",

Distribution revenues are primarily from the sale of electricity, natural gas, and related services to retail customers. Distribution sales are regulated by the RIPUC, which is responsible for approving the rates and other terms of services as part of the rate making process. Natural gas and electric distribution revenues are derived from the regulated sale and distribution of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within RIE's service territory under the tariff rates. The tariff rates approved by the RIPUC are designed to recover the costs incurred by RIE for products and services provided, along with a return on investment.",

Currently, RIE's ISR and Renewable Energy Growth Program adjustment mechanisms are the only mechanisms authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in RIE's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and taxes.\n\n## Transmission\n\nRIE owns an electric transmission system in Rhode Island. RIE's transmission services are regulated by the FERC and coordinated with ISO - New England.\n\n## Deferral Mechanisms\n\nRIE records revenues in accordance with accounting principles for rate-regulated operations for arrangements between RIE and the applicable regulator. These include various deferral mechanisms such as capital trackers, energy efficiency programs, and other programs that qualify as Alternative Revenue Programs (ARPs). ARPs enable RIE to adjust rates in the future, in response to past activities or completed events. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to the RIE's delivery rates, as a result of the reconciliation between allowed revenue and billed revenue. RIE also has other ARPs related to the achievement of certain objectives, demand side management initiatives, and certain other rate making mechanisms. RIE recognizes ARPs with a corresponding offset to a regulatory asset or liability account when the regulatory specified events or conditions have been met, when the amounts are determinable, and are probable of recovery (or payment) through future rate adjustments.\n\n## Last Resort Service\n\nRIE is required by the RIPUC and by statute to provide Last Resort Service. Last Resort Service is available to all customers who have not elected to receive their electric supply from a non-regulated power producer or any customer who, for any reason, has stopped receiving generation service from a non-regulated power producer.\n\nThe charge for Last Resort Service is the sum of the applicable Last Resort Service charges in addition to all appropriate Retail Delivery charges as stated in the applicable tariff. The monthly charge for Last Resort Service also includes the costs incurred by RIE to comply with the Renewable Energy Standard, established in Rhode Island General Laws Section 39-26-1 and the costs to comply with the RIPUC's Rules Governing Energy Source Disclosure. The charge for Last Resort Service includes the administrative costs associated with the procurement of Last Resort Service, including an adjustment for uncollectible accounts as approved by the RIPUC.\n\nNumerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in RIE's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for RIE, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters.\n\n## Natural Gas Distribution Supply\n\nTo meet the projected annual gas supply requirements of approximately 37 Bcf, RIE has a portfolio of gas supply arrangements of varying contractual terms and durations to provide service to its customers. These natural gas supply arrangements include contracts with natural gas producers and marketers that reflect market price signals. RIE also has firm pipeline and underground storage capacity contracts to support the delivery of natural gas supplies to its customers. To manage the winter peak",

These contracts have various termination dates with certain contracts being subject to evergreen renewal provisions providing RIE with flexibility in managing its upstream resource portfolio.\n\nRIE has purchased and expects to continue to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions accessed by its pipeline capacity portfolio in South Texas, East Texas, and Louisiana, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas. RIE expects to purchase certain natural gas supplies that originate in Canada and from regional LNG import terminals.\n\n## Corporate and Other (PPL)\n\nPPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs.\n\nPPL Capital Funding provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL utilizes PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in financings, in addition to continued direct financing by certain operating subsidiaries. Unlike those of PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL.\n\nBeginning in 2023, the financing activity of LKE is included in Corporate and Other. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters, and may be subject to different and more stringent laws and regulations enacted in the future. The EPA and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters have issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. Due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. The Biden administration is currently undertaking changes in a wide range of environmental programs.\n\nSee 'Legal Matters' in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2024 through 2026. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs.\n\nLG&E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon KPSC review.

The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities.\n\n## Air\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## NAAQS\n\nApplicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the NAAQS, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. States that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish \"good neighbor\" state implementation plans. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional EPA program known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR).\n\nThe Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to establish and review NAAQS for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change, but the EPA subsequently announced reconsideration of those decisions in June 2021. On February 7, 2024, the EPA released a pre-publication revision to the particulate matter standard that lowers the primary standard for fine particulates. Based on the new standard, the EPA could potentially designate Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the new particulate matter standard and require additional particulate matter reductions from sources including LG&E's Mill Creek Station. The new particulate matter standard may also result in more stringent requirements for new generation located in nonattainment areas. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict future implementation actions or the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards.\n\nIn January 2018, the EPA designated Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015 ozone standard. In 2020 and 2021, LG&E entered into agreements with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District for temporary nitrogen oxide emission limits at LG&E's Mill Creek Station during those years to facilitate compliance with the ozone standard. In October 2022, Jefferson County was 'bumped up' to the moderate nonattainment classification, but the Louisville Air Pollution Control District has applied to the EPA for Jefferson County to be redesignated as in attainment. If the EPA declines to issue such a redesignation, Jefferson County could be subject to additional requirements including requirements for installation of reasonably available control technology on coal-fired generating units. Compliance with such requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions. PPL and LG&E are unable to determine the impact on operations until certain compliance determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky.\n\nIn March 2021, the EPA released final revisions to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS and providing for reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years. Additionally, the EPA reversed its previous approval of the KentuckyStateImplementationPlanwithrespecttothese requirements. In March 2023, the EPA Administrator released a final Federal Implementation Plan under the Good Neighbor provisions of the Clean Air Act providing for significant additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions for compliance with the revised 2015 ozone NAAQS. The reductions in Kentucky state-wide nitrogen oxide budgets were scheduled to commence in 2023, with the largest reductions planned for 2026, based on the installation time frame for certain selective catalytic reduction controls, subject to future specific allowance calculations. PPL, LG&E and KU are currently assessing the potential impact of the Good Neighbor Plan revisions on operations. The rules provide for reduced availability of nitrogen oxide allowances that have historically permitted operational flexibility for fossil units and could potentially result in constraints that may require implementation of additional emission controls or accelerate implementation of lower emission generation technologies. In response to judicial orders that stayed the EPA's denial of certain state implementation plans, the EPA in July 2023 issued an interim stay of implementation of Good Neighbor Plan requirements for emission sources in several states including Kentucky.",

        "page_content": "Legal challenges to CSAPR and related determinations remain pending, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on numerous stay applications filed by states and industry groups over the Good Neighbor Plan. In January 2023, the EPA released a proposed revision to increase the stringency of the current NAAQS for particulate matter. The EPA is continuing review of its previous determinations made in December 2020 to retain the existing NAAQS for ozone without change.\n\nPPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of pending litigation or future emission reductions that may be required by future federal rules or state implementation actions. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR, Good Neighbor Plan, and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, inclusive of retirements, the costs of which PPL, LG&E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Proposed Modification of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards\n\nIn 2012, the EPA issued the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule requiring reductions in mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from fossil fuel-fired power plants. LG&E and KU installed significant controls to achieve compliance with MATS and other rules. In April 2023, the EPA proposed to increase the stringency of MATS and further reduce emissions of certain hazardous air pollutants by reducing certain particulate matter standards by approximately two-thirds to reflect developments in control technologies. While the exact impact will depend on the provisions adopted in the final rule, PPL, LG&E, and KU do not expect significant operational changes or additional controls. PPL, LG&E, and KU will continue to monitor the ongoing rulemaking process.\n\n## Proposed Greenhouse Gas Standards\n\nOn May 11, 2023, the EPA released proposed rules under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to establish performance standards and emissions limits aimed at reducing GHG emissions from certain new, existing, and modified fossil fuel-fired electric generating units (EGUs). The proposed standards would require phased implementation of carbon mitigation technologies including state-of-the-art efficiency requirements, carbon capture and sequestration, low GHG hydrogen co-firing, and natural gas co-firing. New natural gas EGUs would be immediately subject to the stricter efficiency standard. The EPA's proposed new GHG reduction requirements, if adopted, could potentially require significant additional compliance measures including changes in current operations, installation of capital equipment, and early retirement of certain coal-fired generating units. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict the precise impact of new GHG reduction requirements until issuance of final rules and resolution of related legal and regulatory proceedings. While the impact of new GHG reduction requirements on operations and financial results of operations could potentially be substantial, the cost of complying with such requirements is expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&E, and KU will continue to monitor the ongoing rulemaking process.\n\n## Climate Change (All Registrants)\n\nThe Biden administration continues to undertake wide-ranging efforts to address climate change. Recent government actions and policy developments, including the President's announced goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035, could have farreaching impacts on PPL's business operations, products, and services. On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that provisions of the EPA's Clean Power Plan, premised on generation shifting from coal-fired plants to lower emitting natural gasfired plants and renewables, exceeded the authority granted to the EPA under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has announced proposed new greenhouse gas rules discussed above. It is uncertain how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling may impact future EPA rulemaking. All of these developments are preliminary or ongoing in nature and the Registrants cannot predict the final outcome or ultimate impact on operations.\n\nPPL has adopted a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which PPL expects will include continuing to retire coal-fired generation and investing in research and innovation that will help to achieve this goal, while maintaining reliable and affordable energy in our service territories. The net-zero goal relates to direct and indirect carbon emissions consistent with Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance and referenced by the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership. Through 2021, PPL reduced carbon emissions nearly 60% from 2010 levels and is targeting a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035 and an 80% reduction by 2040.",

To address these risks, PPL continues to work to advance grid modernization and improve the Company's equipment to help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and improve reliability.\n\n## Water/Waste (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Clean Water Act\n\nRegulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects that impact \"Waters of the United States\". Many other requirements relate to power plant operations, including the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, and standards intended to protect aquatic organisms that become trapped at or pulled through cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. These requirements could impose significant costs for LG&E and KU, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Clean Water Act Jurisdiction\n\nEnvironmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the \"Waters of the United States,\" including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. Any associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of future regulatory proceedings and litigation.\n\n## Waters of the U.S.\n\nPPL, LG&E, and KU are subject to permitting and mitigation requirements for certain construction activities that impact \"Waters of the United States.\" On April 21, 2020, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule revising the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" to exclude jurisdiction over certain surface waters. On August 30, 2021, a U.S. District Court in Arizona vacated and remanded the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed to repeal the rule and restore the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" that was in place prior to 2015. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case raising the issue of the appropriate scope of the definition of \"Waters of the United States\" under the Clean Water Act. On January 18, 2023, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final revision to the rule broadening the definition of Waters of the United States and reverting to the pre-2015 regulatory framework. Although the broader definition incorporates additional water bodies, any resulting permitting, construction, and operational expenses are expected to be immaterial and subject to rate recovery.\n\nOn May 25, 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion in Sackett v. EPA holding that the government's jurisdiction to regulate wetlands under the Clean Water Act extends to wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are \"waters of the United States.\" On September 8, 2023, the EPA issued a conforming rule that incorporated the holding of Sackett into federal definitions of waters of the United States; some states and industry groups have challenged the conforming rule as well. By limiting water bodies that fall within the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision could reduce the number of projects or the scope of project activities subject to federal permitting for wetlands. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of current or future litigation or regulatory proceedings, but do not expect a material impact on operations.",

Capitalized terms and abbreviations are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" includes the following information:\n\n- \u00b7 \"Overview\" provides a description of each Registrant's business strategy and a discussion of important financial and operational developments.\n- \u00b7 \"Results of Operations\" for all Registrants includes a \"Statement of Income Analysis,\" which discusses significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2023 with 2022. For PPL, \"Results of Operations\" also includes \"Segment Earnings,\" which provides a detailed analysis of earnings by reportable segment. These discussions include the non-GAAP financial measure \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and provide an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation of the measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.\n- \u00b7 \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources\" provides an analysis of the Registrants' liquidity positions and credit profiles. This section also includes a discussion of forecasted sources and uses of cash and rating agency actions.\n- \u00b7 \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" provides an explanation of the Registrants' risk management programs relating to market and credit risk.\n- \u00b7 \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies\" provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of the Registrants and that require their management to make significant estimates, assumptions and other judgments of inherently uncertain matters.\n\nFor comparison of the Registrants' results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2021, refer to 'Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 2022 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nFor a description of the Registrants and their businesses, see \"Business.\"\n\n## Business Strategy (All Registrants)\n\nPPL operates four regulated utilities located in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Rhode Island. Each of these jurisdictions has distinct regulatory structures and each of the utilities has distinct customer classes.\n\nPPL's strategy, which is supported by the other Registrants and subsidiaries, is to achieve industry-leading performance in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and operational efficiency; to advance a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability; to maintain a strong financial foundation and create long-term value for our shareowners; to foster a diverse and exceptional workplace; and to build strong communities in areas that we serve.\n\nCentral to PPL's and the other Registrants' strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, in addition to FERC",

In Pennsylvania, FERC formula rates, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In Rhode Island, FERC formula rates, the gas cost adjustment, net metering, infrastructure, safety and reliability (ISR) and revenue decoupling mechanisms and other rate adjustment mechanisms operate to reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.\n\n## Financial and Operational Developments\n\n## Talen Litigation (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nOn December 22, 2023, PPL announced that it entered into a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) with Talen Montana, LLC and affiliated entities (Talen) to resolve all claims made by Talen in Talen Montana, LLC et al. v. PPL Corp. et al, Adv. No 22-09001 pending before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas and arising out of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, which was renamed Talen. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, PPL paid Talen $115 million and Talen dismissed all claims against PPL. Separately, PPL and Riverstone mutually agreed to dismiss all remaining claims in a settlement in January 2024. This matter is now concluded. See \"Legal Matters\" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Purchase of Renewable Tax Credits (PPL)\n\nDuring 2023, PPL purchased approximately $300 million of renewable tax credits, as allowed by the IRA. The credits were acquired at a discount. PPL believes that it will be able to monetize the acquired credits within the foreseeable future and recorded the associated benefit of the discount as a reduction of income taxes as of December 31, 2023. In addition, PPL recorded a deferred tax asset representing credits that will be utilized in future periods.\n\n## IRS Revenue Procedure 2023-15 (PPL and LG&E)\n\nOnApril 14, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether expenses to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized for tax purposes. PPL and LG&E are currently reviewing the revenue procedure to determine its potential impact on their financial statements.\n\n## Regulatory Requirements\n\n( All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Environmental Considerations for Coal-Fired Generation\n\nThe businesses of LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See Notes 7, 13 and 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2010. As part of the long-term generation planning process, LG&E and KU evaluate a range of factors including the impact of potential stricter environmental regulations, fuel price scenarios, the cost of replacement generation, continued operations and major maintenance costs and the risk of major equipment failures in determining when to retire generation assets.",

        "page_content": "As a result of environmental requirements and aging infrastructure, LG&E has sought and obtained approval to retire two older coal-fired units at the Mill Creek Plant. Mill Creek Unit 1, with 300 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2, with 297 MW of capacity, is expected to be retired in 2027, subject to certain conditions. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## CPCN and SB 4 Application\n\nOn December 15, 2022, LG&E and KU filed an application with the KPSC for a CPCN for the construction and purchase of various generating facilities in conjunction with the retirement of four existing coal-fired generation units and three small gasfired units. On March 24, 2023, Kentucky Senate Bill 4 (SB 4) went into effect, which requires KPSC approval of the retirement of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in the state. On May 10, 2023, LG&E and KU filed an application with the KPSC seeking approval of the retirement of seven fossil fuel-fired generating units as required by SB 4. On May 16, 2023, the KPSC entered an Order consolidating the SB 4 filing proceeding into the CPCN case.\n\nOn November 6, 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E's and KU's requests (i) to construct a 640 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine at LG&E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky, (ii) to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, (iii) to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky and (iv) to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station. The KPSC denied the request to construct a 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky at this time, based on the finding that the construction of this unit should be deferred with the construction date beginning on a date that provides for an in-service date in 2030. The order also authorized LG&E's and KU's entry into the four solar PPAs, subject to certain conditions, but deferred for future proceedings specific decisions on cost recovery treatment or mechanisms. Further, the order approved the new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs contained in the requested 2024-2030 DSM plan.\n\nThe new NGCC facility will be jointly owned by LG&E (31%) and KU (69%) and the solar units will be jointly owned by LG&E (37%) and KU (63%), the battery storage unit will be owned by LG&E, and the proposed PPA transactions and DSM programs will be entered into or conducted jointly by LG&E and KU, consistent with LG&E and KU's shared dispatch, cost allocation, tariff or other frameworks.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Kentucky March 2023 Storm\n\nOn March 3, 2023, LG&E and KU experienced significant windstorm activity in their service territories, resulting in substantial damage to certain of LG&E's and KU's assets with total costs incurred through December 31, 2023 of $74 million ($33 million at LG&E and $41 million at KU). On March 17, 2023, LG&E and KU submitted a filing with the KPSC requesting regulatory asset treatment of the extraordinary operations and maintenance expenses portion of the costs incurred related to the windstorm. OnApril 5, 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving the request for accounting purposes, noting that approval for recovery would be determined in LG&E's and KU's next base rate cases. As of December 31, 2023, LG&E and KU recorded regulatory assets related to the storm of $8 million and $11 million.\n\n## FERC Transmission Rate Filing\n\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going waivers and credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's",

In 2020, LG&E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. On May 18, 2023, the FERC issued an order on remand reversing its 2019 decision and requiring LG&E and KU to refund credits previously withheld, including under such transition mechanism. LG&E and KU filed a petition for review of the FERC's May 18, 2023 order with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and provided refunds in accordance with the FERC order on December 1, 2023. The FERC issued an order on LG&E and KU's compliance filing on November 16, 2023, and LG&E and KU filed a petition for review of this November 16 order on February 14, 2024. The proceedings at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals were held on abeyance until February 15, 2024, but a motion to hold the proceedings on abeyance for an additional 60 days was filed on February 15, 2024, to allow the FERC time to substantively address LG&E and KU's request for rehearing of the November 16 order. LG&E and KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or any other post decision process but do not expect the annual impact to have a material effect on their operations or financial condition. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of certain waivers and credits primarily through base rates increases, provided, however, that increases associated with the FERC's May 18, 2023 order are expected to be subject to future rate proceedings.\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Advanced Metering Functionality (AMF)\n\nIn 2021, RIE filed its Updated AMF Business Case and Grid Modernization Plan (GMP) with the RIPUC in accordance with the Amended Settlement Agreement (ASA) approved by the RIPUC in August 2018, and which among other things, sought approval to deploy smart meters throughout the service territory. After PPL completed the acquisition of RIE, RIE filed a new AMF Business Case with the RIPUC in 2022, consisting of a detailed proposal for full-scale deployment of AMF across its electric service territory.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, the RIPUC unanimously approved RIE to deploy an AMF-based metering system for the electric distribution business. RIE is authorized to seek recovery of the approved capital investment through the ISR process with an overall multi-year cap on recovery at approximately $153 million, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the potential offsets and recoverability of certain costs. RIE is required to continue spending even if above the recovery cap, until it achieves the functionalities outlined in the AMF Business Case. RIE filed with the RIPUC (i) an updated electric Service Quality Plan on December 27, 2023 for RIPUC approval and (ii) additional compliance tariff provisions regarding recovery and updated cost schedules to reflect the RIPUC's decision on December 22, 2023 for RIPUC approval. RIE cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\n(PPL)\n\nThe \"Statement of Income Analysis\" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2023 with 2022. The \"Segment Earnings\" discussions provides a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include the non-GAAP financial measure \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" and provide an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation of the measure to the most comparable GAAP measure.",

        "page_content": "- (a) In addition to credits internally generated, in 2023, PPL purchased approximately $300 million of renewable tax credits, as allowed by the IRA. PPL recorded a current tax benefit and a deferred tax expense for the utilization of approximately $250 million of the credits in 2023 and prior years, per the three-year carry-back rule.\n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on incometaxes.\n\n## Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\n\nIncome from discontinued operations (net of income taxes) decreased $42 million in 2023 compared with 2022. The decrease was due to an income tax benefit recorded in 2022 related to the 2021 sale of the U.K. utility business. See \"Discontinued Operations\" in Note 9 to the Financial Statements for summarized results of the operations of the U.K. utility business.\n\n## Segment Earnings\n\nPPL's Net Income (Loss) by reportable segments was as follows:\n\n|                             | 2023   | 2022   | Change 2023 vs. 2022   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|------------------------|\n| Kentucky Regulated (a)      | $ 552  | $ 549  | $ 3                    |\n| Pennsylvania Regulated      | 519    | 525    | (6)                    |\n| Rhode Island Regulated      | 96     | (44)   | 140                    |\n| Corporate and Other (a)(b)  | (427)  | (316)  | (111)                  |\n| Discontinued Operations (c) | -      | 42     | (42)                   |\n| Net Income (Loss)           | $ 740  | $ 756  | $ (16)                 |\n\n## Earnings from Ongoing Operations\n\nManagement utilizes \"Earnings from Ongoing Operations\" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.\n\nEarnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges.\n- \u00b7 Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.\n- \u00b7 Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.\n- \u00b7 Significant losses on early extinguishment of debt.\n- \u00b7 Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.",

In November 2023, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 2, 2024, at 24.00 cents per share (equivalent to $0.96 per annum). On February 16, 2024, PPL announced a quarterly common stock dividend of 25.75 cents per share, payable April 1, 2024, to shareowners of record as of March 8, 2024. Future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067. At December 31, 2023, no interest payments were deferred.\n\n## (PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nFrom time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends, distributions or return capital, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.",

The amounts involved may be material.\n\n## Rating Agency Actions\n\nMoody's and S&P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.\n\nAcredit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2023.\n\n|                     | Senior Unsecured   | Senior Unsecured   | Senior Secured   | Senior Secured   | Commercial Paper   | Commercial Paper   |\n|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Issuer              | Moody's            | S&P                | Moody's          | S&P              | Moody's            | S&P                |\n| PPL                 |                    |                    |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| PPL Capital Funding | Baa1               | BBB+               |                  |                  | P-2                | A-2                |\n| Rhode Island Energy | A3                 | A-                 |                  |                  | P-2                | A-2                |\n| PPLand PPL Electric |                    |                    |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| PPL Electric        |                    |                    | A1               | A+               | P-2                | A-1                |\n| PPL, LG&E and KU    |                    |                    |                  |                  |                    |                    |\n| LG&E                |                    |                    | A1               | A                | P-2                | A-2                |\n| KU                  |                    |                    | A1               | A                | P-2                | A-2                |\n\nThe rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nIn June 2023, Moody's assigned RIE's commercial paper a Short-Term Rating of P-2.\n\nIn June 2023, S&P assigned RIE's commercial paper a Short-Term Rating of A-2.",

        "page_content": "## Ratings Triggers (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nVarious derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, and interest rate instruments, contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of \"Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features,\" including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Guarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL)\n\nPPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.\n\n## Other Contingent Obligations (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Market Risk\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nSee Notes 1, 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.\n\nThe forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.",

Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.\n- \u00b7 LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs.\n- \u00b7 RIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC- approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices.\n\n## Volumetric Risk\n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.",

RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans - Equity Securities Price Risk\n\nSee \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits\" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.\n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.\n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E or KU defaults on its contractual obligation, those Registrants would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Related Party Transactions\n\nThe Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU.\n\n## Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n\nThe Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures, and development projects. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information on acquisition and divestiture activity. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental Matters\n\nExtensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to the Registrants' air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.\n\nSee \"Legal Matters\" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental claims. See \"Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures\" in \"Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2024 through 2026. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs. See \"Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of 'sustainability', which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer's business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the '34 Act), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their '34 Act reports. In March 2022, the SEC proposed broad-based climate disclosure requirements for public companies. The proposed rule would require public companies to disclose direct and indirect GHG emissions, strategic insights, and certain financial implications in public disclosures. The proposed rulemaking elicited significant debate and comment. While a final rulemaking is currently expected to be issued in the first half of 2024, PPL cannot predict the final legal requirements or when the requirements will be effective.\n\nAs has been PPL's practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants' financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric and gas utility industries. Additionally, PPL consults widely used reporting frameworks for discrete sustainability topics, including corporate political contributions and climate-related issues. PPL also responds to the climate survey of CDP, a not-for-profit organization based in the United Kingdom formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that runs the global disclosure system that enables investors, companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts.",

The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.\n\n## Defined Benefits (All Registrants)\n\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 7 and 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.\n\nAsummary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.\n\n| Plan Sponsor   | PPL   | PPL Electric   | LG&E   | KU   |\n|----------------|-------|----------------|--------|------|\n| PPL Services   | S     | P              |        |      |\n| LKE            |       |                | P      | P    |\n\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are:\n\n- \u00b7 Discount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Expected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.\n- \u00b7 Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.\n\nSee Note 11 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\nThe following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities.

        "page_content": "Additionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers several factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. When evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by political risk on such factors is also considered by management. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities (All Registrants)\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E, KU and RIE are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.\n\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.\n\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.\n\n## PriceRiskManagement (PPL)\n\nSee \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.

A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value.\n\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\n\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. See \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances by reportable segment at December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of October 1, 2023, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill. These evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:\n\n- \u00b7 current year financial performance versus the prior year,\n- \u00b7 changes in planned capital expenditures,\n- \u00b7 the consistency of forecasted free cash flows,\n- \u00b7 earnings quality and sustainability,\n- \u00b7 changes in market participant discount rates,\n- \u00b7 changes in long-term growth rates,\n- \u00b7 changes in PPL's market capitalization, and\n- \u00b7 the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.\n\nBased on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying value. As such, the step one quantitative impairment test was not performed and no impairment was recognized.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (LG&E and KU)\n\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities over the asset's useful life.\n\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.\n\nSee \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations\" in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.",

At December 31, 2023, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $7 million at LG&E and $11 million at KU. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $5 million at LG&E and $1 million at KU and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million at LG&E. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.\n\n## Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nFor RIE, LG&E and KU, revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures.\n\n## Other Information (All Registrants)\n\nPPL's Audit Committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities- Impact of Rate-Regulation on Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures - Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company owns and operates four cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulatory commissions to enable the regulated utility to recover the costs of providing electric or gas",

As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions.\n\nRegulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific rate orders or, in certain cases, regulatory commission precedent for transactions or events. While the Company has indicated that it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the regulatory commissions will not approve full recovery of and return on such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, and recent rate orders. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to its inherent complexities.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by regulatory commissions included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery or refund in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management's internal controls over the recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the regulatory commissions for the Company and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\nMorristown, New Jersey February 16, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.",

Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal subsidiaries are LG&E, KU, RIE and PPL Electric. PPL's corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited entered into a share purchase agreement to sell PPL's U.K. utility business, which prior to its sale substantially represented PPL's U.K. Regulated segment, to a subsidiary of National Grid plc. The sale was completed on June 14, 2021. The results of operations of the U.K. utility business are classified as Discontinued Operations on PPL's Statements of Income for 2022 and 2021. PPL has elected to separately report the cash flows of continuing and discontinued operations on the Statements of Cash Flows for 2022 and 2021. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations. See Note 9 for additional information.\n\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S., a subsidiary of National Grid plc. Narragansett Electric, whose service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island, is primarily engaged in the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas. The results of Narragansett Electric are included in the consolidated results of PPL from the date of the acquisition. Following the closing of the acquisition, Narragansett Electric provides services doing business under the name Rhode Island Energy (RIE). See Note 9 for additional information.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric's principal business is the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas. LG&E and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names. KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe financial statements of the Registrants include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE and, as a result, are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Amounts consolidated under the VIE guidance are not material to the Registrants.\n\nAll significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n\nThe financial statements of PPL, LG&E and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 12 for additional information.",

        "page_content": "## Regulation\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover expected future costs, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions. See Note 7 for additional details regarding regulatory matters.\n\n## Accounting Records\n\nThe system of accounts for regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Loss Accruals\n\nPotential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is \"probable\" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines \"probable\" as cases in which \"the future event or events are likely to occur.\" The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate.\n\nThe accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured.\n\n## Earnings Per Share (PPL)\n\nEPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocationmethodforcomputingEPSthattreatsa participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners. Sharebased payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities.",

        "page_content": "## PriceRiskManagement\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. Derivative instruments pursuant to regulator approved plans to manage commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases to reduce fluctuations in natural gas prices and costs associated with these derivatives instruments are generally recoverable through approved cost recovery mechanism. Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation.\n\nCertain contracts may not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved to facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative contracts may be excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because NPNS has been elected. These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting. Contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheets at fair value.\n\nCash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification of the hedged items.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\n\nDerivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities at PPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU, if approved by the appropriate regulatory body. These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps or commodity gas contracts that are included in customer rates.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nTo meet their obligations as last resort providers of electricity supply to their customers, PPL Electric and RIE have entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts.\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nSee Notes 16 and 17 for additional information on derivatives.\n\n## Revenue (All Registrants)\n\nOperating revenues are primarily recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of each calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than at the end of the month. For RIE, LG&E and KU, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. For PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the price per tariff.\n\nPPLElectric's,RIE's,LG&E'sandKU'sbaseratesaredeterminedbasedoncost of service. Some regulators have also authorized the use of additional alternative revenue programs, which enable PPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU to adjust future rates based on past activities or completed events. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are recognized when the specific events permitting future billings have occurred. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are required to be presented separately from revenues from contracts with customers. These amounts are, however, presented as revenues from",

See Note 3 for additional information.\n\n## Financing and Other Receivables\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Financing receivables include accounts receivable, with the exception of those items within accounts receivable that are not subject to the current expected credit loss model.\n\nFinancing receivable collectability is evaluated using a current expected credit loss model, consisting of a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs and the age of the receivable. Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered when applicable. The Registrants also evaluate the impact of observable external factors on the collectability of the financing receivables to determine if adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts should be made based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on the results of these analyses. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.\n\nPPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU have identified one class of financing receivables, 'accounts receivable - customer', which includes financing receivables for all billed and unbilled sales with customers. All other financing receivables are classified as other.\n\nThe changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included in the following table. Amounts relate to financing receivables, except as noted.\n\n|             | Balance at Beginning of Period   | Additions Charged to Income   | Deductions (a)   | Balance at End of Period   |        |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|--------|\n| PPL         |                                  |                               |                  |                            |        |\n| 2023        | $ 95                             | $ 87                          | $ 52             | $ 130                      | (c)    |\n| 2022        | 69                               | 78                            | 52               |                            | 95 (c) |\n| 2021        | 73                               | 26                            | 30               |                            | 69 (c) |\n| PPLElectric |                                  |                               |                  |                            |        |\n| 2023        | $ 33                             | $ 52                          | $ 35             | $                          | 50 (b) |\n| 2022        | 35                               | 27                            | 29               |                            | 33 (b) |\n| 2021        | 41                               | 13                            | 19               |                            | 35 (b) |\n| LG&E        |                                  |                               |                  |                            |        |\n| 2023        | $ 4                              | $ 4                           | $ 2              | $                          | 6      |\n| 2022        | 3                                | 6                             | 5                |                            | 4      |\n| 2021        | 3                                | 4                             | 4                |                            | 3      |\n| KU          |                                  |                               |                  |                            |        |\n| 2023        | $ 3                              | $ 3                           | $ 4              | $                          | 2      |\n| 2022        | 3                                | 6                             | 6                |                            | 3      |\n| 2021        | 2                                | 8                             | 7                |                            | 3      |",

On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is included in \"Other current assets,\" while the noncurrent portion is included in \"Other noncurrent assets.\" See Note 16 for a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the Balance Sheets to the amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows.\n\n(All Registrants)\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe Registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities in defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents. PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.\n\nThe Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value.\n\nAssessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy.",

        "page_content": "## Investments\n\nGenerally, the original maturity date of an investment and management's intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term. Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.\n\nInvestments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments are carried at cost or fair value. These investments are included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. Earnings from these investments are recorded in \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income.\n\nShort-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\n\n## Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nPP&E is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset. PP&E acquired in business combinations is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. Original cost for constructed assets includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable. Included in PP&E are capitalized costs of software projects that were developed or obtained for internal use. The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. The Registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which work is performed and costs are incurred.\n\nAFUDC is capitalized at PPL Electric and RIE as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service. AFUDC is capitalized at LG&E and KU for certain projects as part of the construction cost of approved projects. LG&E and KU are generally provided a return on construction work in progress for other projects. The debt component of AFUDC is credited to \"Interest Expense\" and the equity component is credited to \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income.\n\nThe Registrants capitalize interest costs as part of construction costs. Capitalized interest, including the debt component of AFUDC, for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n\n|              | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| PPL          | $ 12   | $ 7    | $ 6    |\n| PPL Electric | 7      | 5      | 6      |\n| LG&E         | 1      | -      | -      |\n| KU           | 1      | -      | -      |\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component of PP&E that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. RIE, LG&E and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer",

Costs incurred to obtain an initial license and renew or extend terms of licenses are capitalized as intangible assets.\n\nWhen determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider:\n\n- \u00b7 the expected use of the asset;\n- \u00b7 the expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate;\n- \u00b7 legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life;\n- \u00b7 the company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension;\n- \u00b7 the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and,\n- \u00b7 the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\n## Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\n\nThe Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nAlong-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impaired, the asset's carrying value is written down to its fair value.\n\nAlong-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. If impaired, the asset's (disposal group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell.\n\nPPL, LG&E and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed. PPL's, LG&E's and KU's reporting units are primarily at the operating segment level.",

See Note 9 for additional information regarding the acquisition.\n\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as step zero) is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, the quantitative impairment test is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the step zero assessment. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nAs of October 1, 2023, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill. These evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:\n\n- \u00b7 current year financial performance versus the prior year,\n- \u00b7 changes in planned capital expenditures,\n- \u00b7 the consistency of forecasted free cash flows,\n- \u00b7 earnings quality and sustainability,\n- \u00b7 changes in market participant discount rates,\n- \u00b7 changes in long-term growth rates,\n- \u00b7 changes in PPL's market capitalization, and\n- \u00b7 the overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.\n\nBased on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying value. As such, the step one quantitative impairment test was not performed and no impairment was recognized.\n\n( PPL, LG&E and KU )\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of accretion expense classified within \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income to reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. For LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\n\nEstimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. See Note 7 and Note 19 for additional information on AROs.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation and Benefits\n\n## Defined Benefits (All Registrants)\n\nCertain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LG&E, KU, RIE and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries, excluding RIE, use an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the required amortization period. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than 30% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the full required amortization period. RIE uses the standard amortization method under GAAP for recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plan.\n\nSee Note 7 for a discussion of the regulatory treatment of defined benefit costs and Note 11 for a discussion of defined benefits.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation (PPL)\n\nPPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors. PPL grants most stockbased compensation awards in the first quarter of each year. PPL recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value method. Forfeitures of awards are recognized when they occur. All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily included in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income.\n\n## Taxes\n\n## Income Taxes\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in its financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization upon settlement that exceeds 50%. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle the uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised",

At December 31, 2023, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits were projected over the next 12 months.\n\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\n\nThe Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The need for valuation allowances requires significant management judgment. If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future .\n\nThe Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are generated and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets. With respect to acquired renewable tax credits, pursuant to the IRA, any benefit is recognized in the period the credits can be utilized.\n\nThe Registrants recognize tax-related interest and penalties in \"Income Taxes\" on their Statements of Income.\n\nThe Registrants use the portfolio approach method of accounting for deferred taxes related to pre-tax OCI transactions. The portfolio approach involves a strict period-by-period cumulative incremental allocation of income taxes to the change in income and losses reflected in OCI. Under this approach, the net cumulative tax effect is ignored. The net change in unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCI under this approach would be eliminated only on the date the investment portfolio is classified as held for sale or is liquidated.\n\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.\n\nThe provision for the Registrants' deferred income taxes related to regulatory assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by relevant regulators. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulatory assets and liabilities and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities.\"\n\n## (PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nThe income tax provision for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement, which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Electric, LG&E, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return. Tax benefits are not shared between companies. The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit. The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.\n\nAt December 31, the following intercompany tax receivables (payables) were recorded:\n\n|              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| PPL Electric | $ (21) | $ 2    |\n| LG&E         | (5)    | (6)    |\n| KU           | (3)    | 4      |",

These taxes are not reflected on the Statements of Income. See Note 6 for details of taxes included in \"Taxes, other than income\" on the Statements of Income.\n\n## Other\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Registrants determine whether contractual arrangements contain a lease by evaluating whether those arrangements either implicitly or explicitly identify an asset, whether the Registrants have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the term of the arrangement, and whether the Registrants have the right to direct the use of the asset. Renewal options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain the Registrants will exercise those options. Periods for which the Registrants are reasonably certain not to exercise termination options are also included in the lease term. The Registrants have certain agreements with lease and non-lease components, such as office space leases, which are generally accounted for separately.\n\nShort-term leases are leases with a term that is 12 months or less and do not include a purchase option or option to extend the initial term of the lease to greater than 12 months that the Registrants are reasonably certain to exercise. The Registrants have made an accounting policy election to not recognize the right-of-use asset and the lease liability arising from leases classified as short-term.\n\nThe discount rate for a lease is the rate implicit in the lease unless that rate cannot be readily determined. In that case, the Registrants are required to use their incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate the Registrants would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\n\nThe Registrants receive secured borrowing rates from financial institutions based on their applicable credit profiles. The Registrants use the secured rate which corresponds with the term of the applicable lease. See Note 10 for additional information.\n\n## Fuel, Materials and Supplies\n\nFuel, natural gas stored underground and materials and supplies are valued using the average cost method. Fuel costs for electricitygenerationarechargedtoexpenseasused.ForRIE,naturalgas supply costs are charged to expense when delivered to customers.

In connection with its share repurchases in 2021, PPL has not returned these shares to authorized but unissued shares; it intends to retain these shares as Treasury stock to use in connection with certain compensation plans.\n\n## 2. Segment and Related Information\n\n(PPL)\n\nPPL is organized into three segments: Kentucky Regulated, Pennsylvania Regulated, and Rhode Island Regulated. PPL's segments are segmented by geographic location.\n\nBeginning on January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. Prior to January 1, 2023, the Kentucky Regulated segment also included the financing activities of LKE. The financing activity of LKE is presented in \"Corporate and Other\" beginning on January 1, 2023. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. As a result, PPL's segments consist of its regulated operations in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island and exclude any incremental financing activities of holding companies, which Management believes is a more meaningful presentation as it provides information on the core regulated operations of PPL.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric.\n\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution operations of RIE, which was acquired on May 25, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## Pennsylvania Regulated Segment Revenue\n\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from PPL Electric's tariff-based distribution and transmission of electricity.\n\n## Distribution Revenue\n\nPPL Electric provides distribution services to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and governmental end users of energy. PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to its distribution customers and revenue is recognized over time as electricity is delivered and simultaneously consumed by the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the volume of electricity delivered during the period multiplied by the price per tariff, plus a monthly fixed charge. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of electric service to the customer as the calculation is based on volumes delivered, and the price per tariff and the monthly fixed charge are set by the PAPUC. Customers are typically billed monthly and outstanding amounts are normally due within 21 days of the date of the bill.\n\nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of PPL Electric with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with PPL Electric's retail account contracts.\n\nCertain customers have the option to obtain electricity from other suppliers where PPL Electric facilitates the delivery. In those circumstances, revenue is only recognized for providing delivery of the commodity to the customer.\n\n## Transmission Revenue\n\nPPL Electric generates transmission revenues from a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff. An annual revenue requirement for PPL Electric to provide transmission services is calculated using a formula-based rate. This revenue requirement is converted into a daily rate (dollars per day). PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to provide transmission services and revenue is recognized over time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC approved formulabased rate. PJM remits payment on a weekly basis.\n\nPPL Electric's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, PPL Electric has no unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Rhode Island Regulated Segment Revenues\n\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from RIE's regulated tariff-based transmission and distribution of electricity and regulated tariff-based distribution of natural gas.\n\n## Distribution Revenue\n\nDistribution revenues are primarily from the sale of electricity, naturalgas,andrelatedservicestoretail customers. Distribution sales are regulated by the RIPUC, which is responsible for approving the rates and other terms of services as part of the rate making process. Natural gas and electric distribution revenues are derived from the regulated sale and distribution of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within RIE's service territory under the tariff rates.

        "page_content": "performance obligation related to distribution sales is to provide electricity and natural gas to customers on demand. The performance obligation is satisfied over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the electricity or natural gas as services are provided. RIE records revenues related to the distribution sales based upon the approved tariff rate and the volume delivered to the customers, which corresponds with the amount RIE has the right to invoice.\n\nDistribution revenue also includes estimated unbilled amounts, which represent the estimated amounts due from retail customers as a result of customer's bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues are determined based on estimated unbilled sales volumes and then applying tariff rates to those volumes. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents RIE's transfer of electricity and natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as approved by the respective regulatory body.\n\nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of RIE with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with RIE's retail account contracts.\n\nCertain customers have the option to obtain electricity or natural gas from other suppliers where RIE facilitates the delivery. In those circumstances, revenue is only recognized for providing delivery of the commodity to the customer.\n\n## Transmission Revenue\n\nRIE's transmission services are regulated by the FERC and coordinated with ISO - New England (ISO-NE). As of January 1, 2023, RIE is a transmission operator. These revenues arise under tariff/rate agreements and are collected primarily from RIE's distribution customers. The revenue is recognized over time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents RIE's transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC-approved formula-based rate.\n\nRIE's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, RIE has no unsatisfied performance obligations.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Kentucky Regulated Segment Revenue\n\nThe Kentucky Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from LG&E's and KU's regulated tariff-based sales of electricity and LG&E's regulated tariff-based sales of natural gas.\n\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. Revenue from these activities is generated from tariffs approved by applicable regulatory authorities including the FERC, KPSC and VSCC. LG&E and KU satisfy their performance obligations upon LG&E's and KU's delivery of electricity and LG&E's delivery of natural gas to customers. This revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by LG&E and KU. The amount of revenue recognized is the billed volume of electricity or natural gas delivered multiplied by a tariff rate perunit of energy, plus any applicable fixed charges or additional regulatory mechanisms. Customers are billed monthly and outstanding amounts are typically due within 22 days of the date of the bill. Additionally, unbilled revenues are recognized as a result of customers' bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf delivered but not yet billed by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur.

Earnings Per Share\n\n(PPL)\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income available to PPL common shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, increased by the number of incremental shares that would be outstanding if potentially dilutive share-based payment awards were converted to common shares as calculated using the Two-Class Method or Treasury Stock Method. The If-Converted Method will be applied to the Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2028 issued in February 2023. See Note 8 for additional information.

The income tax provisions for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement, which provides that taxable income be calculated as if each domestic subsidiary filed a separate consolidated return. PPL Electric or its subsidiaries indirectly or directly file tax returns in three major tax jurisdictions, and LG&E and KU indirectly or directly file tax returns in two major tax jurisdictions. With few exceptions, at December 31, 2023, these jurisdictions, as well as the tax years that are no longer subject to examination, were as follows.\n\n| U.S. (federal)       | PPL 2019 and prior   | PPL Electric 2019 and prior   | LG&E 2019 and prior   | KU 2019 and prior   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| Pennsylvania (state) | 2017 and prior       | 2017 and prior                |                       |                     |\n| Kentucky (state)     | 2018 and prior       | 2018 and prior                | 2018 and prior        | 2018 and prior      |\n| U.K. (foreign)       | 2021 and prior       |                               |                       |                     |\n\n## Other\n\n## Purchase of Renewable Tax Credits (PPL)\n\nDuring 2023, PPL purchased approximately $300 million of renewable tax credits, as allowed by the IRA. The credits were acquired at a discount. PPL believes that it will be able to monetize the acquired credits within the foreseeable future and recorded the associated benefit of the discount as a reduction of income taxes as of December 31, 2023. In addition, PPL recorded a deferred tax asset representing credits that will be utilized in future periods.\n\n## Narragansett Electric Acquisition (PPL)\n\nThe acquisition of Narragansett Electric on May 25, 2022 was deemed an asset acquisition for federal and state income tax purposes, as a result of PPL and National Grid making a tax election under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) \u00a7338(h)(10). Accordingly, the tax bases of substantially all of the assets acquired were increased to fair market value, which equaled net book value, thereby eliminating the related deferred tax assets and liabilities. This election resulted in tax goodwill that will be amortized for tax purposes over 15 years.\n\n## Pennsylvania State Tax Reform (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nOn July 8, 2022, the Governor of Pennsylvania signed into law Pennsylvania House Bill 1342 (H.B. 1342). Among other changes to the state tax code, the bill reduces the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% beginning January 1, 2023, and further reduces the rate annually by half a percentage point until the rate reaches 4.99% in 2031.\n\n## Inflation Reduction Act (All Registrants)\n\nOnAugust 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA enacted a new 15% corporate \"book minimum tax,\" which is based on adjusted GAAP pre-tax income and is only applicable to corporations whose pre-tax income exceeds a certain threshold. PPL does not expect to be subject to the book minimum tax for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Registrants will continue to assess the impacts of the IRA on their financial statements and will monitor guidance issued by the",

PPL continues to assess the applicability of these provisions to PPL and its subsidiaries.\n\n## IRS Revenue Procedure 2023-15 (PPL and LG&E)\n\nOnApril 14, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether expenses to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized for tax purposes. PPL and LG&E are currently reviewing the revenue procedure to determine its potential impact on their financial statements.\n\n## 7. Utility Rate Regulation\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their rate-regulated utility operations. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to an item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nRIE is subject to the jurisdiction of the RIPUC, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, and the FERC. RIE operates under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff. RIE's base distribution rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base. Certain other recovery mechanisms exist to recover expenses and capital investments with a return on rate base separate from the base distribution rate case process.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the FERC and the VSCC.\n\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets.\n\n## (PPL and KU)\n\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\n\nKU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from thereturnonratebaseutilizedinthedevelopmentofmunicipalrates,noreturn is earned on the related assets.",

Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in \"Regulatory Matters.\"\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nDefined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent prior service cost and net actuarial gains and losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and, generally, are amortized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants. These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is remeasured.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nAs a result of previous rate case settlements and orders, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated using a 15-year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses and settlements are recorded as a regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2023, the balances were $86 million for PPL, $46 million for LG&E and $40 million for KU. As of December 31, 2022, the balances were $107 million for PPL, $57 million for LG&E and $50 million for KU.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nRIE is subject to a pension rate adjustment mechanism whereby the difference in amounts allowed to be recovered in rates versus actual costs of RIE's pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are to be recovered from or passed back to customers in future periods, are also recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## (All Registrants)\n\n## Storm Costs\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU have the ability to request from the PAPUC, the KPSC and the VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once such authority is granted, LG&E and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts. PPL Electric can recover qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over three years through the Storm Damage Expense Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred. LG&E's and KU's regulatory assets for storm costs approved for base rate recovery are being amortized through various dates ending in 2031.\n\nAs provided in the ASA, RIE has the authority from the RIPUC to treat certain incremental O&M expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once all expenses for the extraordinary storm have been finalized, RIE files a final accounting of those storm expenses with the RIPUC that is subject to review by the RIPUC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers.\n\n## Unamortized Loss on Debt\n\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt refinanced, reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). Such costs are being amortized through 2053 for PPL Electric, through 2042 for KU, and through 2044 for LG&E.\n\n## Accumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant\n\nRIE, LG&E and KU charge costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.\n\nPPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal. When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the costs as a regulatory asset. Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent five-year period.\n\n## Net Deferred Taxes\n\nRegulatory liabilities associated with net deferred taxes represent the future revenue impact from the adjustment of deferred income taxes required primarily for excess deferred taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, largely a result of the TCJA enacted in 2017.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)\n\nThe DSIC is authorized under Act 11 and is considered an alternative ratemaking mechanism providing more timely cost recovery of qualifying distribution system capital improvements. DSIC is charged to all customers taking distribution service as a percentage of total distribution revenue (excluding State Tax Adjustment Surcharge). DSIC is capped at 5% of the total amount billed to all customers for distribution service (including reconcilable riders) which provides a safeguard for customers. PPL Electric is permitted to utilize the DSIC mechanism so long as the rolling 12 month ROE for the applicable period does not exceed the PUC ROE in the company's PAPUC quarterly financial report filing. The DSIC contains a reconciliation mechanism",

The recovery includes charges for generation supply, as well as administration of the acquisition process. In addition, the GSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior periods is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent rate filing period.\n\n## Transmission Service Charge (TSC)\n\nPPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers. PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PAPUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\n\nRIE arranges transmission service on behalf of its customers and bills the costs of those services to customers, pursuant to its Transmission Service Cost Adjustment Provision. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or underrecovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\n\n## Transmission Formula Rate\n\nPPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, beginning in 2023, rates are put into effect on January 1st of each year based upon actual expenditures from the most recently filed FERC Form 1, forecasted capital additions, and other data based on PPL Electric's books and records. 2023 is considered a transitional period as the calendar year rate approved by FERC became effective April 1, 2023. Rates are compared during the year to the estimated annual expenses and capital additions that will be filed in PPL Electric's annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Under the mechanism, any difference between the revenue requirement in effect and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, and the regulatory asset or regulatory liability is to be recovered from or returned to customers starting one year after the conclusion of the rate year.\n\n## Storm Damage Expense Rider (SDER)\n\nThe SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recover any differences from customers. In the 2015 rate case settlement approved by the PAPUC in November 2015, it was determined that reportable storm damage expenses to be recovered annually through base rates will be set at $20 million. The SDER will recover from or refund to customers the applicable expenses from reportable storms as compared to the $20 million recovered annually through base rates.\n\n## Act 129 Compliance Rider\n\nIn compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric is currently in Phase IV of the energy efficiency and conservation plan which was approved in March 2021. Phase IV allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $313 million over the five-year period, June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2026. The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption. The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. The rates are applied to customers who receive",

The actual Phase IV program costs are reconcilable after each 12month period, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period.\n\n## Smart Meter Rider (SMR)\n\nAct 129 requires each electric distribution company (EDC) with more than 100,000 customers to have a PAPUC approved Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation Plan (SMP). As of December 31, 2019, PPL Electric replaced substantially all of its old meters with meters that meet the Act 129 requirements under its SMP. In accordance with Act 129, EDCs are able to recover the costs and earn a return on capital of providing smart metering technology. PPL Electric uses the SMR to recover the costs to implement its SMP. The SMR is a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior years is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarters.\n\n## Universal Service Rider (USR)\n\nThe USR provides for recovery of costs associated with universal service programs, OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program (WRAP), provided by PPL Electric to residential customers. OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households and WRAP provides low-income customers a means to reduce electric bills through energy saving methods. The USR rate is applied to residential customers who receive distribution service. The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\n## TCJA Customer Refund\n\nAs a result of the reduced U.S federal corporate income tax rate as enacted by the TCJA, the PAPUC ruled that these tax benefits should be refunded to customers. Timing differences between the recognition of these tax benefits and the refund of the benefit to the customer creates a regulatory liability. PPL Electric's liability is being credited back to distribution customers through a temporary negative surcharge and remains in place until PPL Electric files and the PAPUC approves new base rates. The TCJA is reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Fuel Adjustment Clauses\n\nLG&E's and KU's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in power purchases and the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LG&E's and KU's rates. The KPSC requires formal reviews at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate, may conduct public hearings and reestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been underor over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within 12 months.\n\nKU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs and load for the fuel year (12 months ending March 31). The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the fuel year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior fuel year. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered or refunded within 12 months.",

ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\n\n## Power Purchase Agreement - OVEC\n\nAs a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition of LG&E and KU, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LG&E and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities. The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. LG&E's and KU's customer rates continue to reflect the original contracts. See Notes 13 and 18 for additional discussion of the power purchase agreement.\n\n## Interest Rate Swaps\n\nLG&E's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures in 2033.\n\n## Terminated Interest Rate Swaps\n\nNet realized gains and losses on all interest rate swaps are recovered through regulated rates. As such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and are primarily recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income over the life of the associated debt.\n\n## Plant Outage Costs\n\nFrom July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2021, plant outage costs were normalized for ratemaking purposes based on an average level of expenses. Plant outage expenses that were greater or less than the average will be collected from or returned to customers, through future base rates. Effective July 1, 2021 under-recovered plant outage costs are being amortized through 2029 for LG&E and KU.\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nRIE evaluates open derivative instruments for regulatory deferral by determining if they are probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers through future rates. Derivative instruments that qualify for recovery are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities in the period in which the change occurs. The balance is reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\n## Energy Efficiency\n\nEnergy efficiency represents the difference between revenue billed to customers through RIE's energy efficiency charge and the costs of the RIE's energy efficiency programs as approved by the RIPUC.\n\nThe energy efficiency charge is designed to collect the estimated costs of the RIE's energy efficiency plan for the upcoming calendar year.

This surcharge provides RIE with a mechanism to recover such amounts. Net metering is reconcilable annually, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\n\n## Rate Adjustment Mechanisms\n\nIn addition to commodity costs, RIE is subject to a number of additional rate adjustment mechanisms whereby an asset or liability is recognized resulting from differences between actual revenues and the underlying cost being recovered or differences between actual revenues and targeted amounts as approved by the RIPUC. The rate adjustment mechanisms are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers are to be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n\n## Renewable energy certificates (RECs)\n\nRepresents deferred costs associated with RIE's compliance obligation with the Rhode Island Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The RPS is legislation established to foster the development of new renewable energy sources. The regulatory asset will be recovered over the next year.\n\n## Taxes Recoverable through Future Rates\n\nTaxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that are anticipated to be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized. For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred.\n\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## Environmental Cost Recovery\n\nKentucky law permits LG&E and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements, which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electricity generating facilities. The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period. The KPSC has authorized return on equity of 9.35% for existing approved ECR projects. The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered or refunded within 12 months.\n\nRIE's rate plans provide for specific rate allowances for RIE's share of the estimated costs to investigate and perform certain remediation activities at sites with which it may be associated, with variances deferred for future recovery from, or return to, customers. RIE believes future costs, beyond the expiration of current rate plans, will continue to be recovered through rates. The regulatory asset represents the excess of amounts incurred for RIE's actual site investigation and remediation costs versus amounts received in rates.",

The gas supply clause also includes a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which allows LG&E's rates to be adjusted annually to share savings between the actual cost of gas purchases and market indices, with the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending October 31). The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are typically recovered or refunded within 18 months.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\n## Rhode Island Activities (PPL)\n\n## Rate Case proceedings\n\nPursuant to Report and Order No. 23823 issued May 5, 2020, the RIPUC approved the terms of an Amended Settlement Agreement (ASA), reflecting an allowed return on equity (ROE) rate of 9.275%basedonacommonequityratioof approximately 51%. RIE is currently in year six of the multi-year rate plan (Rate Plan). On June 30, 2021, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers consented to an open-ended extension of the term of the Rate Plan. Pursuant to the settlement with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General in connection with the acquisition of RIE by PPL, RIE currently does not anticipate filing a new base rate case before October 1, 2025. Pursuant to the open-ended extension, the Rate Year 3 level of base distribution rates under ASA will remain in effect and RIE will continue to operate under the current Rate Plan until a new Rate Plan is approved by the RIPUC.\n\nThe ASA includes additional provisions, including (i) an Electric Transportation Initiative (the ET Initiative) to facilitate the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and scaling of the market for EV charging equipment to advance Rhode Island's zero emission vehicles and greenhouse gas emissions policy goals, (ii) two energy storage demonstration projects, which are on track for timely completion, (iii) a performance incentive for System Efficiency: Annual Megawatt Capacity Savings, which sunset in 2021 and is a tracking and reporting only metric and (iv) several additional metrics for tracking and reporting purposes only. The RIPUC discussed the ET Initiative at an Open Meeting on August 30, 2022, advising RIE to seek RIPUC authorization to continue the ET Initiative and/or to alter any of the targets established in the ASA for Rate Year 5 and beyond. No votes or official rulings were taken; however, based on this feedback, RIE has paused the ET programs in Rate Year 5.\n\n## Advanced Metering Functionality (AMF)\n\nIn 2021, RIE filed its Updated AMF Business Case and Grid Modernization Plan (GMP) with the RIPUC in accordance with the Amended Settlement Agreement (ASA) approved by the RIPUC in August 2018, and which among other things, sought approval to deploy smart meters throughout the service territory. After PPL completed the acquisition of RIE, RIE filed a new AMF Business Case with the RIPUC in 2022, consisting of a detailed proposal for full-scale deployment of AMF across its electric service territory.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, the RIPUC unanimously approved RIE to deploy an AMF-based metering system for the electric distribution business. RIE is authorized to seek recovery of the approved capital investment through the ISR process with an overall multi-year cap on recovery at approximately $153 million, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the potential offsets and recoverability of certain costs. RIE is required to continue spending even if above the recovery cap, until it achieves the functionalities outlined in the AMF Business Case. RIE filed with the RIPUC (i) an updated electric Service Quality Plan on December 27, 2023 for RIPUC approval and (ii) additional compliance tariff provisions",

The new GMP filing consists of a holistic suite of grid modernization investments that will provide RIE with the tools and capability to manage the electric distribution system more granularly considering a range of distributed energy resources adoption levels, accelerated by Rhode Island's climate mandates, while at the same time maintaining a safe and reliable electric distribution system. The GMP is an informational guidance document that supports the grid modernization investments to be proposed in future electric ISR plans. Consequently, RIE did not request approval from the RIPUC for any specific investments or seek cost recovery as part of the GMP; rather, RIE requested the RIPUC issues an order affirming RIE's compliance with its obligation to file a GMP that meets the requirements of the ASA. The RIPUC held a status conference on October 26, 2023, to discuss the scope of the RIPUC's review of the GMP and its potential impact future electric ISR plans.\n\n## Petition for Deferral of Credit Card Fees\n\nOn January 31, 2024, RIE filed a petition to request approval to recognize regulatory assets related to the credit card, debit card, and related fees (Electronic Transaction Fees) that RIE has waived and will continue to waive on a going forward basis pursuant to the RIPUC orders in RIPUC Docket No. 5022 related to COVID-19 impacts. If approved, RIE plans to include a proposal as part of its next base distribution rate case for the amortization/recovery of the regulatory assets and to include future Electronic Transaction Fees in base distribution rates. RIE simultaneously filed a Notice of Withdrawal of its April 2021 petition to create regulatory assets for COVID-19 related bad debt expense and the lost revenue from unassessed late payment charges pending in Docket No. 5154. RIE is continuing to evaluate these other COVID-19 related costs and intends to reserve its rights to file for recovery of these costs in the future. RIE cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n\n## FY 2023 Gas Infrastructure, Safety and Reliability (ISR) Plan\n\nAt an Open Meeting on March 29, 2022, the RIPUC conditionally approved RIE's FY 2023 Gas ISR Plan and associated revenue requirement, subject to further review regarding RIE's Proactive Main Replacement Program and its decision to reconstruct and purchase heating and pressure regulation equipment located at RIE's Wampanoag and Tiverton take stations. The RIPUC held an Open Meeting on September 13, 2022, and issued its Order on November 18. 2022 regarding the Proactive Main Replacement Program and made the following rulings: (i) commencing with the Gas ISR plan to be filed in this calendar year 2022 (prospectively), new main constructed to replace leak prone pipe will not be considered used and useful, and therefore not eligible for rate base treatment, until the related old main is abandoned; and (ii) approved the proactive main replacement revenue requirement set forth in the FY 2023 Gas ISR plan. Also, the RIPUC directed RIE to submit prefiled testimony on the issue of its replacement of heating and pressure regulation facilities at the Wampanoag and Tiverton take stations and to address three issues, specifically: (i) a cost-benefit analysis arising from RIE's decision to take ownership of the reconstructed take station equipment; (ii) the potential that the benefits derived from the reconstruction and ownership transfer of the take station equipment will not be realized due to the future use of hydrogen or abandonment of the gas system; and (iii) the depreciation and accounting treatment of the reconstructed take station equipment. RIE filed this testimony with the RIPUC on May 16, 2022, and the RIPUC has not taken any action to date on this issue. The RIPUC continues to consider the appropriate rate recovery treatment of projects not covered by an ISR plan for the applicable fiscal year, and additional definitions and procedures that may be implemented related to the ISR plan process. A new docket has been opened to address this matter with the goal of implementing changes for the FY 2025 ISR Plan.

On March 24, 2023, Kentucky Senate Bill 4 (SB 4) went into effect, which requires KPSC approval of the retirement of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in the state. On May 10, 2023, LG&E and KU filed an application with the KPSC seeking approval of the retirement of seven fossil fuel-fired generating units as required by SB 4. On May 16, 2023, the KPSC entered an Order consolidating the SB 4 filing proceeding into the CPCN case.\n\nOn November 6, 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E's and KU's requests (i) to construct a 640 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine at LG&E's Mill Creek Generating Station in Jefferson County, Kentucky, (ii) to construct a 120 MWac solar photovoltaic electric generating facility in Mercer County, Kentucky, (iii) to acquire a 120 MWac solar facility to be built by a third-party solar developer in Marion County, Kentucky and (iv) to construct a 125 MW, 4-hour battery energy storage system facility at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station. The KPSC denied the request to construct a 621 MW net summer rating NGCC combustion turbine at KU's E.W. Brown Generating Station in Mercer County, Kentucky at this time, based on the finding that the construction of this unit should be deferred with the construction date beginning on a date that provides for an in-service date in 2030. The order also authorized LG&E's and KU's entry into the four solar PPAs, subject to certain conditions, but deferred for future proceedings specific decisions on cost recovery treatment or mechanisms. Further, the order approved the new, adjusted or expanded energy efficiency programs contained in the requested 2024-2030 DSM plan.\n\nThe KPSC order included approval of the requested retirements of two existing coal-fired generation units at LG&E's Mill Creek Unit 1 (300 MW) and 2 (297 MW) in 2024 and 2027, subject to certain conditions, and three small gas-fired units. The order denied approval of the retirement of KU's E.W. Brown 3 Unit (412 MW) and Ghent Unit 2 (486 MW) in 2028 at this time, citing the need for additional clarity regarding environmental compliance regulations.\n\nThe new NGCC facility will be jointly owned by LG&E (31%) and KU (69%) and the solar units will be jointly owned by LG&E (37%) and KU (63%), the battery storage unit will be owned by LG&E, and the proposed PPA transactions and DSM programs will be entered into or conducted jointly by LG&E and KU, consistent with LG&E and KU's shared dispatch, cost allocation, tariff or other frameworks.\n\nThe order approved the requested AFUDC accounting treatment for associatedfinancingcosts,eachasrelatingtotheNGCC, solar and battery facilities to be constructed and owned by LG&E and KU. With respect to generating unit retirements that were approved by the KPSC, and separate from the order, LG&E and KU anticipate the recovery of associated costs, including the remaining net book value, for these units through the RAR or other rate mechanisms. The remaining net book values of LG&E's Mill Creek 1 and 2 generating units were approximately $95 million and $244 million at December 31, 2023 and LG&E is continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates through their retirement dates in 2024 and 2027. LG&E expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement, which is expected to total approximately $83 million for Mill Creek Unit 1 and $160 million for Mill Creek Unit 2, to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period of ten years in accordance with the RAR.",

        "page_content": "## Kentucky March 2023 Storm\n\nOn March 3, 2023, LG&E and KU experienced significant windstorm activity in their service territories, resulting in substantial damage to certain of LG&E's and KU's assets with total costs incurred through December 31, 2023 of $74 million ($33 million at LG&E and $41 million at KU). On March 17, 2023, LG&E and KU submitted a filing with the KPSC requesting regulatory asset treatment of the extraordinary operations and maintenance expenses portion of the costs incurred related to the windstorm. OnApril 5, 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving the request for accounting purposes, noting that approval for recovery would be determined in LG&E's and KU's next base rate cases. As of December 31, 2023, LG&E and KU recorded regulatory assets related to the storm of $8 million and $11 million.\n\n## KPSC Investigation Related to Winter Storm Elliott\n\nOn December 22, 2023, the KPSC initiated an investigation into the practices of LG&E and KU regarding the provision of electric service from December 23, 2022 through December 25, 2022, during a period of extreme temperatures during Winter Storm Elliott. The investigation is the result of LG&E's and KU's need to implement brief service interruptions to approximately 55,000 customers during this period. The purpose of the investigation is to supplement discovery and examination already completed through LG&E's and KU's CPCN proceedings, a legislative hearing completed in February 2023 and reports completed by the NERC and the FERC related to the issue. Additionally, the investigation will evaluate LG&E's and KU's actions taken, or planned to be taken, since Winter Storm Elliott that affect their ability to provide service during periods of variable weather and power system stress. LG&E and KU believe actions taken during the period under question were necessary and appropriate. Several parties have been granted intervenor status for the proceeding and discovery is currently scheduled to continue through March 15, 2024. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and an estimate of the impact, if any, cannot be determined, but LG&E and KU do not believe this matter will have a significant impact on their operations or financial condition.\n\n## Pennsylvania Activities (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\n## PAPUC investigation into billing issues\n\nOn January 31, 2023, the PAPUC initiated an investigation focused on billing issues related to estimated, irregular bills and customer service concerns following customer complaints, which for many customers were driven by increased prices for electricity supply. Certain bills issued during the time period of December 20, 2022 through January 9, 2023 were estimated due to a technical issue that prevented PPL Electric from providing actual collected meter data to customer facing and other internal systems. Customers also reported difficulties accessing PPL Electric's website and contacting the customer service call center. The PAPUC's Bureau of Investigation & Enforcement (I&E) has directed PPL Electric to respond to certain inquiries and document requests. PPL Electric submitted its responses to the information request and cooperated fully with the investigation. PPL Electric reached a Settlement Agreement with I&E on November 21, 2023. In the settlement, PPL Electric agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1 million, make certain remedial improvements to its billing systems and processes, and agree to not seek recovery for extraordinary costs incurred in responding to the billing event. On November 21, 2023, PPL Electric and I&E submitted a Joint Petition for Approval of Settlement to the PAPUC. On January 18, 2024, the PAPUC issued an Order requesting public comment prior to the Commission entering a Final Order on the petition. Comments are due on February 28, 2024. PPL Electric is waiting for the PAPUC to issue a Final Order on the Joint Petition for Approval of Settlement. Approval is pending until the Commission has provided its final decision. PPL Electric cannot predict the outcome of this matter.",

        "page_content": "## Act 129\n\nAct 129 requires Pennsylvania Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) to meet, by specified dates, specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties. PPL Electric filed with the PAPUC its Act 129 Phase IV Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan on November 30, 2020, for the five-year period starting June 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2026. PPL Electric's Phase IV Act 129 Plan was approved by the PAPUC at its March 25, 2021, public meeting.\n\nAct 129 also requires EDCs to act as a default service provider (DSP), which provides electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PAPUC-approved default service procurement plan. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan.\n\n## Federal Matters\n\n## FERC Transmission Rate Filing (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going waivers and credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. On May 18, 2023, the FERC issued an order on remand reversing its 2019 decision and requiring LG&E and KU to refund credits previously withheld, including under such transition mechanism. LG&E and KU filed a petition for review of the FERC's May 18, 2023 order with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and provided refunds in accordance with the FERC order on December 1, 2023. The FERC issued an order on LG&E and KU's compliance filing on November 16, 2023, and LG&E and KU filed a petition for review of this November 16 order on February 14, 2024. The proceedings at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals were held on abeyance until February 15, 2024, but a motion to hold the proceedings on abeyance for an additional 60 days was filed on February 15, 2024, to allow the FERC time to substantively address LG&E and KU's request for rehearing of the November 16 order. LG&E and KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or any other post decision process but do not expect the annual impact to have a material effect on their operations or financial condition. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of certain waivers and credits primarily through base rates increases, provided, however, that increases associated with the FERC's May 18, 2023 order are expected to be subject to future rate proceedings.\n\n## Recovery of Transmission Costs (PPL)\n\nUntil December 2022, RIE's transmission facilities were operated in combination with the transmission facilities of National Grid's New England affiliates, Massachusetts Electric Company (MECO) and New England Power (NEP), as a single integrated system with NEP designated as the combined operator. As of January 1, 2023, RIE operates its own transmission facilities. NE-ISO allocates RIE's costs among transmission customers in New England, in accordance with the ISO Open Access Transmission Tariff (ISO-NE OATT). According to the FERC orders, RIE is compensated for its actual monthly transmission costs, with its authorized maximum ROE of 11.74% on its transmission assets.\n\nThe ROE for transmission rates under the ISO-NE OATT is the subject of four complaints that are pending before the FERC. On October 16, 2014, the FERC issued an order on the first complaint, Opinion No. 531-A, resetting the base ROE applicable to transmission assets under the ISO-NE OATT from 11.14% to 10.57% effective as of October 16, 2014 and establishing a",

        "page_content": "maximum ROE of 11.74%. On April 14, 2017, this order was vacated and remanded by the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals). After the remand, the FERC issued an order on October 16, 2018 applicable to all four pending cases where it proposed a new base ROE methodology that, with subsequent input and support from the New England Transmission Owners (NETO), yielded a base ROE of 10.41%. Subsequent to the FERC's October 2018 order in the New England Transmission Owners cases, the FERC further refined its ROE methodology in another proceeding and has applied that refined methodology to transmission owners' ROEs in other jurisdictions, and the NETOs filed further information in the New England matters to distinguish their case. Those determinations in other jurisdictions have recently been vacated and remanded back to the FERC for further proceedings by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The proceeding and the final base rate ROE determination in the New England matters remain open, pending a final order from the FERC. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and an estimate of the impact cannot be determined.\n\n## Other\n\n## Purchase of Receivables Program\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nIn accordance with a PAPUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative electricity suppliers at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, PPL Electric purchased $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers.\n\n(PPL)\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the RIPUC approved various components of a Purchase of Receivables Program (POR) in Rhode Island for effect on April 1, 2022. Municipal aggregators and non-regulated power producers (collectively, Competitive Suppliers) are eligible to participate in accordance with RIE's approved electric tariffs for municipal aggregation and non-regulated power producers. Under the POR program, RIE will purchase the Competitive Suppliers' accounts receivables, including existing receivables, at discounted rates, regardless of whether RIE has collected the owed monies from customers. The program is intended to make RIE whole through the implementation of a discount rate or Standard Complete Bill Percentage (SCBP) paid by Competitive Suppliers. RIE calculates the SCBP for each customer class and files the calculations with the RIPUC for review and approval by February 15 of each year. At an Open Meeting on March 29, 2023, the RIPUC approved the SCBP for effect beginning on April 1, 2023 for a one-year period.\n\n## 8. Financing Activities\n\n## Credit Arrangements and Short-term Debt\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. For reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the credit facilities and commercial paper programs of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU also apply to PPL. The amounts listed in the borrowed column below are recorded as \"Short-term debt\" on the Balance Sheets except for borrowings under PPL Electric's term loan agreement due March 2024 and borrowings under LG&E's and KU's term loan agreements due July 2024, which were reflected in \"Long-term debt\" at December 31, 2022 and were repaid in 2023.

The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. LG&E, KU, PPL Electric and RIE are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in capital account.\" The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act. LG&E, KU, PPL Electric and RIE believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes. In February 2012, LG&E and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for PPL's 2010 acquisition of LG&E and KU. In May 2012, the FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below 30% of total capitalization. Accordingly, at December 31, 2023, net assets of $1.5 billion for LG&E and $2.0 billion for KU were restricted",

Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n\n(PPL)\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of Narragansett Electric\n\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S., a subsidiary of National Grid plc (the Acquisition). Narragansett Electric, whose service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island, is primarily engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas. The Acquisition expands PPL's portfolio of regulated natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution assets, has improved PPL's credit metrics and is expected to enhance long term earnings growth. Following the closing of the Acquisition, Narragansett Electric provides services doing business under the name Rhode Island Energy (RIE).\n\nThe consideration for the Acquisition consisted of approximately $3.8 billion in cash and approximately $1.5 billion of longterm debt assumed through the transaction. The fair value of the consideration paid for Narragansett Electric was as follows (in billions):\n\n| Aggregate enterprise consideration                     | $ 5.3   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Less: fair value of assumed long-term debt outstanding | 1.5     |\n| Total cash consideration                               | $ 3.8   |\n\nThe $3.8 billion total cash consideration paid was funded with proceeds from PPL's 2021 sale of its U.K. utility business.\n\nIn connection with the Acquisition, National Grid USA Service Company, Inc., National Grid U.S. and Narragansett Electric have entered into a transition services agreement (TSA), pursuant to which National Grid has agreed to provide certain transition services to Narragansett Electric to facilitate the transition of the operation of Narragansett Electric to PPL following the Acquisition, as agreed upon in the Narragansett SPA. The TSA is for an initial two-year term and certain aspects have been extended to the third quarter of 2024. The TSA is subject to further extension as necessary to complete the successful transition. TSAcosts of $228 million and $123 million were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Commitments to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island\n\nAs a condition to the Acquisition, PPL made certain commitments to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island. As a result:\n\n- \u00b7 RIE provided a credit to all its electric and natural gas distribution customers in the total amount of $50 million ($40 million net of tax benefit). Based on the relative number of electric distribution customers and natural gas distribution customers as of November 1, 2022, RIE refunded, in the form of a bill credit, $33 million to electric customers and $17 million to natural gas customers of amounts collected from customers since the Acquisition date. Each electric customer received the same credit, and each natural gas customer received the same credit. A reduction of revenue and a regulatory liability of $50 million for the amounts refunded were recorded during the quarter ended",

The amounts refunded will not impact RIE's earnings sharing regulatory mechanism.\n- \u00b7 RIE forgave approximately $44 million ($21 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts) in arrearages for lowincome and protected residential customers, which represents 100% of the arrearages over 90 days for those customers as of March 31, 2022. PPL deemed these accounts uncollectible and fully reserved for them as of September 30, 2022, resulting in an increase to \"Other operations and maintenance expense\" on the Statement of Income of $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 RIE will not file a base rate case seeking an increase in base distribution rates for natural gas and/or electric service sooner than three years from the Acquisition date, and RIE will not submit a request for a change in base rates unless and until there is at least twelve months of operating experience under PPL's exclusive leadership and after the TSA with National Grid terminates.\n- \u00b7 RIE will forgo potential recovery of any and all transition costs, which includes (1) the installation of certain information technology systems; (2) modification and enhancements to physical facilities in Rhode Island; and (3) incurring costs related to severance payments, communications and branding changes, and other transition related costs. These costs, which are being expensed as incurred, were $262 million and $181 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n- \u00b7 RIE will not seek to recover any transaction costs related to the Acquisition, which were $28 million through December 31, 2023, including an immaterial amount for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $18 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These amounts were recorded in \"Other operations and maintenance\" on the Statement of Income.\n- \u00b7 RIE will not seek to recover in rates any markup charged by National Grid U.S. and/or its affiliates under the TSA which were $7 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n- \u00b7 In June 2022, RIE expensed $20 million of regulatory assets as of the Acquisition date for the Gas Business Enablement (GBE) project and for certain Cybersecurity/IT investments related to GBE. The expense was recorded to \"Other operations and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. RIE will not seek to recover these regulatory assets from customers in any future proceedings.\n- \u00b7 RIE will exclude all goodwill from the ratemaking capital structure.\n- \u00b7 RIE will hold harmless Rhode Island customers from any changes to Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) as a result of the Acquisition. RIE reserves the right to seek rate adjustments based on future changes to ADIT that are not related to the Acquisition.\n- \u00b7 RIE will not increase its revenue requirement to a level higher than what would exist in the absence of the Acquisition as a result of any restatement of pension and other post-retirement benefits plan assets and liabilities to fair value after the close of the Acquisition.\n- \u00b7 Rhode Island Holdings contributed $2.5 million to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation's Renewable Energy Fund and will not use any of the $2.5 million to meet its pre-existing renewable energy credit goals in Rhode Island or any other state. This contribution was made during the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in \"Other Income (Expense)\" on the Statement of Income.\n- \u00b7 RIE will make available up to $2.5 million for the Rhode Island Attorney General to utilize as needed in evaluating PPL's report on RIE's specific decarbonization goals to support Rhode Island's 2021 Act on Climate or to assess the future of the gas distribution business in Rhode Island. This amount was accrued during the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statement of Income.\n- \u00b7 Various other operational and reporting commitments have been established.\n\n## Purchase Price Allocation\n\nThe operations of Narragansett Electric are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. The carrying value of Narragansett Electric's assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting and cost recovery provisions provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of net assets and liabilities included in rate base. Therefore, the fair values of these assets and liabilities equal their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets acquired nor liabilities assumed reflect any adjustments related to these amounts.",

PPL has elected to not reflect the effects of purchase accounting in the separate financial statements of RIE or PPL's Rhode Island Regulated segment.

The remaining excess purchase price of $860 million is included in PPL's Corporate and Other category for segment reporting purposes. The goodwill reflects the value paid for the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of PPL to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of those growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows.

Adjustments to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in a decrease in goodwill of $1 million since the purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2022.\n\n|                                                   | Final Purchase Price Allocation   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Assets                                            |                                   |\n| Current Assets                                    |                                   |\n| Cash and Cash Equivalents                         | $ 154                             |\n| Accounts Receivable (a)                           | 195                               |\n| Unbilled Revenues                                 | 54                                |\n| Price Risk Management Assets                      | 99                                |\n| Regulatory Assets                                 | 75                                |\n| Other Current Assets                              | 65                                |\n| Total Current Assets                              | 642                               |\n| Noncurrent Assets                                 |                                   |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment, net                | 3,992                             |\n| Regulatory Assets                                 | 393                               |\n| Goodwill                                          | 1,585                             |\n| Other Noncurrent Assets                           | 164                               |\n| Total Noncurrent Assets                           | 6,134                             |\n| Total Assets                                      | $ 6,776                           |\n| Liabilities                                       |                                   |\n| Current Liabilities                               |                                   |\n| Long-Term Debt Due Within One Year                | $ 14                              |\n| Accounts Payable                                  | 180                               |\n| Taxes Accrued                                     | 44                                |\n| Regulatory Liabilities                            | 239                               |\n| Other Current Liabilities                         | 198                               |\n| Total Current Liabilities                         | 675                               |\n| Noncurrent Liabilities                            |                                   |\n| Long-Term Debt                                    | 1,496                             |\n| Regulatory Liabilities                            | 643                               |\n| Other Deferred Credits and Noncurrent Liabilities | 142                               |\n| Noncurrent Liabilities                            | 2,281                             |\n| Total Purchase Price (Balance Sheet Net Assets)   | $ 3,820                           |",

The leases were operating leases and expired in 2021. Payments were allocated among lease and non-lease components as stated in the agreements. Lease payments were fixed or determined based on the amount of refined coal used in electricity generation at the facility. Payments received were primarily recorded as a regulatory liability and amortized in accordance with regulatory approvals. There are certain leases in which RIE is the lessor. Revenue under such leases was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table shows the lease income recognized for the years ended December 31:\n\n|      | 2023   | 2022   |   2021 |\n|------|--------|--------|--------|\n| PPL  | $ 4    | 6      |     11 |\n| LG&E | -      | 2      |      5 |\n| KU   | -      | -      |      5 |\n\n## 11. Retirement and Postemployment Benefits\n\n(All Registrants)\n\n## Defined Benefits\n\nCertain employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible for pension benefits under non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of service and final average pay, as defined by the plans.\n\nEffective January 1, 2012, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees.

The investment strategy for the Master Trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted returnonamixofassetsthat,incombinationwithPPL's funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments, while also managing the duration of the assets to complement the duration of the liabilities. The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk.\n\nThe investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian. The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL's Board of Directors.\n\nThe EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities. This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios. The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions. The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nTarget allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility. In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time. EBPB investment guidelines as of the end of 2023 are presented below.\n\nThe asset allocation for the trust and the target allocation by portfolio at December 31 are as follows:\n\n|                         | Percentage of trust assets   | Percentage of trust assets   | 2023                    |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                         | 2023                         | 2022                         | Target Asset Allocation |\n| Growth Portfolio        | 54 %                         | 55 %                         | 55 %                    |\n| Equity securities       | 31 %                         | 31 %                         |                         |\n| Debt securities (a)     | 12 %                         | 13 %                         |                         |\n| Alternative investments | 11 %                         | 11 %                         |                         |\n| Immunizing Portfolio    | 43 %                         | 43 %                         | 43 %                    |\n| Debt securities (a)     | 36 %                         | 33 %                         |                         |\n| Derivatives (b)         | 7%                           | 10 %                         |                         |\n| Liquidity Portfolio     | 3%                           | 2%                           | 2%                      |\n| Total                   | 100 %                        | 100 %                        | 100 %                   |",

        "page_content": "The fair value measurements of cash and cash equivalents are based on the amounts on deposit.\n\nThe market approach is used to measure fair value of equity securities. The fair value measurements of equity securities (excluding commingled funds), which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets. These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices.\n\nInvestments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities. Investments in commingled equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities. Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations, as well as funds that invest in investment grade longduration fixed-income securities.\n\nThe fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models, which incorporate observable inputs. Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data. For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations.\n\nInvestments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others. The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.\n\nInvestments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies. The partnerships have limited lives of at least 10 years, after which liquidating distributions will be received. Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\n\nInvestments in private credit represent pools of actively managed loans that span capital structure and borrower type. Strategies carry different types and levels of risk. Returns from those strategies will vary in terms of yield, fees generated, loan loss rates and the pace of principal repayment. Investments have limited lives of approximately 2-8 years. The investment cannot be redeemed with the general partner; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Master Trust had unfunded commitments of $85 million that may be required during the lives of the real estate, private equity and private credit partnerships.\n\nInvestments in hedge funds represent investments in a fund of hedge funds. Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined, aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions. Major investment strategies for the fund of hedge funds include long/short equity, tactical trading, event driven, and relative value. Shares may be redeemed with 45 days prior written notice. The fund is subject to short term lockups and other restrictions. The fair value for the fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share.",

        "page_content": "The fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. These securities primarily represent investments in treasury futures, total return swaps, interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap), which are valued based on quoted prices, changes in the value of the underlying exposure or on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings.\n\n## Plan Assets - Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\n\nThe investment strategy with respect to other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401(h) accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner. Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments. These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers and, therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Equity securities include investments in a large-cap commingled fund and a global equity exchange-traded fund. Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. Ownership interests in money market funds are treated as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. The asset allocation for the PPL VEBA trusts and the target allocation, by asset class, at December 31 are detailed below.\n\n|                               | Percentage of plan assets   | Percentage of plan assets   | Target Asset Allocation   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                               | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2023                      |\n| Asset Class                   |                             |                             |                           |\n| Equity securities             | 46 %                        | 45 %                        | 45 %                      |\n| Debt securities (a)           | 48 %                        | 48 %                        | 49 %                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (b) | 6%                          | 7%                          | 6%                        |\n| Total                         | 100 %                       | 100 %                       | 100 %                     |\n\nThe fair value of assets in the other postretirement benefit plans by asset class and level within the fair value hierarchy was:\n\n|                                                | December 31, 2023 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2023 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2023 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2023 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using   | December 31, 2022 Fair Value Measurement Using   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                | Total                                            | Level 1                                          | Level 2                                          | Level 3                                          | Total                                            | Level 1                                          | Level 2                                          | Level 3                                          |\n| Money market funds                             | $ 20                                             | $ 20                                             | $ -

PPL expects to make approximately $10 million of benefit payments under these plans in 2024.\n\nPPL is not required to make contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans but has historically funded these plans in amounts equal to the postretirement benefit costs recognized. Continuation of this past practice would cause PPL to contribute $14 million to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2024.\n\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans and the following federal subsidy payments are expected to be received by PPL.\n\n|           |         | Other Postretirement   | Other Postretirement     |\n|-----------|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n|           | Pension | Benefit Payment        | Expected Federal Subsidy |\n| 2024      | $ 299   | $ 52                   | $ -                      |\n| 2025      | 293     | 50                     | -                        |\n| 2026      | 290     | 49                     | -                        |\n| 2027      | 282     | 48                     | -                        |\n| 2028      | 277     | 47                     | -                        |\n| 2029-2033 | 1,322   | 216                    | -                        |\n\n## Savings Plans (All Registrants)\n\nSubstantially, all employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible to participate in deferred savings plans (401(k)s).

Substantially all of these contracts require power to be delivered before RIE is obligated to make payment. Additionally, RIE has entered various contracts for gas delivery, storage, and supply services. Certain of these contracts require payment of annual demand charges, which are recoverable from customers.

The RIPUC-approved solicitations currently in service include: (i) a 15-year PPA with Orbit Energy Rhode Island, LLC for a 3.2 MW nameplate anaerobic digester biogas project located in Johnston, Rhode Island, placed in service in 2017, (ii) a 15-year PPA with Black Bear Development Holdings, LLC for a 3.9 MW nameplate run-of-river hydroelectric plant located in Orono, Maine, placed in service in 2013, (iii) a 15-year PPA with Copenhagen Wind Farm, LLC for an 80 MW nameplate land-based wind project locatedinDenmark,NewYork,placedin service in 2018, and (iv) a 15-year PPA with Rhode Island LFG Genco, LLC for a 32.1 MW nameplate combined cycle combustion turbine generating facility fueled by a landfill gas project located in Johnston, Rhode Island, placed in service in 2013 . On December 29, 2023, RIE filed an RFP with the RIPUC for approval under LTCS to backf ill approximately 17.2 MW of renewable contracting capacity resulting from a terminated PPA to fulfill the required 90 MW under LTCS.",

        "page_content": "In addition to the LTCS, in October 2023, RIE issued a request for proposals (RFP) for 300 MW to approximately 1,200 MW of newly developed offshore wind energy projects, under the Affordable Clean Energy Security Act (ACES), as amended in 2022. Based on the RFP schedule, RIE anticipates beginning conditional project selection in June 2024. RIE must negotiate in good faith to achieve a commercially reasonable contract and may file such contract with the RIPUC for approval in December 2024, unless RIE shows that the bids are unlikely to lead to a contract that meets all of the statutory and RFP requirements.\n\nAs approved by the RIPUC, RIE is allowed to pass through commodity-related/purchased power costs to customers and collect remuneration equal to 2.75% for long-term contracts approved prior to January 1, 2022, pursuant to LTCS as amended in 2022, and that have achieved commercial operation. For long-term contracts approved pursuant to LTCS or ACES, both as amended, on or after January 1, 2022, RIE is entitled to financial remuneration equal to 1.0% through December 31, 2026, for those projects that are commercially operating. For long-term contracts approved pursuant to LTCS or ACES on or after January 1, 2027, RIE is not entitled to any financial remuneration, unless otherwise granted by the RIPUC. Also, the 2022 amendments to LTCS and ACES added a provision, which provides that for any calendar year inwhichRIE'sactualreturnonequityexceeds the return on equity allowed by the RIPUC in the last general rate case, the RIPUC may adjust any or all remuneration to assure that such remuneration does not result in or contribute toward RIE earning above its allowed return for such calendar year.\n\n## Legal Matters\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities, unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Talen Litigation\n\n## Background (PPL)\n\nIn September 2013, one of PPL's former subsidiaries, PPL Montana, entered into an agreement to sell its hydroelectric generating facilities. In June 2014, PPL and PPL Energy Supply, the parent company of PPL Montana, entered into various definitive agreements with affiliates of Riverstone to spin off PPL Energy Supply and ultimately merge it with Riverstone's competitive power generation businesses to form a stand-alone company named Talen Energy. In November 2014, after executing the spinoff agreements but prior to the closing of the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana closed the sale of its hydroelectric generating facilities. Subsequently, on June 1, 2015, the spinoff of PPL Energy Supply was completed. Following the spinoff transaction, PPL had no continuing ownership interest in or control of PPL Energy Supply. In connection with the spinoff transaction, PPL Montana became Talen Montana, LLC (Talen Montana), a subsidiary of Talen Energy and Talen Energy Marketing, LLC also became a subsidiary of Talen Energy. Talen Energy has owned and operated both Talen Montana and Talen Energy Marketing, LLC since the spinoff. As a result of the spinoff and merger, affiliates of Riverstone owned a 35% interest in Talen Energy. Riverstone subsequently acquired the remaining interests in Talen Energy in a take private transaction in December 2016.\n\nIn October 2018, Talen Montana Retirement Plan and Talen Energy Marketing, LLC filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of current and contingent creditors of Talen Montana (the Montana Action) who allegedly suffered harm or allegedly will suffer reasonably foreseeable harm as a result of, among other things, the November 2014 allegedly fraudulent transfer of $900 million of proceeds from the sale of then-PPL Montana's hydroelectric generating facilities.\n\nIn November 2018, PPL, certain PPL affiliates, and certain current and former officers and directors filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking various forms of relief against Riverstone, Talen Energy and certain of their affiliates (the Delaware Action), in response to the Montana Action and as part of the defense strategy.",

PPL Corp., PPL Capital Funding, Inc., PPL Electric Utilities Corp., and PPL Energy Funding (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nOn May 9, 2022, Talen Energy Supply, LLC and 71 affiliates, including Talen Montana, LLC, filed petitions for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Texas Bankruptcy Court).\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Talen Montana, LLC, as debtor-in-possession, filed a complaint initiating an adversary proceeding (Adversary Proceeding) in the Texas Bankruptcy Court against PPL Corporation, PPL Capital Funding, Inc., PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, and PPL Energy Funding Corporation. Similar to the litigation in Montana, the Adversary Proceeding sought the recovery of an allegedly fraudulent transfer relating to PPL Montana's November 2014 sale of hydroelectric assets to Northwestern and subsequent distribution of approximately $900 million of proceeds from that sale, reiterating claims that the parties had already been litigating in Montana and Delaware.\n\nBoth the Montana Action and the Delaware Action were transferred to and consolidated in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. PPL filed its Answer and asserted a Counterclaim against the Talen and Riverstone entities, similar to the claims previously asserted in the Delaware Action, and filed a motion for partial summary judgment that was heard on October 31, 2022. Mediation occurred on February 22, 2023 before Judge David R. Jones of the Texas Bankruptcy Court. The parties were not able to settle the case at that time. On June 14, 2023, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered an Order denying PPL's motion for partial summary judgment.\n\nAhearing on Riverstone's motion for summary judgment occurred on August 24, 2023. The court ordered supplemental briefings from each party following the hearing. Defendants filed a second partial motion for summary judgment based on a safe harbor provision in the bankruptcy code on September 29, 2023. On December 22, 2023, PPL announced that it entered into a settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) with Talen Montana, LLC and affiliated entities (Talen) to resolve all claims made by Talen in Talen Montana, LLC et al. v. PPL Corp. et al, Adv. No 22-09001 pending before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas and arising out of the June 2015 spinoff of PPL Energy Supply, which was renamed Talen. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, PPL paid Talen $115 million and Talen dismissed all claims against PPL. Separately, PPL and Riverstone mutually agreed to dismiss all remaining claims in a settlement in January 2024. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Narragansett Electric Litigation (PPL)\n\n## Energy Efficiency Programs Investigation\n\nNarragansett Electric, while under the ownership of National Grid, performed an internal investigation into conduct associated with its energy efficiency programs. On June 27, 2022, the RIPUC opened a new docket (RIPUC Docket No. 22-05-EE) to investigate RIE's actions and the actions of its National Grid employees during the time RIE was a National Grid USA affiliate being provided services by National Grid USA Service Company, Inc. relating to the manipulation of the reporting of invoices affecting the calculation of past energy efficiency shareholder incentives and the resulting impact on customers. The Rhode Island Attorney General and National Grid USA intervened in the docket.",

        "page_content": "On January 19, 2023, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (the Division) filed a motion to dismiss RIPUC Docket No. 22-05-EE without prejudice. As grounds for its motion, the Division stated that sufficient evidence exists in the docket to warrant an independent summary investigation by the Division, to include an audit of RIE, pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws Section 39-4-13. If the Division finds sufficient grounds, the Division may proceed to a formal hearing regarding the matters under investigation pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws Sections 39-4-14 and 39-4-15. Upon the conclusion of its investigation, the Division will provide the RIPUC with a report outlining the Division's findings and final decision. On January 30, 2023, the Rhode Island Attorney General filed an objection to the Division's motion to dismiss; RIE and National Grid each filed responses with the RIPUC requesting that any additional action taken by the RIPUC or the Division be considered after National Grid completes its internal investigation report, which National Grid filed with the RIPUC on March 10, 2023. On February 24, 2023, the Division initiated the independent summary investigation that it had referenced in its motion to dismiss. The RIPUC held a hearing on March 28, 2023 to hear oral arguments regarding the Division's motion to dismiss and subsequently denied the motion. On November 27, 2023, the Division filed testimony recommending the RIPUC disallow a portion of the performance incentive awarded from 2012 through 2021, an amount of approximately $13 million, including interest. On January 19, 2024, the Division and the Rhode Island Attorney General filed their respective briefs recommending that the RIPUC assess financial penalties on the Company. The Division also recommended that the RIPUC consider further regulatory investigations and analysis within each of the energy efficiency dockets from 2012 through 2020, to confirm the accuracy of claimed savings and to document all conduct and actions that would trigger penalties pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-8 and 39-1-22. This proceeding remains open and, in parallel, the Division's summary investigation remains ongoing. At this time, it is not possible to predict the final outcome or determine the total amount of any additional liabilities thatmaybeincurredbyRIEinconnectionwiththismatterortheDivision'ssummary investigation. RIE does not expect this matter will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## E.W. Brown Environmental Assessment ( PPL and KU)\n\nKU is undertaking extensive remedial measures at the E.W. Brown plant including closure of the former ash pond, implementation of a groundwater remedial action plan and performance of a corrective action plan including aquatic study of adjacent surface waters and risk assessment. The aquatic study and risk assessment are being undertaken pursuant to a 2017 agreed Order with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). KU conducted sampling of Herrington Lake in 2017 and 2018. In June 2019, KU submitted to the KEEC the required aquatic study and risk assessment, conducted by an independent third-party consultant, finding that discharges from the E.W. Brown plant have not had any significant impact on Herrington Lake and that the water in the lake is safe for recreational use and meets safe drinking water standards. On May 31, 2021, the KEEC approved the report and released a response to public comments. On August 6, 2021, KU submitted a Supplemental Remedial Alternatives Analysis report to the KEEC that outlines proposed additional fish, water, and sediment testing. On February 18, 2022, the KEEC provided approval to KU to proceed with the proposed sampling, which commenced in the spring of 2022. On November 17, 2022, KU submitted a Supplemental Performance Monitoring Report to the KEEC finding that there are no significant unaddressed risks to human health or the environment at the plant. KU revised the Supplemental Performance Monitoring Report on June 8, 2023, in response to KEEC comments from April 24, 2023. On September 1, 2023, the KEEC requested KU to propose additional monitoring or remedial measures. KU submitted a revised Supplemental Performance Monitoring and Corrective Action Completion on December 28, 2023. Discussions between KU and the KEEC are ongoing.\n\n## Water/Waste (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\n## ELGs\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized ELGs for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities. These guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment and mandate operational changes including \"zero discharge\" requirements for certain wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations was to be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA. Legal challenges to the final rule were consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In April 2017, the EPA announced that it would grant petitions for reconsideration of the rule. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rule to postpone the compliance date for certain requirements. In October 2020, the EPA published final revisions to its best available technology standards for certain wastewaters and potential extensions to compliance dates (the Reconsideration Rule). In",

        "page_content": "March 2023, the EPA released a proposed rule that would modify the 2020 ELG revisions. The proposed rule would increase the stringency of previous control technology and zero discharge requirements, revise certain exemptions for generating units planned for retirement, and require case-by-case limitations for legacy wastewaters based on the best professional judgment of the state regulators. Compliance with the Reconsideration Rule is required during the pendency of the rulemaking process. The proposed rule is currently under evaluation, but could potentially result in significant operational changes and additional controls for LG&E and KU plants. The ELGs are expected to be implemented by the states or applicable permitting authorities in the course of their normal permitting activities. LG&E and KU are currently implementing responsive compliance strategies and schedules. Certain aspects of these compliance plans and estimates relate to developments in state water quality standards, which are separate from the ELG rule or its implementation. Certain costs are included in the Registrants' capital plans and expected to be recovered from customers through rate recovery mechanisms, but additional costs and recovery will depend on further regulatory developments at the state level.\n\n## CCRs\n\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule governing management of CCRs which include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes. The CCR Rule imposes extensive new requirements for certain CCR impoundments and landfills, including public notifications, location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements, and specifies restrictions relating to the beneficial use of CCRs. In July 2018, the EPA issued a final rule extending the deadline for closure of certain impoundments and adopting other substantive changes. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded portions of the CCR Rule. In December 2019, the EPA addressed certain deficiencies identified by the court and proposed amendments to change the closure deadline. In August 2020, the EPA published a final rule extending the deadline to initiate closure to April 11, 2021, while providing for certain extensions. The EPA is conducting ongoing rulemaking actions regarding various other amendments to the rule including potentially making the rule applicable to certain inactive impoundments and landfills not currently subject to the rule. Certain ongoing legal challenges to various provisions of the CCR Rule have been held in abeyance pending review by the EPA pursuant to the President's executive order. PPL, LG&E, and KU are monitoring the EPA's ongoing efforts to refine and implement the regulatory program under the CCR Rule. In January 2022, the EPA issued several proposed regulatory determinations, facility notifications, and public announcements whichindicateincreasedscrutinybytheEPAtodeterminethe adequacy of measures taken by facility owners and operators to achieve closure of CCR surface impoundments and landfills. In particular, the agency indicated that it will focus on certain practices which it views as posing a threat of continuing groundwater contamination. On May 18, 2023, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at inactive electricity generation facilities. The EPA proposes to establish groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements for all CCR management units at regulated CCR facilities regardless of how or when the CCR was placed. The proposed rule, if finalized, would require PPL to complete applicability determinations, implement site security measures, initiate weekly inspections and monthly monitoring of the impoundment, create a website, and complete hazard assessments and reports for its legacy impoundments within three months of the proposed rule's effective date. Additionally, the proposed rule could potentially subject management units that have previously completed remedial action and closure and certain beneficial use projects to additional federal regulatory requirements. Future guidance, regulatory determinations, rulemakings, and other developments could potentially require revisions to current LG&E and KU compliance plans including additional monitoring and remediation at surface impoundments and landfills, the cost of which could be substantial. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, rulemaking, and regulatory determinations or potential impacts on current LG&E and KU compliance plans. PPL, LG&E and KU are currently finalizing closure plans and schedules in accordance with existing regulations.\n\nIn January 2017, Kentucky issued a new state rule relating to CCR management, effective May 2017, aimed at reflecting the requirements of the federal CCR rule. As a result of a subsequent legal challenge, in January 2018, the Franklin County, Kentucky Circuit Court issued an opinion invalidating certain procedural elements of the rule. LG&E and KU presently operate their facilities under continuing permits authorized under the former program and do not currently anticipate material impacts as a result of the judicial ruling. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.",

Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with the federal CCR rule, KU also received KPSC approval for its plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law. LG&E and KU have completed planned closure measures at most of the subject impoundments and have commenced post closure groundwater monitoring as required at those facilities. LG&E and KU generally expect to complete all impoundment closures within five years of commencement, although a longer period may be required to complete closure of some facilities. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\nIn connection with the final CCR rule, LG&E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015 and continue to record adjustments as required. See Note 19 for additional information. Further changes to AROs, current capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\n\n## Superfund and Other Remediation\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nThe Registrants are potentially responsible for investigating and remediating contamination under the federal Superfund program and similar state programs. Actions are under way at certain sites including former coal gas manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Kentucky previously owned or operated by, or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of, PPL subsidiaries.\n\nDepending on the outcome of investigations at identified sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, additional costs of remediation could be incurred. PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU lack sufficient information about such additional sites to estimate any potential liability or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. Such costs, however, are not currently expected to be significant.\n\nThe EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of coal gas manufacturing. As a result, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup, that could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former coal gas manufacturing plants. The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these matters.\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric is a potentially responsible party for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites. Cleanup actions have been or are being undertaken at these sites as requested by governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL Electric.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of $8 million and $11 million, representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate these sites.\n\n## (PPL)\n\nRIE is a potentially responsible party for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including former manufactured gas plant (MGP) facilities formerly owned by the Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company and the Rhode Island gas distribution assets of the New England Gas division of Southern Union Company and electric operations at certain RIE facilities. RIE is currently investigating and remediating, as necessary, those MGP sites and certain other properties under agreements with governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expectedtobesignificanttoPPL.",

These undiscounted costs are expected to be incurred over approximately 30 years and generally to be subject to rate recovery. However, remediation costs for each site may be materially higher than estimated, depending on changing technologies and regulatory standards, selected end uses for each site, and actual environmental conditions encountered. RIE has recovered amounts from certain insurers and potentially responsible parties, and, where appropriate, may seek additional recovery from other insurers and from other potentially responsible parties, but it is uncertain whether, and to what extent, such efforts will be successful.\n\nThe RIPUC has approved two settlement agreements that provide for rate recovery of qualified remediation costs of certain contaminated sites located in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Rate-recoverable contributions for electric operations of approximately $3 million are added annually to RIE's Environmental Response Fund, established with RIPUC approval in March 2000 to address such costs, along with interest and any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third-parties. In addition, RIE recovers approximately $1 million annually for gas operations under a distribution adjustment charge in which the qualified remediation costs are amortized over 10 years. See Note 7 for additional information on RIE's recorded environmental regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\n## Regulatory Issues\n\nSee Note 7 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation.\n\n## Electricity - Reliability Standards\n\nThe NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards.\n\nThe Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations.\n\nPPL Electric, LG&E, KU and RIE monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential violations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any Regional Reliability Entity determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC.\n\nIn the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined.\n\n## Gas - Security Directives (PPL and LG&E)\n\nIn May and July of 2021, the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released two security directives applicable to certain notified owners and operators of natural gas pipeline facilities (including local distribution companies) that the TSA has determined to be critical. The TSA has determined that LG&E is within the scope of the directive, while RIE has not been notified of this distinction. The first security directive required notified owners/operators to implement cybersecurity incident reporting to the DHS, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, and perform a gap assessment of current entity cybersecurity practices against certain voluntary TSA security guidelines and report relevant results and proposed mitigation to applicable DHS agencies. The second security directive, revised in July of 2023, requires refinement of the cybersecurity implementation plan and the cybersecurity assessment plan. LG&E does not believe the security directives have had or will have a significant impact on LG&E's operations or financial condition.",

Related Party Transactions\n\n## Wholesale Sales and Purchases (LG&E and KU)\n\nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa. These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as \"Electric revenue from affiliate\" and \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" and are recorded at a price equal to the seller's fuel cost plus any split savings. Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies. The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its available generation.\n\n## Support Costs (PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL Services and LKS provide and, prior to its merger into PPL Services on December 31, 2021, PPL EU Services provided the Registrants, their respective subsidiaries and each other with administrative, management and support services. For all services companies, the costs of directly assignable and attributable services are charged to the respective recipients as direct support costs. General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific entity are allocated and charged to the respective recipients as indirect support costs. PPL Services, PPL EU Services and LKS use a three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs. PPL Services may also use a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs or a weighted average cost ratio. LKS bases its indirect allocations on the subsidiaries' number of employees, total assets, revenues, number of customers and/or other statistical information. PPL Services, PPL EU Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the years ended December 31, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense on the books of the recipients, based on methods that are believed to be reasonable.\n\n|                                   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| PPL Electric from PPL Services    | $ 222  | $ 241  | $ 54   |\n| PPL Electric from PPL EU Services | -      | -      | 222    |\n| LG&E from LKS                     | 115    | 153    | 169    |\n| LG&E from PPL Services            | 42     | 13     | 3      |\n| KU from LKS                       | 150    | 171    | 179    |\n| KU from PPL Services              | 48     | 14     | 3      |\n\nIn addition to the charges for services noted above, LKS makes payments on behalf of LG&E and KU for fuel purchases and other costs for products or services provided by third parties.

Fair Value Measurements\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. The fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis. See Note 1 for information on the levels in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe assets and liabilities measured at fair value were:\n\n|                                                      | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2022 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2022 Level 2 Level 3   | December 31, 2022 Level 2 Level 3   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                      | Total               | Level 1             | Level 2             | Level 3             | Total                               | Level 1                             |                                     |                                     |\n| PPL                                                  |                     |                     |                     |                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Assets                                               |                     |                     |                     |                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                            | $ 331               | $ 331               | $ -

In 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. The funds are invested primarily in commingled debt and equity funds measured at NAV and are classified as investments in equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the funds are recorded to the Statements of Income.\n\n## Price Risk Management Assets/Liabilities\n\n## Interest Rate Swaps ( PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nTo manage interest rate risk, PPL, LG&E and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., SOFR and government security rates), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3.\n\n## Gas Contracts (PPL)",

        "page_content": "To manage gas commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases, RIE utilizes over-the-counter (OTC) gas swaps contracts with pricing inputs obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), except in cases where the ICE publishes seasonal averages or where there were no transactions within the last seven days. RIE may utilize discounting based on quoted interest rate curves, including consideration of non-performance risk, and may include a liquidity reserve calculated based on bid/ask spread. Substantially all of these price curves are observable in the marketplace throughout at least 95% of the remaining contractual quantity, or they could be constructed from market observable curves with correlation coefficients of 95% or higher. These contracts are classified as Level 2.\n\nRIE also utilizes gas option and purchase and capacity transactions, which are valued based on internally developed models. Industry-standard valuation techniques, such as the Black-Scholes pricing model, are used for valuing such instruments. For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is classified as Level 3. This includes derivative instruments valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility, and contract duration. Such instruments are classified as in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. RIE considers non-performance risk and liquidity risk in the valuation of derivative instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the gas derivative instruments are implied volatility and gas forward curves. A relative change in commodity price at various locations underlying the open positions can result in significantly different fair value estimates.\n\n## Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value (All Registrants)\n\nThe carrying amounts of long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\n## Risk Management Objectives\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nPPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Senior Director-Risk Management, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of",

Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Many of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected.\n\nThe following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. PPL and LG&E utilize over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floatingrate debt. PPL, LG&E and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuance.\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the regulated utilities due to the recovery methods in place.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nPPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.\n- \u00b7 LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs.\n- \u00b7 RIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC- approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices.\n\n## Volumetric Risk\n\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors.

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 RIE is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates.\n\n## Equity Securities Price Risk\n\n- \u00b7 PPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of the defined benefit plans' assets. This risk is significantly mitigated due to the recovery methods in place.\n- \u00b7 PPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.\n\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.\n\nIn the event a supplier of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E or KU defaults on its contractual obligation, those Registrants would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.\n\n## Master Netting Arrangements (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nNet derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\n\nPPL had no cash collateral posted under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2023 and $4 million cash collateral posted at December 31, 2022.\n\nPPL had no obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nLG&EandKUhadnocashcollateralpostedorobligationtoreturncashcollateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nSee \"Offsetting Derivative Instruments\" below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\n(All Registrants)\n\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate.

        "page_content": "limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges (PPL)\n\nInterest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL had no such contracts at December 31, 2023.\n\nCash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring.\n\nFor 2023, 2022 and 2021, PPL had no cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the amount of accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months is insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded.\n\n## Economic Activity (PPL and LG&E)\n\nLG&E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including terminated swap contracts, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December 31, 2023, LG&E held contracts with a notional amount of $64 million that mature in 2033.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk (PPL)\n\n## Economic Activity\n\nRIE enters into derivative contracts that economically hedge natural gas purchases. Realized gains and losses from the derivatives are recoverable through regulated rates, therefore subsequent changes in fair value are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as purchased gas. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Energy Purchases\" on the Statements of Income upon settlement of the contracts. See Note 6 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, RIE held contracts with notional volumes of 48 Bcf that range in maturity from 2024 through 2025.\n\n## Accounting and Reporting\n\n## (All Registrants)\n\nAll derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless the NPNS is elected. NPNS contracts include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as NPNS are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and designated as such, except for the changes in fair values of LG&E's interest rate swaps that are recognized as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. See Note 7 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2023 and 2022.",

Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.\n\nAdditionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL's, LG&E's and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties. However, amounts disclosed below would represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with \"adequate assurance\" features.\n\n(PPL)\n\nAt December 31, 2023, derivative contracts in a net liability position that contain credit risk-related contingent features was $35 million. The aggregate fair value of additional collateral requirements in the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade was $36 million.\n\n## 18.

Asset Retirement Obligations\n\n## (PPL and PPL Electric)\n\nPPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur.\n\n## (PPL, LG&E and KU)\n\nPPL's, LG&E's and KU's ARO liabilities are primarily related to CCR closure costs. See Note 13 for information on the CCR rule. LG&E and RIE also have AROs related to natural gas mains and wells. LG&E's and KU's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements, which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property. Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission anddistributionassets.ForLG&E,KU,andRIE,all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registeredwiththePCAOBandarerequiredtobe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAcompany's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\nMorristown, New Jersey February 16, 2024",
