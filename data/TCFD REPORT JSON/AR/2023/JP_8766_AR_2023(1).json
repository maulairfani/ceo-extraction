As I listened to the aria performed on the platform of the Kiyomizu-dera Temple, I was pondering: \u02a0I really want to create a world where accidents do not happen, and losses, even if they cannot be avoided, are minimized.\u02a1\n\nI was surrounded by 50 some global insurance company CEOs, who were enchanted by the atmosphere and absorbed in the lingering impressions from our earlier discussions.\n\nThe Geneva Association* held its General Assembly in Japan for the first time in 15 years, and this was my first participation. Exploring with the top management of global insurers how the industry can contribute to society was a valuable experience.\n\nThe conference, held over three days, included keynote speeches on Japan\u029fs tradition and culture and a session in the Kiyomizu-dera Temple.\n\nThe conference provided many opportunities to experience the excellence of Japan, a sustainable society founded on well-being and continuing so over the course of its history. Having the participating CEOs express their resonance and appreciation was a great honor as a host country participant.\n\nMore importantly, given the significant changes in global risks and the increasing complexity of societal issues, it was valuable for the entire industry to bring together global CEOs to engage on how the insurance industry can contribute to society. In-depth discussions encompassed heightening risk-hedging mechanisms and supporting the transition to a decarbonized society through active engagement.\n\nAs the CEO of Tokio Marine, a company founded in Japan, a country prone to natural disasters, and through various discussions, I reaffirmed my commitment to addressing the \u02a0protection gap\u02a1 against natural catastrophes among various imminent societal issues.\n\nToday, natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and earthquakes cause economic losses of several hundreds of\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\nbillions of dollars each year, and the losses are increasing. However, only about 30% of these losses are covered by insurance. The remaining 70% is the \u02a0protection gap\u02a1 for which insurance companies have not been able to provide support.\n\nWe have faced natural catastrophe risks head-on with maximum efforts to further promote insurance through diversifying our business portfolio and arranging effective reinsurance for stable coverage. However, with finite capital and with just underwriting, there is a limit to what a private insurance company can achieve in addressing the massive protection gap of natural catastrophe risks.\n\nThat has made me think about how we can reduce the loss itself, by drastically enhancing our value proposition in the area of disaster prevention and mitigation. The discussions held at the General Assembly in Kyoto galvanized my vision to contribute to a safer and more secure world that is resilient to disasters.\n\nWe have been enhancing our values in the \u02a0pre- and post-incident\u02a1 areas such as disaster prevention and mitigation, early recovery, and prevention of recurrence. In November 2011, we established CORE, a disaster prevention consortium. By collaborating with more than 100 organizations representing a wide array of industries, we are creating and implementing solutions to reduce natural catastrophe damages from various aspects.\n\nFor example, in response to the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024, we disseminated real-time weather alerts and road collapse information for safe evacuation and recovery activities in the affected areas. For those affected by liquefaction following the earthquake, we offered consultation services to mitigate the damages.\n\nUtilizing these solutions helps to avoid or reduce damages, or alleviate the extent of loss, and allow for faster recovery, thereby preventing recurrence. If this is achieved, our economic value will improve through lower loss frequency and lower loss cost per claim and in aggregate. For clients, this will reduce insurance premium, while securing our proper margins, leading to stable risk placement without excessive cost increase.\n\n## \u25ef Geneva Association 2024 Annual General Assembly (Kyoto)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *\uff1a The Geneva Association is an insurance industry think tank made up of the CEOs of approximately 70 insurance companies from around the world.",

If they occur, the impact can be mitigated, and the premiums will not be substantial. In other words, the more we focus on delivering our values, the more resilient our stakeholders will be against disasters, reducing the social costs and creating a safer and more secure world. In this virtuous cycle, the client base will increase, leading to growth of our corporate earnings. This upward spiral is the value creation cycle that we aspire to and the world we envision.\n\nFor the time being, our initiatives are making progress mainly in Japan. However, natural disasters are a global challenge, and these initiatives can be laterally deployed around the world. I believe there is significance in starting this from Japan.\n\nFurthermore, the protection gap is not only an issue in natural disasters. It is also prevalent in various areas, including cybersecurity and healthcare. I see broader application where Tokio Marine can play an even more important role for our value creation.\n\nBy providing solutions to societal issues through our business activity, we create social value and grow our economic value at the same time. Persistence in meeting stakeholder expectations through our value creation approach will allow us to sustainably grow over the next 100 years. This is my sincere belief as I engage in day-to-day management.\n\n## \u25ef Value Creation Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our current positioning and unique strengths\n\nLet\u029fs turn to our latest business performance and standing.\n\nWe posted record adjusted net income in fiscal 2023, with strong underwriting mainly in North America offsetting the impact of various natural catastrophes in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nOn a Group basis, we are becoming a formidable organization, with Group companies reporting solid performance supporting and complementing others experiencing temporary challenges.\n\nNet premiums written increased 6% year-on-year to 5.8 trillion yen. Profit excluding one-time factors, such as the impact of natural catastrophes and COVID-19, increased 11% year-on-year to 685.5 billion yen. This past year has given us confidence that our underlying capabilities are stronger and will continue to improve.\n\nThe profit plan for fiscal 2024 is 1 trillion yen. On top of the profit based on our stronger capabilities, the plan is inclusive of capital gains from our \u02a0zero business-related equities\u02a1 policy, which accelerates the sell-down of our equity holdings.\n\n## Purpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and\n\nthe Mid-Term Business Plan\n\n## \u25ef FY2023 Performance\n\n## Net Premium Written\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe recent strong performance is supported by the \u02a0global risk diversification\u02a1 and \u02a0global Integrated Group Management,\u02a1 which are our unique strengths. These are the core strategies that the Group has long nurtured, and we will refine them further\n\nI will start with \u02a0global risk diversification.\u02a1 The insurance business is about underwriting \u02a0risks.\u02a1 Our commitment and promise to our stakeholders should not waver under any circumstances. Any type of incident, occurring anywhere in the world, will affect our business in one way or another. This is the assumption to which we must manage the risks to ensure our financial soundness. This way, we always keep our promise to our stakeholders.\n\n\u02a0Global risk diversification\u02a1 is required to raise the bar. Over the past 15 years, we have built a highly diversified portfolio by organically and inorganically expanding our business outside of Japan, where risk correlation with Japanese non-life business is low.\n\nAs a result, we were able to keep the impact to our profits from large-scale natural catastrophes and the COVID-19 pandemic losses to about 20% to 30%. However, we believe this percentage is still high, and we will engage in further risk diversification.\n\nNext is \u02a0global Integrated Group Management.\u02a1 Expansion of our non-Japanese business through M&As resulted in a diversified risk portfolio and profit growth. Yet for Tokio Marine, our greatest achievement is welcoming talent with great expertise and industry knowledge.\n\nAs societal issues and risks amplify and become more complex around the world, we must accurately recognize these challenges, create solutions, and manage those risks as risk management professionals. Accordingly, we have improved the quality, accuracy, and speed of our management decision-making by assigning the best talent in corresponding areas to ensure that the right person addresses the challenges. This is how we call upon our global wisdom.\n\nWe are in our ninth year of Integrated Group Management, and by increasing the number of non-Japanese executive officers and reinforcing our global committees, we continue to evolve, developing our unique competitive values.\n\nSuch values will be passed on to the next generation of leaders. We are taking various approaches to ensure that the baton is passed on to those who will rise to lead the future of our Group.\n\nGovernance\n\n## Adjusted Net Income (normalized basis*)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor example, the Tokio Marine Group Leadership Institute (TLI) was launched in April 2023, and I am serving as the inaugural dean. TLI plays a central position in group management leadership development. With a commitment from our global management team and drawing on their collective wisdom, we aim to develop a talent pool with competitive strength in the global market, while handing down the true understanding of our business purposes.\n\nFoundational to our unique strengths are \u02a0human capital\u02a1 and \u02a0intellectual capital.\u02a1 We will continue to invigorate them to develop better talent and culture, and pass them on to the next generation. In addition, we will join forces with various external partners to create social values through which we continue to expand our purposeful business propositions. Details of those initiatives are outlined in the sections from the CHRO (from p. 60) and CDO (from p. 64).\n\n## \u02a0Our Long-Term Aspiration for 2035\u02a1 and the 2026 Mid-Term Business Plan -Inspiring confidence. Accelerating progress.-\n\nOur unique strengths support our business performance, but the pace of change in the business environment is accelerating. Recognizing this as a once-in-a-hundred-year tipping point, we have a strong sense of urgency that a mere extension of existing initiatives will not be enough to respond to further changes.\n\nThe world is uncertain and full of increasingly complex societal issues that we must face. Against this backdrop, our new Mid-Term Business Plan\u0336\u02a0Inspiring confidence. Accelerating progress.\u02a1\u0336was launched in April 2024.\n\nIn preparing the plan, we imagined the future in about 10 years. We discussed the vision we wish to achieve, that is, \u02a0our long-term aspiration 2035,\u02a1 incorporating the opinions of younger employees who will support Tokio Marine in the future as well as those of external experts.\n\nThrough this exercise, we identified that while insurance is our core in protecting customers and society \u02a0in their times of need,\u02a1 we must take further steps to become the partner that \u02a0always\u02a1 supports our stakeholders with solutions for \u02a0Prevention and Recovery\u02a1 of loss and even beyond for \u02a0Well-being.\u02a1 This realization of the value creation cycle is what we aspire to.\n\nStrengthening, Human,\n\nIntellectual, and Social Capital",

        "page_content": "Toward this long-term aspiration and as one of the Mid-Term Business Plan\u029fs key strategies, we are mobilizing initiatives to develop and commercialize solutions beyond insurance.\n\nFor example, in the area of disaster prevention and mitigation, solutions, such as the aforementioned response to Noto Peninsula earthquake, are already being implemented. We are also developing new solutions using the latest digital technologies, such as a 3D modeling tool that visually demonstrates expected damages from disasters or satellite data that allows quick and accurate assessment of damages in the affected areas.\n\nIn November 2023, we established Tokio Marine Resilience, a new company dedicated to businesses in this area. We aim to provide a wide range of comprehensive services, from the visualization of disaster risks to the implementation of disaster prevention measures, and to post-loss early recovery and for recurrence prevention support. The estimated market size is significant at more than 1 trillion yen, and we will proactively seize these opportunities. We wish to nurture it into the third pillar of income, after the \u02a0Japan and non-Japanese\u02a1 and \u02a0P&C and life insurance\u02a1 businesses, that drives several tens of billions of yen in profit.\n\nThis nonetheless does not change our key strategy for the Mid-Term Business Plan to further develop our core insurance business corresponding to increased societal issues and risks.\n\nOur management of business is ambidextrous, enhancing insurance and exploring solutions. As for our insurance business, we will sustainably achieve top-tier profit growth by leveraging our strengths from the globally diversified, strong underwriting portfolio, and superior investment returns from our liabilities profile.\n\nOur three-year KPI is to achieve world-class EPS growth at +8% or higher.* The insurance business can be said to be an \u02a0aggregation of local businesses\u02a1 composed of vastly different markets among countries and regions. We first focus on organically achieving top-tier profit growth by leveraging the unique strength in each country and region, such as Japan and the United States. Based on this, we will create a better global business portfolio as a Group through global risk diversification and disciplined capital management. As a result, we will control volatility while achieving a solid growth trajectory. We pride ourselves as a \u02a0growth stock,\u02a1 prioritizing the delta in profit growth, which might be rare in the financial services sector. As such, we must aim at the top-tier delta that matches the global peers. The \u02a0+8%\u02a1 target represents the management\u029fs commitment.\n\nWe will also continue to achieve the delta for dividends, which are the basis of our shareholder returns, and DPS growth consistent with the top-tier EPS growth. We will continue implementing management that aligns our purpose, strategies, and resulting profits, ensuring that they are consistent with our contributions to our stakeholders.\n\nOur ROE in fiscal 2026 is projected at 14%* or higher. This still leaves a room to expand when compared to our global peers. However, we will fully divest business-related equities holdings, which is the main cause of this gap. We have been reducing business-related equities for more than 20 years. Recently, the \u02a0six-year\u02a1 target was established as a deadline to complete the selling of business-related equities. While the cue to such a result is not what we expected, we are determined to see this through. Furthermore, we will increase our ROE level to match that of our peers by implementing our unwavering disciplined capital management, that is, rebalancing our portfolio with higher ROR business investments and risk taking.\n\n## \u25ef Our Long-term Aspiration 2035\n\nExpansion of issues/risks of customers and society\n\nNew issues/risks\n\nGrowth opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMobility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHealth\n\ncare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDisaster prevention/ mitigation\n\n\u02a0A Partner that continuously provides innovative solutions\u02a1 to the issues/ risks of our customers and society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCyber\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Issues/Risks are examples\n\nNew issues/risks Growth opportunities\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan Strengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\n## Enhancing Governance as the Foundation of Everything\n\nImplementing transparent governance is the prerequisite for realizing our aspirations and sustaining top-tier profit growth.\n\nWe take this opportunity to sincerely apologize again for any concerns caused to our stakeholders by the price-fixing misconduct at Tokio Marine & Nichido.\n\nThis was a significant incident that fundamentally undermined the trust of our customers\u0336the very basis of the insurance business.

However, some of our industry and company practices, such as business-related equity and cooperation in customer\u029fs business, have become incompatible with the social norms.\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido will eliminate such practices and comprehensively implement preventive measures. Furthermore, we will review and fully overhaul all business processes and models from a customer-oriented perspective and transform into a new company that customers truly trust and need. As Tokio Marine Holdings, we are determined to see this through.\n\nIn addition to the individual initiative by Tokio Marine & Nichido, we will strengthen internal control and governance on a Group basis. We believe it is particularly important to continually review whether the norms of the industry and the company have become incompatible with society and whether there are lessons to be learned from outside, with an impartial external perspective. Accordingly, we have been implementing various measures, such as deliberation by the Group Audit Committee, of which the majority of members, including the chairperson, are external members. Other measures include active recruitment of external experts and deployment of those experts across the Group companies.\n\nEverything we do depends on each employee doing the right thing under all circumstances. Whether everyone truly believes that the work to be done is valuable and wholeheartedly resonates with the company\u029fs purpose is critical for implementing this. Similar incidents should not occur if we can establish this basis.\n\nThis belief was renewed when I visited Kanazawa and Nanao soon after the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024.\n\nWe set up a task force immediately after the New Year\u029fs Day earthquake, and more than 2,000 employees from all over Japan headed to the disaster-affected areas. We applied our collective strength to accelerate claims payment to enable affected customers to start rebuilding their lives as soon as possible.\n\nWhat I observed were our employees fully devoted with a strong sense of mission to stand by our customers and local community in their times of need\u0336to deliver our promise and expedite claims settlement for their earliest recovery.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\nThe task force was filled with a sense of purpose and the firm conviction that our work and the company\u029fs business are valuable in serving society.\n\nThis is our culture and strength that have been handed down in the 150 years since our founding. My primary mission as the CEO and the Chief Culture Officer (CCO) is to further strengthen and deeply instill a culture, and nurture our people to pour their passion into fulfilling our purpose. I will continue to lead from the front.\n\n## \u25ef Visited the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake Task Force Headquarters (Kanazawa)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In Closing\n\nLastly, I would like to repeat my heartfelt gratitude to all of our shareholders and investors for the support that makes it possible for the Tokio Marine Group to continue its business activities\u0336thank you.\n\nAs I have stated above, we are at a once-in-a-hundred-year tipping point now, making everything uncertain. We are aware that we will be unable to grow merely by extending the status quo. This is why we will further diversify risks and accelerate growth. Capital unlocked by the sale of business-related equities will be invested to create future pillars of profit growth to realize our purpose. Our disciplined market-based capital management will remain unshaken.\n\nLooking back on the previous MTP period, various challenges occurred throughout the world. With a strong resolve to make something out of crises, we dealt with and overcame challenges, bringing together the power of the entire Group each time we faced difficulties. In that process, I think we steadily improved our underlying capabilities.\n\nWe understand that the current business environment is not easy at all; however, we will manage our business on the back of our strong business foundation and our abilities to overcome and to respond to difficulties. With a strong desire to achieve the top-tier EPS growth and to raise ROE in the next three years and beyond, we are still on our journey to \u02a0growth.\u02a1\n\nI want to keep the Company actively working for you and meet everyone\u029fs expectations in the process.\n\nI appreciate your continued support for the Tokio Marine Group.",

Accelerating progress.'\n\n2 Facing Societal Issues\n\nThe starting point of our purpose is to solve societal issues through insurance and solutions. Even in times of uncertainty and instability, we continue to provide protection in times of need, inspiring confidence and accelerating progress for our customers and society.\n\nIn recent years, it has been said that we\u029fve entered the VUCA age, characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, with numerous societal issues spreading and becoming more complicated. But it is precisely because of this that our business fields and opportunities continue to expand as our core business is taking on and managing risk.\n\nAmong those issues, improving disaster resilience, promoting climate action, and supporting healthy and spiritually rich living are among the most important for the world, and for our industry. Facing those societal issues and contributing to their solutions is how we fulfills its purpose, and with that in mind, those three challenges have been designated as critical societal issues. By facing them head on and providing protection in times of need for our customers and society, we will inspire confidence and accelerate progress.\n\n1VSQPTF 4UPSZ\n\n$apital Policy and\n\nStrategy and Business Platform Supporting Our Purpose Story\n\nStrengtIeningglyph<c=13,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold> )umanglyph<c=13,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold>\n\ntIe .idglyph<c=14,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold>5erm Business Plan Intellectualglyph<c=13,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold> and Social $apital\n\n## Improving Disaster Resilience\n\nFacing the threat of natural disasters head-on and contributing to disaster resilience to provide protection in their times of need is exactly what our purpose is.\n\nIn addition to strengthening our traditional insurance business, we are increasingly contributing to the resilience of society by expanding our solutions business including before and after insurance areas such as disaster prevention, mitigation, swift recovery, and recurrence prevention.\n\n## Promoting Climate Action\n\nThe intensification of natural disasters, as well as various other negative effects of climate change, jeopardize the safety and security of people\u029fs lives and threaten to hinder society\u029fs sustained development. Climate change is a societal issue of critical importance for the sustainability of the earth, and as an insurance provider, institutional investor, and global company, we will face this issue head-on and contribute to solutions.\n\nSustainaCility .anagement\n\n(oWernance\n\n'inancial and /onglyph<c=14,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold>'inancial %ata\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pp. 14-21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pp. 22-25\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting Healthy and Spiritually Rich Living\n\nIn the era of 100-year life spans, issues such as extending healthy life expectancy and avoiding asset depletion have become urgent real-world concerns.\n\nWe will support the era of 100-year life spans through its integrated life and non-life insurance coverage, as well as by providing high-value-added products and services and company health management support.\n\nSee pp. 26, 27\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to strengthening our insurance business, we are increasingly contributing to the resilience of society by expanding our solutions business including the prevention/recovery fields.\n\n## Environmental Awareness\n\nEconomic losses due to natural disasters such as hurricanes, typhoons, torrential rains, and earthquakes remain high. Recently, a large earthquake occurred in Japan\u029fs Noto Peninsula. Seconday perils, such as wildfires\u0336which have caused severe damage in Hawaii\u0336heavy rains and hailstorms are occurring frequently all over the world and have become a serious threat for local populations. Secondary perils are occurring frequently all over the world and have become a serious threat to local populations. On the other hand, in fiscal 2023 losses not covered by insurance\u0336the protection gap\u0336 rose to 69%. Narrowing this gap is critical to improving\n\ndisaster resilience. Of course, it is best if disaster-related damage can be prevented from happening in the first place. And even if disasters do occur, the smaller the damage and the faster the recovery, the better. Preventing recurrence is also desirable. From this perspective, it is important to not only provide insurance but also expand solutions that grant peace of mind before and after damages occur, such as disaster prevention, mitigation, fast recovery, and recurrence prevention. Such initiatives should be promoted not only by insurance companies but also related businesses, government offices, and local communities.\n\n## \u25ef Global Economic Loss Trends\n\n## \u25ef Protection Gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: 2024 Weather, Climate and Catastrophe Insight, Aon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: 2024 Weather, Climate and Catastrophe Insight, Aon\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, the reduction of incurred insurance payments and lowered loss ratio make it possible to reduce insurance premiums even while maintaining appropriate margins, leading to wider insurance adoption.\n\nThus, both directly and indirectly, our economic value\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwill increase. We hope to build a world where these associated value creation processes can be realized.\n\nOn the following pages, in addition to examples of initiatives related to our strengthening its insurance business and expanding its solution business (shown in green), we will detail the social value (orange area) created by these initiatives.\n\nsupport before and after incidents occur, such as decreasing and avoiding damage due to natural disasters as well as fast recovery and recurrence prevention.

The associated amount of risk is tremendous, but we will continue to stably provide appropriate coverage at realistic rates. To always be able to support our customers and society in their times of need, thorough initiatives for improved profitability are required. In Tokio Marine Nichido\u029fs (TMNF) market of Japan, a country prone to natural disasters, the relative volume of fire insurance is\n\nlarge, and in addition to improving its business efficiency (through measures such as cost reductions), the company is promoting flexible rates, product revisions, and optimization of reinsurance. The company achieved profitability in fiscal 2023, and by continually making more comprehensive and thorough efforts to improve profitability will achieve the current mid-term management plan goal of securing ROR above 7% and continue to stably provide appropriate coverage to protect customers from natural disasters.\n\n## (Reference) Specific Initiatives at TMNF\n\nIncreased business efficiency\n\nBottom-line focus initiatives\n\nOptimization of reinsurance\n\nRate and product revision (fire insurance)\n\nWe are working to improve business efficiency through means such as digital utilization to reduce clerical workloads and the use of generative AI as part of its continual efforts to provide stable insurance coverage.\n\nStrict profitability management is being thoroughly implemented through the Re-New initiative of stricter underwriting for low-profit contracts and improved underwriting conditions (see p. 130).\n\nReinsurance premium rates remain high due to the intensification of natural disasters. Naturally, we are implementing agile cycle management, with the Global Reinsurance Team, primarily in Tokyo and London, working together to carry out negotiations. While displaying the bargaining power of the entire group, by transparently communicating the high profitability and superiority of primary insurance to reinsurers, we have been able to suppress an insurance premiums increase.\n\nSince fiscal 2019, we have been continuously revising our fire insurance premium rates and products, achieving profitability in fiscal 2023. But due to the significant amount of risk from large-scale natural disasters, we have not yet achieved ROR above 7%. In October 2024, therefore, we will carry out further rate and product revisions with the goal of profitability improvement.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\n## Specific Initiatives (solution business)\n\nTo always be ready to support our customers and society in their times of need, not only insurance but also the development and provision of solutions connected to peace of mind before and after incidents, such as disaster prevention, mitigation, swift recovery, recurrence prevention, is essential. In November 2023, we established a new company, Tokio Marine Resilience. With the goal of being a comprehensive disaster prevention and mitigation business, we are promoting initiatives in the fields of\n\npre-incident disaster prevention and post-incident recovery and mitigation. In addtion, we are refining our solution development capabilities and sequentially beginning to provide new services, not only by utilizing Tokio Marine Holdings\u029f own in-company human and intellectual capital of the know-how, data, and technology accumulated through our insurance business, but also by utilizing social capital co-created with partners such as the disaster prevention consortium CORE.\n\n## (Reference) Specific Solutions and Initiatives\n\n## Resilient Information Distribution Service (from July 2023)\n\n- \u25cf Distribution of a wide range of weather and disaster information (e.g., rain mudslides, earthquakes, snow, hail)\n- \u25cf Alerts issued when risk reaches high level at registered location points\n\n## Supply Chain Risk Visualization (from January 2024)\n\n- \u25cf Supply chain risk management system for visualizing risks, conducting emergency and peacetime simulations and formulating recovery plans for the development of resilient supply chains (collaboration with Fujitsu)\n\n## Countermeasure implementation package (from May 2024)\n\n- \u25cf A total of 35 services maintained in coordination with external partners.

As a result, it will increase our economic value and, by extension, increase our corporate value. With that in mind, from fiscal 2024, we are making great efforts to quantitatively visualize the previously outlined societal value created by the provision of insurance and solutions connected to disaster resilience.\n\nFor example, TMNF and Tokio Marine dR (TdR) provide a loss prevention service. This is a service that contributes to disaster prevention and mitigation for client companies bearing diversified complex risks by providing expert\n\nadvice and effective solutions for accident reduction and preventive measures based on scientific evidence in fields such as ergonomics and safety engineering. By providing this service, for example, when a large-scale natural disaster occurs, the creation of social value for our customers, such as reducing the period of business suspension thanks to pre-incident countermeasures and reducing the extent of damage through property protection leading to swift recovery, should be taking place, and we are currently progressing with quantifying these values with the use of third-party checks.\n\nOf course, services provided in the disaster resilience field are not only pre-loss services. As shown on p. 19, there are also services such as our Supply Chain Risk Visualization, a countermeasure implementation package, a liquefaction damage mitigation countermeasure, and earthquake resistance and seismic isolation design services. Moreover, we offer other services too numerous to list in this integrated report, in addition to new services\n\n## \u25ef What We Hope to Achieve through Quantification Efforts\n\nCustomers, society, and agents\n\nCompany employees\n\nShareholders\n\n- \u25cf Convey the social value we provide (utility for customers and society) and earn further support for us. Have them become partners with whom we jointly promote the resolution of societal issues.\n- \u25cf Instill an understanding of just how much social value the work we carry out has, and its connection to resulting increases in economic value by serving a purpose, leading to increased employee energy and enthusiasm.\n- \u25cf Achieve improvements in all services through verification of social value through running a PDCA cycle.\n- \u25cf By showing the social value created by our business operations and its connection to economic value, enrich dialogue and improve corporate value while creating the world we aspire to.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability Management\n\nfor which development is progressing. As another example of how we are contributing to improved disaster resilience, in the United States, PHLY is expanding PHLY Sense, its program of distributing and utilizing temperature/humidity sensors to prevent freezing and other accidents, and we are accelerating our disaster resilience contribution efforts elsewhere around the world.\n\nIn the future, in addition to these services, we hope to be able to comprehensively calculate the social value of all products and services that we provide, such as the value of business continuity and recovery made possible through insurance claim payments. However, in truth, there are\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmany difficulties in this, such as the difficulty of selecting and sorting appropriate data, or a lack of sufficient data due to new services being introduced one after another. Although it will not be easy, through these quantification efforts, we will conduct business while being conscious of both the social value we offer to society and our customers, and of Tokio Marine Holdings\u029f improved economic value resulting from serving them.  We aim to work with various stakeholders toward this value expansion and growth.\n\n1\n\nQuantifying social value\n\nRunning this cycle to improve our corporate value\n\n2\n\nExpanding and improving initiatives to resolve societal issues\n\n3\n\nStakeholder dialogue",

GCube has expanded its business since the 1990s, during the early days of the renewable energy market. Today, we are a leading company in the renewable energy sector, with eight of the world\u029fs top 10 renewable energy companies as clients, and insuring more than 2,000 projects in 38 countries, making our knowledge and data a true strength for us. We engage with more than 200 major clients that account for approximately 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our insurance underwriting and provide proposals and support to help them resolve issues related to decarbonization. In addition to these\n\ninsurance-related initiatives, we established a preparatory company in February 2024 to develop and provide decarbonization-related solutions. We will continue to contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society by providing decarbonization management support services and other activities primarily to small and medium-sized businesses in Japan. As an institutional investor, we continuously engage in dialogue with the companies we invest in on environmental themes and implement ESG integration that takes non-financial information into consideration when making decisions on loans and investments. We are also promoting our sustainability-themed investments and impact investments, with total investments and loans of 138 billion yen and 29 billion yen, respectively, as of the end of March 2024.\n\nAs a global company, we have reduced greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions* 1 associated with our business activities by 32% from fiscal 2015 levels (actual figures from FY2022; FY2030 target: 60%) using renewable energy for the electricity we use, conversion of company-owned vehicles to electric vehicles, and reduction of utility costs at our bases in each country. We are also steadily expanding the amount of GHG absorption and fixed carbon through mangrove reforestation, an effort we have been engaged in since 1999. As a result, we have achieved carbon neutrality for 11 consecutive years.\n\nThrough the initiatives outlined above and by supporting the transition of our business partners, we\n\naim to achieve virtually zero CO2 emissions* 1 by FY2050, including for our insurance customers and investment and financing recipients. On the other hand, the global and historic human challenge of climate change cannot be completely resolved by the efforts of a single corporate group centered on our in-house activities. It requires a concerted effort by the international community. Since the company\u029fs founding, we have participated in various international climate-related initiatives, such as the TCFD, and have conducted surveys, research, and advocacy activities. By actively leading the debate on a decarbonized society, we will continue our efforts to achieve decarbonization on a global scale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 1 (Our company) Scope 1 (direct emissions) + Scope 2 (indirect emissions) + Scope 3 (other indirect emissions, Categories 1, 3, 5, and 6) based on the GHG Protocol, the standard for calculating greenhouse gas emissions (Insurance customers/investment and financing recipients) Scope 3, Category 15, based on the greenhouse gas emission calculation standard GHG Protocol\n- \u25cf We aim to achieve virtually zero greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions by FY2050, including for our insurance customers and investment and financing recipients* 1\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will support the age of a 100-year life expectancy by providing highvalue-added products and services through the integration of life and non-life insurance.\n\n## Environmental Awareness\n\nIn Japan, where the birth rate is declining and the population is aging at an unprecedented rate, and for which the population is entering a new era of a 100-year life expectancy, the risk of living with an illness or running out of financial assets before one\u029fs life span expires is also increasing. The number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and stroke is also on the rise, resulting in an increased burden of national healthcare costs. The gap between average life expectancy and\n\n## Specific Initiatives\n\nWith respect to \u02a0extending healthy life expectancy\u02a1 and \u02a0avoiding the depletion of assets,\u02a1 we support long and healthy lives through the provision of novel products and services that precisely meet customers\u029f needs. In August 2023, we launched \u02a0Anshin Treatment Support Insurance,\u02a1 a product that provides comprehensive support for the promotion of customers\u029f health by offering a wide range of coverage for eight lifestyle-related diseases, including coverage for outpatient treatment, support for early detection and early treatment with a special clause for early treatment support that pays benefits for a second medical checkup, and a service that simulates the risk of developing diabetes and other diseases.\n\nIn October 2024, we will launch \u02a0Health Assist Insurance,\u02a1 which promotes early detection and early treatment of diseases through the recommendation of secondary medical examinations to company employees. By offering these products in addition to existing products that cover post-onset of diseases such as group long-term disability insurance as well as medical insurance and cancer insurance, we will continue to strengthen our efforts to ensure that employees of our client companies are able to work vigorously and healthily. We are also committed to providing health management support that utilizes our own in-house know-how on health management. We support apporximatley 2000 companies each year in thier efforts to be certified as \u02a0excellent health management corporations\u02a1 and promote health management of our client companies. We are able to do this by leveraging our knowledge and track record as a \u02a0health management brand.\u02a1\n\nhealthy life expectancy can be as much as 10 years. Amid a growing need for asset building to achieve a comfortable retirement, \u02a0extending healthy life expectancy\u02a1 and \u02a0avoiding the depletion of assets\u02a1 have become important societal issues.\n\nIn addition, with Japan\u029fs declining birth rate coupled with a growing labor shortage, the importance of \u02a0health management,\u02a1 in which companies support their employees so that they can work in good mental and physical health, is also increasing.\n\nWe aim to provide not only insurance but also solutions, and in April 2023, we established a preparatory company that focuses on the healthcare sector with a view to developing business focused on pre-symptomatic diseases and prevention, based on our affinity with the insurance business and our company\u029fs purpose.\n\nFor example, we will continue to provide new value to society by contributing to the well-being management of companies and organizations through the creation of an ecosystem for improving health, starting with health checkups, and through the utilization of accumulated health data.\n\nWe are also working to provide value not only internally but also through co-creation with social capital (external partners) and through Whitehealthcare Inc. established in July 2020 as a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation. Through this JV, we provide consulting and various support services utilizing data analysis for corporate health insurance association, local governments, and regional medical institutions. We have been steadily expanding our efforts to achieve both health promotion and optimization of medical costs.\n\nThrough these initiatives, we aim to contribute to overcoming the challenges facing Japan such as a declining birth rate and an aging society. And by refining such solutions, we will accumulate know-how domestically and, in the future, expand our initiatives outside of Japan to support other countries that might be facing the same challenges we are.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accelerating progress.'\n\n3 Driving Force\uff5cGlobal Risk Diversification\n\n## Global Risk Diversification\n\nAs an insurance business that underwrites risks all over the world, global risk diversification is the cornerstone of our strategy to achieve business management that would remain unshaken whatever situations we face.\n\nUnderpinning this strategy are our abilities to execute M&As and PMI and to manage our portfolio.\n\nI have previously served as the CFO of TMHCC and the CEO of TMK, and since April of this year, I have been leading the entire international business as the Co-Head of International Business at Tokio Marine Holdings. In this context, I would like to explain our cornerstone, the \u02a0global risk diversification strategy,\u02a1 while also sharing my personal experiences and thoughts.\n\nDeveloping our business globally is core to our aspiration to Inspire Confidence. Accelerate Progress. We exist to serve our customers, people, and society and bring solutions that address their needs for safety, security, and confidence in an increasingly volatile world. For me personally, successful companies will have a keen understanding of those needs through a diverse group of companies and employees able to address them today and as they evolve into the future. A favorite part of my role is communicating this aspiration to our people around the world regularly and visibly. I personally believe the combination of the connection of our people to the strong and unique cultures within our Group companies together with a clear sense of belonging to a global business with a sense of purpose and cultural direction is powerful. I intend to support and strengthen these complementary cultural identities in my role as Co-Head of International Business.\n\n## Risk Diversification Using M&A\n\nThe purpose of insurance is to assume the risks of our customers so they can operate with confidence, and our responsibility is to manage those risks within our appetite and tolerances. \u02a0Risk diversification\u02a1 is a key component of our risk management strategy and an area where M&A can be an effective tool. Over the past 20 years, through overseas M&A and other initiatives, we have expanded our international insurance business, which was designed to build new sources of long-term profitability that did not correlate with our\n\n## \u25ef Effect of Risk Diversification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJapanese business, notably natural disasters in Japan. We have achieved geographical, business, and product diversification. Through this \u02a0global risk diversification\u02a1 strategy, we have controlled the amount of risk we retain, reduced volatility, and achieved sustainable profit growth.\n\nAs a result, even in years plagued by large-scale natural catastrophes or the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to keep the impact of these events on our business results below 30%.\n\nFY2024 Diversification effect\n\n43 %\n\n\u25a0 Japan P&C (Underwriting)\n\n\u25a0 Japan P&C (Investment)\n\n\u25a0 Japan Life\n\n\u25a0 International\n\n\u25a0 Others\n\nPost-diversification risk capital\n\n4.3trillion yen\n\nFY2014 Diversification effect\n\n29 %\n\nPost-diversification risk capital 3.1trillion yen\n\n*The amount of risk excluding cross-shareholdings is 5.9 trillion yen before diversification and 3.1 trillion yen after diversification.\n\n## Stringent Acquisition Guidelines Emphasizing Cultural Fit\n\nFor our company, M&A is a \u02a0method\u02a1 to achieve \u02a0global risk diversification\u02a1 rather than a \u02a0goal\u02a1 in itself. We adhere to \u02a0three principles\u02a1 and execute them with discipline: (1) alignment/fit of culture and management values, (2) consistent, best-in-class profitability, and (3) a unique and robust business model to ensure sustainability. Among these, we consider cultural fit to be the most critical gating item.\n\nWe have a market intelligence (MI) function internally that we use to identify deals from various sources. We discuss and scrutinize identified acquisition candidates in the IEC\n\n(International Executive Committee), which is composed of group management members. These high-level discussions consider quantitative qualities and economics while using our collective experience and MI to assess cultural fit, business model, and likelihood of deal execution. Candidates passing these high-level checks and where management is open to a discussion go through in-depth, face-to-face discussions with us. During these discussions, both parties must be able to confirm the alignment of management direction and chemistry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManaging Executive Officer\n\nCo-Head of International Business\n\nBrad Irick\n\n1VSQPTF 4UPSZ\n\n$apital Policy and tIe .idglyph<c=14,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold>5erm Business Plan\n\nStrengtIeningglyph<c=13,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold> )umanglyph<c=13,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold> Intellectualglyph<c=13,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold> and Social $apital\n\nSustainaCility .anagement\n\n## \u25ef Stringent Acquisition Guidelines\n\nHigh\u00a0profitability\n\n## Cultural\u00a0fit\n\nStrong\u00a0business\u00a0model\n\nTarget (three\u00a0principles of\u00a0M&A)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Oversight Respecting the Autonomy and High Growth of Target Companies\n\nThe ROI of our large-scale M&As executed so far is a high 21.5%, and I believe it is fair to say that we have \u02a0accumulated successes.\u02a1 In addition to the \u02a0stringent acquisition guidelines emphasizing cultural fit\u02a1 that I previously explained, another important factor has been our management approach that respects the autonomy of the acquired companies, our so-called Federated Model. By acquiring companies with strong business models and respecting their autonomy to fully leverage their inherent strengths, we have enabled further growth even after they\n\njoin our group. This accumulation of successes and reputation has led to subsequent high-quality M&A and a recognition within the deal community that Tokio Marine and its Group companies are highly credible buyers with the skill and knowledge to execute deals professionally. I\u029fve experienced this directly in my days as CFO of TMHCC, CEO of TMK, and now in my new role as Co-Head of International Business. I am confident that we can continue this successful approach and further accelerate our profitable growth around the world well into the future.\n\n## Forward-Looking Business Divestments\n\nOur company not only \u02a0acquires\u02a1 businesses but also proactively engages in \u02a0divesting,\u02a1 deploying the capital and funds generated from these divestments into our remaining businesses either through future acquisitions or investments in organic growth. This approach diversifies risk, manages the volatility of our results, and fosters business growth. It is also healthy to evaluate businesses over time for their fit within the overall portfolio as this can change due to market events or changes in appetite.\n\nDuring my tenure as CFO at TMHCC and then CEO of TMK, I actively engaged in both numerous bolt-on M&As and dynamically executed portfolio rebalancing through divestments and run-offs. One example of this is the sale of Highland Insurance Solutions in 2022. Highland Insurance Solutions was an insurance agency in the United States that handled construction insurance, which was highly\n\n## Closing\n\nOur M&A track record and reputation give us the confidence to know we will have a seat at the table for high-quality M&A opportunities when they emerge, which is a unique strength that other companies cannot easily replicate. By incorporating \u02a0good companies\u02a1 that have minimal overlap in customer base and products and low risk correlation, we simultaneously achieve risk diversification and business growth. Conversely, we divest businesses that we determine will not contribute to\n\ndiversification and/or growth going forward, reallocating the capital and funds to businesses that will further contribute to diversification and stable profit growth. By dligently managing our portfolio in this disciplined way, and evolving our approach in response to environmental changes, we steadily advance our \u02a0global risk diversification\u02a1 strategy. This enables us to control the amount of risk while aiming for sustainable growth and improving the capital efficiency of the entire company.\n\nsusceptible to natural disasters and subject to revenue and profit volatility. We decided there were other lines of business that more consistently met our return expectations and would fit better with our efforts to diversify the overall portfolio, which had a high concentration of U.S. CAT-exposed business. At the same time, Highland was a solid business, and we expected and ultimately found that other insurers found value and a better fit within their organizations\u0336a win/win for TMK, Highland, and the acquiring company. This was a key part of the portfolio reform I led at TMK that ultimately resulted in higher overall profitability at TMK and less volatility to those results.\n\nThe outlook and environmental recognition for current M&A activities are commented on in the CFO\u029fs message (see p. 49 for details) regarding our company\u029fs policy.\n\n(oWernance\n\n'inancial and /onglyph<c=14,font=/ZFAHGE+ToppanBunkyuMidashiGothicStdN-ExtraBold>'inancial %ata\n\n<!-- image -->",

We acquire companies with cultures that match our own, but by carrying out PMI while respecting the unique culture and autonomy of the acquired companies, our employees become more engaged and motivated without leaving the company. This leads to continual high scores on the Culture & Value Survey (see p. 125 for details). Beyond\n\nadding the top management of acquired companies to the head office management team, we provide opportunities for motivated individuals to play a role in the management of the Group as a whole through participation in the Global Committee, as well as in their own roles at their own companies. We are now in the ninth year of such integrated group management, and it continues to evolve and become a unique strength of the company, with the addition of overseas directors and the enhancement of the Global Committee.\n\nOptimized allocation of our talented workforce globally to strengthen integrated group management\n\nBy increasing the number of overseas officers and the appointment of chief officers, we will bring together global insight to decide upon and execute important management matters.\n\nDonald Sherman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVice President Executive Officer Co-CIO\n\nSteady Succession\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristopher Williams\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCo-Head of International Business (up to March 2024)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBrad Irick\n\nManaging Executive Officer Co-Head of International Business\n\nContinued support of international business as Chairman of International Business.\n\n## Executive Officers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTMSR\n\nJos\u00e9 Adalberto Ferrara\n\nPHLY\n\nJohn Glomb\n\nSusan Rivera Managing Executive Officer Co-CRSO\n\nGroup CDIO\n\nCaryn Angelson\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAppointment of Joint Group Leaders\n\nLeverage Group Expertise\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability Management\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steady Succession and Development of the Next Generation of Management Talent\n\nOur integrated group management will not be discontinued in the so-called \u02a0first generation.\u02a1 Developing the next generation of management talent and passing the baton is important, and we are executing this with great care. Specifically, we established the Tokio Marine Group Leadership Institute (TLI) in April 2023, and the Group CEO was appointed as its first president (see p. 62 for details). TLI is positioned as a central hub for the development of group management leaders, and our domestic and international management teams are\n\ncommitted to collecting wisdom from around the world to develop human resources that are highly competitive in the global marketplace. TLI\u029fs mission is not limited to training but also serves as the cornerstone of the human resource development organization, linking recruitment, capacity development, evaluation, and placement throughout the entire Group, while aiming to produce a stable and continuous stream of human resources who will be responsible for the next generation of integrated group management.\n\n## The talent that contributes to global integrated group management at the TMHCC and at the Group level\n\nThe drive to improve and elevate management quality is an important theme for any company or group, regardless of time or place.\n\nAt Tokio Marine HCC (TMHCC), we have strengthened our management and enhanced its quality through the contributions of talent that has joined us over the years through acquisition, new greenfield operations, or other. These talents are now playing roles not only within TMHCC but also across the Tokio Marine Group. We genuinely feel that we are helping advance and progress the operating performance of the entire Group by playing an integral part in our \u02a0global integrated group management.\u02a1\n\nFor example, former CEO of TMHCC, Chris Williams, has been leading the international business as the Co-Head of International Business. Brad Irick, who took over this position in April, transitioned from being the CFO of TMHCC to the CEO of Tokio Marine Kiln, contributing to the company\u029fs transformation and profit improvement. Randy Rinicella, as Deputy CLCO, Barry Cook, as Deputy CRSO, and Dawn Miller, as Deputy CAO, are also utilizing their accumulated expertise at the Group level.\n\nI, myself, have been appointed as the Co-CRSO, and I am excited and challenged by the opportunity to make significant contributions not only within TMHCC but also globally at the Group level. It is truly rewarding.\n\nThe learning and know-how we have cultivated as a global leader in specialty insurance are being widely disseminated within the Group, creating synergies and advancing best practices. For example, TMHCC\u029fs expertise in bolt-on acquisitions has been standardized by Tokio Marine Holdings and applied as guidelines to other Group companies. This can indeed be called an \u02a0accumulation of global insights.\u02a1\n\nMoving forward, we aim to support and contribute to the evolution of our \u02a0global integrated group management,\u02a1 achieving further growth as both TMHCC and the Tokio Marine Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManaging Executive Officer Co-CRSO CEO of TMHCC Insurance Holdings, Inc.\n\n## Susan Rivera",

The results of these efforts take the form of Group synergy in the four areas of revenue (premium growth), investment (investment income growth), capita (optimization of in-force ceded reinsurance), and cost (cost reduction), resulting in an annual profit contribution of approximately $620 million. If this profit were to be realized through acquisitions, assuming an average PER of 12x for North American P&C, the simple calculation would be to acquire a company worth in excess of 1 trillion yen. We have realized this significant value at \u02a0no additional cost,\u02a1 and this is one of our strengths that we intend to continue to develop in the future.\n\n## Group synergies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExamples of synergies include not only the expansion of cross-selling (revenue) by utilizing a diversified product lineup and global sales network but also the expansion of investment income (investment) by outsourcing asset management to DFG, which has advanced expertise in asset management; the optimization of in-force ceded reinsurance (capital) including the utilization of underwriting capacity; and the joint purchase of systems (cost). For example, revenue synergies have increased to approximately $900 million on an underwriting premium basis.\n\nOur Group synergy, which is one of our unique strengths, has been steadily expanding as a result of our integrated group management, and we will further accelerate it in the future to raise the level of the entire Group.\n\n## Example of revenue synergies\n\n## Cross-Selling\n\nCross-sell\u00a0to\u00a0customers\u00a0in\u00a0other\u00a0Group entities\n\nLateral\u00a0expansion\u00a0of\u00a0specialty\u00a0products\n\nRegional Expansion\n\nLeverage\u00a0Group\u00a0capital,\u00a0intellectual/ human\u00a0capital,\u00a0and\u00a0network\n\nStrategic\u00a0Use\u00a0of Group\u00a0Assets\n\nJoint\u00a0approach\u00a0for\u00a0mega-events\u00a0and large\u00a0corporations\n\nJoint\u00a0Approach\n\n## Revenue synergy (DWP)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *: DWP rose year on year excluding the impact of the loss of synergy from specific projects due to the sale of Highland in 2022 (see p. 29).\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability Management\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u02a0Corporate Culture\u02a1 Supporting Integrated Group Management\n\nAnother important key to promoting integrated group management is the development of a corporate culture that supports the realization of the purpose.

At our company, the Group CEO takes the lead as the Group Chief Culture Officer (CCO) in our efforts to spread the purpose.

We also hold \u02a0Majikirakai\u02a1 meetings, where serious discussions transcending divisions and positions can be held in a relaxed and casual manner.

Our internal control is based on the \u02a0Basic Policy for Internal Control\u02a1, which covers areas such as business management, compliance, risk management, internal audit, and audit by the Audit & Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we have monitored the operating status and continuous implementation of the internal control system, and the Board of Directors have confirmed the status based on the report and recommendations from the Internal Control Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nHowever, in response to incidents at domestic group companies such as price-fixing of corporate insurance premiums and governance-related incidents at overseas group companies, we have determined that it is necessary to further strengthen our internal control system and our internal audit functions. The new \u02a0Group Audit Committee\u02a1, which will be established on April 1 st , 2024, will bring in external perspectives to strengthen the supervisory function of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to our company\u029fs internal members, Haruka Matsuyama, an independent director of our Company, is appointed as the chairperson of the \u02a0Group Audit Committee\u02a1. The committee will examine the business processes and culture of Tokio Marine Holdings, as well as that of our group companies, from an external perspective independent from company management. This will include identification of discrepancies from cultural norms in society.\n\nThe existing \u02a0Internal Control Committee\u02a1 has focused on deliberations regarding the internal control system as a whole. The Group Audit Committee will expand the scope of deliberations to individual incidents. The committee will confirm the appropriateness of each group company's preventative measures and consider the need for preventive actions at other group companies and any necessary action at the group level.\n\nAt Group Audit Committee meetings held in May and July, lively discussions were held on the Tokio Marine Group\u029fs governance issues and appropriate measures from an external perspective. These discussions were based on specific themes, such as the \u02a0reexamination of common sense\u02a1 to identify gaps with common sense in society in terms of business processes and cultures; learning from other companies\u029f cases to \u02a0draw a lesson\u02a1; and the sharing of learning from cases at individual companies within the Group.\n\nAs for the \u02a0reexamination of common sense,\u02a1 based on the analysis of employees\u029f comments on the corporate culture published in career change websites and the results of interviews with mid-career employees of TMNF, we examined the corporate culture and business model, including relationships with agencies, from an external perspective as well, and discussed issues in the Tokio Marine Group\u029fs business processes. In addition, we will analyze misconduct that has occurred at other companies and in other industries, which will \u02a0draw a lesson,\u02a1 and discuss the impact if the same thing was to happen in the Tokio Marine Group and the status of our response. This will lead to the further strengthening of the internal control system and governance on a Group basis. Individual themes include IT governance and risk management for high-risk legacy system replacement projects, and measures to strengthen communication between overseas subsidiaries and the headquarters.\n\nIn the future, we will continue to examine these issues from the perspective of group management more broadly and continuously through discussions and deliberations by the Group Audit Committee. We will further strengthen and enhance our internal control system and internal audit function to take proactive measures. With both governance and execution, we will strive to spread the company\u029fs purpose, build a system to understand risks, and foster a risk culture to achieve a good balance between growth and governance.\n\nWe will work together as one to restore the trust of our customers and all other members of society and to enhance our corporate value.\n\n(Reference) pp. 98-101 Contribution of the Board of Directors to Governance Issues and the Essentials of Global Management p. 118 Internal Control System\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u25ef Issue Analysis and Actions as TMHD\n\n## Issue Analysis of Incidents from a Group Management Perspective\n\n| TMHD Involvement in Group Company Operations       | \u25cf   The expansion and diversification of our global business has potentially led to a variance  in the implementation of internal controls in each business.

However, the business environment surrounding us is undergoing rapid changes, and our operations could be more significantly impacted than ever before. In this context, particularly from the perspective of \u02a0growth,\u02a1 there was a concern that continuing with existing strategies and initiatives might not adequately address future environmental changes. Therefore, in developing the new Mid-Term Business Plan, we adopted a backcasting approach.\n\nIn concrete terms, we analyzed medium- to long-term changes in the business environment and, based on that analysis, envisioned \u02a0Our Long-term Aspiration 2035\u02a1 for the Tokio Marine Group. We then examined what actions are necessary over the next three years to achieve that vision and developed our plan accordingly. In addition, we considered which issues need to be prioritized in the current context and identified further strengthening of discipline as one of the key strategies for the new Mid-Term Business Plan.

Moreover, there are growing opportunities and needs for new solutions and coverage for emerging societal issues and risks. To continue fulfilling our purpose in this\n\nchanging landscape, we must diversify our revenue sources further to achieve growth beyond our previous trajectory while also strengthening governance at the Group level. Recognizing the need to balance growth and governance at a high level, we have established \u02a0growth\u02a1 and \u02a0discipline\u02a1 as the central pillars of our major strategies in the new MTP.\n\n## \u02a03 Pillars\u02a1 of \u02a0Growth\u02a1\n\nGiven the rapidly changing business environment, we aim to achieve sustainable profit growth by (1) dramatically expanding the domains where we deliver our value, (2) providing this value through a highly specialized and diverse distribution model to ensure we are chosen by customers, and (3) extensively improving productivity.\n\n## (1) Drastic expansion of domains where we can deliver our value\n\n- \u25cf Accurately analyze customer risks and needs and develop and provide optimal insurance products while also creating and offering new solutions beyond insurance (pp. 18, 19)\n\n## (2) Diversification of distribution model\n\n- \u25cf Expand and develop a highly specialized sales system\n- \u25cf Build new direct models and expand initiatives such as embedded insurance that meet customer needs\n\n## (3) Extensive improvement of productivity\n\n- \u25cf Develop a highly productive sales model utilizing digital tools and AI\n- \u25cf Reduce costs and optimize operations\n\n## \u02a02 Pillars\u02a1 of \u02a0Discipline\u02a1\n\nBased on the series of incidents that occurred during the previous MTP, we will strengthen our internal controls and governance at the Group level while continuing to enhance disciplined management of our business portfolio and capital.\n\n## (1) Strengthening and improvement of internal controls/governance\n\n- \u25cf Further utilize external perspectives on internal controls and governance\n- \u25cf Recruit and bolster experts for implementing governance improvements\n- \u25cf Promote the consolidation of headquarters functions across domestic Group companies\n- \u25cf Strengthen internal control functions at overseas Group companies based on their maturity level, and advance Group-wide support through consolidation of common functions and personnel deployment, etc.\n\n## (2) Enhancement of business portfolio and capital management\n\n- \u25cf Strengthen disciplined underwriting, including rate and product revisions, and enhance reinsurance policies\n- \u25cf Continuously review existing businesses and execute disciplined \u02a0In/Out\u02a1 strategies (p. 57)\n\nPurpose Story\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KPI Targets under the New MTP* 1\n\nNext, I will outline the quantitative goals and KPI targets for the new MTP. We have consistently achieved top-tier EPS growth while managing volatility, and we will continue this through the implementation of our \u02a0Group Core Strategies\u02a1 and \u02a0Group Major Strategies\u02a1 under the plan. Specifically, the EPS growth target of the plan is a CAGR of +8% or more, excluding gains from the sale of business-related equities, which we continue to recognize as world top tier. 8% EPS growth will be driven by a CAGR of +7% or more profit growth with an additional +1-2% from share buybacks. Furthermore, the target for adjusted ROE in fiscal 2026is set at 14% or more, excluding gains from the sale of business-related equities.\n\nThe drivers of our growth remain unchanged: a globally diversified and robust underwriting portfolio and strong investment returns leveraging its predictable insurance cashflows (AUM) which together constitute a solid basis for organic growth. Specifically, for the Japan P&C business, we plan for a CAGR of +5% or more through improvements in auto and fire insurance profitability, expansion of specialty insurance products, and further\n\nGovernance\n\noperational efficiency. For the international business, we aim for a CAGR of +5% or more through balanced growth in underwriting and investment focusing on developed markets. It is important to note that the performance of the international business in fiscal 2023, the launch year of the new MTP, includes significant gains from the takedown of prior-year loss reserves, which are not factored into the plan. Excluding these reserves, the international business is expected to achieve a CAGR of +7% or more. Our plan aims for balanced growth across our top-tier regional insurance businesses, leveraging strengths in each area to achieve organic growth comparable to our peers (see pp. 129-143 for details).\n\nIn addition, the strong base profit from organic growth will be significantly enhanced by accelerating the sale of business-related equities. As a result, the projected overall EPS growth will be CAGR of +16% or more, while the adjusted ROE is expected to be 20% or more. Given the high level of interest in business-related equity sales, I will provide a detailed explanation in the following section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: The KPIs are based on the current definitions.",

We are now committed to bring down business-related equities to \u02a0zero* 1 \u02a1 in six years, with an intermediate goal of halving them within the next three years as part of our new MTP.\n\nAs a result, we anticipate higher profits from these sales in the coming six years. However, as the unrealized gains from these equities are already included in our capital, the sales themselves will not generate new capital. The true impact on corporate value will depend on how effectively we use the released risk amounts (approximately 1.2 trillion yen out of the total 4.3 trillion yen in post-diversified risk) for high-quality investments and risk-taking.\n\nTo achieve the organic growth target (CAGR of +7% or more) in the new MTP, we will engage in substantial risk-taking within our existing operations. We will also explore inorganic (M&A) opportunities. However, M&A is a means to achieve risk diversification and profit growth, not an end in itself. Therefore, the released capital from accelerating the sale of business-related equities will be used with ongoing discipline. Given that current valuations for large-scale M&A are still high, we will continue to conduct market intelligence, maintaining a long and short list of potential acquisition targets, and carefully select companies that offer a high Return on Investment (ROI). At the same time, we will actively pursue small to mid-sized bolt-on M&A opportunities, leveraging the Group\u029fs experience and expertise.\n\n## \u25ef Accelerating the Sales of Business-Related Equities\n\n## Business-Related Equity Sales and Timeline\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ratio of Holdings to Net Assets* 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: Excluding non-listed stocks (circa 22.5 billion yen in market/book value as of March 31, 2024) and investments related to capital and business alliances\n- *2: Based on share prices as of March 31, 2024.

Specifically, the dividend base will be set as the five-year average of adjusted net income to minimize volatility, with ordinary dividends calculated by applying a 50% payout ratio, which aligns with global peer standards. For fiscal 2024, due to significant gains from the sale of business-related equities, the profit plan is set at 1 trillion yen, substantially increasing the five-year average of adjusted net income. Consequently, the DPS for fiscal 2024 is projected to be 159 yen, reflecting a +29% increase from the previous year and marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend growth.\n\nLooking ahead, we plan to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) by the end of fiscal 2025, alongside the introduction of the new International Capital Standard (ICS). With these changes, we expect to review various indicators and definitions, including for\n\n## \u25ef Dividend Growth\n\nprofit, starting from fiscal 2026. Despite the new standards, we remain committed to achieving top-tier EPS growth and aligning DPS growth accordingly. We will carefully assess the dividend payout ratio and other related factors, engaging in discussions with stakeholders in the capital market. We aim to provide a comprehensive update on these changes and our strategy in the fall of 2025.\n\nOur approach to share buybacks remains unchanged as a means of adjusting our capital levels. We make decisions based on a comprehensive assessment of factors such as ESR, market conditions, opportunities for M&A and additional risk-taking, and the common practice among global peers of executing share buybacks amounting to approximately 2% of market capitalization annually. Given that our ESR was 140% as of March 31, 2024, we plan to conduct share buybacks totaling 200 billion yen throughout fiscal 2024, with an initial resolution of 100 billion yen in May.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * DPS = Five-year adjusted net income \u00d7 Payout ratio / Number of shares\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nGovernance\n\n## \u25ef Review of Indicators for the Introduction of IFRS and ICS\n\n2\n\n| Reference:  European peers     | FY2022 \u25c6 Review of various KPIs* 1  triggered  by the adoption of IFRS 9 and 17   | FY2025                                                                         | FY2026 \u25c6 Scheduled  introduction of ICS* 2   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Tokio Marine                   |                                                                                   | \u25c6 Planned guidance on various KPIs based on new definitions from November 2025 | \u25c6 Scheduled  introduction of IFRS and ICS*   |\n| <Current KPIs and Definitions> | <Current KPIs and Definitions>                                                    | <Current KPIs and Definitions>                                                 | <FY2026->                                    |\n| Profit Indicators              | Adjusted net income, business unit profit                                         | Adjusted net income, business unit profit                                      |                                              |\n| ROE                            | Adjusted ROE                                                                      | Adjusted ROE                                                                   |                                              |\n| Dividend Policy                | Adjusted net income (5-year average) \u00d7 dividend payout ratio (currently 50%)      | Adjusted net income (5-year average) \u00d7 dividend payout ratio (currently 50%)   | New definition                               |\n| ESR                            | Current ESR (Confidence level: 99.95% VaR)                                        | Current ESR (Confidence level: 99.95% VaR)                                     |                                              |\n|                                | 100%-140%                                                                         | 100%-140%                                                                      |                                              |\n| Target                         |                                                                                   |                                                                                |                                              |\n\n- *1: Profit indicators, etc.: European peers: Allianz, AXA, Zurich Source: Company disclosures\n- *2: International Capital Standard (ICS).

We have positioned Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) as the cornerstone of Group management. ERM takes into consideration our risk appetite, to what extent we undertake risks (risk boundaries), whether return on risk is sufficient, and whether risks are appropriately diversified. We have also established the ERM Committee to discuss ERM strategy. The committee assesses the growth potential and profitability of all businesses and the risks associated with each strategy in a forward-looking manner and formulates a capital allocation plan to optimize the risk portfolio from a Group-wide perspective. By doing so, we aim to achieve capital adequacy and high profitability relative to risk. This approach is intended to sustainably enhance our corporate value.\n\n## Tokio Marine Group\u029fs ERM Structure and Initiatives to Strengthen it\n\nThe risks surrounding the Tokio Marine Group are becoming more diversified and complex due to our global expansion and changes in the business environment. In addition, in today\u029fs uncertain and rapidly changing political, economic, and social climate, we must proactively anticipate the emergence of new risks and their warning signs and take appropriate action.

Specifically, we focus on emerging risks as well as material risks from the previous business year within the Group.

We specify these risks using the following 5\u00d75 matrix.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *3\uff1a For material risks, we formulate response measures (Plan), implement these measures (Do), assess the outcomes (Check), and make improvements (Act).\n\ncomprehensively assessing risk in qualitative and quantitative ways.\n\nIn addition, we are continuing our efforts to further strengthen the ERM structure.

Risks identified in this manner are evaluated not only in terms of the economic loss or frequency of occurrence but also in terms of business continuity and reputation. Risks that have a large impact on the financial soundness and business continuity of the Group or of individual Group companies are identified as \u02a0material risks.\u02a1 For identified material risks, we assess the sufficiency of capital through the quantitative risk management process described in the subsequent pages,\n\ndraw up control measures before the risks emerge and countermeasures* to be taken if the risks do emerge, and conduct PDCA management. In addition, while we have been implementing such risk management practices, in light of the series of irregularities that occurred at TMNF, we have added scenarios related to competition law to the

(p. 51)\n\nSpecifically, the Company quantifies potential risks using a statistical metric called \u02a0Value at Risk (VaR)\u02a1 on a 99.95% confidence level, which corresponds to an AA credit rating, and verifies its capital adequacy based on the Economic Solvency Ratio (ESR) arrived at by dividing net asset value* 1 by risk capital. Our capital policy is determined by comprehensively considering business investment opportunities and future market outlooks. A 99.95% VaR is equivalent to the damage caused by an occurrence of a risk that happens once in 2,000 years. Although many insurance companies around the world use 99.5% VaR (once in 200 years), the Tokio Marine Group uses a much more stringent standard to evaluate risk capital.\n\n## \u25ef Risk Composition and Diversification Effects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY2014\n\nDiversification\n\neffect\n\n29 %\n\nPost-diversification\n\nrisk capital\n\n3.1 trillion yen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also conduct stress tests based on scenarios involving significant economic losses from material risks such as domestic and international economic crises, disruptions in financial and capital markets, loss of confidence in Japanese government bonds, major earthquakes, major wind and water-related disasters, and widespread outbreaks of new viruses. We also assess scenarios where multiple critical risks materialize simultaneously. In addition, we conduct reverse stress tests, which assume scenarios that could severely impact the financial soundness of the Group, allowing us to comprehensively verify that there are no issues with capital adequacy and liquidity.\n\n- *1: Calculated by adding the value of catastrophe loss reserves, deducting for goodwill, and making other adjustments to consolidated net assets on a financial accounting basis.\n- *2: ESR after the acquisition of 200 billion yen in treasury stock is 135%.\n\nFY2024\n\nDiversification\n\neffect\n\n43 %\n\n\u25a0 Japan P&C (Underwriting)\n\n\u25a0 Japan P&C (Investment)\n\n\u25a0 Japan Life\n\n\u25a0 International\n\n\u25a0 Others\n\nPost-diversification risk capital\n\n4.3 trillion yen\n\nNote: Risk excluding business-related equities is 5.9 trillion yen before diversification and 3.1 trillion yen after diversification.\n\n## \u25ef ESR Sensitivity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurpose Story\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Disciplined Portfolio Review and Business Investment (In/Out strategy)\n\nBased on this risk-based management approach, we are committed to disciplined portfolio reviews and business investments while considering risk diversification and future growth potential. For example, we recently acquired the PURE Group, established a local subsidiary in Canada, and engaged in bolt-on M&A with Gulf Guaranty Employee\n\nBenefit Services (GGEBS) through TMHCC, while also divesting subsidiaries in Guam and Saudi Arabia as part of our In/Out strategy. We will continue to carefully manage our risk portfolio, controlling risks and expanding corporate value through appropriate capital allocation.\n\n## \u25ef Trajectory of the In/Out Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are dedicated to actively embracing human capital management and increasing the probability of realizing the goals of our business strategy through our human resources strategy.\n\n## Satoshi Moriyama\n\nManaging Executive Officer Group Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) Group Chief Wellness Officer (CWO)\n\n## Human Resources Empowering Our Competitive Edge\n\n\u02a0Human resources\u02a1 have been the Tokio Marine Group\u029fs most important asset since our founding. The strength of our people, who continue to take on the challenges of the \u02a0Purpose,\u02a1 is the driving force behind our corporate growth and the source of our competitive advantage. The roles of the Group CHRO are to respect each and every one of our more than 40,000 employees around the world, to thoroughly create an environment in which we can maximize our unlimited potential, and to strengthen our corporate capabilities through the implementation of our human resources strategies while increasing the likelihood that business strategies will be realized.\n\nSince our founding in 1879, we have positioned human capital as a driving force for growth and have continued to devote all of our efforts to \u02a0human capital management.\u02a1 Last year, we released the \u02a0Human Capital Report\u02a1 for the first time as a tool to explain our thoughts and specific initiatives to our stakeholders. This year, in June, we released the second version of this report. Here, we will explain the outline of this report.\n\n## Human Resources Strategy Aimed at Facilitating Business Strategy\n\nOur human resources strategy is designed to enhance the probability of realizing the goals of our business strategy and propel Group growth. Of particular importance are two things: the building of a talent portfolio aligned with business concepts and the establishment of an organizational environment where the potential of such talent can be fully realized. As a result, our human resources strategy is built upon \u02a0People\u02a1 and \u02a0Corporate culture,\u02a1 working in harmony aiming to create synergies that uphold and further enhance our distinctive capability of \u02a0Integrated Group Management.\u02a1\n\nWe intend to build a strategically aligned human resource portfolio and achieve growth in each business through the active engagement of individual human resources. Moreover, we will enhance management decision-making in terms of both quality and speed by strengthening the Group management system. The underlying organizational culture and the creation of a sense of unity within the Group will further drive the growth of each business and the sophistication of decision-making. This virtuous cycle is what we are aiming for in Tokio Marine human capital management,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand it is also the driving force that leads to the improvement of Tokio Marine's ROE, which is aimed at the global peer level.\n\n## \u02a0People\u02a1 Supporting Integrated Group Management\n\nAs society as a whole becomes more complex, the challenges that we must solve are becoming more difficult. To solve these issues, it is important for employees with a variety of knowledge and experience to be active. Accordingly, the Tokio Marine Group will actively recruit and develop human resources with a high level of expertise and knowledge on a global basis to build a strategically aligned human resources portfolio. By placing the right people in the right positions, we will improve our ability to identify and resolve issues from diverse perspectives, which in turn will improve the problem-solving capabilities of the Group as a whole.\n\nIn this uncertain business environment, we believe that the most important management issue that holds the key to the future growth of the Tokio Marine Group is the stable and continuous development of future business leaders who can come up with solutions. Based on this belief, we established TLI (Tokio Marine Group Leadership Institute) in April 2023 as an organization headed by the Group CEO himself. With TLI at the core, we will create the foundation for the Tokio Marine Group to be a company that continues to grow 100 years from now by implementing recruitment, development and evaluation, and appointment and assignment in an integrated manner while interlinking them. Under the deep commitment of our executives, we will pass on the spirit of the Group since its foundation across generations.\n\nAt the same time, from the perspective of human\n\n## \u25ef The Human Capital Report 2024 Released in June 2024\n\nhttps://www.tokiomarinehd.com/ir/download/uh7ekg0000 001y9b-att/Human\u0332Capital\u0332Report\u03322024\u0332j.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1VSQPTF 4UPSZ\n\n$BQJUBMglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>1PMJDZglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>BOE UIFglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>.JEglyph<c=14,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>5FSNglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>#VTJOFTTglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>1MBO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(PWFSOBODF\n\n'JOBODJBMglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>BOE\n\n## CDIO Message\n\n## \u02a0Inspiring confidence. Accelerating progress.\u02a1 by promoting DE&I\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Caryn Angelson\n\nExecutive Officer Group CDIO (Group Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer)\n\nThe business environment is incredibly uncertain and complex. In these times of uncertainty, it is more critical than ever that we foster an environment where each and every individual worldwide can feel psychologically safe and can flourish. This involves providing fair opportunities for growth, which in turn motivates employees to continue thriving.\n\nTo accelerate our efforts as they pertain to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), we are committed to (1) fostering inclusive behaviors, (2) cultivating a culture of ally-ship, (3) eliminating barriers, and (4) working, collectively, for the benefit of the Group. Our aim is to drive the growth of the Group.\n\nresource development, based on our deep reflection on the insurance premium adjustment incident that occurred in TMNF, which is the core company of the Group, we will make thorough efforts to train each and every employee to create a \u02a0truly trusted customer-oriented company.\u02a1 The insurance business is a people business, and trust created by people is the source of everything. Therefore, it is essential for all employees to conduct their work in accordance with rules and based on a high sense of ethics. We will work to regain the trust of our stakeholders by again instilling the importance of integrity throughout the Group and developing human resources with a high sense of integrity.\n\n## \u02a0Corporate Culture\u02a1 Supporting Integrated Group Management\n\nCentral to all human capital management endeavors is each employee\u029fs alignment with the Group\u029fs Purpose. Our Purpose acts as a guiding light for the entire Group, providing a sense of direction. To unite our diverse workforce of more than 40,000 individuals worldwide and unleash their full potential, the CEO spearheads initiatives as Chief Culture Officer (CCO), driven by a strong belief in embedding these principles. Moreover, a \u02a0culture of growth\u02a1 has taken root wherein each individual actively pursues self-improvement and positively influences others. This culture has thrived due to our history and continued efforts in addressing societal issues since our inception. It stands as our unique advantage, fostered by the ongoing sharing of these values among our employees. Through initiatives that embed our Purpose, we share the role we have played in addressing societal issues and the genuine aspirations of our employees, making the Purpose a personal commitment. Employees who internalize the Purpose then experience a sense of societal trust through their work and derive the motivation to contribute to future problem-solving. This cycle also contributes to enhancing overall organizational engagement. The results of the Culture & Values Survey conducted across the Group also reflect a high level of positive feedback. We regularly conduct employee perception surveys to gauge employee and organizational status, following a PDCA cycle to identify challenges and enact solutions. We prioritize employee satisfaction, motivation, and organizational culture. These factors are set as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the executive compensation evaluations. Management leads\n\nefforts to boost employee engagement and nurture an organizational culture, actively driving these initiatives forward.\n\nWe believe it is essential to consistently value our employees and enhance unity while simultaneously creating an environment where diverse talents can thrive. In today\u029fs rapidly changing business landscape with increasingly complex societal issues, it is vital to leverage the knowledge and experiences of our diverse employees in management and governance. Given this perspective, we are placing DE&I at the core of our growth strategy and are advancing initiatives to improve both job satisfaction and ease of working.\n\nThe development of a company cannot be achieved without the growth of its people. We strive to bring together individuals under a shared purpose, fostering alignment with our valued corporate culture. Through this resonance, we aim to support personal growth and enhance the value we deliver to all stakeholders.\n\n## Achieving Sustainable Growth through the Synergy of \u02a0People\u02a1 and \u02a0Corporate Culture\u02a1\n\nThe concepts of \u02a0People\u02a1 and \u02a0Corporate culture\u02a1 that I have discussed are closely intertwined. Our corporate culture, built on Group unity and increased engagement, helps attract and retain valuable talent. Meanwhile, appropriate human resource recruitment, development, and placement generates both personal and corporate growth, further enriching Group unity and employee engagement. Through ongoing efforts, we will sustain this synergy and virtuous cycle to foster lasting growth. Irrespective of how much global conditions and the business environment change, the fact remains that people are the cornerstone of our competitiveness.\n\nAs I step into the role of CHRO this fiscal year, I am committed to living by the principle of \u02a0In essentials unity, in action freedom\u02a1 in our organizational management. I believe our true strength\u0336and that of the entire Group\u0336 comes from employees who exhibit high professionalism and a strong sense of responsibility while supporting each other warmly as a unified team. I will wholeheartedly dedicate myself to these goals by harnessing and trusting our people\u029fs potential, offering diverse opportunities for growth, and maintaining a psychologically safe work environment where everyone can challenge themselves and excel.",

As CDO, my objective is to harness our intellectual assets, encompassing the Group\u029fs exclusive data and digital technology, as a source of competitive advantage. In addition to the drive toward global digital synergies, I aim for evolving into a company that always supports its customers while driving business process transformation.\n\n## Transforming Our Value Proposition\n\nOver the course of many years, we have amassed, analyzed, and effectively utilized extensive volumes of data through our underwriting and claims services. With Tokio Marine dR Co., Ltd. (TdR), at the helm, driving the Group\u029fs data utilization and solution development, we are leveraging this intellectual capital to step into novel domains such as advanced data-driven underwriting, data solutions, and embedded insurance. Based on the belief that expanding our data and value proposition model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthrough collaboration will lead to new value creation, we are continuously honing our intellectual capital and co-creating with external partners. Our goal is to broaden our value proposition while also enhancing our social capital.\n\n## Utilize Social Capital to Create New Profit Streams\n\nAn example of utilizing social capital, an ecosystem built across different companies through these initiatives, is our collaboration with I-Resilience Corporation, a joint venture between the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience and TMNF. This partnership involves providing the Resilient Information Distribution Service offered by Tokio Marine Resilience. The service integrates information from various locations of companies and organizations with extensive and multiple sites to support the maintenance and continuity of logistics and business activities during natural disasters. By developing a program that centralizes risk data from multiple sites and assesses their risk conditions, the service provides information such as identifying which sites\u0336such as A and B\u0336are at high risk due to an impending disaster. This enables companies, for instance, with 100 locations, to\n\n## \u25ef Overview of the Comprehensive Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Solutions Business in Collaboration with the Tokio Marine Group and External Partners\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance underwriting capability\n- \u00b7 Sales\n- planning/development leveraging customer interactions\n- \u00b7 Insurance accident response for natural disasters nationwide\n- \u00b7 National/local government network\n\nTMNF\n\n## I-Resilience\n\n- \u00b7 Joint venture with National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Implementation of research results in society\n- \u00b7 BCP suited to company/industry-specific needs\n- \u00b7 Visualization of disaster risk (PML calculation based on local surveys) and risk mitigation consulting service\n\n## Tokio Marine dR (TdR)\n\n## AlgoNaut\n\n\u00b7 Joint venture with PKSHA Technology Inc.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk analysis via algorithms in the machine learning/deep learning fields\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinue logistics and business operations primarily from sites with lower risk while planning actions to support those with higher risk, based on this information. The system was provided free of charge as an emergency response following the Noto Peninsula earthquake. We quickly developed a user-friendly mobile interface in collaboration with I-Resilience, and by January 10, just nine days after the earthquake, the service was made available on TMNF\u029fs website (until March 31, 2024). This system was used to leverage alert information for preventing secondary disasters at evacuation sites and for formulating support schedules by local governments and volunteers to facilitate early recovery efforts.\n\nTo further enhance the utilization of social capital, we established two new companies in November 2023: Tokio Marine Resilience Co., Ltd., for disaster prevention and mitigation, and Tokio Marine Smart Mobility Co., Ltd., for the mobility sector. These new entities are dedicated to new business initiatives and are focused on accelerating the planning and development of innovative value propositions and solutions.\n\nTo continue fulfilling our Purpose of protecting customers and society in their times of need, we aim to expand our value proposition into a comprehensive solution business. This approach goes beyond just insurance payouts to cover both preventive and responsive measures, including preventing accidents, alleviating burdens in case of incidents, facilitating swift recovery, and preventing recurrences. Our goal is to develop this area so that, in 10 years, it stands as a key revenue pillar alongside our existing businesses.\n\n## Transforming Business Structure\n\nFor nearly 20 years, we have been committed to fundamentally reforming our business processes to enhance operational efficiency. At TMNF, we have been advancing the digital streamlining of insurance business processes, including efforts to improve contract procedures and automate the insurance claims payment process. In fiscal 2023, we achieved a 16.7% reduction in administrative burden compared with the end of fiscal 2019, exceeding the planned reduction of 15%. This reduction translates to an annual profit contribution of 20-25 billion yen.\n\nTo further enhance the efficiency of our digital business model, we are positioning the use of AI and data as a crucial strategy for transforming our business structure. We are also exploring the potential of generative AI, which has garnered significant attention across various fields. Generative AI, with its capabilities in understanding text and generating responses, holds promise for improving productivity and customer service quality in the insurance industry. However, the industry\u029fs reliance on specialized terminology and complex communications presents challenges for implementing generative AI in practice. In addition, there are risks associated with data leakage and copyright infringement that must be carefully managed.\n\nTo tackle these obstacles, we have partnered with PKSHA Technology Inc. and Microsoft Japan Co., Ltd., to\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\ncreate safeguards against external data leaks and secondary usage of input information. Leveraging our extensive repository of manuals and insurance policy terms, we are in the process of crafting a dedicated interactive AI tailored to the insurance domain.\n\nBy conducting a trial operation of this interactive AI, initiated in June 2023, our objective is to continue gathering insights and address any remaining risks. Our aim is to roll out this feature for widespread employee usage by the end of fiscal 2024. In addition, we will explore and pursue new use cases that maximize the potential of generative AI, aiming to enhance operational productivity and customer service excellence.\n\nOur commitment lies in driving additional growth by channeling the time generated from these endeavors into creating novel profit opportunities.\n\n## Foundation Underpinning Our Intellectual Capital Strategy\n\n## (1) Global Synergies (Development of Global Labs)\n\nIn addition, we are dedicated to strengthening collaboration both domestically and internationally in the digital realm. We are actively engaged in fostering digital synergy globally. Through our network of seven Global Labs and the Digital Roundtable that brings together overseas sites, we are facilitating the sharing of diverse knowledge and expertise from around the world. This is accelerating digital transformation (DX) across the Group.\n\n## (2) Investment in and Development of DX Personnel\n\nTo expedite these efforts, investing in and nurturing talent with strong DX skills is crucial. We have brought on board approximately 100 dedicated digital experts, encompassing engineers and designers. Meanwhile, graduates from our internal DX talent development program, known as Data Science Hill Climb, are equipped to lead digitalization efforts as proficient data scientists.\n\nWith a focus on \u02a0Business Architect\u02a1 professionals, we are collaborating with technology companies to achieve notable outcomes. For instance, we have implemented a system that integrates fire insurance subscription processes into the online purchasing process for investment real estate, marking a first in both the domestic real estate and insurance industries. Furthermore, based on feedback from previous Data Science Hill Climb participants, who highlighted the need for expertise not only in advanced specialties but also in leading DX and AI business initiatives, we have developed a new Business Architect training program. This program will be offered externally as well.\n\nMoving forward, we will expand our business beyond just offering courses and sharing know-how. We aim to extend our services into concrete implementation support through data analysis and digital technology utilization. This will include advancing digital usage across society and supporting the disaster prevention value chain through collaboration and co-creation.",

This approach will accelerate the virtuous cycle of resolving societal issues and the Group's sustainable growth.\n\n## Mika Nabeshima\n\nExecutive Officer Group Chief Sustainability Office (CSUO)\n\nProtecting customers and society in their times of need has been the Tokio Marine Group\u029fs raison d\u029fetre since our founding. Based on this, we aim to be a global insurance group that continues growing by providing safety and security to customers worldwide. We have consistently confronted evolving societal issues head-on and offered solutions that only we can. Our historical contributions, from supporting Japan\u029fs modernization as a trading nation through maritime insurance to aiding postwar motorization with automobile insurance and promoting renewable energy through tailored insurance packages, illustrate how our core business activities inherently address societal issues and embody sustainability. The spirit of addressing societal issues through our business is ingrained in our 40,000 Group employees worldwide, reflecting the very essence of our Purpose\u0336a legacy passed down through generations since our founding.\n\n## The Environment Surrounding Sustainability\n\nIn this era of rapid change and unpredictability, the landscape of sustainability is constantly evolving. Societal issues are becoming more diverse and complex, extending beyond global warming, climate change, and the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters to include human rights and biodiversity preservation. Against this backdrop, my mission as Group CSUO is to actively address new societal issues alongside our ongoing initiatives. By integrating our business activities with efforts to tackle these societal issues, we aim to create a better environment and society for future generations while driving corporate growth. Despite the shifting landscape and personnel changes, the core principles of our deeply rooted sustainability strategy have remained constant since our inception. To achieve this, it is essential that employees worldwide fully understand and align with our sustainability strategy. We must also leverage the knowledge and expertise of our globally expanding Group companies and continue to implement the strategy cohesively as a unified organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global Strategy Deployment and Expansion of Efforts to Address Societal Issues\n\nTo further advance our sustainability strategy, it is essential that the strategy is deeply ingrained among all employees, with each individual understanding, resonating with, and taking ownership of the relevant policies, and translating this into concrete actions. In fiscal 2023, we engaged in dialogues with Group companies to integrate sustainability-related initiatives into their business plans. To promote two-way dialogue with our overseas Group companies, we held quarterly Q&A sessions. In addition, we published a new sustainability booklet featuring numerous interviews and case studies of employees involved in societal issues resolution. These initiatives aim to enhance employees\u029f understanding of how every aspect of our daily operations contributes to solving societal issues.\n\nRegarding climate change measures, we have not only developed and provided products and services that contribute to the advancement of renewable energy but also strengthened our engagement with customers toward transitioning to a decarbonized society. As a specific measure, in September 2023, TMNF, which handles a significant portion of corporate transactions within the Group, engaged in dialogue with 200 key clients responsible for approximately 90% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our insurance underwriting. We have set a goal to elevate the engagement level with at least 160 of these clients to a standard where we\n\nshare an understanding of the issues and make concrete proposals for their resolution. Furthermore, in March 2024, we revised our Basic Approach to Climate Change and announced a policy requiring the development of decarbonization plans through engagement from the 60 GHG high-emission sector clients, which account for approximately 70% of the GHG emissions associated with insurance underwriting among the 200 key clients. We also clarified our policy to cease transactions (insurance underwriting and investment) with companies that do not\n\n1VSQPTF 4UPSZ\n\n4USFOHUIFOJOHglyph<c=13,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>glyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>)VNBOglyph<c=13,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>glyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold> *OUFMMFDUVBMglyph<c=13,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>glyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>BOEglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>4PDJBMglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>$BQJUBM SustainaCility .anagement $BQJUBMglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>1PMJDZglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>BOE UIFglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>.JEglyph<c=14,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>5FSNglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>#VTJOFTTglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>1MBO\n\nhave a decarbonization plan by 2030. To foster cross-group collaboration and expand business opportunities in the green transformation (GX) sector, we are advancing support for the global transition to a decarbonized society by hosting initiatives such as the GX Roundtable.\n\nIn the domain of disaster resilience, we are leveraging digital technology to automate and accelerate insurance claim processes, ensuring prompt delivery of benefits to those affected. We are also expanding our efforts into both pre-emptive and post-incident strategies. Our objectives include preventing accidents, mitigating damage during incidents, and facilitating rapid recovery while preventing future occurrences.\n\nThrough these efforts, our sustainability strategy is steadily expanding and becoming ingrained at a global level, with a focus on eight key areas (materiality).\n\n## Strengthening External Communication and Disclosure, and Addressing New Societal Issues\n\nIn fiscal 2024, we will focus on strengthening external communication and tackling challenges in new domains.\n\nIn strengthening external communication and disclosure, we will clearly present our sustainability initiatives to a broad range of stakeholders, including general consumers, explaining why we are undertaking these efforts along with the details. This approach aims to invigorate dialogue with stakeholders and, based on insights gained from these interactions, further enhance our sustainability strategy to improve corporate value.\n\nIn addressing new societal issues, we will challenge ourselves to quantify the impact (social value) of the Group\u029fs sustainability strategy and initiatives: how they contribute to society. This effort aims to expand both the quality and quantity of our contributions to solving societal issues and to enhance employee motivation.\n\nFurthermore, as emerging societal issues such as natural capital and biodiversity conservation become more apparent, we will remain sensitive to societal perspectives\n\n(PWFSOBODF\n\n'JOBODJBMglyph<c=1,font=/UAXDOO+TBUDGoStd-Bold>BOE\n\nand expectations of businesses and respond with a sense of urgency. Specifically, we will promote marine conservation activities, such as mangrove reforestation and seagrass bed preservation, which are symbolic of our Group\u029fs efforts. We will also assess the impact of our business activities on ecosystems and natural capital, in line with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we analyzed the dependency and impact on natural capital within our insurance underwriting and investment portfolios and identified key sectors. Starting in fiscal 2024, we plan to conduct detailed analyses of these key sectors and initiate engagement with partner companies.\n\nIn addition, in fiscal 2024, we will engage in constructive dialogues with internal and external stakeholders regarding human capital management, which supports societal issues resolution and our sustainable growth. We will refine and implement our human resources strategy in alignment with our business strategy and execute the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) process on an ongoing basis. This approach aims to continuously strengthen our human capital and enhance corporate value sustainably.\n\nIn this way, we will actively advance our sustainability strategy and initiatives to enhance corporate value.\n\n## Enhancing Value by Circulating Corporate Activities and the Resolution of Societal Issues\n\nGuided by our enduring purpose of protecting customers and society in their times of need, we will leverage the Group\u029fs collective strengths and capabilities and take pride in our commitment to be a front-runner in solving societal issues. At the same time, we will strive to increase both social value and economic value (profit growth) by circulating our corporate activities against the resolution of societal issues.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate the ongoing understanding and support of all our stakeholders.\n\n## Fiscal 2024 (Plan)\n\nEnhancement of societal issues resolution and initiatives in key areas through business activities Venturing into new domains\n\n| Embedding and  advancement of  the sustainability  strategy   | \u25cf  Promote integrated management of our sustainability strategy and business activities \u25cf  Strive to quantify the impact (social value) provided to society through business \u25cf  Provide clear and accessible information to a wide range of stakeholders, including general consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Initiatives  in key areas                                     | \u25cf  Strengthen efforts toward achieving a decarbonized society (Support for transition through products and  services, enhanced engagement) \u25cf  Promote global expansion of initiatives for future generations \u25cf  Enhance efforts to respect human rights across the value chain \u25cf  Expand ESG investment and financing (e.g., sustainability-themed investments, impact investing) \u25cf  Advance biodiversity conservation efforts (In-depth analysis of key sectors, exploring engagement) \u25cf  Elevate human capital management to support societal issues resolution and sustainable corporate growth, |",

We have also established mechanisms to support and promote the implementation of plans at each company, such as conducting regular follow-up sessions and building a system to recognize and realize excellent ideas and initiatives into the Tokio Marine Innovation Program (TIP)*.\n\nIn addition, by externally disclosing specific initiatives and processes that emerge from these efforts, we aim to engage in dialogue with our stakeholders, incorporating their feedback into the following year\u029fs initiatives.\n\nBy setting this PDCA cycle in a positive feedback loop throughout the Group, we further embed our sustainability strategy and elevate the content and insights of our initiatives, enabling us to accelerate our sustainability strategy across the Group.\n\n- *: An initiative where ideas from employees of Group companies are solicited for addressing societal issues through business activities, and applicants themselves aim to bring these ideas to fruition with the support of their company.\n\n## \u25ef Accelerating the Sustainability Strategy through a PDCA Cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note: Hosting Follow-up Sessions with Overseas Group Companies\n\nTo promote interactive dialogue with the Group\u029fs sustainability managers, we began holding quarterly follow-up sessions with overseas Group companies in November 2023.

In this identification process, we first consider external environmental factors and the impact on the Company. We evaluate and select the issues based on two criteria: \u02a0stakeholder expectations and interests\u02a1 and \u02a0relevance to the Tokio Marine Group\u029fs business.\u02a1 Afterward, we finalize the material issues through consultations with internal and external experts, as well as deliberations by the Sustainability Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nAs the field of sustainability is subject to rapid changes in external environments, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) trends and international frameworks, regular reviews are necessary. We are conducting a review in fiscal 2024.\n\nBased on the identified material issues, we evaluate their impact on the Group\u029fs business (risks and opportunities) and undertake initiatives to mitigate risks while capturing opportunities.

Guided by principles such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO International Labor Standards, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we established the Basic Policy on Human Rights and the Responsible Procurement Guidelines. In fiscal 2023, we focused on implementing human rights due diligence throughout the value chain, taking mitigation measures, and establishing an external consultation and reporting hotline for human rights violations. Moving forward, we will continue to engage in dialogue with stakeholders, enhance the sensitivity of our management and employees toward human rights, and build a framework capable of swiftly addressing human rights issues.\n\n## Steps for Initiatives\n\n## Summary of Key Initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFormulated the Basic Policy on Human Rights and established the Human Rights Subcommittee Formulated the Policy to Address Environmental and Social Risks Developed the Responsible Procurement Guidelines\n\nFormulated a human rights risk map Held human rights workshops\n\nConducted interviews and surveys with rights holders in the value chain Performed self-assessments using a checklist of human rights issues within the Group\n\nShared insights gained through interviews to raise awareness Implemented employee education and training\n\nEstablished a hotline (internal and external consultation and reporting channel)\n\nIssued the Integrated Report and the Sustainability Report Engaged in dialogue with external experts\n\n## Efforts to Respect Human Rights in the Value Chain\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we conducted a risk assessment through a human rights workshop* to identify priority areas for action. We evaluated the impact of human rights violations on rights holders by conducting field hearings in three sectors: foreign technical trainees engaged in automotive maintenance, IT service providers, and printing service providers.\n\nFor foreign technical trainees, we have shared the insights gained from interviews with our automotive maintenance agents and supervising organizations. For IT service providers and printing service providers, we have shared the insights with the management responsible for the contractors and implemented mitigation measures such as improving communication to prevent long working hours at the contractors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *\uff1a Human rights workshop: Members of the Group\u029fs planning and management departments, in collaboration with external experts, engaged in discussions to identify human rights risks within our business areas.\n\n## Establishment of a Consultation and Reporting Hotline for Human Rights Violations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo ensure we can respond sincerely to complaints and requests from rights holders, we are establishing effective grievance mechanisms in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nFor example, we established a dedicated human rights violation consultation hotline through the Global Stakeholders Hotline operated by TSUHO Support Center Co., Ltd., in March 2024. This hotline is accessible via our website and allows for anonymous consultations.\n\nThrough our commitment to respecting human rights, we will sincerely address the voices of victims and take appropriate measures to remedy human rights violations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\n## Initiatives for Natural Capital and Biodiversity Conservation\n\nThe Tokio Marine Group prioritizes protection of the natural environment as a key focus area and practices harmonizing with the Earth\u029fs environment and conducting environmentally considerate business activities. We have established our Basic Policy on the Environment and Responsible Procurement Guidelines to engage in the conservation of natural capital and biodiversity through our business activities. Protecting the Earth\u029fs environment requires not only addressing climate change but also halting the loss of biodiversity and achieving nature positive outcomes to restore nature. In fiscal 2023, we established the TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures) Task Force to build a promotion system and analyze the relationship between our business activities and nature. In March 2024, we issued a TNFD Report based on the TNFD recommendations, publicly announcing our initiatives toward achieving nature-positive status by 2030. We will continue to address this as a critical issue, with unified Company-wide effort.\n\n## Initiatives for Natural Capital and Biodiversity through Business Activities\n\nWe have been advancing efforts to conserve natural capital and biodiversity through environmental protection activities, such as mangrove reforestation. We will continue to contribute to building a society the coexists in harmony with nature by developing and providing insurance products and services as well as through investments and financing that address nature-related issues* 1 .\n\n## \u25ef Insurance Products and Services\n\n## \u25ef Investment and Financing\n\n- \u25cf Green Gift Project\n- \u25cf Soil purification cost insurance* 2\n- \u25cf Aquaculture insurance* 3\n- \u25cf Soil environmental surveys\n- \u25cf Soil contamination countermeasures and consulting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25cf TNFD compliance support services for companies\n- \u25cf Nature-positive management support services, etc.\n- \u25ef Others\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u25cf Mangrove reforestation and seagrass bed conservation and restoration activities \u25cf Participation in natural capital and biodiversity-related initiatives \u25cf Disclosure of nature-related information\n\n- * 1\uff1a  Organizations have dependencies on and impacts on nature, which create nature-related risks and opportunities.

The Board also holds discussions on corporate strategy on the themes of the management environment and management issues, including climate change countermeasures, and fully leverages the insights of outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members.\n\n| Date                | Items deliberated and reported                                                                 |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| May 2023            | Group\u029fs sustainability-related initiatives in  fiscal 2022 and the annual plan for fiscal 2023 |\n| Oct. 2023 Nov. 2023 | Progress in the Group\u029fs annual sustainability  plan for fiscal 2023                            |\n| March 2024          | Progress in the Group\u029fs annual sustainability  plan for fiscal 2023 (second half)              |\n\n## Group Chief Sustainability Officer (CSUO)\n\nWe established the position of CSUO in April 2021 to accelerate the promotion of our sustainability strategy, including climate action, across the entire Group. The CSUO oversees the promotion and permeation of the sustainability strategy, presents related policies to the Board of Directors and the Management Meeting for discussion and takes the role of reporting the progress to these bodies.\n\n## Sustainability Committee\n\nWe established the Sustainability Committee in April 2021 to accelerate our sustainability strategy, including climate action, across the entire Group. Chaired by the CSUO and comprising such members as the CEO, chief officers, and management of overseas Group companies, the Sustainability Committee deliberates on details of our sustainability initiatives and policies on a global basis and monitors the progress of each initiative. The committee met four times in fiscal 2023 to promote and execute the sustainability strategy, formulate medium- to long-term targets (KPIs) related to sustainability, formulate and review annual plans, and deliberate on other items.\n\n## Division Dedicated to Promoting Sustainability\n\nThe Sustainability Division of the Corporate Planning Department is a division dedicated to the promotion of the Group\u029fs sustainability initiatives, including climate action. This division is responsible for operating the Sustainability Committee and promoting the Group\u029fs sustainability initiatives while consistently communicating relevant strategies to Group companies, sharing information, and undertaking learning and support activities.\n\n## Compensation System for Directors and Executive Officers\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we started incorporating non-financial indicators concerning the tasks on climate action and other key issues in our sustainability strategy into the performance-linked compensation for Directors and Executive Officers. We use the progress of each task toward our vision as an indicator, and after performing the first assessment of compensation amounts at the Sustainability Committee, hold a deliberation and give a final decision at the Compensation Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate-related risks include risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (physical risks) and risks related to the transition to a decarbonized society (transition risks). Moreover, as demand for insurance in the renewable energy sector grows, it presents potential opportunities for our business. The following are some examples of risks and opportunities in the Group\u029fs business activities.\n\n|                                                                                         | Examples of events                                                                                                                               | Examples of risks to the Group\u029fs business activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Acute                                                                                   | Potential for growing frequency and scale of  typhoons, floods, and other weather events Rising temperatures Other weather changes, such as      | \u25cf  Decrease in insurance profits resulting from an  increase in claims payments and a rise in  reinsurance premiums \u25cf                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Chronic                                                                                 | droughts and heat waves Rising sea levels Impact on arthropod-borne infectious diseases Increase in carbon prices                                | Impact on business continuity caused by damage  to facilities at bases \u25cf  Decreases in the corporate value of portfolio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Policies and regulations                                                                | Strengthening of environment-related  regulations and standards Increase in climate-related legislation                                          | companies and in the value of the assets held by  the Company due to higher carbon prices \u25cf  Influence in liability insurance payments  Decrease in the corporate value of investee                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Technology                                                                              | Progress in technological innovation  and technology development toward the  transition to a decarbonized society and  improvement in resilience | \u25cf companies that have missed the transition to a  decarbonized society and in the value of the  assets held by the Company                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Markets                                                                                 | Changes in the demand for and supply  of products and services                                                                                   | \u25cf  Decline in revenue due to technological innovation  and inability to ascertain changes in customer needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Resource  efficiency, energy  sources, products  and services,  markets  and resilience | Demand for products and services  aligned with changes in energy sources  and designed to increase resilience;

We believe such risks could increase in frequency and severity, owing to the effects of climate change.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario analysis is the process of identifying and evaluating the potential impact of climate change based on certain scenarios. The Group believes it can be flexible and resilient to these impacts, as most non-life insurance policies are relatively short term and the Group\u029fs assets under management are highly liquid financial assets.\n\n## (1) Physical Risks\n\nPhysical risks are those related to physical impacts of climate change. Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, which could impact claims payments and business continuity. We conduct a scenario analysis of physical risks as part of our efforts to identify and assess their impact. The Group takes part in the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). Using analysis and assessment tools developed by UNEP FI\u029fs climate change impact assessment project, we have created the following assessment of the impact of changes in the intensity (wind speed) and number of tropical cyclones on our insurance payments under the IPCC\u029fs Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario forecast as of 2050.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and\n\nthe Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human,\n\nIntellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability\n\nManagement\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n## \u25ef Changes in Insurance Payments in 2050\n\n| Intensity (wind speed)   |                | Number                     |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| +5\uff05 to +53\uff05            | -30\uff05 to +28\uff05 | Japan (typhoons)           |\n| 0\uff05 to +37\uff05             | -36\uff05 to +30\uff05 | United States (hurricanes) |\n\n- *1: The figures above reflect economic losses, assuming the same impact on insurance payments.\n- *2: The figures above show the rate of change from current weather conditions (1980-2000) to those in around 2050.\n\nThe Tokio Marine Research Institute, a Group company, began conducting research in 2007 to evaluate and calculate the impact on insurance loss of changes in wind disaster risk associated with typhoons under future climate conditions (impact under the IPCC\u029fs RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios) and changes in flood risk due to increased rainfall (impact resulting from temperature increases of 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C). Referring to the results of this scenario analysis, we assess the impact on underwriting of natural disasters resulting from increasingly severe climate change.\n\nFuture projections of climate change scenarios are subject to uncertainties, as described later (see p. 85). In assessing the impact of climate change, it is also important to evaluate not only weather phenomena but also the vulnerability of society to disasters as well as the extent to which real estate and personal properties will be concentrated in areas exposed to natural disaster risk in the future and the extent to which their asset values will increase (in other words, the extent to which asset concentration will change). The basis for these projections and assessments is indicated in the following pages.\n\n## a. Change in Weather Events\n\nHow a weather event will change due to the impact of climate change and the degree of confidence of such an impact forecast will vary depending on the type of weather event. Figure 1 shows the confidence of climate change impact projections by weather event type. Notably, the confidence in impact projections is greater for extreme rainfall compared to tropical cyclones, such as typhoons and hurricanes. However, the impact on extreme rainfall entails more uncertainty compared to temperature variations such as extreme heat or extreme cold.\n\nFor extreme rainfall and tropical cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), which are two weather events that considerably affect the Tokio Marine Group, we consider the impact of climate change as follows.\n\nFigure 1: Confidence of impact forecasts of climate change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Created by Tokio Marine Holdings based on material prepared by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n\n## \u25ef Impact of Climate Change on Heavy Rains\n\nIn Japan, the frequency of heavy rains has been on the rise since 1900 (Figure 2). The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report released in August 2021 states that heavy rains will become more severe in the future in step with a temperature rise and that for every temperature rise of about 1\u00baC, the intensity (precipitation) of heavy rains will increase by approximately 7%.\n\nFigure 2: Days per year with precipitation of 100 mm or more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1901 1904 19071910 1913 1916 1919 1922 1925 1928 1931 1934 1937 1940 1943 19461949 1952 1955 1958 1961 1964 1967 1970 1973 1976 1979 1982 1985 1988 19911994 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015 2018 2021\n\nYear",

As a result, among the 1,154 business offices analyzed (489 business offices of Group companies in Japan and 665 business offices of TMNF\u029fs insurance agents), it was discovered that 203 business offices are located in areas with high risk of flooding, while 12 are in areas with high risk of landslide disasters.\n\nOur business offices are all located in typical office buildings, and each office has independently implemented crisis management measures. In addition, we have already investigated and analyzed the flood risk at TMNF\u029fs business offices and have not detected any notable negative impacts associated with the risk at this point. Nonetheless, these water-related risks could become increasingly apparent in the future, following a rise in the sea level and more frequent heavy rains due to global warming as well as changes in land use. For the identified business offices, we will proceed with further analysis and initiatives such as education and awareness programs for Group employees to prepare for future water-related risks.\n\n## Findings from the Analysis of Our Business Offices in Japan (including the Value Chain): Number of Business Offices Located in Priority Locations Exposed to Flood Immersion and Landslide Risks\n\n| No. of business offices analyzed   |   No. of business offices analyzed |   Located in areas with high risk of flood inundation | Located in areas with high risk of landslide disasters   |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 489                                |                                 86 |                                                     3 | Domestic Group companies                                 |\n| 665                                |                                117 |                                                     9 | Insurance agents of TMNF                                 |\n| 1,154                              |                                203 |                                                    12 | Total                                                    |\n\nSources: \u00b7Flood immersion risk: Based on digital national land information (areas subject to possible immersion by floods) (by river) (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)\n\n(https://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/ksj/gml/datalist/KsjTmplt-A31a-v4\u03320.html)\n\n\u00b7Landslide disaster risk: Based on digital national land information (areas prone to landslide disasters) (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)\n\n(https://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/ksj/gml/datalist/KsjTmplt-A33-v2\u03320.html)\n\n## (2) Transition Risks\n\nTransition risks are risks associated with the transition to a decarbonized society. As the global momentum toward decarbonization accelerates and the transition to a decarbonized society progresses, we anticipate more stringent regulations, technological innovation, asset value fluctuations, and changes in the investment environment as well as in customer needs, which could affect the Group\u029fs businesses.\n\nTransition risks include impact on the corporate value of investee companies and the value of assets held by the Company due to increased costs associated with GHG emissions resulting from climate change. To reduce the impact of these factors, we are decreasing total holdings of business-related equities and promoting engagement with investee companies.\n\nWe have estimated the impact of transition risks on assets under management by the Tokio Marine Group (equities, corporate bonds, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), and government bonds) using \u02a0Aladdin Climate,\u02a1 a model provided by BlackRock Solutions. With this model, we have quantified the impact on corporate value due to changes in scenario variables (e.g., carbon prices, energy demand, fuel prices, emissions) based on scenarios provided by The Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). More specifically, the quantification of the impact on corporate value has been conducted by comparing the scenario where current policies continue to 2050 (NGFS\u029fs Hot House World-Current Policies scenario, assuming limited policy changes and a 3.3\u00b0C temperature rise at the end of this century) with the following two scenarios, also of NGFS.\n\n(1) Orderly: Net Zero 2050 (assuming a temperature rise suppressed to 1.5\u00b0C and net zero CO2 emissions both by 2050) (2) Disorderly: Delayed Transition (assuming a 1.8\u00b0C temperature rise by 2050 due to delayed policy changes)\n\nThe following shows the results of the model-based estimates of transition risks of assets (equities, corporate bonds, CMBS, and government bonds) (impact analysis on asset prices based on scenarios up to 2050) held by the Tokio Marine Group as of March 31, 2024.\n\n|         | Transition risks   | Transition risks   |\n|---------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Orderly |                    | Disorderly         |\n| -2.1%   | -1.6%              | Total              |\n| -9.7%   | -7.0%              | Equities           |\n| -1.1%   | -0.8%              | Corporate bonds    |\n| -0.1%   | -0.5%              | CMBS               |\n| -0.1%   | -0.2%              | Government bonds   |\n\n* The Aladdin Climate analytics of BlackRock Solutions contained in this report should not be construed as a characterization of the materiality or financial impact of the corresponding information. The Aladdin Climate analytics include non-financial metrics and involve measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent to the nature of the corresponding data and the methods used for determining such data.

Moreover, we believe that this and other quantification models of climate change are still in the development stage, undergoing upgrades based on the latest research findings. We thus have no plan, at this point, to use the data in our management decision-making process, but will continue to carry out research and investigations to explore more appropriate ways to utilize such quantification modeling methods.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and\n\nthe Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human,\n\nIntellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability\n\nManagement\n\nGovernance\n\n## Implementation of Climate Change Strategy\n\nThe Tokio Marine Group assumes the roles of an insurance company, institutional investor, asset manager, global company, and good corporate citizen. In every role, we are promoting the creation of a safe, secure, and sustainable future to protect our customers and local communities in their times of need even 100 years from now.\n\n## As an Insurance Company\n\n## \u25ef Developing and Providing Renewable Energy-Related Products and Services\n\nAs part of our Group\u029fs global promotion system, we launched the GX Roundtable in 2023 to explore insurance products and services that support the transition to a decarbonized society across the Group. The first meeting, held in London, was attended by approximately 15 Group companies. Since then, these companies have been sharing their GX initiatives and engaging in discussions on collaboration within the Group and expanding business opportunities.\n\nIn addition, TMNF, a Group company, has established a dedicated GX department that is focusing its efforts on advancing GX initiatives to support customers in achieving carbon neutrality and transitioning to a decarbonized society, thereby contributing to industrial growth and development.\n\n## [Insurance and Services to Support Offshore Wind Power Generation]\n\nIn the Tokio Marine Group, TMNF has been underwriting insurance for offshore wind power generation projects across the world since 2013 when such projects were not yet widely known in Japan. In 2020, the Group acquired GCube, a leading company specializing in underwriting insurance for renewable energy operators. Through this and other moves, we are now regarded as one of the major international players in this field. Offshore wind power generation projects, which require large-scale investment, often entail project financing and involve various parties, including the manufacturer of windmills and other contractors. Thus, an insurance package exclusively designed for such projects plays a crucial role. Such an insurance package offers comprehensive and seamless total support in order to cover a variety of risks faced by each party involved in constructing and operating wind farms. As a managing underwriter, the Group offers globally competitive coverage in its insurance package.\n\nAt TMNF, premiums related to offshore wind power generation increased by about 2.8 billion yen from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023. We anticipate continued sharp market growth both in and outside Japan.\n\n## \u25a0 Electricity Generated by Offshore Wind Power\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Vision for Offshore Wind Power Industry (1st Draft), materials from the Japan Wind Power Association and partially surveyed by Tokio Marine Holdings\n\nIn addition, the Group, through TMNF and GCube, has underwritten insurance for 144 projects across 11 countries and regions. Offshore wind power generation is said to play a crucial role in shifting our main power source to renewable energy. We will continue to leverage the Group\u029fs strengths to generate synergies, support offshore wind power projects globally, and contribute to the transition to a decarbonized society.\n\n## \u25a0 Offshore Wind Power Generation Projects for which the Tokio Marine Group Has Underwritten Insurance\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\n## [Managing Climate-Related Risk Based on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)]\n\nThe Tokio Marine Group conducts enterprise risk management (ERM), which includes the management of climate risks. Through the ERM cycle, we comprehensively identify and assess risks, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches.\n\nIn the insurance business, which pursues profit through risk-taking, risk assessment is the foundation of our business.\n\nThe Group has been working for many years to assess material risks (including those due to natural disasters) both quantitatively and qualitatively. Specific initiatives are as follows.\n\n## Qualitative Risk Management\n\nWe identify all forms of risks comprehensively, including those for natural disasters such as large wind/flood and emerging risks due to environmental changes. Of these risks, we define risks that will have an extremely large impact on our financial soundness and business continuity as \u02a0material risks.\u02a1\n\nWe include the large wind/flood risks (including climate change physical risks) in the \u02a0material risks\u02a1 category, which we believe could become more frequent and severe due to the effects of climate change. For these material risks, we also formulate control measures prior to risk emergence and response measures for after risks occur.\n\n## Quantitative Risk Management\n\nFor material risks, we perform a multifaceted review of the adequacy of capital relative to the risks held, through measuring risk amounts and implementing stress tests as part of our quantitative risk management. This is done to maintain ratings and prevent bankruptcy.\n\nWe calculate risk amounts posed by natural disasters using a risk model (for Japan, a risk model we developed in-house based on engineering theory and the latest knowledge of natural disasters, and for overseas, models provided by outside vendors). We independently analyze past tropical cyclones (typhoons in Japan and hurricanes in the United States), torrential rains, and other changing trends and incorporate this data as necessary in order to properly assess current weather phenomena.\n\nFurthermore, within material risks, we conduct stress tests based on scenarios in which extreme economic losses are expected and scenarios where multiple material risks occur at the same time. As for risks involving major wind and flood disasters, for example, we assume these scenarios to be on a much larger scale than the major typhoons that hit the Greater Tokyo Area in 2018 and 2019 causing extensive damages. We update scenarios continuously while taking into account stress tests released by regulatory authorities of every country, the latest knowledge (including that of climate change), and recent case studies.\n\n## [Appropriately Control Risk through Risk Diversification and Reinsurance, etc.]\n\nNatural disasters are inevitable in Japan, our home market. For that reason, we have sought to control risk capital by geographic, business, and product risk diversification through M&A overseas. In addition, reinsurance, as a hedge against risk, is an effective way to protect our capital and stabilize profits. The Group utilizes reinsurance to prepare for major natural disasters (capital events) that occur once every few centuries, and we determine earnings coverage from the standpoint of economic rationality and take necessary measures.\n\n## [Acquisition of Knowledge (Industry-Academia Collaboration, etc.)]\n\nThe Tokio Marine Group is deepening collaboration with both inside and outside experts to acquire knowledge about risks. The Tokio Marine Research Institute collaborates with The University of Tokyo, Nagoya University, and Kyoto University, among others, to carry out impact analysis based on the possibility of increased insurance losses associated with natural disasters that are becoming more severe in nature.\n\nMoreover, Tokio Marine dR and a team of experts in natural disasters working in Atlanta, the United States, are leading efforts to upgrade natural disaster risk management across the entire Group, including various evaluations of natural disaster risk models.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nWhile Tokio Marine withdrew from the international initiative, the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), in May 2023, our commitment to contributing to the transition toward a decarbonized society based on the Paris Agreement remains unchanged.\n\n## \u25ef Metrics and Targets for Fiscal 2050\n\n- \u25cf Reduction of GHG emissions\n- Aiming to reduce GHG (CO2) emissions from the Tokio Marine Group to net zero by fiscal 2050 for our own operations (including insurance customers and investment and financing recipients)* 1,2\n\n## \u25ef Metrics and Targets for Fiscal 2030\n\n- \u25cf Reduction of GHG emissions\n- Reducing GHG emissions (CO2) for operations from the Tokio Marine Group by 60% (vs. 2015)* 3\n- \u25cf Renewable electricity use\n- Using 100% of renewable electricity at the Tokio Marine Group\u029fs major business facilities\n- \u25cf Electrification of company-owned vehicles (TMNF, TMNL, and NF)\n- Switching all vehicles owned by TMNF, TMNL, and NF to electrified vehicles (EV, PHV, HV, etc.)\n- \u25cf Engagements with customers (TMNF)\n- TMNF: Holding dialogue with 200 large corporate customers, which account for approximately 90% of its insurance-associated GHG emissions, and making Level 2 (see p. 90) or higher engagements with more than 160 customers among them; and requesting that 60 companies within GHG high-emission sectors, out of the 200 large corporate customers, formulate decarbonization plans, with the intention to decline transactions with those failing to present such plans by 2030\n\n## \u25ef Metrics and Targets for Fiscal 2026 (improvements over fiscal 2023)\n\n- \u25cf Improving profitability of fire insurance by around 15 billion yen* 4 from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026 (TMNF)\n- *1: Medium-term targets still under consideration\n- *2: Scope 3, Category 15, based on the GHG Protocol standards\n- *3: Associated with our own business activities (Scope 1 [direct emissions] + Scope 2 [indirect emissions] + Scope 3 [other indirect emissions; Categories 1, 3, 5, and 6] based on the GHG Protocol standards)\n- Scope 3 includes categories of importance to the Group for which numerical values can be obtained.\n- *4: Supposing natural catastrophe claims in an average year\n\n## GHG Emission Reduction Record\n\n## \u25ef Achieve Carbon Neutrality in Business Activities\n\n- \u25cf Reduction of GHG (CO2) emissions from Tokio Marine Group operations* 5 : 69,341* 6 tons (34% reduction vs. fiscal 2015) (Scope 1: 13,752 tons; Scope 2: 28,187 tons; Scope 3* 7 : 27,401 tons)\n- \u25cf Amount of GHG (CO2) fixed and reduced: 96,465 tons\n\nThe Tokio Marine Group is working to reduce the environmental impact (domestic and international) and become carbon neutral by (1) conserving energy and using energy more efficiently, (2) planting mangroves to absorb and fix CO2, (3) using renewable energy (such as by procuring green electricity), and (4) amortizing carbon credits. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2023 we achieved carbon neutrality for the 11th consecutive year (since fiscal 2013) thanks to the absorption and fixation effects of mangrove planting and the use of carbon credits outperforming the CO2 emissions generated by the Group\u029fs overall business activities.\n\n## \u25ef GHG Emissions for the Investment Portfolio\n\nTo assess the climate change-related risks and opportunities of its investee companies and financing recipients, TMNF has performed analysis of total GHG emissions and weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) on its domestic listed equity and bond portfolios as of March 31, 2023, the disclosure of which is recommended by the TCFD. The emissions and WACI of the portfolio as of March 31, 2023, are published in the TCFD Report 2024 on p. 41.\n\nWe will continue to urge our investee companies to fully disclose climate change-related information and work toward a decarbonized society through engagement, while also making use of this analysis.\n\n- *5: Associated with our own business activities (Scope 1 [direct emissions] + Scope 2 [indirect emissions] + Scope 3 [other indirect emissions; Categories 1, 3, 5, and 6] based on the GHG Protocol standards)",

Through my experience with both Tokio Marine\u029fs executive team and governance team, I feel that it is important to continuously strengthen and evolve both execution and governance in order to realize our purpose to \u02a0support our customers and society in their times of need\u02a1 and to improve medium- to long-term corporate value. \u02a0Diversity\u02a1 and \u02a0core identity\u02a1 are important as driving forces behind this.\n\nIn an era when societal issues are expanding and becoming more complex, it is important to incorporate more and more \u02a0diversity\u02a1 into business execution and governance, and to evolve the Board of Directors through new and diverse perspectives in order to capture the changing needs of society. Tokio Marine has been operating under a hybrid corporate governance structure for nearly 20 years. Immediately after the establishment of the holding company, the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee were established based on the structure of a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board. The Board of Directors makes high-quality decisions by making maximum use of expertise of Outside Directors and external Audit & Supervisory Board Members in executing important business operations. While emphasizing such advisory and management functions, the Board of Directors has also worked to strengthen the monitoring function that supervises the execution of duties by Directors, for example, by increasing the ratio of outside directors. Most recently, a series of governance issues led to the establishment of the \u02a0Group Audit Committee\u02a1 in fiscal 2024 to examine the appropriateness of business processes and culture, etc., using an \u02a0external perspective.\u02a1 These changes are part of our organizational structure, but I believe they are the result of a thorough focus on the question of \u02a0whether we can have a good discussion\u02a1 that leads to the realization of our purpose and the enhancement of our corporate value, rather than on mere formality.\n\nHowever, the more \u02a0diversity\u02a1 is incorporated, the more difficult it is to determine the direction in which the members are heading, so \u02a0core identity\u02a1 is also important. In an era of rapid change, the structure of the Board of Directors and the content of the discussions vary at all times. However, the Board of Directors\u029f \u02a0core identity,\u02a1 which has not changed in any era or situation, is that discussions and decisions are based on \u02a0the realization of our purpose and the enhancement of corporate value,\u02a1 as well as \u02a0guiding the Group\u029fs businesses and society into the future.\u02a1 What I expect from each Board of Directors member, both internal and external, is that internal members, for example, are free to participate in discussions while providing sufficient internal information necessary to elicit meaningful opinions in Board of Directors meetings and to have high-level discussions. I want external members to not be afraid of\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\nhaving conflicting opinions with executives, to speak out, and to advise and supervise the executives\u029f responses. At the root of each is a relationship of mutual trust, which is our \u02a0core identity.\u02a1 All Board of Directors members with their own fields of expertise and ideas have this \u02a0core identity\u02a1 and engage in open and dynamic discussions from diverse perspectives. By doing so, I believe we can draw better conclusions.\n\n## Tasks of the Board of Directors\n\nSince 2011, Tokio Marine has conducted a survey of all Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. In 2022, we first began effectiveness evaluations of the Board of Directors by a third-party organization as part of our efforts to increase the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. In this context, it has been evaluated that the roles and functions of both the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board have been appropriately fulfilled and the Board of Directors has been able to secure a high level of effectiveness. On the other hand, issues have been highlighted. In concrete terms, we should spend more time discussing important long-term issues, such as fundamental policies for achieving our purpose, corporate culture and global strategies, and free discussions based on environmental changes. We did incorporate these strategic discussions into the regular agenda four or five times a year, but I cannot say that the discussions have been thoroughly carried out. For this reason, since last year, we decided to hold additional meetings that are only to discuss corporate strategies in August and January. We will engage in far-reaching discussions from a broad and long-term perspective in order to realize our purpose and raise corporate value. We will lead the Group\u029fs businesses and society into the future. This is one of the major roles that the Board of Directors is expected to play, and we will develop the necessary systems to achieve this.\n\n## And Finally\n\nAs the Chairman of the Board, I have made every effort to ensure the transparency and credibility of our discussions and to make the Board of Directors a place where we can engage in open, dynamic, and forward-looking discussions. This stance remains unchanged. I want to lead the discussion so that the members can focus on topics such as are there any important points overlooked, or are there any problems with the direction the company is heading, the process or mechanism of initiatives, or awareness?\n\nWe will continue to respond to the changing times by flexibly and continuously evolving the Board of Directors and engaging in substantial discussions toward the realization of our purpose and the enhancement of corporate value that Tokio Marine seeks to achieve.",

At Holdings, management discussions were conducted from a broader perspective and from a more medium- to long-term perspective, and it was a year in which I realized the scale of the discussions.\n\nMatsuyama Since I had worked as an Outside Director of a financial holding company in the past, I felt that the relationship between Holdings and the operating companies and the management on a global scale were similar. On the other hand, last year the price-fixing of corporate insurance premiums was discovered in TMNF, one of our core subsidiaries, and we held discussions at the Board of Directors throughout the year. I felt that there were problems and structural issues specific to the non-life insurance industry.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n## The Board of Directors\u029f Contributions to Governance Issues\n\nSecretariat The price-fixing of corporate insurance premiums that occurred in TMNF was a serious issue that called into question the effectiveness of governance. Following the discovery of the incident, the FSA issued a report submission order, an order for business improvement in December, and TMNF submitted a business improvement plan in February. Amidst these series of developments, what were the discussions taking place in Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board? Shimizu The incident in TMNF, our founding business, caused significant concern to our stakeholders. The management took this situation very seriously and immediately moved to confirm the facts and conduct an in-depth investigation. In the Company\u029fs Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board, the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, in particular, gave strong advice that a thorough investigation should be conducted not only into cases that might violate the Anti-Monopoly Act but also any conduct that was deemed inappropriate.\n\nMatsuyama Of course, we must take into account the fact of price-fixing seriously and reflect on it. Furthermore, if a similar incident is discovered after the problem has been resolved, we will further lose the trust of our stakeholders, which will be a major blow to our management. I feel that the management policy of resolving all problems at once and eliminating all fundamental problems was appropriate.\n\nShimizu An in-depth investigation was carried out by the Special Investigation Committee in order to remove the corruption, and the progress was reported to the Board of Directors. After receiving this report, I believe that the \u02a0external perspective\u02a1 of the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members contributed to the depth of the discussions and the objectivity of the decisions in the course of the Company\u029fs true cause analysis. In particular, the broad perspectives of Mr. Endo, Mr. Katanozaka, and Mr. Shindo, who have extensive experience in corporate management, have been very instructive to me.\n\nMatsuyama I believe that an \u02a0external perspective\u02a1 is indispensable to Tokio Marine today. I am the chairperson of the \u02a0Group Audit Committee,\u02a1 which was established to strengthen the supervisory function of the Board of Directors. As stated in the business improvement plan submitted by TMNF this time, in order to correct the \u02a0gap in common sense (business standards)\u02a1 with the public and society that was occurring unconsciously. It is necessary to incorporate an \u02a0external perspective.\u02a1 One of the roles of the Group Audit Committee is to examine whether there are any gaps with the common sense of society and the general public by delving into the cultures of Tokio Marine and Group companies in Japan and overseas. Based on the discussions at the first committee meeting held in May, I strongly feel the significance of these roles.\n\nShimizu It\u029fs not easy to change the structure of the industry or the culture.\n\nMatsuyama\n\nAs Ms. Shimizu said, the incident that occurred\n\nlast year was largely related to structural problems, and I think it originated from the formation of the business itself. That\u029fs why change is so difficult, and Tokio Marine alone cannot solve the problem. However, I believe that Tokio Marine, which should lead the industry, should take the lead in creating rules, and that it is necessary to approach stakeholders and regulatory authorities and work on the issue as a whole. Cultural reform is also an important issue. At the recent meeting of the Group Audit Committee, we shared the voices of mid-career employees of TMNF with the aim of re-inspection of our common sense (historically accepted business practices). For mid-career employees with an outside perspective, Tokio Marine's corporate culture sometimes seems strange. For example, Tokio Marine advocates \u02a0freedom and open-mindedness,\u02a1 but depending on the generation and the environment, it seems that there is a gap between this corporate culture and reality. Employees in the mid-level and above who have joined the Company as new graduates are proud of the fact that the corporate culture of \u02a0freedom and open-mindedness,\u02a1 in which employees think and act independently and have open and frank communication, has nurtured people and built a strong organization. On the other hand, there are cases in which the younger generation and employees hired for careers are not able to feel the corporate culture of \u02a0freedom and open-mindedness.\u02a1 If an organization has become conspicuously homogeneous, there is a danger that it will be difficult to notice gaps in common sense and incongruity with society. To put it another way, if we can accept diverse values and incorporate the awareness gained from an external perspective, we will be able to notice and change the gaps in common sense. I would like to start our discussion on culture by consciously listening to the voices of people in various environments and positions, such as mid-career employees and overseas employees, and sharing their insights.\n\nShimizu It really leads to the true cause of this incident.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I think that \u02a0external perspective\u02a1 leads to an opportunity to speak out about such a \u02a0strange\u02a1 structure of the industry and to change it. We, the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, should bring common sense to the execution of business. In the Board of Directors, under the leadership of Mr. Nagano, the Chairman, an environment has been created in which open discussions can be held. If I feel something is irregular, I would like to continue to point it out and engage in lively discussions. Matsuyama You are right. There might be aspects that are difficult to notice within the company, or there might be information that is difficult to obtain, so I think it is also our role to communicate such awareness and stimulate the company. The Group Audit Committee also deliberates on issues that have arisen in other companies in the same industry or in other industries from the perspective of whether there is a possibility of such incidents occurring at Tokio Marine and whether there are measures that can be considered at the present time. Let this be a lesson to us. As for the price-fixing of corporate insurance premiums adjustment incident, we should reflect on why we could not notice it until now (there might have been an opportunity to notice it), so I would like to play a role from the perspective of detecting future concerns.\n\n## What Tokio Marine, as a global insurer, needs to do to further increase its corporate value (the essence of global management)\n\nSecretariat Tokio Marine has used the Purpose as a starting point to solve societal issues and increase corporate value as a result. In this age of uncertainty, what do you think is necessary for Tokio Marine to further increase its corporate value and continue to grow as a global company?\n\nShimizu At present, North America accounts for a large share of the entire Tokio Marine Group. In the future, it might be necessary to install headquarters functions not only in Japan but also in North America, for example. Including this topic, I think that we need to discuss medium- to long-term strategies for Tokio Marine\u029fs growth as a global insurer in a more in-depth and realistic manner. Matsuyama Tokio Marine's International business has achieved an industry leading position within its different segments as a result of respecting the autonomy of each operating company and allowing them to utilize their unique DNA. On top of that, human resources with a high level of expertise and knowledge will gather on a global scale to manage the Group as a whole, enhance the organization, and generate synergies. I have looked at the governance systems of various companies from a lawyer\u029fs perspective, but it is not possible for any company to expand its business on the basis of such a relationship of\n\ntrust. As we expand our operations on a global scale, the roles of the Board of Directors will change depending on how we manage our operations from a global perspective. We must deepen our discussions on these issues. Shimizu On a slightly different angle, when the Noto Peninsula Earthquake occurred in January of this year, the Disaster Response Headquarters was set up immediately after the disaster, and I heard reports that Group employees worked together to grasp the damage, build a support system, and promptly respond to customers in cooperation with agencies. I was very excited to see the employees thinking about what the Group as a whole can do now and what to do in the future and exchanging opinions. Tokio Marine is able to protect customers all over the world when a disaster strikes Japan, or something happens around the world because it spreads risk and expands its businesses. And we have the people who make it happen. Every day, I felt that our Purpose was \u02a0protecting our customers and society in their times of need.\u02a1 To borrow Mr. Komiya\u029fs words, \u02a0Under any circumstances, we will keep our promises to our customers.\u02a1 This is possible only because Tokio Marine has expanded and grown globally. I think it is also important for our domestic businesses and overseas\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nbusinesses, as well as domestic employees and overseas employees, to feel more connected to each other through this sense of purpose.\n\nMatsuyama Last year, when a large-scale forest fire occurred on the Hawaiian island of Maui, support was provided remotely from Japan as we have extensive experience in dealing with natural catastrophe damage. The fact that the Group as a whole is protecting people in their times of need in Japan and overseas is also linked to the pride of working at a good company.\n\nShimizu In addition to in their times of need, we are expanding our businesses in \u02a0pre- and post-incident areas,\u02a1 such as disaster prevention and mitigation, with the aim of \u02a0always\u02a1 protecting our customers. This will certainly increase Tokio Marine\u029fs corporate value, but I still think it will be difficult to generate large profits immediately in the businesses that have just been launched. I feel that it is important to create a company in which employees involved in these solutions businesses can feel a sense of purpose and work with enthusiasm. Matsuyama You are right. These businesses will create a new world, contribute to society, and improve Tokio Marine\u029fs economic interests. For example, in the area of disaster prevention and mitigation, by providing services that reduce damage caused by natural catastrophes and prevent recurrences, we can eventually reduce the number of insurance payment incidents, which will make a significant contribution to profits. It is difficult to quantify the specific impact, but I heard that the Company is starting to take on the challenge of quantitative measurement. I believe that this initiative will give employees involved in our businesses, as well as our stakeholders, a sense of Tokio Marine\u029fs corporate value.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\nShimizu Although we have made steady progress step by step toward the realization of our Purpose, it might be a little difficult to realize this Purpose in your daily work. I would like to discuss with everyone, including young people, how to relate the significance of \u02a0always\u02a1 protecting our customers in their times of need to their work and how to make it more rewarding. Employees can become enthusiastic about what the company is aiming for. There is an enthusiastic purpose. As we expand our businesses globally, I think that if we can share this kind of corporate value with everyone, Tokio Marine will be a unique company.\n\nMatsuyama In discussing strategies for the new MTP, we backcasted from our medium- to long-term vision. We also discussed our strategies based on environmental changes. Looking at Tokio Marine over the past year as an Outside Director, I was convinced that Tokio Marine\u029fs solutions business initiatives and TMNF\u029fs reforms are all important initiatives for the future of Tokio Marine, and that we must steadily implement these initiatives, and that if we do so, our corporate value will surely increase. In terms of the governance issues I talked about at the beginning, it\u029fs a huge opportunity in a way to review the current situation and correct the distortions in the company and the industry. Rather than just improving our own company, we should look at the problems of the entire non-life insurance industry. As a leading company in the industry, we should undertake thorough reforms and Holdings will support the reform of the operating companies and fulfill its responsibility as a supervisor. Shimizu We, the Outside Directors and the Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, as members of this Group, will spare no effort in these initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, to increase the monitoring function of the Board of Directors, the rate of outside directors should generally exceed one-third, with 47% currently being outside directors. Furthermore, the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee, which ensure transparency in the process of determining the nomination and remuneration of Directors, consist of a majority of outside officers and are both chaired by an outside officer.\n\nSince its founding in 2002, the Company has worked to improve its corporate governance. In this way, we have\n\n## \u25ef Corporate Governance System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\n- \u25cf Deliberates appointment and dismissal of the President, Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and Executive Officers; reports to the Board of Directors\n- \u25cf Deliberates the President\u029fs succession plan and supervises the development of successor candidates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutside officer selected as Committee Chair\n\n## [New]\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n- \u25cfDeliberates policies related to President, Director, and Executive Officer performance evaluations, compensation systems and levels, and determination of officer compensation; reports to the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutside officer selected as Committee Chair\n\n## Group Audit Committee\n\n- \u25cf Utilizes external perspectives to examine the appropriateness of business processes and culture\n- \u25cf Confirms the status of formulation and implementation of appropriate measures to prevent recurrence in response to incidents of misconduct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOutside officer selected as Committee Chair\n\ndetermined that the current system, which emphasizes management functions while also ensuring monitoring functions, is optimal at this point in time. However, we also believe that we must be in constant pursuit of the most optimal solutions to improve monitoring functions, including ways of institutional designing, increasing the number of non-Japanese directors, and increasing the ratio of outside directors and female directors.\n\nIn response to a number of incidents of misconduct, including the incident of price-fixing of corporate insurance premiums in a Group company in Japan and a governance incident in a Group company outside Japan, we decided that it was necessary to further strengthen our internal control system and internal auditing functions. Accordingly, on April 1, 2024, we established the Group Audit Committee, which includes an external perspective, to strengthen our Board of Directors\u029f supervisory functions. Including these initiatives, we will strive to further strengthen governance at the Group level (see pp. 36, 37 for details).\n\nPurpose Story\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual,

As part of that, the Company, as the insurance holding company taking charge of the Group, is building highly sound and transparent corporate governance and internal controls, as well as administering Group companies as appropriate. The Board of Directors in this company with an Audit & Supervisory Board makes important business decisions as well as supervises the work of the directors.\n\nFor the Board of Directors to properly fulfill its role, the board needs to possess the necessary skills on the basis of the business content, business development, governance structure, and so forth of Tokio Marine Group. Moreover, the necessary skills will differ depending on changes in the business environment. To facilitate important business decisions and proper supervision in the Company, board members first need to deeply understand the business, which means having a thorough understanding of the \u02a0insurance business.\u02a1 Moreover, the basis of all decision-making is skills in \u02a0financial economics,\u02a1 \u02a0financial accounting and finance,\u02a1 \u02a0legal compliance,\u02a1 \u02a0human resources strategy,\u02a1 and \u02a0governance and risk management.\u02a1 Moreover, as the planet\u029fs environment and technological innovation have become issues for society, the importance of skills pertaining to \u02a0environment\u02a1 and\u02a0technology\u02a1 is growing as well.\n\nIn addition, Directors are expected to have skills relating to\u02a0internationality\u02a1 and \u02a0business administration.\u02a1 Considering our global business reach, insights from global environmental awareness and business administration are extremely beneficial for the Tokio Marine Group.\n\nWe also consider it preferable for the Audit & Supervisory Board members to have skills similar to those of the members of the Board of Directors, so that they can properly audit the work of the Board of Directors. Skills in \u02a0financial accounting and finance\u02a1 are considered as especially important.\n\nBased on this direction, we appoint four outside directors with business administration experience (one has extensive experience as a business administration consultant). Moreover, the outside directors also include a lawyer, an analyst, and an academic expert. Most of the outside directors have rich international experience. In summary, the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board consist of members with diverse skills. Within the framework of the Board of Directors, etc., the outside directors provide advice about the management of the Company based on these skills. In addition, from a gender perspective, we have appointed three female directors and two female Audit & Supervisory Board members so that the ratio of female members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board is 25%.\n\n|                   |                                                                   |

Tokio Marine conducted evaluations of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in fiscal 2022 using a third-party organization and will continue to do so as necessary. In addition, on April 1, 2024, we established the Group Audit Committee, which incorporates an external perspective into our internal auditing function, further strengthening our Board of Directors supervisory function.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data",

To this end, the Board of Directors holds \u02a0Discussions on Corporate Strategy,\u02a1 which are discussions about themes such as management challenges and the business environment. The themes are selected based on questionnaire responses from directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members as well as themes that come up at \u02a0independent officers\u029f meetings.\u02a1\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we held discussions on the following themes, and similar discussions will be held in fiscal 2024. The Company also holds one meeting a year that is attended by independent officers only. It is entirely conducted by Independent Directors and Independent Audit & Supervisory Board members, including establishing agenda items. Opinions are exchanged objectively and from broad perspectives. In fiscal 2023, discussions were held on medium- to long-term strategy, Group governance, and other issues, with recommendations made based on these discussion.\n\n## \u25ef \u02a0Discussions on Corporate Strategy\u02a1 Themes\n\n| Fiscal year Themes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| (1) The ideal structure of the Board of Directors We discussed the current status of the Board of Directors and what the ideal structure is in light of the business  environment and changes in the environment over the medium to long term.

At the same time, the composition of the members of the Board of Directors is designed to achieve an optimal balance.\n\nIn addition, the Company has its own criteria for determining independency, and in principle, only persons who meet these criteria are appointed as Outside Directors. Based on these standards, all seven Outside Directors are deemed to be independent from Tokio Marine, and all of them have been registered as independent directors as stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.",

This system constitutes more than 20% of directors\u029f compensation.\n\nIn 2024, for the same purpose and to raise awareness of the \u02a0integrated group management,\u02a1 we introduced a post-delivery type stock-based compensation system using Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) for officers (CEO or equivalent) of subsidiaries in Japan and overseas that meet the criteria. The beneficiaries of this plan do not include the beneficiaries of the stock ownership plan.\n\ncompensation, from fiscal 2022 we are introducing \u02a0employee engagement indicators\u02a1 and \u02a0sustainability indicators\u02a1 as KPIs to determine corporate performance compensation, thereby creating a system that reflects compensation linked with performance. In fiscal 2023, we increased the ratio of non-financial indicators from 10% to 20% to further promote employee engagement and sustainability.\n\nIn the future, we will aim to continuously raise the level and realize high and consistent incentive accountability based on new developments in internal discussions about sustainability strategies and trends in the maturation and establishment of ways to evaluate non-financial indicators in the market.\n\n## Amount of Compensation\n\nThe Compensation of Directors and Auditors is as follows: \u25a0Internal Director \u25a0Internal Auditor \u25a0Outside Director \u25a0Outside Auditor 1,000 (millions of JPY)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, through constructive dialogue between management and shareholders and investors, the Company will gain an appropriate understanding of how it is viewed and the state of the capital markets and provide that understanding and feedback to management and within the Company to lead to the improvement of management itself and further enhance corporate value.\n\nIn April 2023, we established the Global Communications Department as an organization responsible for the interdepartmental operations of external IR, SR, and PR and internal communications, with the aim of further strengthening dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, including the capital markets, shareholders, the media, and employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dialogue with Investors\n\n## Dialogue with Institutional Investors\n\nOrganizing financial results conference calls, IR conferences, and theme-focused strategy conferences, the Company holds these both onsite and on the Internet (broadcast live across the globe) and is thereby engaging in dialogue with shareholders and investors around the world.\n\nAt an IR conference held in May 2024, we expressed our determination to turn TMNF into a \u02a0truly trusted customer-oriented company,\u02a1 based on our New MTP and a series of incidents and received high marks.\n\nIn April 2024, we launched the Global Communications Department\u029fs New York Desk to further strengthen our dialogue system with shareholders and investors. For example, the year-end financial results announcement in May was distributed online from the New York Desk to reporters and media familiar with the local insurance industry.\n\nWe also continuously hold briefings focusing on topics of high interest in the capital markets. In fiscal 2023, Special IR Meetings were held in London and New York City, where presentations were made by the CEOs and executives of major subsidiaries in Europe and the United States, and Q&A sessions were held with participants. In Japan, we also held two special briefings on overseas subsidiaries, featuring the CEOs of overseas subsidiaries as speakers, and received favorable responses.\n\nIn addition to these activities, we held dialogues with a total of 518 investors in Japan and overseas, including overseas IR activities in North America, Europe, and Asia, in fiscal 2023. (May 2024 IR conference video)\n\nhttps://webcast.net-ir.ne.jp/87662405e/index.html\n\n## Dialogue with Individual Investors\n\nWe hold conferences for individual investors every year, featuring the Group CEO. In fiscal 2023, conferences were held in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Aichi. Investors are satisfied with the Company\u029fs easy-to-understand explanations that focus on the \u02a0Group\u029fs Management Strategy\u02a1 and \u02a0shareholder returns,\u02a1 which are of great interest to individual investors.\n\nWe will continue to engage in careful dialogue with our shareholders to expand our fan base and increase the number of individual shareholders and the percentage of shares held by individual shareholders.\n\n(Conference video, Japanese only)\n\nhttps://www.irmovie.jp/nir2/?conts=tokiomarinehd\u033220230 9\u0332bLn5\n\n## Feedback\n\nThe Company is also making efforts to report the opinions obtained through dialogue with shareholders and investors widely to management and other members of the Company, and to reflect them in improvement of management. Many of our employees have no contact with the capital markets in their daily work, but through the IR activity reporting sessions, they understand the voices of the capital markets, the evaluation of the Company, and the connection between their work and the capital markets. This has a positive impact on their own motivation and growth and, as a result, a virtuous circle of company growth is also created.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we also used remote tools to share and interact with approximately 2,600 Group employees.\n\n## Awards Related to Disclosure\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we have received various awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWICI Japan Integrated Report Awards 2023 Gold Award (Great Company Award)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMay 2024 IR conference\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurpose Story\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\n## Presentation by the Group CEO\n\nTo promote a deeper understanding of the Company\u029fs management and business, the Group CEO routinely conducts presentations.

In addition, the Company monitors the status and practical application of its internal control system. The Group Audit Committee deliberates on the results of this monitoring, and the Board of Directors confirms the details of these deliberations.

As regards the number of reports and consultations received by the Group in fiscal 2023, there were 372 cases (118% compared with fiscal 2022).

Reports and discussions are also held twice a year by the Board of Directors, where outside directors with IT expertise also participate.\n\nSpecifically, we are promoting countermeasures by adopting global standard frameworks and standard architectures such as ISO 27001* 1 and NIST SP800. The Tokio Marine Group\u029fs basic ideas and compliance standards are determined from the perspective of people, processes, and technologies, and include constant monitoring, log analyses, periodic vulnerability-scanning, penetration tests, and risk assessments. Furthermore, to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks that are becoming more sophisticated year by year, we use the PDCA cycle to formulate and execute improvement plans in response to issues identified in this process, while taking into account the amount of risk at each Group company, intelligence gained from inside and outside the Group, and the application of new technologies.\n\nInformation Security Management,\u02a1 each company establishes departments to oversee information security management and formulate policies and regulations. To protect information assets from various information leakage risks, including leak, loss, and unauthorized use, we ensure the confidentiality of information assets and manage them so that they can be used when necessary. Furthermore, the Company regularly monitors the information security management of Group companies, setting up structures and providing information when necessary.\n\nUnder the Tokio Marine Group CSIRT* 2 , the entire Group has also been divided into three regions\u0336North, America, Europe, and Japan/Asia\u0336and we are consolidating our organization and standardizing our technologies and processes at a high level. Each region carries out regular countermeasures such as employee training, including security monitoring on a daily basis, cyber drills (conducted multiple times a year mainly for relevant parties), targeted e-mail drills (conducted multiple times a year for all employees), etc. Also, in the event of a cyber incident, each region strives to establish an efficient and effective system by identifying the scope of the impact and promptly implementing initial responses, recovery, and recurrence prevention measures to prevent the spread of damage while cooperating with other regions.\n\nA Group-wide committee made up of security experts gathers knowledge from around the world and promotes advanced security measures to support our customers and society in their times of need.\n\n- *1: Tokio Marine & Nichido Systems, the core systems company of the Tokio Marine Group, acquired ISO 27001 certification\n- *2: Abbreviation of Computer Security Incident Response Team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurpose Story\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n## \u25ef (Reference) Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance\u029fs Response to Customers Regarding \u02a0Fraudulent Insurance Claims by Former BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd.\u02a1 (August 2023)\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., issued a news release in August 2023 in connection with the fraudulent insurance claims by the sheet metal division of the former BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd.* We will place the highest priority on the recovery of customers who have suffered damage due to this incident, etc. We will remove the concerns of customers who have had their cars repaired by BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd., will take measures to recover the damage of customers who have actually received unauthorized repairs, and will advance initiatives to prevent recurrence.\n\n*Three companies: BIGMOTOR Co., Ltd., BM Holdings Co., Ltd., and BM Hanaten Co., Ltd.\n\n## Recognition of major issues\n\n- (1) Failure to detect malicious and organizational fraudulent claims at an early stage\n- (2) There was room for improvement in the operation of the designated factory system from the customer\u029fs perspective\n\n## Main responses and measures to prevent recurrence\n\n## [Measures to Recover Customers\u029f Damage]\n\n- \u00b7 Set up a dedicated call center for customers and investigate to determine the amount of fraud\n- \u00b7 Support for safety inspections\n- \u00b7 Implementation of contract confirmation procedures such as grade correction\n\n## [Measures to Prevent Recurrence]\n\n(1) Further strengthen the damage assessment system\n\n(2) Start of a repair shop matching service (open network information of designated factories)*\n\n- *: For more information, please refer to the news releases dated August 1, 2023, and March 29, 2024.

We took the business improvement order seriously, and in order to ensure that such a situation never occurs again, taking into account the true cause based on the results of various investigations, we examined recurrence prevention measures from all perspectives, including mechanisms and systems (contracting processes, organizations, systems, and governance), awareness, and knowledge, and formulated a business improvement plan that includes clarifying management responsibilities.\n\n## 1. Management\u029fs View\n\nThe inappropriate conduct that we have caused this time is an act that damages the interests of our customers and fundamentally loses the \u02a0trust of our customers\u02a1 which is the starting point of all of Tokio Marine\u029fs business activities. We take it seriously as management and deeply regret it. On that basis, Tokio Marine never viewed this incident as \u02a0just a problem of premium adjustment,\u02a1 but continued to pursue the true cause behind the problem.\n\nTo recover the trust lost by our customers and society, and to become a \u02a0truly trusted customer-oriented company\u02a1 that realizes \u02a0always supporting and protecting customers and society in their times of need,\u02a1 our Purpose, that we have inherited since our foundation in 1879 without interruption, management will take the lead in creating a sound organizational culture that emphasizes compliance and customer first, and we will work to fundamentally strengthen our management control system. At the same time, we will make company-wide efforts to improve our operations.\n\nNon-life insurance has the social infrastructure function of \u02a0protecting customers and society in their times of need\u02a1 by providing compensation in the event of an emergency. To \u02a0protect customers and society in their times of need,\u02a1 it is necessary to accurately understand the risks and issues surrounding our customers and then provide the most appropriate policies and services. We believe that this is the true value of our policies. From this perspective, Tokio Marine believes that a \u02a0truly trusted customer-oriented company\u02a1 means \u02a0a company that can fulfill its roles in delivering the true value of its policies to customers and society.\u02a1 In the area of corporate insurance in particular, we believe that Tokio Marine\u029fs roles are to contribute to the risk management and the enhancement of corporate value of client companies through the provision of \u02a0true value of our policies.\u02a1\n\nIn the past, Tokio Marine intended to conduct its business based on a customer-oriented approach. However, in light of the factors that led to the occurrence of the inappropriate conduct, Tokio Marine has unconsciously acted based on the \u02a0common sense (historically accepted business practices) of the non-life insurance industry and Tokio Marine,\u02a1 and there has been a \u02a0gap\u02a1 between the \u02a0customer-oriented approach that should have existed\u02a1 and the \u02a0customer-oriented approach that was the basis of Tokio Marine\u029fs actual conduct.\u02a1\n\nWith the launch of the new Mid-Term Business Plan in fiscal 2024, we have defined \u02a0customer-first\u02a1 as judging and acting from the perspective of \u02a0how to provide the true value of insurance,\u02a1 based on the customer\u029fs perspective and the \u02a0common sense (business standards) of customers and society\u02a1 as the starting point for all our thinking and actions, with the aim of restoring customer trust and realizing our Purpose. We will fundamentally review all of our business processes from the customer\u029fs perspective. We will also share this decision-making criteria with our business partners, our agents, with the aim of becoming a \u02a0truly trusted customer-oriented company.\u02a1 Under the \u02a0Re-New\u02a1 concept, which is the key concept of the new Mid-Term Business Plan, all executives and employees will be fully aware of the current situation in Tokio Marine, and we will strive to regain trust and realize our Purpose with the determination to \u02a0transform ourselves into a new company.\u02a1\n\nWith this incident as an opportunity, we will ensure that each and every one of our directors and employees is able to provide the true value of insurance, that there are no gaps with the common sense (business standards) of our customers and society, and that our decision-making criteria is on the right track. We will strive to instill these perspectives into the corporate culture of Tokio Marine, and at the same time, we will establish an organizational structure suitable for providing the functions of the social infrastructure, develop the employees who will be responsible for this, and review various rules and regulations.\n\n## 2. Policy for Future Initiatives\n\nThe purpose of the Antimonopoly Act is to maintain and promote \u02a0fair and free competition.\u02a1 We will ensure that all employees understand that the Antimonopoly Act is a fundamental rule that must be observed in a free economic society. Based on this, we will advance the following initiatives with the aim of becoming a \u02a0truly trusted customer-oriented company,\u02a1 which will continue to be chosen by customers by providing the \u02a0true value of insurance.\u02a1\n\n\u0146\n\n## (1) Fundamental review of industry practices that have taken root Tokio Marine\n\nIn some cases, the lead insurer and trading share are determined by factors such as the volume of premiums, holding status of business-related equities, and the degree of cooperation in core business, rather than the \u02a0true value of insurance\u02a1 that Tokio Marine wants to provide to client companies. It is true that our Company has been competing not only in terms of \u02a0true value of insurance\u02a1 but also in the aforementioned areas. Taking this incident as a turning point, we will take a fresh look at what Tokio Marine\u029fs responsibility to provide customers is and what we should do for them. For example, we will fundamentally review various industry practices that have taken root in Tokio Marine, such as eliminating business-related equities, eliminating excessive cooperation in core businesses, and breaking free from excessive competition targeting agents rather than client companies.\n\n## (2) Review of internal systems and mechanisms\n\nWe will not only fundamentally strengthen our business management system and establish an appropriate compliance system but also review our internal systems and mechanisms to ensure proper sales promotion. In Tokio Marine, sales targets have long been managed by the top-line (written premium), and the achievement of organizational sales targets has been a major focus of the in-house award program. In the performance evaluation systems for individual employees, individual top-line targets were set based on organizational targets, and evaluations focused on achieving those targets. In the future, we will review the system to evaluate proposals and provision of \u02a0true value of insurance\u02a1 to client companies.\n\n## (3) Strengthening of human resource development\n\nIn addition to responding to increasingly severe natural catastrophes and increasingly complex diverse risks, it is Tokio Marine\u029fs responsibility to contribute to the improvement of risk management and corporate value of client companies by providing long-term, stable, and appropriately priced optimal insurance programs that include measures to prevent accidents and minimize damage in order for client companies to continue their businesses. At the same time, Tokio Marine was sometimes preoccupied with short-term competition and market share. As a result, the company was unable to make sufficient efforts to enhance client companies\u029f understanding of insurance.\n\nIn the future, we will focus even more on human resource development so that our employees can provide higher value as risk management professionals. We also aim to develop \u02a0flexible and robust employees,\u02a1 who are able to find optimal solutions that satisfy both client companies and Tokio Marine, and who are able to build lasting relationships of trust with client companies.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital Capital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial and Non-Financial Data\n\n## \u25ef (Reference) Information Leakage due to E-mail Communication between Insurance Agencies and Insurance Companies (May and July 2024)\n\nA news release was issued on May 23, 2024, after it was discovered that TMNF customer information had been leaked by sending and receiving e-mails containing TMNF customer information in e-mail communications between insurance agents and other non-life insurance companies. In the course of a series of investigations triggered by this incident, it was discovered that a TMNF employee on loan to an agent had caused information leakage by sending e-mails to TMNF, the home company, with contract information of other insurers within the agent to which the employee had been loaned to. We have received a report submission order from the FSA regarding the leakage of personal data and the provision of information to a third party without the consent of the customer pertaining to \u02a0information leakage due to e-mail communication between insurance agencies and insurance companies\u02a1 (issued a news release on July 23). We will continue our investigation to clarify the whole picture, investigate the true cause, and thoroughly implement measures to prevent recurrence.\n\nMay 23, 2024 Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\nApology Regarding Information Leaks Due to Email Communication Between Insurance Agents and Insurance Companies\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. (President: Hiroaki Shirota, hereinafter referred to as \u02a0the Company\u02a1) has confirmed that customer information was included in emails exchanged between insurance agents and other non-life insurance companies. We hereby report that a customer information leak has been verified.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the significant concern and inconvenience caused to our customers and all stakeholders.\n\nTo address any worries or inquiries regarding this matter, we have set up a contact point for inquiries at 0120-773-826.\n\n## 1. Overview of the Incident\n\nThe incident involves the leak of customer information from the Company to representatives of co-insurance companies through emails sent by the management departments of various insurance agents, including automobile dealerships. Instances were identified where emails containing customer information were sent to insurance agents with co-insurance representatives included in the CC field, as well as cases where emails containing information from co-insurance companies were received.\n\nUnfortunately, there was a lack of awareness regarding the Personal Information Protection Act and insufficient recognition of the risks associated with information leakage within the Company, which hindered our ability to prevent such leaks. Recently, a Company representative flagged a potential information leak after receiving an email that contained customer information from both the Company and co-insurance companies. This prompted an internal investigation, which confirmed the occurrence of the information leak.\n\nJuly\u00a023,\u00a02024 Tokio\u00a0Marine\u00a0&\u00a0Nichido\u00a0Fire\u00a0Insurance\u00a0Co.,\u00a0Ltd.\n\nRegarding Financial Services Agency Order for Reports on Information Leaks\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \u02a0the Company\u02a1) was requested by the Financial Services Agency yesterday to submit reports regarding a personal data leak and the unauthorized provision of information to third parties. This request relates to the information leak resulting from email communications between insurance agents and insurance companies, as announced on May 23, 2024 * .\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the significant inconvenience and concern this has caused to our customers and all stakeholders. The Company takes this matter very seriously and is committed to responding diligently.\n\nAdditionally, during a series of investigations initiated by the incident announced on May 23, it was discovered that Company employees on loan to insurance agents had sent contract information from other insurance companies back to the Company via email, leading to the information leak. We will continue to thoroughly investigate the extent of the leaks at the co-insurance agents and identify the root causes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\n* 1 https://www.tokiomarine-nichido.co.jp/company/release/pdf/240523\u033201.pdf (Japanese only)\n\n*For details, please refer to the news releases dated May 23 and July 23, 2024.

In fire insurance, the increase in insurance payments due to the increase in natural catastrophes in recent years is a problem. In addition, in all categories, the impact of soaring repair unit prices due to inflation is significant, and measures are being taken to improve profitability. In addition, we are expanding specialty insurance, which will be a growth area in the medium to long term and are working on providing non-insurance solutions as \u02a0+\u03b1\u02a1 in the \u02a0pre-/post-incident\u02a1 domain.\n\n## New MTP Targets\n\nThe company plans to achieve a CAGR of +5% or more for business unit profits in the new Mid-Term Business Plan (MTP). The decrease in dividend income due to the acceleration of sale of business-related equities and the negative impact on profits due to the increase in the natural catastrophes budget are partially included, but they will be offset by the rate increase, the expansion of the number of customers, and the strong growth of underwriting profit as a result.\n\nAmong them, the CAGR of underwriting profit is planned to be \u02a0+10% or more,\u02a1 which is highly likely to be realized through the revision of rates and products. With these plans, a combined ratio will be improved to around 92%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1: After tax, estimation\n- *2: Natural catastrophes are normalized to an average annual level and the impact of foreign exchange is excluded. Average annual level for natural catastrophes is 83 billion yen (Wide natural catastrophes: 73 billion yen + Small natural catastrophes: 10 billion yen. before tax).

Under these circumstances, the General Insurance Rating Organization of Japan has raised the reference net rate for fire insurance (notified in June 2023; average increase of about 13% based on the Comprehensive Renters\u029f Insurance for Houses). In addition to the increasing frequency and severity of natural catastrophes, there has been an increase in insurance claims outside natural catastrophes, and reinsurance charges have remained high. As a result, fire insurance is still in a severe financial situation. In light of this management discussion and analysis of the business environment, we are required to improve profitability in both corporate and individual insurance, including rates and product revisions, in order to continue to provide stable fire insurance services to customers.\n\n## New MTP Targets\n\nAchieve profitability commensurate to capital cost (RoR > 7%) by fiscal 2026 through more disciplined underwriting exercised as part of \u02a0Re-New,\u02a1 in addition to the constant rate and product revisions.

A stock split was implemented (a ratio of three shares per share) in October 2022. The 'BPS,' 'EPS,' 'DPS,' 'Number of shares outstanding at year-end,' and 'Share price at year-end' for FY2021 and earlier fiscal years have been recalculated based on after the stock split.\n- 6.  The Key Performance Indicators have been newly defined in FY2015 and figures for FY2012 and thereafter have been restated. FY2021 onward is based on new definition.\n- 7.  The main reason for the increase in CO2 emissions from FY2015 was the expansion of coverage for calculation of Scope 3 (Other Indirect Emissions). The CO 2 emissions since FY2022 reflect the CO2 reduction effect from the use of renewable energy. The CO2 emissions for FY2023 are preliminary figures.\n- 8. IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' has been adopted from the beginning of fiscal 2023 by overseas consolidated subsidiaries that have adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Consolidated Results of Operations\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the world economy remained strong, mainly driven by the United States where personal consumption expanded. Although the Chinese economy showed a slowdown, the world economy as a whole picked up.\n\nThe Japanese economy continued to show weakness in domestic demand due to price inflation, and the pace of recovery remained moderate.\n\nUnder these circumstances, as a result of our efforts to expand our domestic and overseas business, which is centered on non-life insurance and life insurance, our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year 2023 were as follows:\n\nOrdinary income increased by 814.6 billion yen to 7,424.6 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, the main components of which were Underwriting income of 5,969.9 billion yen and Investment income of 1,292.7 billion yen. Ordinary expenses increased by 466.2 billion yen to 6,582.0 billion yen from the previous fiscal year, the main components of which were Underwriting expenses of 5,027.4 billion yen, Investment expenses of 260.3 billion yen, and Operating and general administrative expenses of 1,255.6 billion yen.\n\nAs a result, Ordinary profit increased by 348.4 billion yen to 842.5 billion yen from the previous fiscal year. Net income attributable to owners of the parent, composed of Ordinary profit plus Extraordinary gains minus Extraordinary losses and Total income taxes, increased by 321.2 billion yen to 695.8 billion yen from the previous fiscal year.\n\nAs described in \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Additional Information\", Consolidated overseas subsidiaries that apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) have started to adopt IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\" (hereinafter referred to as \"IFRS 17\") from the beginning of the fiscal year 2023.

As such non-consolidated subsidiaries are not considered to materially affect any reasonable determination as to the Group's financial condition and results of operations, these companies are excluded from the consolidation.\n\n## 2. Application of the equity method\n\n(1) Number of non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for by the equity method: 7 companies\n\nFor details of major non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for by the equity method, please refer to \"Tokio Marine Holdings and its Subsidiaries\" in \"Corporate Data\".\n\nEdelweiss Tokio Life Insurance Company Limited and one other company are excluded from the application of the equity method from the fiscal year 2023 due to the decline in influence, etc.\n\n- (2) The non-consolidated subsidiaries (Tokio Marine & Nichido Adjusting Service Co., Ltd., Tokio Marine Life Insurance (Thailand) Public Company Limited, etc.) and other affiliates (Malayan Insurance Company, Inc., etc.) are not accounted for by the equity method because these companies have an immaterial effect on the Company's consolidated net income or loss as well as consolidated retained earnings.\n- (3) The Company owns 30.1% of the total voting rights of Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co., Ltd. through Tokio Marine & Nichido and Nisshin Fire. However, the Company does not consider Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co., Ltd. to be its affiliate since it cannot exert a significant influence on any decision making of its policies given the highly public nature of their business.\n- (4) When a company accounted for by the equity method has a different closing date from that of the Company, in principle, the financial statements prepared at its closing date are used for presentation in the consolidated financial results.\n\n## 3.

Allowance for doubtful accounts\n\nIn order to prepare for the losses from bad debts, allowances are provided pursuant to the rules of asset self-assessment and the rules of asset write-off. Allowances are provided by major domestic consolidated subsidiaries as follows:\n\nFor receivables from any debtor who has legally, or in practice, become insolvent (due to bankruptcy, special liquidation or suspension of transactions with banks based on the rules governing clearing houses, etc.) and for receivables from any debtor who has substantially become insolvent, allowances are provided based on the amount of any such receivables deducting the amount expected to be collectible calculated based on the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees.\n\nFor receivables from any debtor who is likely to become insolvent in the near future, allowances are provided based on the amount of any such receivables deducting the amount expected to be collectible through the disposal of collateral or execution of guarantees and the overall solvency assessment of the relevant debtor.\n\nFor receivables other than those described above, allowances are the amount of receivables multiplied by the default rate, which is calculated based on historical default experience in certain previous periods.\n\nIn addition, all receivables are assessed by the asset accounting department and the asset management department in accordance with the rules of asset self-assessment.

The method of attributing expected retirement benefits to periods\n- In calculating the retirement benefit obligations, the method of attributing expected retirement benefits to periods is based on the benefit formula basis.\n- b. The method of amortization of actuarial gains and losses and past service costs Actuarial gains and losses for each fiscal year are amortized proportionally from the following fiscal year using the straight-line method over a certain number of years (5 to 13 years) within the average remaining work period of employees at the time of occurrence.\n\nPast service costs are amortized by the straight-line method over a certain number of years (10 to 13 years) within the average remaining work period of employees at the time of occurrence.\n\n## (7) Consumption taxes\n\nFor the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, consumption taxes are accounted for by the tax-excluded method except for costs such as Operating and general administrative expenses incurred by domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries which are accounted for by the tax-included method.\n\nIn addition, any non-deductible consumption taxes, in respect of assets, are included in Other assets and are amortized over five years using the straight-line method.\n\n## (8) Hedge accounting\n\n## a. Interest rate\n\nTo mitigate interest rate fluctuation risks associated with long-term insurance policies, Tokio Marine & Nichido conducts Asset Liability Management (\"ALM\") to control such risks by evaluating and analyzing financial assets and insurance liabilities simultaneously.\n\nAs for interest rate swaps that are used to manage such risks, Tokio Marine & Nichido applies deferred hedge accounting to the swaps based upon the Industry Committee Practical Guideline No. 26, \"Accounting and Auditing Treatments related to Application of Accounting for Financial Instruments in the Insurance Industry\" (issued by the JICPA, March 17, 2022).\n\nAssessment of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the companies group hedged insurance liabilities with the interest rate\n\nswaps that are the hedging instruments, based on the period remaining for the instruments, and the hedge is highly effective.\n\n## b. Foreign exchange\n\nMajor domestic consolidated insurance subsidiaries apply fair value hedge accounting, deferred hedge accounting or assignment accounting for certain foreign exchange forwards and certain currency swaps used to reduce future currency risk such as in assets denominated in foreign currency. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is omitted because the principal terms of the hedging instruments and the hedged items are identical and the hedge is highly effective.\n\n## (9) Methods and periods of amortization of goodwill\n\nRegarding goodwill recognized as an asset on the consolidated balance sheet, goodwill in connection with Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corp. is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill in connection with HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. is amortized over 10 years using the straight-line method. Goodwill in connection with Privilege Underwriters, Inc. is amortized over 15 years using the straight-line method. Other goodwill is amortized over 5 to 10 years using the straight-line method. Other goodwill in small amounts is amortized immediately.\n\nNegative goodwill incurred before March 31, 2010 and recognized as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet is amortized over 20 years using the straight-line method.\n\n## (10) Scope of Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nCash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term investments such as time deposits with original maturities or redemption of three months or less at the date of acquisition.\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability Management\n\nGovernance\n\n## Significant Accounting Estimates\n\nItems including accounting estimates that could have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are as follows:\n\nAs described in \"Additional Information\", Consolidated overseas subsidiaries that apply IFRS have started to adopt IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\" from the beginning of the fiscal year 2023. The figures of comparative prior fiscal year are adjusted retrospectively in accordance with IFRS 17.\n\n## 1. Outstanding claims\n\n(1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024\n\n|                    | As of March 31, 2024   | As of March 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Outstanding claims | 4,739,831              | 4,266,235              |\n\n## (2) Information on the significant accounting estimates\n\n- a. Calculation method\n\nOutstanding claims are estimated as the amount of claims, refunds and other benefits (hereinafter referred to as \"Claims\") deemed to have resulted in an obligation under an insurance contract that have not yet been paid.\n\n- b. Key assumptions used in the calculations Outstanding claims are estimated based on the ultimate settlement of Claims by using the assumptions calculated mainly from historical payment experience.\n- c. Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n- Due to the revision of laws and regulations or court decisions, etc., the ultimate settlement of Insurance Claims may change from the initial estimate, and the amount recorded for outstanding claims may increase or decrease.\n\n## 2. Impairment of goodwill\n\n(1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024\n\n|          | As of March 31, 2024   | As of March 31, 2023   |\n|----------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Goodwill | 372,624                | 428,601                |\n\n## (2) Information on the significant accounting estimates\n\n## a. Calculation method\n\nImpairment of goodwill is recognized mainly in accordance with the procedures for identifying indications of impairment, assessing the recognition of an impairment loss and measuring an impairment loss for each unit to which goodwill is attributed (hereinafter referred to as \"Reporting unit\") whose performance is reported independently for the Company's management purpose.\n\nFirst, for each Reporting unit, the Company assesses if indications of impairment are identified, such as deterioration in the latest operating results and future prospects, a significant negative deviation compared to the business plan at the time of acquisition, or significant adverse changes in the business environment including market conditions. For Reporting units for which indications of impairment were identified, an impairment loss is recognized if the total amount of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the book value of goodwill. For Reporting units for which recognition of an impairment loss is deemed necessary, the book value of goodwill shall be reduced to the recoverable amount which is calculated by discounting future cash flows, and recognizes the reduced amount as impairment loss.\n\n## b. Key assumptions for the calculations\n\n- Future cash flows and discount rates are used to calculate impairment loss on goodwill. Future cash flows are estimated based on the latest rational business plan, taking into account the growth, etc., based on the business environment of each Reporting unit.\n\nThe discount rate is the pre-tax interest rate, which is the cost of capital plus necessary adjustments such as interest rate differentials.\n\n## c. Impact on the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year\n\nAn impairment loss may be incurred if undiscounted future cash flows significantly decline due to, for example, a significant deterioration in profitability from the assumption at the time of acquisition and a significant downward deviation from the business plan.\n\n## 3. Market value evaluation of financial instruments\n\n- (1) The carrying amount shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024 Please refer to \"Information on Financial Instruments\".\n\n## (2) Information on significant accounting estimates\n\n- a.

Qualitative information on financial instruments\n\n## (1) Investment policies\n\nThe core operation of the Group is its insurance business, and it invests utilizing the cash inflows mainly arising from insurance premiums. Therefore, the Group seeks to appropriately control risks based on the characteristics of insurance products primarily through ALM. The Group thereby aims to ensure stable, long-term earnings while realizing efficient management of liquidity.\n\nSpecifically, the Group's approach entails controlling interest rate risks associated with insurance liabilities by utilizing interest rate swaps and other transactions while assuming a certain degree of credit risks by investing in bonds with high credit ratings. At the same time, the Group endeavors to ensure medium-to-long-term earnings by diversifying risks and asset management approaches in Japan and overseas through the utilization of a wide range of products including foreign securities and alternative investments. Foreign exchange forwards and other derivative transactions are used to mitigate risks associated with the Group's asset portfolio.\n\nThrough these approaches, the Group aims to increase investment income in order to maximize net asset value in the medium-to-longterm and maintain financial soundness.\n\nWith regard to financing, the Group issues corporate bonds and undertakes borrowings mainly to secure funds for investments. When financing is necessary, amounts and methodologies are determined based on the Group's cash flow status.\n\n## (2) Details of financial instruments and their risks\n\nThe Group holds financial instruments including equity securities, bonds, other securities, loans and derivatives. These instruments are exposed to market risk, which refers to the risk of losses arising from fluctuations in stock prices, exchange rates, interest rates, and other market indicators. They are also exposed to credit risk, which refers to the risk of losses when the value of an investment declines or is lost due to deterioration in the financial condition of the debtor. Other risks to which these instruments are exposed include market liquidity risk, which refers to the risk of losses that may occur from being unable to make transactions due to disorderly market conditions or being forced to make transactions at extremely unfavorable prices.\n\nSome currency risk is hedged through foreign exchange forwards, currency swaps and other such transactions. Hedge accounting is applied to some of these transactions.\n\nCredit risk associated with over-the-counter derivative transactions includes the risk of losses when the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations due to insolvency or for other reasons. In order to reduce such credit risk, netting arrangements and collateral transfers equivalent to fair value of derivative transactions may be used with financial institutions and other counterparties with whom there are frequent transactions. Also, interest rate risk associated with long-term insurance liabilities is hedged by interest rate swaps and other transactions for which hedge accounting is applied in some cases.\n\nWith regard to hedging instruments, hedged items, hedging policies and evaluation of hedge effectiveness, please refer to \"Significant Accounting Policies - 4. Accounting policies - (8) Hedge accounting\".\n\n## (3) Risk management structure\n\n## a. Market risk and credit risk management\n\nBased on the \"Investment risk management policy\" established by the Board of Directors, Tokio Marine & Nichido executes risk management activities both quantitatively and qualitatively to control investment risk related to financial instruments, such as market risk and credit risk, at the risk management department, which is independent of trading departments.\n\nIn accordance with the policy, \"Investment guidelines\" are established, which set the rules for which instruments to invest in, risk limits, and actions to take when limits are exceeded for each segment set in the annual investment plan. Investment risk is quantitatively measured using VaR-like concepts. Compliance with the guidelines and investment risk and return are reported on a regular basis to directors.\n\nTokio Marine & Nichido appropriately manages credit risk by regularly monitoring the concentration and the status of issuers and borrowers using internal credit rating guidelines set by the \"Guidelines for managing credit risk concentration\".\n\nIn order to control individual investments, Tokio Marine & Nichido also executes pre-investment review and post-investment monitoring according to the \"Review guidelines\" and others.\n\nRisk monitoring operations are reported to the Board of Directors depending on their importance. Other consolidated subsidiaries maintain risk management structures based on the aforementioned risks.\n\n## b. Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Group manages liquidity risk by controlling payment schedules and ensuring various ways of financing through treasury management by each consolidated subsidiary and by the Group as a whole.\n\n## (4) Supplementary information on fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is measured under certain assumptions, therefore it may differ under other assumptions.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance\n\n## 2. Fair value of financial instruments and breakdown by input level\n\nThe tables below show carrying amounts shown on the consolidated balance sheet, fair value, differences of financial instruments, and fair value breakdown by input level.\n\nSecurities without a market price, and investments in partnerships are not included below. (Refer to Note 3.)\n\nThe fair values of financial instruments are classified into the following three levels depending on the observability and significance of the input used in the fair value calculation:\n\nLevel 1: Fair value measured by the market price of the asset or liability in active markets among the observable inputs\n\nLevel 2: Fair value measured by the observable inputs other than the Level 1 inputs\n\nLevel 3: Fair value measured by unobservable inputs\n\nIf multiple inputs are used with a significant impact on the fair value measurement, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input.\n\nAs described in \"Additional Information\", Consolidated overseas subsidiaries that apply IFRS have started to adopt IFRS 17 from the beginning of the fiscal year 2023. The figures of comparative prior fiscal year are adjusted retrospectively in accordance with IFRS 17.

These valuation techniques include the inputs such as yield curves, prepayment rates and market prices of similar type of securities.\n\nThe fair value is categorized within Level 2 if unobservable inputs are either not included or not significant in the valuation techniques. It is categorized within Level 3 if unobservable inputs are significant in the valuation techniques.\n\n## Securities\n\nThe fair value of securities which is measured using quoted prices in active markets is categorized within Level 1. The fair value of securities which is based on quoted prices in inactive markets is categorized within Level 2.\n\n- If quoted prices in markets are not available, the fair value of securities is measured using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow and matrix pricing. These valuation techniques include the inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads and market prices of similar type of securities.\n- The fair value is categorized within Level 2 if unobservable inputs are either not included or not significant in the valuation techniques. It is categorized within Level 3 if unobservable inputs are significant in the valuation techniques.\n- The fair value of major investment trusts for which quoted prices in markets are not available, is based on net asset value and categorized within Level 2, as there is no significant restriction on cancellation.\n\n## Loans\n\nWith regard to floating rate loans, fair value is measured using the book value and is categorized within Level 3 as long as there are no significant changes in the credit status of the borrowers, since the fair value is considered to approximate the book value as the changes in interest rates are reflected in a timely manner in the future cash flows.\n\nWith regard to fixed rate loans, the fair value is measured using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow. These valuation techniques include the inputs such as yield curves and credit spreads. The fair value of fixed rate loans is categorized within Level 3.\n\nWith regard to loans of which borrowers are insolvent or in bankruptcy proceedings, the fair value approximates the amount after deducting the estimated uncollectible debts from the carrying amount. Therefore, the fair value is measured with such amount and is categorized within Level 3.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nThe fair value of Corporate bonds is measured using quoted prices in markets and others and categorized within Level 2.\n\n## Derivative transactions\n\nWith regard to exchange-traded derivative transactions, the fair value is measured using the closing prices at exchanges and others. For over-the-counter derivative transactions, the fair value is measured using valuation techniques such as the Black-Scholes model and the discounted cash flow, using the inputs such as swap rates, forward rates, volatilities and basis swap spreads.\n\nThe fair value of derivative transactions which is measured using closing prices at exchanges and others is categorized within Level 1. It is categorized within Level 2 if unobservable inputs are either not included or not significant in the valuation techniques. It is categorized within Level 3 if unobservable inputs are significant in the valuation techniques.\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance\n\n(Note 2) Information on the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet (1) Reconciliation of beginning balances to ending balances, unrealized gains and losses recognized in profit or loss for the period As of March 31, 2024\n\n|                               | Beginning  balance   | Transfers to  Level 3 fair  value (*1, *2)   | Transfers  from Level 3  fair value (*1, *3)   | Recorded in  profit or loss  for the period  (*4)   | Recorded in  other  comprehensive income (*5)   | Net amount  of  purchases,  sales, issues   and  settlements   | Ending  balance   | Unrealized  gains  (losses) on  financial  assets and  liabilities held  at the end of  the period, of  the amount  recorded in  profit or loss  for the period  (*4)   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Monetary receivables bought   | 271,091              | 1,110                                        | (52,765)                                       | (11,911)                                            | 17,748                                          | 30,877                                                         | 256,151           | -

Most subsidiaries in Tokio Marine Group engage in non-life insurance business, life insurance business and Small Amount and Short Term insurance business. In addition to reserves to cover claim payments, payments for maturity refunds of saving type insurance policies, etc., it is necessary for insurance groups to maintain sufficient solvency in order to cover risks that exceed normal estimates, e.g. occurrences of a major catastrophe, or a significant decline in value of assets held by insurance groups.\n- 2. (C) Solvency margin ratio is the ratio of (A) Total amount of solvency margin (i.e. solvency of insurance company groups in terms of their capital, reserves, etc.) to (B) Total amount of risks (i.e. risks that exceed normal estimates) which is calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Act.\n- 3. \"Risks that exceed normal estimates\" is composed of risks described below.\n- (1) General insurance risk on non-life insurance contracts, life insurance risk, third sector insurance risk and insurance risk of Small Amount and Short Term Insurers: risk that insurance claims occur in excess of normal estimates excluding catastrophe risk on non-life insurance contracts.\n- (2) Assumed interest rate risk: risk that invested assets fail to yield assumed interest rates due to factors such as downturn of investment conditions.\n- (3) Minimum guarantee risk on life insurance contracts: risk that value of assets related to the minimum guarantee for benefits of insurance contracts, which are managed as a separate account, fluctuates in excess of normal estimates and falls below the minimum guaranteed benefits when they are to be paid.\n- (4) Asset management risk: risk that the prices of retained securities and other assets fluctuate in excess of normal estimates.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\nSustainability Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance\n\n- (5) Business administration risk: risk that occurs in excess of normal estimates and does not fall under other categories.\n- (6) Catastrophe risk on non-life insurance contracts: risk that a major catastrophe in excess of normal estimates which is equivalent to the Great Kanto Earthquake or Isewan Typhoon or overseas major catastrophe occurs.\n- 4. Subsidiaries that were excluded from the scope of consolidation in preparation of the consolidated financial statements due to immateriality were included within the calculation of the consolidated solvency margin ratio.\n- 5. Solvency of insurance company groups in terms of their capital, reserves, etc. ((A) Total amount of solvency margin) is the total amount of net assets excluding planned outflows, certain reserves (e.g. price fluctuation reserve, contingency reserve, catastrophe loss reserve, etc.) and part of unrealized gains (losses) on land, etc.\n- 6. Solvency margin ratio on a consolidated basis is one of the objective indicators used by the regulatory authority to supervise corporate groups headed by an insurance holdings company. A ratio exceeding 200% indicates sufficient solvency to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims.\n\n## Sufficiency of solvency of major domestic subsidiaries to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims\n\n## Solvency margin ratio (non-consolidated) for Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | (Yen in millions)    | (Yen in millions)    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                           | As of March 31, 2024 | As of March 31, 2023 |\n| (A) Total amount of solvency margin                                                                                                       | 6,454,659            | 5,287,626            |\n| Shareholders' equity less adjusting items                                                                                                 | 1,517,899            | 1,421,939            |\n| Reserve for price fluctuation                                                                                                             | 114,165              | 108,000              |\n| Contingency reserve                                                                                                                       | 12,279               | 9,578                |\n| Catastrophe loss reserve                                                                                                                  | 1,050,430            | 1,081,242            |\n| General allowance for doubtful accounts                                                                                                   | 217                  | 202                  |\n| Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and deferred gains (losses) on hedge transactions before tax effect deductions | 2,823,534            | 1,772,797            |\n| Unrealized gains (losses) on land                                                                                                         | 265,617              | 260,134              |\n| Excess of policyholders' contract deposits                                                                                                | -

In addition to reserves to cover claim payments, payments for maturity refunds of saving type insurance policies, etc., it is necessary for insurance companies to maintain sufficient solvency in order to cover risks that exceed normal estimates, e.g. occurrences of a major catastrophe, a significant decline in value of assets held by insurance companies.\n- 2. (C) Solvency margin ratio is the ratio of (A) Total amount of solvency margin (i.e. solvency of insurance companies in terms of their capital, reserves, etc.) to (B) Total amount of risks (i.e. risks that exceed normal estimates), which is calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Act.\n- 3. \"Risks that exceed normal estimates\" is composed of risks described below.\n- (1) (General) insurance risk, third sector insurance risk: risk that insurance claims occur in excess of normal estimates excluding catastrophe risk.\n- (2) Assumed interest rate risk: risk that invested assets fail to yield assumed interest rates due to factors such as downturn of investment conditions.\n- (3) Minimum guarantee risk: risk that value of assets related to the minimum guarantee for benefits of insurance contracts, which are managed as a separate account, fluctuates in excess of normal estimates and falls below the minimum guaranteed benefits when they are to be paid.\n- (4) Asset management risk: risk that prices of retained securities and other assets fluctuate in excess of normal estimates.\n- (5) Business administration risk: risk that occurs in excess of normal estimates and does not fall under other categories.\n- (6) Catastrophe risk: risk that a major catastrophe in excess of normal estimates which is equivalent to the Great Kanto Earthquake or Isewan typhoon occurs.\n- 4. Solvency of insurance companies in terms of their capital, reserves, etc. ((A) Total amount of solvency margin) is the total amount of net assets excluding planned outflows, certain reserves (e.g. reserve for price fluctuation, contingency reserve, catastrophe loss reserve, etc.) and part of unrealized gains (losses) on land, etc.\n- 5. Solvency margin ratio is one of the objective indicators used by the regulators to supervise insurance companies. A ratio exceeding 200% indicates sufficient solvency to fulfill payment obligations such as insurance claims.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability Management\n\nGovernance\n\n## Solvency margin ratio (non-consolidated) for Nisshin Fire & Marine Insurance Co., Ltd.\n\n|                                                                                                                                           | (Yen in millions)    | (Yen in millions)    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                           | As of March 31, 2024 | As of March 31, 2023 |\n| (A) Total amount of solvency margin                                                                                                       | 121,134              | 133,868              |\n| Shareholders' equity less adjusting items                                                                                                 | 46,071               | 60,574               |\n| Reserve for price fluctuation                                                                                                             | 5,648                | 5,048                |\n| Contingency reserve                                                                                                                       | 27                   | -

(TMNL)\n\n## About MCEV\n\nThe current Japanese financial accounting standards focus on conservativeness and have the limitation that the profits generated from life insurance business are generally undervalued shortly after underwriting contracts in terms of the valuation and assessment of performance of life insurance business.\n\nEmbedded values (EV) are calculated as the total of the \"adjusted net worth\" and the \"value of in-force.\" EV is designed to address the limitations of the financial accounting standards in order to facilitate an appropriate evaluation of value and improve performance assessment, considering the actual situation of the business performance.\n\nWhile there have been various methodologies for calculation of EV, the European Insurance CFO Forum released its MCEV Principles, the European Insurance CFO Forum Market Consistent Embedded Value Principles, in June 2008, to enhance the consistency of valuation standards and unify the standards for disclosures. TMNL has been disclosing its EV in compliance with the MCEV Principles to enhance the disclosure since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\n\nPurpose Story\n\nCapital Policy and the Mid-Term Business Plan\n\nStrengthening, Human, Intellectual, and Social Capital\n\n## MCEV as of March 31, 2024\n\n## 1.

This UFR method entails setting the JPY ultimate forward rate to 3.8%, extrapolating rates from year 30,and applying the Smith-Wilson method so that forward rates from the 31st year onwards approach to the UFR in 30 years. This method was established with reference to the global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) currently in development by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Representative JPY interest rates are as follows:\n\nJPY\n\n| Term     | End of March 2024   |\n|----------|---------------------|\n| 1 year   | 0.04%               |\n| 5 years  | 0.35%               |\n| 10 years | 0.75%               |\n| 20 years | 1.54%               |\n| 30 years | 1.86%               |\n| 40 years | 2.18%               |\n| 50 years | 2.49%               |\n\nWe have not included a liquidity premium in the risk-free rates given that definitions in the MCEV Principles are not clear and generally accepted practice has not yet been established. Negative interest rates are not floored at zero.\n\n## 2.

Some of the operating expense rates were adjusted by removing one-off costs which are not  ordinarily expected to be incurred in future periods. The removed one-off cost is 0.79billion yen, which is tied  primarily to a portion of system development costs.

As 60.5 yen per share was paid as an interim cash dividend (an ordinary dividend), the total amount of annual cash dividends (ordinary dividends) was 123 yen per share for the fiscal year 2023. This is an increase of total annual cash dividends (ordinary dividends) of 23 yen per share from 100 yen per share paid for the previous fiscal year.\n\nIn the fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, in addition to the ordinary dividends, the Company also paid one-time dividends (23 yen per share, 12 yen per share, and 12 yen per share respectively) for capital level adjustment.\n\nNote: The Company conducted a 3-for-1 stock split on October 1, 2022. For dividends paid before the stock split, the amount per share equivalent after the stock split is shown (fractions less than 1 yen are rounded to the nearest whole number).\n\n## Capital\n\n| Date           | Equity capital   |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| April 2, 2002  | \u00a5150 billion     |\n| March 31, 2024 | \u00a5150 billion     |\n\nSustainability Management\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->",

Figures for and prior to September 2022 have been recalculated based on figures after the split.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## On the Publication of Our Integrated Annual Report 2024\n\nAs Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tokio Marine Holdings, I would like to thank you for taking the time to read our Integrated Annual Report 2024 to its conclusion.\n\nWe published our first integrated annual report in fiscal 2015 to provide analysts and institutional investors with a balanced understanding of our sustainable value creation capabilities from both financial and non-financial perspectives. Following this initial publication, we have continued to make improvements each year through a process of trial and error, referring to the opinions of analysts and institutional investors, comments of integrated annual report rating agencies, and various guidelines, and have now published our 10th integrated annual report.\n\nRegarding this fiscal year's integrated annual report, we have been mindful of creating a well-structured layout while incorporating the content of the Tokio Marine Group Mid-Term Plan 2026 'Inspiring confidence. Accelerating progress.' announced in May of this year. The report also reflects the thoughts and commitments of our management team, led by each Chief Officer (CEO on pp. 2-7, Co-Head of International Business on pp. 28, 29, Co-CRSO on p. 31, CFO on pp. 44-57, CHRO/CWO on pp. 60, 61, CDIO on p. 61, CDO on pp. 64, 65, and CSUO on pp. 68, 69). With detailed explanations of our Company's strengths, strategies, and the management foundation centered around human, intellectual, and social capital, the report aims to enhance confidence in our ability to achieve future growth and our long-term aspiration of realizing world-class EPS growth and ROE levels comparable to global peers.\n\nIn particular, with respect to our efforts to enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance in light of a series of governance issues, we have aimed to further enrich the content of our disclosures. To this end, we have included a special feature in the first half of the integrated report (pp. 36, 37), added a new message from the Chairman of the Board (pp. 96, 97), and presented a dialogue among outside directors (pp. 98-101), where discussions at the Board and the challenges facing the Company are explained. In addition, the policies and status of Tokio Marine & Nichido's initiatives are thoroughly detailed (p. 130), all with the aim of further enhancing transparency and trust.\n\nThe policy on reduction of business-related equities, which has garnered significant interest from the market, has been detailed again (p. 112), while the utilization of the capital released from the sales has been explained in the CFO's message (p. 49).\n\nFinally, as the officer responsible for publishing this integrated annual report, I would like to state that it is a clear and accurate representation of our Company's ability to create sustainable value.\n\nOur purpose is to protect our customers and society in times of need. Since our founding in 1879, we have contributed to solving various societal challenges that have evolved with the times. By empowering our customers and society to have the confidence to drive progress, we have also achieved sustainable and long-term growth for our Company.\n\nAs a result, our adjusted net income plan for fiscal 2024 stands at 1 trillion yen, representing a clearly different stage from before. We recognize that we are still on a journey toward achieving\n\nworld-class EPS growth and ROE levels comparable to\n\nglobal peers. By addressing and innovatively solving the challenges faced by our customers and society through both our insurance and solutions pillars, we seek to empower their next step and continue our growth journey without pause.\n\nWe appreciate your continued support and guidance as we forge ahead.\n\nKenji Okada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2024 Publication Officer Senior Managing Director Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO)",
