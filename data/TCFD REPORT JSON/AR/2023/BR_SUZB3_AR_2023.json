We disclose our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this annual report, which are considered to be non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA is calculated as Net income (loss) plus Net financial result, Income and social contribution taxes, and Depreciation, amortization and depletion. Our Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA as further adjusted to add or exclude:\n\n(i) exceptional adjustments, such as COVID-19 - Social actions and operating expenses, initial acquisition costs relating to Kimberley Clark Brazil Tissue Operation, penalties for termination of a specific barge contract with Norsul and termination of packaging subsidiary;",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n(ii) non-cash adjustments, such as Accrual (reversal) of losses on ICMS credits, Extension of the PCHM concession, Fair value adjustment of biological assets, Income from associates and joint ventures - Biomas, Ensyn, F&E, Ibema, Spinnova and Woodspin, Income from associates and joint ventures - Recycling of other comprehensive income from Suzano Trading, Write off of the development contract advance program, and Write-off of wood inventory;\n\n(iii) specific adjustments that by their nature and scope, do not reflect our operational performance for the specific period, in our management's view. This includes The Losses or Gains on Realization (write-off of sale, scrap, loss, decommissioning, dismantling or property, plant and equipment inventory adjustment) of fixed, intangible and biological assets whose economic benefits are no longer obtained or that do not relate to the core business of the Company and Tax Credits resulting from the exclusion of ICMS in the PIS and COFINS calculation base in prior fiscal years. These are events that may recur from time to time, but our management believes that it is important for investors to review the operational performance of the Company's business without potential distortions deriving from these events.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures described in this annual report are not a substitute for the IFRS Accounting Standards measures of net income or other performance measures. Our management believes that disclosure of our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors, financial analysts and the public in their review of our operating performance and their comparison of our operating performance to the operating performance of other companies in the same industry and other industries. For example, interest expense is dependent on the capital structure and credit rating of a company. However, debt levels, credit ratings and, therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings vary significantly between companies. Similarly, the tax positions of individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and the differing jurisdictions in which they transact business. Finally, companies differ in  the  age  and  method  of  acquisition  of  productive  assets,  and  thus  the  relative  costs  of  those  assets,  as  well  as  in  the  depreciation  method  (straight-line, accelerated  or  units  of  production),  which  can  result  in  considerable  variation  in  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  between  companies.  Therefore,  for comparison purposes, our management believes that our EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful measures of operating profitability because they exclude these elements of earnings that do not provide information about the current operations of existing assets.\n\nOther companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, and therefore our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other  similarly  titled  measures  used  by  other  companies.  Each  of  these  non-GAAP  financial  measures  are  important  measures  to  assess  our financial and operating performance. We believe that the disclosure of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors and financial  analysts  in  their  review  of  our  operating  performance  and  in  the  comparison  of  such  operating  performance  to  the  operating  performance  of  other companies in the same industry or in other industries that have different capital structures, debt levels and/or income tax rates. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards.",

Risk Factors\n\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties resulting from changing competitive, economic, political, environmental and social conditions that could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. The risks described below, although not being the only ones we face are the most important ones according to our ability to identify material risks. Other risks that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us.\n\n## Risks Relating to the Pulp and Paper Industry\n\nOur products' prices are greatly affected by international market prices, which vary depending on a number of factors that are beyond our control and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our ability to operate our plants in an economically viable manner.\n\nPulp  markets  are  typically  cyclical,  and  our  pulp  prices  follow  international  market  prices,  which  are  determined  by  supply  and  demand,  global  pulp production capacity and global economic conditions. Such prices can also be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the currencies of main producing and consuming countries, movement of inventories, diverging price expectations, business strategies adopted by other producers and availability of substitutes for our products, among others. All of these factors are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on the prices for pulp and, consequently, on our operational margins, profitability and ROIC. Fluctuations in pulp price may lead us to adopt changes in our commercial strategy or production, which also may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\n\nPaper prices are also determined by supply and demand conditions in the markets in which they are sold, and are affected by various factors, including the fluctuation in pulp prices and the specific characteristics of the markets in which we operate.\n\nWe  cannot  assure  that  pulp  and  paper  market  prices  and  demand  for  our  products  will  remain  favorable  to  us,  and  any  adverse  price  or  demand fluctuations, which may occur rapidly in our markets, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our ability to operate our plants in an economically viable manner.\n\nWe are highly dependent on our planted forest areas for the supply of wood, which is essential to our production processes, and any damage to our forest areas or impact on prices of land we seek to purchase for our forests may adversely affect us.\n\nMost  of  the  wood  used  in  our  production  processes  is  supplied  by  our  own  forestry  operations,  which  include  planted  forest  areas  located  in  close proximity to our production facilities. The wood market in Brazil is very regional and limited in wood availability, as most pulp and paper producers are integrated and utilize wood grown in their own planted forests to meet their wood requirements.\n\nOur planted forests are subject to natural threats, such as drought, fire, pests and diseases, which may reduce our supply of wood or increase the price of wood we acquire. Our planted areas are also subject to other threats, considering their wide territorial coverage and proximity to a significant number of neighbors and local communities, including loss of possession due to social unrest or squatter invasion, land title disputes, wood theft, or arson, which may result in real damage to our planting and transit areas and may adversely affect our results.\n\nIn addition, the physical effects of climate change may materially and adversely affect our operations, for example by changing air temperature and water levels, and subjecting us to unusual or different weather-related risks. Any climate changes that negatively affect the favorable climate conditions in Brazil may adversely  affect  the  growth  rate  and  quality  of  our  plantations,  or  our  production  costs.  Although  we  cannot  predict  the  impact  of  changing  global  climate conditions,  any  such  occurrences  may  increase  our  liabilities  and  capital  expenditures  and  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of operations.\n\nAdditionally, in acquiring land for our timber plantations, we compete with other crops, as well as with cattle breeders, which could ultimately raise land prices or make it more difficult for us to contract independent third parties to cultivate eucalyptus.",

Some  of  our  units  are  located  in  the  affected  areas  and  we  cannot  assure  that  our  processes  for  efficient  use  of  water  and contingency plans will be able to avoid impacts from severe droughts or governmental measures to address drought conditions on our units' operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face significant operational risks that can result in the shutdown of our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe face operational risks that may result in partial or temporary suspension of our operations and in loss of production. Such outages may be caused by factors associated with equipment failure, information system disruptions or failures (including due to cyber-attacks), accidents, fires, strikes, invasions, acts of war, armed conflicts,  weather,  exposure  to  natural  disasters,  regional  water  crisis,  electricity  power  outages  and  chemical  product  spills,  accidents  involving  water reservoirs, landfills, revocation of licenses, labor restrictions by pandemics, among other operational and environmental hazards. The occurrence of these events may, among other impacts, result in serious damage to our property, assets and reputation, liability for damages to the environment and third parties, a decrease in production or an increase in production costs, any of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increasing geopolitical tensions and  hostilities  in  connection  with  the  ongoing  conflicts  in  Ukraine  and  in  the  Middle  East,  and  the  trade  and  monetary  sanctions  that  have  been  imposed  in connection with those developments, have affected, and could affect, worldwide markets, cause turmoil in the global financial system and negatively impact our operations.\n\nCertain of our assets, notably biological assets measured at fair value, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, may be impacted by climate events. Effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, scarcity of water resources, fires and impacts arising from the greater presence and resistance of pests and other forest diseases favored by the gradual increase in temperature, as well as other adverse weather events, may impact the determination of fair value of biological assets, cause the loss of biological assets, reduce productivity or event result in interruptions of our production. In addition, regulatory and legal changes related to a transition to a low-carbon economy and/or with greater biodiversity might impose additional costs and create greater risk of litigation and/or commercial restrictions to our business.\n\nDuring the normal course of our business, we depend on the continuous availability of logistics and transportation networks, including roads, railways, warehouses and ports, among others. Such operations may be disrupted by factors beyond our control, such as social movements, geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters,  electricity  shortages  strikes  and  shutdowns  (such  as,  for  instance,  trucker  strikes). Any  interruption  in  the  supply  of  inputs  for  the  operation  of  our industrial and forestry units or in the delivery of our finished products to clients could cause a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nWe have entered into contracts with third parties to provide transportation and logistics services. The early termination of these contracts or our inability to renew them or negotiate new contracts with other service providers with similar conditions could adversely affect our financial and operating condition. In addition, most of our suppliers of transportation operate under concessions granted by the Brazilian government. The loss or non- renewal of such concessions without timely  replacement for new concessions to third parties that can continue the services provided and willing to do so on similar terms as the previous service providers may also adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, we are subject to quality control risks associated with our products, which may affect our consumer market and customers. In this sense, we note that our products have several properties that influence the processes of our customers, as well as the quality of the products they produce. Accordingly, we are also subject to any potential claims relating to the quality of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",

Medium and long-term supply agreements with wood suppliers may vary between one to three forest cycles, each cycle lasting approximately seven years. Lease agreements or forest partnerships have an average term of 14 years. Wood price conditions are subject to cyclical and circumstantial variations of wood demand in the different regions where we operate. A material failure to obtain wood from third party suppliers or a material interruption in our current supply arrangements may result in a significant reduction in available wood for processing at our plants, which may adversely affect our production and, accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, we have few sources for certain raw materials and services that are essential for the production of pulp and paper, including fuel oil, bleached chemothermomechanical pulp, peroxide, natural gas and third-party industry technology (maintenance). We enter into medium and long-term supply agreements with such suppliers or service providers. Any significant reduction in the supply or increase in prices, on behalf of the relevant supplier or service provider, of any of these raw materials or services, as well as our inability to maintain the relationship or find  suitable  substitutes  for  these  suppliers  or  service  providers,  could adversely affect our products' mix, margin or availability and, consequently, our results of operations.\n\nWe  cannot  guarantee  that  our  supplies  and  service  providers  will  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  working  conditions, sustainability, production chain assurance and appropriate safety conditions. Brazilian law may impose liability on us for improper practices of our supplies and service providers. If our suppliers or service providers engage in improper business practices (particularly improper or illegal environmental or labor practices), our business, results of operations and reputation may be adversely affected.\n\n## Investments by us or our competitors to enhance pulp and paper production capacity in the future may adversely affect the market price for our products.\n\nNew capacity projects developed by us or our competitors may create an imbalance between supply and demand of pulp and paper, which may cause a reduction  in  pulp  and  paper  prices.  Investments  in  new  capacity  may  have  a  negative  impact  on  pulp  and  paper  prices  and,  consequently,  on  our  financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## We face significant competition in some of our lines of business, which may adversely affect our market share in the pulp and paper industries and our profitability.\n\nThe pulp and paper markets are extremely competitive. We face substantial competition in both domestic and international markets from a large number of companies, some of which have extensive access to financial resources and low capital costs. In the domestic market, we face competition from national products, produced  by  companies  of  Brazilian  and  international  groups,  and  imported  products.  In  the  international  market,  we  compete  against  companies  with  large production and distribution capacities, significant consumer base and great variety of products.\n\nIn addition, the oversupply of coated paper in the world market, the antidumping measures adopted in other countries and the use of imported coated paper for alternative purposes, especially during periods of prolonged appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, may increase competition in Brazil from producers of imported paper. If the Brazilian federal government were to decrease import taxes, or in the event of sustained appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, competition in Brazil from international producers may increase. The occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing events could adversely affect us.",

If we are unable to remain competitive against these producers in the future, our market share may be adversely affected. Other companies operating in the same segments may compete with us for acquisition and alliance opportunities. Strategic acquisitions or alliances by our competitors could affect our ability to enter into or consummate acquisitions and alliances that are  necessary  to  expand  our  business.  We  may  also  face  elevated  costs  associated  with  restructuring  and  financing  in  relation  to  acquisitions  or  strategic partnerships in comparison to our competitor companies. Companies that are better positioned to enter into acquisitions or alliances may benefit from preferable production costs, which may affect our competitiveness and market share.\n\nOther  factors  affecting  our  ability  to  compete  include  the  entry  of  new  competitors  into  the  markets  we  serve,  increased  competition  from  overseas producers, our competitors' pricing strategies, the introduction by our competitors of new technologies and equipment, our ability to anticipate and respond to changing  customer  preferences  and  our  ability  to  maintain  the  cost-efficiency  of  our  facilities.  In  addition,  changes  within  these  industries,  including  the consolidation of our competitors and our customers, may impact competitive dynamics.\n\n## Periods of limited or unavailable financing may increase our financial costs and restrict the terms or availability of market funding, potentially adversely impacting our operations.\n\nBrazilian paper and pulp companies have made significant investments during the last few years in order to compete more efficiently and on a larger scale in the international market. This trend towards consolidation has enhanced the need for resources and diversification of financing sources among national and foreign financial institutions.\n\nIn  this  context,  we  depend  on  third-party  capital  to  conduct  our  business,  by  means  of  financing  transactions  to  support  our  investments  and  working capital. We cannot assure that our current sources of funds will be sufficient or that they will remain available to meet our capital needs, which may require us to seek additional funds in the financial and capital markets. In liquidity restriction periods, such as the ones of 2008 and 2009 that occurred due to the international financial  crisis,  credit  lines  may  become  excessively  short,  expensive  or  even  unavailable.  Under  these  circumstances,  there  is  a  higher  risk  of  not  achieving success in financing and refinancing transactions, meaning that there is a higher possibility of failure in obtaining financing in the market in order to pay down existing indebtedness, as well as a higher risk of raising these funds at an elevated cost or subject to posting collateral, which may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## More  stringent  environmental  regulations  could  increase  our  expenditures  and  noncompliance  with  such  regulation  may  result  in administrative, civil and criminal liability, which may adversely affect us, our results of operations or financial condition.\n\nOur  activities  are  subject  to  extensive  environmental  regulation,  including  in  relation  to  gas  emissions,  liquid  effluents  and  solid  waste  management, reforestation and odor control, as well as maintenance of Land Reserve ( Reserva Legal ) and Permanent Preservation Areas ( \u00c1rea de Preserva\u00e7\u00e3o Permanente ). Our industrial and forestry activities also require periodic renewal of environmental permits.\n\nEnvironmental  standards  that  are  applicable  to  us  are  issued  at  the  federal,  state  and  municipal  levels,  and  changes  in  the  laws,  rules,  policies  or procedures adopted in the enforcement of the current laws may adversely affect us. In Brazil, violations of environmental laws, regulations and authorizations could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties for us, our management and our employees, including fines, imprisonment, interruption of our activities and dissolution of our corporate entity.\n\nGovernmental agencies or other competent authorities may provide new rules or additional regulations even stricter than the ones in force, or they may pursue a stricter interpretation of the existing laws and regulations, which could require us to invest additional resources in environmental compliance or to restrict our ability  to  operate  as  currently  done. Additionally,  noncompliance  with  or  a  violation  of  any  such  laws  and  regulations  could  result  in  the  revocation  of  our licenses  and  suspension  of  our  activities  or  in  our  liability  for  environmental  remediation  costs,  which  could  be  substantial.  Moreover,  failure  to  comply  with environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to obtain financing from financial institutions.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn  December  2015,  several  countries  (including  Brazil)  signed  the  Paris  Agreement,  a  new  global  environmental  agreement  adopting  the  Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, as the measures taken to reduce its emissions after 2020. The INDC that applies to Brazil provides for an increase in the share of sustainable biofuels and other sources of renewable energy in the Brazilian national energy mix, as well as zero deforestation, reforestation, forest restoration and enhancement of the native forest management. Considering the amplitude of the operation, we may be materially affected by more restrictive national or foreign environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, to the extent that such new laws or regulations may cause an increase in capital expenditures and investments to comply with such laws, and indirectly, by changes in prices for transportation, energy and other inputs. Both the regulations related to climate change and the changes in existing regulations, as well as the physical effects of climate change generally, could result in increased liabilities and capital expenditures, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## Failure to obtain, timely renew or maintain permits, licenses and concessions, grants and registrations necessary to develop our activities, as well as any cancellation thereof, could adversely affect our operations.\n\nOur operations depend on the issuance of permits, licenses, concessions, grants and registrations from numerous federal, state and municipal agencies. In addition, obtaining licenses for certain activities, in which significant environmental impacts are expected, requires investments in conservation and/or recovery to  compensate  such  impacts.  We  have  permits,  licenses,  concessions,  grants  and  registrations  necessary  to  operate  our  factories,  which  usually  have predetermined validity. In order to renew them, we must periodically report our compliance to the standards required by government agencies.\n\nThe expansion of our operations and/or changes in the current regulation may cause us to request for new permits, licenses, concessions, grants and registrations along with government authorities, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain them in a timely manner. The failure to obtain such permits, licenses, concessions, grants and registrations, or to obtain them in a timely manner, may delay the implementation of new activities, in addition to increase costs, and financial fines or sentences for payment of compensation.\n\nIn case we are fined and/or penalized for not obtaining, timely renewal or canceling our authorizations, licenses, grants and registrations, as well as for non-compliance with environmental legislation, our financial and operational results and our reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, non-compliance with applicable environmental legislation may result in partial or total shutdowns of our operational activities, which may also adversely affect our financial position and reputation.\n\n## Global or regional economic conditions and events may adversely affect the demand for and the price of our products.\n\nDemand for pulp and paper is directly related to the growth of the world economy and economic conditions. Currently, Europe, China and North America are the main consumer markets of the industry. Fluctuations in the value of local currency versus the U.S. dollar, downturns in economic activity, nationalization or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of these countries or regions impacting matters such as sustainability, environmental regulations and trade policies and agreements, could negatively affect our financial results. Any slowing of economic growth in Europe, China and North America could adversely affect the price and volume of our exports and thus impact our operating performance.\n\nAccording to market statistics (PPPC), Chinese demand represented 41% of the global market pulp demand in 2023 and 35% in 2022 (compared to 36% in 2021 and 39% in 2020), and this demand has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 8.0% since 2010, above the global average of 2.4%.",

Historically,  pandemics,  as  well  as  regional  or  global epidemics and outbreaks, have affected sectors of the economy in countries where these diseases have spread, adversely impacting global commercial activity and  contributing  to  significant  volatility  in  the  market.  In  light  of  our  activities  in  the  foreign  market,  such  events  or  potential  reactions  and  mandates  from government authorities could cause disruption of regional and global supply chains and economic activity, including significant volatility in demand, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Prolonged closures, stoppages and shutdowns, if continuing, may disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers, service providers and customers and could materially, adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nFurther, additional waves of outbreaks - including new variants that are more or less aggressive and contagious - may occur, and the intensity of the economic slowdown resulting from actions taken or to be taken by government authorities in response to the pandemic are unpredictable, especially considering that both the severity of the disease and the action plan of local authorities will depend on various unknown factors.\n\n## Our exports are subject to special risks that may adversely affect our business.\n\nWe export to different regions of the world, which makes us subject to special political and regulatory risks, including currency controls in countries where we have payments receivable, possible formal or informal trade barriers and incentive policies and subsidies favoring local producers in many regions.\n\nThus, our future financial performance will depend on the economic, political, environmental and social conditions of our main export markets (Europe, Asia and North America). As a result, factors that are beyond our control include:\n\n- \u00b7 imposition of barriers to trade by certain countries to limit the access of Brazilian companies to their markets or even to subsidize local producers, particularly with respect to paper products, or the granting of commercial incentives in favor of local producers;\n- \u00b7 changes in economic policies and/or conditions of the countries to which we export, which may affect our export capacity and, consequently, our business and operating results;\n- \u00b7 logistics costs, including disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n- \u00b7 significant fluctuations in global demand for pulp products, which could impact our sales, operating income and cash flows;\n- \u00b7 the  deterioration  of  global  economic  conditions,  which  could  impair  the  financial  condition  of  some  of  our  customers  or  foreign  suppliers,  thereby increasing bad debts or non-performance by our foreign suppliers, as well as increasing our costs for financing and refinancing;\n- \u00b7 changes in revenues due to variations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n- \u00b7 controls on currency exchange; and\n- \u00b7 adverse consequences deriving from the need to comply with more stringent regulatory requirements in foreign countries, including environmental rules, regulations and certification requirements.",

New regulations and standards have been approved in multiple jurisdictions and investors have been imposing specific requirements. Regulatory and industry standards and expectations from global forums and stakeholders relating to ESG matters, including with respect to internal controls, assumptions and estimates, are still evolving. As these standards and expectations evolve, our previously acceptable practices may become outdated. This results in increased expenses and increased management time and attention dedicated to ESG-related requirements. If our practices and policies fail to meet our key stakeholders' expectations in respect of ESG matters, our revenue, ability access to capital and our reputation may be adversely impacted. We have publicly shared our ESG initiatives and goals, which makes us subject to enhanced scrutiny from our investors, regulators and the public in general. A number of risks and factors may prevent us from achieving these goals, including our ability to meet the key performance indicators required by our debt instruments with ESG targets. Our failure to make progress in these areas on a timely basis, or revisions of our initiatives and goals, could adversely affect our financial condition, employee retention, brand and reputation.\n\n## We may not be able to successfully implement our strategy relating to acquisitions, joint ventures or similar transactions or manage risks derived from these transactions.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may enter into mergers, acquisitions and divestment from time to time. We may not be able to identify targets for our acquisition strategy or to successfully implement our divestment strategy, to successfully negotiate or close our merger and acquisition transactions, including by not receiving required regulatory approval in Brazil or abroad, which may adversely impact our business strategy and the trading price of our securities.\n\nWe enter from time to time into strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and other strategic partnerships in Brazil or other countries. Conflicts and disagreements with our partners or counterparties, unexpected events or changes in market conditions or failure to manage strategic alliances could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or prevent us from realizing expected gains of these acquisitions or alliances.\n\nIn  addition,  some  of  our  assets  may  be  controlled  and  managed  by  joint  venture  partners  that  may  not  fully  comply  with  our  standards,  controls  and procedures,  including  our  health,  safety,  environment  and  community  standards.  Failure  by  any  of  our  partners  to  adopt  standards,  controls  and  procedures equivalent to ours could lead to higher costs, reduced production or environmental, health and safety incidents or accidents, which could adversely affect our results and reputation.\n\n## We may not successfully integrate our acquired companies or capture the synergies expected from our mergers and acquisitions.\n\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies or to obtain synergies anticipated from our mergers or acquisitions. In particular, we may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings from combination of companies' production facilities, or anticipated synergies from joint acquisitions of raw materials,  sharing  of  improved  production  techniques  and  integration  of  administrative  departments.  If  we  fail  to  achieve  the  synergies  from  our  mergers  or acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition and the trading price for our securities may be adversely affected. Even if we achieve the expected synergies eventual future mergers, we may not be able fully realize them within the anticipated timeframe.",

For further information, see note 16 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report. Under IFRS Accounting Standards, goodwill and intangible assets with undetermined useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually to identify  possible  need for impairment, or more often if any event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Other intangible assets that have determined useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. In addition, under IFRS Accounting Standards we are required to perform an impairment analysis of assets with undetermined useful life when the book value of our net assets exceeds our market capitalization. As a result, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets in future periods if required under IFRS Accounting Standards, which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income. If a significant write down were required, the charge could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or the trading price of our securities.\n\n## The level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and a material portion of our cash flow may need to be used to service our debt obligations, which could impair our ability to operate our business.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had R$77.2 billion of total consolidated outstanding indebtedness (which includes current and non-current loans, financing and debentures). We are subject to the risks normally associated with significant amounts of debt, which could have important consequences to investors. Our indebtedness could, among other things: (i) require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, operations, capital expenditures, dividend payments, strategic acquisitions, expansion of our operations and other business activities; (ii) increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic and industry conditions, and may make us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth; (iii) limit, along with financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, our ability to incur additional debt or equity financing or dispose of assets; and (iv) decrease our ability to deleverage and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\nA significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions, or other significant adverse developments with respect to our results of operations or financial condition, may affect our ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our current business objectives. Moreover, the restrictions associated with these covenants and financial ratios may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Additionally, despite these restrictions, we may be able to incur substantial additional  indebtedness  in  the  future,  which  might  subject  us  to  additional  restrictive  covenants  that  could  affect  our  financial  and  operational  flexibility  and otherwise increase the risks associated with our indebtedness as noted above. We may also need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity, and we may not be able to do this on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nAdditionally,  a  default  under  our  financial  agreements  that  is  not  waived  by  the  relevant  creditors  may  result  in  an  acceleration  of  the  maturity  of  the outstanding balance of such debt and may also accelerate the maturity of other debt that benefits from cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions.

We  also  benefit  from  tax  incentives  granted  by  states  based  on  state  laws.  The program PROMARANHAO in the state of Maranh\u00e3o and the program Desenvolve in the state of Bahia, published through Special Regime n\u00ba 004/2012 and Decree No. 18,270/18, respectively, are the most relevant ones for our operations. We cannot assure you that the tax incentives we currently benefit from will be maintained or renewed, particularly, but not exclusively, in light of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions that may lead to changes in current material incentives, such as the Regime Especial de Aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de Bens de Capital para Empresas Exportadoras ,  which is a special regime for the acquisition of capital goods by exporting companies, and Preponderante Exportador (i.e. RECAP and REIDI), among others. If such tax benefits are not effectively renewed, this could have a material adverse effect on our generation of net cash flow. In the event of constitutional challenges or if we fail to comply with specific obligations to which we are subject in connection with the tax benefits described above, such benefits may be suspended or cancelled, and we may be required to pay the taxes deferred in the last five years in full, plus penalties and interest, which may adversely affect us.\n\nOur exports and international trading activities are also conducted under certain tax regimes, including rulings and incentives in some foreign countries, including Austria. These tax rulings or benefits expire and have to be renewed from time to time. We cannot assure you that the tax regimes and incentives from which we currently benefit will be renewed or maintained in the future. In addition, we also benefit from provisions of international treaties entered into by the Brazilian federal government, such as the taxation treaty between Brazil and Austria, pursuant to which profit earned by our wholly-owned subsidiary in Austria is not subject to taxation in Brazil.\n\nOur interpretation of international treaty provisions may differ from that of the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (RFB). We filed a writ of mandamus in Brazil to enforce certain interpretations related to the Brazil-Austria Treaty. The trial court ruled in our favor, granting the writ and prohibiting the RFB from taxing the profits of the Austrian entity. This decision is subject to appeal, and we are awaiting the appellate court's decision. If the final ruling determines that the BrazilAustria treaty does not prevent the RFB from taxing the profits of the Austrian entity, our financial position could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn June 2023, Brazil adopted rules for a transfer pricing (TP) model aligned with the OECD's guidelines. This new TP system is mandatory for all taxpayers starting January 1, 2024. As a result, the current transfer pricing practices between us and our Austrian entities has changed and may lead to a material impact on our financial condition and operational results.\n\nFluctuations in interest rates, as well as our inability to manage risks associated with the replacement of benchmark indices, could increase the cost of servicing our debt and negatively affect our overall financial performance.\n\nOur financial results are affected by changes in interest rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (wich was used to replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in the respective operations), the Brazilian Interbank Deposit Certificate Rate ( Certificado de Dep\u00f3sito Interbanc\u00e1rio , or CDI) and the Brazilian Long-Term Rate ( Taxa de Longo Prazo ,  or  TLP). The  CDI  rate  has  fluctuated  significantly  in  the  past  in  response  to  the  expansion  or contraction of the Brazilian economy, as it is an instrument for Brazilian Central Bank to manage inflation and pursuit its policies targets. The CDI rate was 11.65% p.a. as of December 31, 2023, while it was 13.65% p.a. and 9.15% p.a. as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The TLP rate was 5.56% p.a., 5.23% p.a. and 4.10% p.a. as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",

On the other hand, a significant reduction in  the  CDI  rate  could  adversely  impact  our  financial  revenues  derived  from  investment  activities,  since  a  material  portion  of  our  cash  is  invested  in Brazilian money market instruments that are linked to the CDI rate.\n\n## A failure of our information technology systems or automated machinery may interrupt our business and negatively impact our operations.

The LGPD regulates the use of personal data in Brazil. The LGPD significantly transformed the data protection system in Brazil and is in line with recent European legislation (the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) to which we are also subject. The current privacy and personal data protection laws or regulations establish detailed rules for the collection, use, processing and storage of personal data.\n\nThe LGPD, in common with other applicable global regulations, will affect all economic sectors, including the relationship between customers and suppliers of  goods  and  services,  employees  and  employers  and  other  relationships  in  which  personal  data  is  collected,  both  in  the  digital  and  physical  environment. Pursuant to these laws, security breaches that may result in significant risk or damage to personal data must be reported to the data protection authorities (DPA) of each jurisdiction, within a reasonable time period. In light of the privacy and personal data protection laws, our practices related to personal data processing may undergo significant  changes,  generating  additional  costs  to  us  due  to  the  need  to  adapt  such  processing  to  the  legal  requirements  and  the  applicable  DPA's guidelines.",

As a result, failure by us to adhere to the laws enacted or approved in different jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nAlthough we have sought to adjust our business processes that include personal data processing in order to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection  requirements,  we  cannot  assure  that  our  personal  data  protection  program  will  be  deemed  sufficient  by  the  data  protection  authorities  to  meet  the provisions of the laws, given the lack of orientation about specific requirements, nor that our practices will prevent any failures in the protection of personal data processed by us, including with respect to cybersecurity incidents.\n\n## A downgrade in our credit ratings may increase our borrowing costs and/or restrict the availability of new capital or financings and have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nThe ratings address the likelihood, according to the respective evaluation methodology of each rating agency, of payment of our debt and obligations at their maturity. The ratings also address the timely payment of interest and other costs on each interest payment date. The assigned ratings to us may be raised, lowered or held constant depending, among other factors, on the rating agencies' respective assessment of our financial strength or a change in methodology of credit assessment adopted by the credit risk agencies. We cannot assure you that our rating will remain for any given period of time or that the rating will not be lowered or withdrawn.\n\nIf  our  credit  ratings  are  downgraded  and  the  market  were  to  perceive  any  such  downgrade  as  a  deterioration  of  our  financial  strength,  our  cost  of borrowing would likely increase and our net income could decrease and our ability to obtain new financing may be adversely affected, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nIn addition, credit rating is sensitive to any change in Brazilian sovereign credit ratings. The credit ratings of the Brazilian sovereign were downgraded in 2016 and 2018 and, despite of a upgrade of the credits ratings in 2023, are no longer investment grade according to the methodologies of the major global rating agencies. Any further decrease in Brazilian sovereign credit ratings may have additional adverse consequences on our ability to obtain financing or our cost of financing and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Unfavorable outcomes in litigation may negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our officers are, and may become, party to numerous tax, civil (including environmental) and labor disputes involving, among other remedies, significant monetary claims. An unfavorable outcome against us may result in our being required to pay substantial amounts of money, which could materially adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, the amounts provisioned for legal proceedings may increase and existing provisions may become insufficient due to unfavorable outcomes in disputes against us. For more information on tax, civil (including environmental), labor and other proceedings, see 'Item 8. Financial Information-Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information-Legal and Administrative Proceedings.'\n\n## Changes in the credit risk of customers and suppliers to whom we have made advances, sales through credit lines or loans may adversely affect us.\n\nIn the markets in which we operate, it is typical, and often a condition for competitive participation, for pulp and paper producers to make advances to suppliers or to make sales to customers on credit. When we make advances, sales on credit or loans to our suppliers or customers, we assume their credit risk. Additionally,  we  assume  additional  risks  when  using  debt  instruments  to  make  advances  and  sales  on  credit  to  our  customers.  Therefore,  changes  in  the macroeconomic environment or the market conditions under which our suppliers and our customers operate, in addition to problems related to the management of our suppliers and clients, may significantly affect their ability to make payments to us, directly impacting our assets and working capital.",

We cannot assure you that we will always be able to match the terms under which we provide financing to our customers and suppliers with the terms of financing provided to us. Any increase in our customers' and suppliers' credit risk or divergence between their and our capital costs may materially adversely affect our shareholders' equity and results of operations.\n\n## Social crisis in the relationship with communities and class entities, as well as expropriation of any of our properties by the government, affect the regular use, cause damage, or deprive us of the use of or fair value compensation of our properties.\n\nOrganized social movements in Brazil advocate for agrarian reform and the redistribution of property, often engaging in irregular occupations in rural areas. In addition, taking advantage of the cover provided by social movements, other groups also illegally occupy rural properties through fraud or other criminal actions. Such occupations when in our operations areas may interrupt our forestry or industrial activities and, consequently, negatively affect our productive and operational results.\n\nLand conflicts can also cause a series of risks to the integrity of our employees who work in the field, possible damage to areas of high environmental value such as Permanent Preservation Areas and buffer zones of Environmental Conservation Units, in addition to reputational damage.\n\nWe actively engage in negotiations with state or federal governments and social movements as an alternative approach, in addition to safeguarding our property rights within legal frameworks. The aim is to find permanent solutions for existing unauthorized occupations and prevent the occurrence of new ones.\n\nIn  Brazil,  with  limited  exceptions  provided  by  law,  only  the  Union,  States,  Municipalities,  Federal  District,  and  Territories  have  the  authority  to  directly engage in the expropriation of land. Typically, the expropriation of rural areas arises from a failure to fulfill the social function of the property, which is a fundamental principle  of  property  rights  in  Brazil.  If  a  property  owned  by  us  is  expropriated,  our  equity  may  be  negatively  impacted,  as  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the compensation provided by the government will be sufficient to cover our losses. A significant risk associated with this scenario is that the financial compensation offered by the governments may prove to be inadequate, or we may be compelled to accept compensation in the form of public debt securities, which have limited liquidity.\n\n## The deterioration in labor relations with employees could adversely affect us.\n\nWe depend on intensive use of labor in our activities. Most of our employees are represented by unions, and their employment contracts are regulated by collective  bargaining  agreements.  New  collective  bargaining  agreements  may  have  shorter  terms  than  our  previous  agreements,  and,  if  we  are  not  able  to negotiate  collective  bargaining  agreements  on  acceptable  terms  to  us,  we  may  be  subject  to  a  significant  increase  in  labor  costs,  deterioration  of  employee relations, slowdowns or work stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\nAdditionally, changes in safety and outsourcing regulations may result in an increase in our labor-related costs. We may be considered secondarily liable for  any  employment  obligations  relating  to  such  employees  or  a  direct  employment  relationship  may  be  established  by  the  labor  courts  with  the  outsourced employees and us, according to the current regulation in force.\n\nThe introduction of a stricter legal framework regarding the use of outsourced employees or third-party subcontractors, and/or the imposition of additional obligations on the contractor of outsourced services, may increase our labor-related costs and may adversely affect our business and operations.",

If we fail to provide all necessary safety equipment and ensure the proper use of the safety equipment, or if we work with companies that are not sufficiently committed to ensuring the safety of their own employees, we may be held liable for any accidents that take place at our worksites. Any accidents at our worksites may expose us to the payment of indemnifications, fines and penalties.\n\nIn addition, any changes to existing safety regulations may impose additional obligations on us and result in an increase in our expenses with respect to safety equipment and procedures. For instance, changes imposing a reduced workday for safety reasons may result in reduced productivity, forcing us to hire additional  staff.  Similarly,  provisions  requiring  us  to  install  or  buy  additional  safety  equipment  could  increase  our  labor-related  costs  and  adversely  affect  our operating costs and results.\n\n## Our hedging activities may expose us to losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or interest rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition.\n\nWe regularly enter into currency, interest rate, commodity price and inflation hedging transactions using financial derivatives instruments, such as future contracts, options and swaps, in accordance with our policies. We have traditionally used hedging transactions to, among others, (1) protect our revenue (which is primarily  denominated in U.S. dollars)  when converted to reais (our functional currency), (2) convert part of our debt which is denominated in reais into  U.S. dollars, (3) swap floating interest rates of our debt to fixed interest rates, (4) swap floating monetary variation of our debt to fixed rate, and swap part of our IPCA indexed debt to CDI.\n\nWe account for our derivative instruments at fair value, in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The fair value of such instruments may increase or decrease due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or interest rates, among others, prior to their settlement date. We may incur losses due to these market risk factors. Fluctuations may also result from changes in economic conditions, investor sentiment, monetary and fiscal policies, the liquidity of global markets, international and regional political events, acts of war, terrorism, among others.\n\nIn the event that we cease to undertake hedging transactions to the extent necessary, we may be exposed to currency exchange, interest rate and inflation risks, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Delays  in  the  expansion  of  our  facilities,  building  new  facilities  or  the  ramp  up  of  new  or  expanded  facilities  may  increase  our  costs  and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we may decide to expand our existing production facilities or build new production facilities. The expansion or construction of a production facility involves various risks, such as engineering, construction, operational systems, integration with the existing mill on brownfield projects, regulatory and other expected or unexpected significant challenges. These risks delay or prevent the successful operation of the project or significantly increase our costs. Our ability to complete successfully any expansion or new construction project subject to risks, including:\n\n- \u00b7 we may either not be able to complete any expansion or new construction project on time or within the expected budget or be required by market conditions or other factors to delay the initiation of construction or the timetable to complete new projects or expansions, including adverse weather conditions,  natural  disasters,  pandemics,  fires,  delays  in  supply,  inputs  or  labor  and  accidents  that  impair  or  prevent  the  development  of  ongoing projects;\n- \u00b7 our new or modified facilities may not operate at designed capacity, ramp up its learning curve as planned or may cost more to operate than we expect;\n- \u00b7 we may not be able to sell our additional production at competitive prices;\n- \u00b7 we may not have cash, or be able to acquire financing, to implement our growth plans;",

In addition, we do not maintain insurance coverage against wars, unforeseeable fortuitous events, force majeure, interruption of certain activities, including due to pandemics, as well as fire, thefts, pests, diseases, droughts and other risks to our forests. The occurrence of losses or other liabilities that are not covered by insurance, due to the limited extent of the insurance coverage, losses that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or any other reason that prevents reimbursement or indemnification, could result in significant and unexpected additional costs, our ability to operate and/or shortage of wood supply, which may affect our production. Moreover, the terms and conditions for the renewal of our insurance policies may change in the future depending upon market circumstances and the type and amount of risks insured. See 'Item 4.

This influence, as well as Brazilian political and economic conditions, may materially and adversely affect us, our activities and the trading prices of our shares.\n\nWe conduct a substantial amount of our operations in Brazil, and we sell part of our products to customers in the Brazilian market. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 22.3% of our net revenues were derived from Brazil. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are substantially dependent on  economic  conditions  in  Brazil.  Future  developments  in  the  Brazilian  economy  may  affect  Brazil's  growth  rates  and,  consequently,  the  consumption  of  our products. As a result, these developments could impair our business strategies, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nThe Brazilian economy has been characterized by frequent, and occasionally drastic, interventions by the Brazilian federal government, which have often changed monetary, credit and other policies to influence Brazil's economy. The Brazilian federal government's actions to control inflation and other policies have often involved wage and price controls, depreciation of the real , changes in tax policies, controls on remittances abroad, fluctuations of the Central Bank of Brazil's base interest rate, as well as other measures. We have no control over, nor can we foresee, any measures or policies that the Brazilian federal government may adopt in the future. We may be materially adversely affected by changes in the policies of the Brazilian federal government, in addition to other general economic factors, including, without limitation:\n\n- \u00b7 political, economic and social instability;\n- \u00b7 monetary policies;\n- \u00b7 political elections;\n- \u00b7 inflation;\n- \u00b7 exchange rate fluctuations;",

Accordingly, such uncertainties and other future developments in the Brazilian economy may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation, negatively impacting our available cash flows for payment, and the trading price of our common shares.\n\n## Changes in Brazilian fiscal policies and tax laws may adversely affect us.\n\nOn December 20, 2023, Constitutional Amendment (EC) No. 132 was enacted, establishing a Tax Reform on consumption. Various aspects of the Reform, including the rates of new taxes, are still pending regulation through infraconstitutional legislation, which must be submitted to the National Congress for review within 180 days.\n\nThe Reform adopts a Value Added Tax (VAT) model with dual competencies, consisting of a federal tax (Contribution on Goods and Services - CBS) and a subnational tax (Tax on Goods and Services - IBS), which will replace the existing PIS, COFINS, ICMS, and ISS taxes.\n\nAdditionally, a Selective Tax (IS) has been introduced under federal jurisdiction, targeting the production, extraction, commercialization, or importation of goods and services detrimental to health and the environment, as defined by the LC. A transition period is set from 2026 to 2033, during which both the old and new tax systems will coexist. The full effects of the Reform on the calculation of the aforementioned taxes, starting from the transition period, will become clear only after the enactment of the required subordinate legislation.\n\nThe Brazilian federal government still maintains on its agenda the willingness for (i) revoking the income tax exemption over the distribution of dividends, which, if promulgated, would increase tax expenses associated with any dividends or distributions and (ii) decreasing import tax (which would increase competition and the role of international competitors), both of which could impact on our ability to pay future dividends. Any purported tax reform or change in fiscal policies, if proposed and implemented, may also significantly impact our business. If there is a tax reform or any changes in applicable laws and regulations that alter the applicable taxes or tax incentives/special regimes, either during or after their terms of validity, our business and results may be affected.\n\nIndeed, the Brazilian federal government has frequently implemented, and may continue to implement, changes in its fiscal policies, including, but not limited to, changes to tax rates, fees, sectorial charges and occasionally the collection of temporary contributions. Some of these measures may result in tax hikes that may negatively affect our business. Increases in taxes could also materially adversely impact industry profitability and the prices of our services, restrict our ability to do business in our existing and target markets and cause our financial results to be negatively impacted. If we are unable to pass on the additional costs associated with such fiscal policy changes to our clients through the prices we charge for our services, we may be adversely affected.\n\nUncertainty over whether the acting Brazilian federal government will implement changes in policy or regulation affecting these or other factors in the future may contribute to economic uncertainty in Brazil and to heightened volatility in the securities issued abroad by Brazilian companies.",

Depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will increase such revenues when denominated in reai s, while appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will decrease such export revenues. Our revenues in the domestic market are also affected  by  exchange  rate  fluctuation,  to  the  extent  that  imported  products  quoted  in  U.S.  dollars  become  more  or  less  competitive  in  the  domestic  market depending on the exchange rate variation.\n\nFurthermore, some of our costs and operating expenses are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the real against the U.S. dollar, including export insurance, freight costs and the cost of certain chemicals we use as raw materials. Depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will increase such costs, while appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar will reduce these costs.\n\nAdditionally, we may be adversely affected by depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar, since a significant portion of our debt is expressed in U.S. dollars. Depreciation or appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar may increase or decrease, as applicable, our financial expenses arising from these debt and other obligations in U.S. dollars, as well as adversely affect our ability to comply with certain covenants under financing agreements, which require us to maintain specific financial ratios. On the other hand, a significant appreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar or an appreciation during an extended period of time may significantly affect our cost structure and negatively affect our competitiveness in export markets.\n\nAs a result of inflationary pressures in past years, the Brazilian real had periodically devalued in relation to the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. In the last two years, the increase of interest rates in Brazil has led to a higher carry level, resulting in an appreciation of the Brazilian real in relation to the U.S. dollar. The Brazilian federal government has in the past implemented various economic plans and utilized a number of exchange rate policies, including sudden devaluations, periodic mini-devaluations during which the frequency of adjustments has ranged from daily to monthly, floating exchange rate systems, exchange controls and dual exchange rate markets. From time to time, there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Brazilian real ,  the U.S. dollar and other currencies. There can be no assurance that the real will not depreciate or be devalued again against the U.S. dollar or against any other foreign currency.\n\nDevaluations of the real relative to the U.S. dollar could create additional inflationary pressures in Brazil, lead to increases in interest rates, further limit our access to foreign financial markets and prompt the adoption of recessionary policies by the Brazilian federal government. Conversely, the depreciation of the real against the U.S. dollar may lead to a further deterioration of Brazil's current account and balance of payments and cause a decrease in Brazilian exports. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect the Brazilian economy as a whole, and, consequently, our results. In recent years, the Central Bank of Brazil has occasionally intervened to control unstable movements in the foreign exchange rate. We cannot predict whether the Central Bank of Brazil will continue to let the real float freely. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict what impact the Brazilian Central Bank exchange rate policies may have on us. We cannot assure that in the  future  the  Brazilian  federal  government  will  not  impose  a  currency  band  within  which  the real U.S.  dollarreal exchange  rate  could  fluctuate  or  set  fixed exchange rates, nor can we predict what impact such an event might have on our business, financial position or operating results.",

Although economic conditions are different in each country, the reaction of investors to developments in one country may cause the domestic or international capital markets prices to fluctuate. Developments or conditions in other countries, including non-recurrent events such as US-China trade war, acts of war and related sanctions and other events have at times significantly affected the availability of credit in the Brazilian economy and resulted in considerable outflows of funds and reductions in the amount of foreign currency invested in Brazil, as well as limited access to international capital markets, all of which may materially and adversely affect our ability to borrow funds at an acceptable interest rate or to raise equity capital when and if we should have such a need.\n\nAdditionally,  we  depend  on  third-party  financing  to  carry  out  our  activities,  especially  to  finance  our  capital  expenditures  and  working  capital.  In circumstances of limited liquidity, credit availability may be scarce, expensive or nonexistent, and we may face difficulties in our regular activities and in honoring our financial commitments.\n\n## Risks Relating to Our Shares and ADSs\n\n## Exchange controls and restrictions on remittances abroad may adversely affect holders of ADSs.\n\nBrazilian laws provide that whenever a serious imbalance in Brazil's balance of payments exists or is anticipated, the Brazilian federal government may impose temporary restrictions on the repatriation by foreign investors of the proceeds of their investment in Brazil and on the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency. You may be adversely affected if the Brazilian federal government imposes restrictions on the remittance to foreign investors of the proceeds of their investments in Brazil and, as it has done in the past, on the conversion of the real into  foreign currencies. These restrictions could hinder or prevent the conversion of dividends, distributions or the proceeds from any sale of shares, as the case may be, into U.S. dollars and the remittance of U.S. dollars abroad. We cannot assure that the government will not take this measure or similar measures in the future. Holders of ADSs could be adversely affected by delays in, or a refusal  to  grant,  any  required  governmental  approval  for  conversion  of real payments  and  remittances  abroad  in  respect  of  the  shares,  including  the  shares underlying the ADSs. In such a case, the ADS depositary will distribute reais or hold the reais it cannot convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid.\n\n## Holders  of  ADSs  may  face  difficulties  in  serving  process  on  or  enforcing  judgments  against  us  and  other  persons,  as  well  as  may  face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are subject to different corporate rules and regulations than a U.S. company.\n\nWe are organized under and are subject to the laws of Brazil and all our directors and executive officers and our independent registered public accounting firm  reside  or  are  based  in  Brazil.  Substantially  all  of  our  assets  and  those  of  these  other  persons  are  located  in  Brazil.  Moreover,  our  corporate  affairs  are governed by our bylaws and Brazilian Corporate Law, which differ from the legal principles that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States or elsewhere outside Brazil. In addition, the rights of an ADS holder, which are derivative of the rights of holders of our common shares, to protect their interests are different under Brazilian Corporate Law than under the laws of other jurisdictions. Rules against insider trading and self-dealing and the preservation of shareholder interests may also be different in Brazil than in the United States. The structure of a class action in Brazil is different from that in the US, and under Brazilian law, shareholders in Brazilian companies do not have standing to bring a class action, and under our by-laws must, generally with respect to disputes concerning rules regarding the operation of the capital markets, arbitrate any such disputes.",

Because judgments of U.S. courts for civil liabilities based upon the U.S. federal securities laws may only be enforced in Brazil if certain conditions are met, the ADS holders may face greater difficulties in protecting their interests due to actions by us, our directors or executive officers than would shareholders of a U.S. corporation.\n\n## The relative volatility and lack of liquidity of the markets for our securities may adversely affect holders of our shares and the ADSs.\n\nInvestments in securities, such as our common shares or ADSs, of issuers from emerging market countries, including Brazil, involve a higher degree of risk than investments in securities of issuers from more developed countries. The Brazilian securities market is substantially smaller, less liquid, more concentrated and more volatile than major securities markets in the United States and other jurisdictions, and may be regulated differently from the ways familiar to U.S. investors. There  is  also  significantly  greater  concentration  in  the  Brazilian  securities  market  than  in  major  securities  markets  in  the  United  States.  These  features  may substantially limit the ability to sell our shares, including our shares underlying the ADSs, at a price and time at which holders wish to do so and, as a result, could negatively impact the market price of these securities.\n\nIn addition, although our public float represented 51.8% (excluding Treasury Shares) of our total capital float as of December 31, 2023, only 3.7% were represented by ADSs. Our controlling shareholders (including related parties and management) hold 47.0% of our stock. Any potential sale by these shareholders could adversely affect the market price of our securities.\n\n## Holders of ADSs may find it difficult to exercise voting rights at our shareholders' meetings.\n\nHolders of ADSs do not have the same voting rights as holders of our shares. Holders of ADSs will not be our direct shareholders and will be unable to enforce directly the rights of shareholders under our bylaws and Brazilian Corporate Law, they are entitled to the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the  deposit  agreement.  Holders  of  ADSs  will  face  practical  limitations  in  exercising  their  voting  rights  because  of  the  additional  steps  involved  in  our communications with ADS holders. For example, we are required to publish a notice of our shareholders' meetings in specified newspapers in Brazil. Holders of our shares will be able to exercise their voting rights by attending a shareholders' meeting in person or voting by proxy.

To exercise their voting rights, ADSs holders have to provide instructions to the depositary on a timely basis on how they wish to vote. In practice, the ability of a holder of ADSs to instruct the depositary as to voting will depend on the timing and procedures for providing instructions to the depositary, either directly or through the holder's custodian and clearing system and this voting process necessarily will take longer for holders of ADSs than for holders of our shares.\n\nHolders of ADSs also may not receive the voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote the shares underlying their ADSs.

The conversion of ADSs directly into ownership of the underlying shares is governed by CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014, and foreign investors who intend to proceed with such conversion are required to appoint a representative in Brazil for purposes of Annex I of CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014, who will be in charge of keeping and updating the investors' certificates of registrations with the Central Bank of Brazil,  and  the  Brazilian  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (Comiss\u00e3o  de  Valores  Mobili\u00e1rios  -  'CVM'),  pursuant  to  the  procedure  provided  for  CVM Resolution No. 13, of November 2020.\n\nwhich entitles registered foreign investors to buy and sell directly on B3.

History and Development of the Company\n\nWe, Suzano S.A., were incorporated as a corporation on December 8, 1987 under the laws of Brazil. We have the legal status of a sociedade por a\u00e7\u00f5es , or a stock corporation, under the Brazilian Corporation Law. Our principal place of business is located at Avenida Brigadeiro Faria Lima, 1355, 7th floor, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, 01452-919, Brazil (telephone: +55 11 3503-9000). Our shares are traded on the special listing segment of the B3, which provides for the highest level of corporate governance in the Brazilian market, and our ADSs are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nOur activities began in 1924, when Leon Feffer, our founder, first entered the paper business to resell national and imported paper used for business cards, writing pads and stationery. In the late 1930s, with the purchase of its first machine, the Suzano Group began to produce its own paper. In the 1950s, Companhia  Suzano  de  Papel  e  Celulose  ('Companhia  Suzano')  was  formed,  becoming  what  we  believe  to  be  the  first  global  industrial-scale  producer  of eucalyptus pulp. In the mid-1960s, Companhia Suzano became the first paper producer to use 100% eucalyptus pulp in the production of printing and writing paper, according to 'The History of the Pulp and Paper Industry in Brazil' (' A Hist\u00f3ria da Ind\u00fastria de Celulose e Papel no Brasil '),  published by the Brazilian Technical Association of Paper and Pulp ( Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira T\u00e9cnica de Papel e Celulose ), or the ABTCP, in 2004. Today, we believe we are the world's largest producer of market pulp, with an aggregate installed capacity of 10.9 million metric tons of eucalyptus pulp per year and a broad and diversified forest base.\n\nIn  1987  Companhia  Suzano incorporated  Bahia  Sul  S.A.  ('Bahia  Sul'),  a  joint  venture  between  Companhia  Suzano  and  Vale  S.A.  In  1992,  we  were granted registration as a publicly traded company by CVM. In early 2001, Companhia Suzano acquired all shares of Bahia Sul previously held by Vale, becoming the  holder  of  100%  of  the  voting  capital  of  Bahia  Sul  and  73%  of  its  total  share  capital. At  the  same  year,  the  management  of  Bahia  Sul  was  unified  with Companhia Suzano's management, aiming to obtain synergies to implement a solid growth strategy in the paper and pulp sector.\n\nIn September 2002, Companhia Suzano and Bahia Sul carried out a reorganization, which resulted in an increase in Companhia Suzano's equity in the total share capital of Bahia Sul to 93.9%. In June 2004, as part of the corporate restructuring process, it was approved the merger of Companhia Suzano on Bahia Sul.\n\nIn 2004, we joined Level 1 Corporate Governance of B3 to enhance transparency and accountability to shareholders. And in 2006, our name was changed to Suzano Papel e Celulose S.A.\n\nIn 2015, we started the production of fluff pulp and announced investments in the tissue segment.\n\nIn December 2018, we started trading our Level II ADRs, in accordance with the program approved by the CVM. The Bank of New York Mellon is acting as our depositary bank in the United States, responsible for issuing the respective depositary shares, at the ratio of one ADS for one common share. We are subject to reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and are required to file with the SEC, or furnish to the SEC, reports and other information.\n\nIn January 2019, we acquired Fibria Celulose S.A. ('Fibria') and became the world's largest producer of market pulp, with an aggregate installed capacity of 10.9 million metric tons of eucalyptus pulp per year and a broad and diversified forest base.\n\nIn October 2021, our board of directors approved the construction of a new pulp production mill with a nominal capacity of 2,550,000 tons of eucalyptus pulp per year, to be located in the municipality of Ribas do Rio Pardo, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, known as Cerrado Project. We estimate that the new plant will start operating until June 2024. The Project Cerrado represents an important development in our long-term strategy, contributing to the expansion of its structural competitiveness, meeting the growing demand for hardwood pulp, and to our evolution in sustainability.",

With this initiative, we aim to accelerate the process of open innovation and become a global platform to encourage entrepreneurship around solutions for the bioeconomy based on planted forests.  The  focus  of  Suzano  Ventures'  investments  are  on  (i)  cellulosic  biomass  technologies  and  applications,  (ii)  cellulosic  packaging,  (iii)  agrotechnology companies that accelerate agroforestry productivity and (iv) carbon capture, measurement and management, in businesses in the Pre-Seed to Series A phases.\n\nIn November 2022, we, along with Ita\u00fa Unibanco, Marfrig, Rabobank, Santander and Vale announced the creation of \"Biomas\", a new company focused entirely on the restoration, conservation and preservation of forests in Brazil. The company's mission is to restore and protect, over the next 20 years, four million hectares of native forest in some of Brazil's most valuable ecosystems, including the Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes.\n\nIn June, 2023, we completed the purchase of Kimberly-Clark's Tissue business and became the Brazilian market leader in the toilet paper segment with 24% of the toilet paper market in terms of transaction value. The acquisition involved a factory located in Mogi das Cruzes (SP), which contractually provides for an installed capacity of approximately 130 thousand tons per year for manufacturing, marketing, distribution and/or sale of tissue products in the country, including ownership of the brand.' NEVE', bringing to us a complementarity of brands, product categories and geography.\n\n## B.    Business Overview\n\n## Industry\n\nPulp can be either recycled or virgin pulp. Recycled pulp is made from used materials, such as printing and writing papers, newsprint, packaging and other types of carton board, and then processed by chemicals in order to remove printing inks and other elements. Virgin pulp can be manufactured from a number of raw materials, such as wood, bagasse and bamboo, and it is classified based on the type of wood or fiber derived from the corresponding raw material as well as the processing system used and whether the pulp will be bleached. Bleached pulp is used for several purposes, including printing and writing, specialty, packaging paperboard and tissue papers. Unbleached pulp has a brown color and is used in the production of packages, corrugated board, paperboard, packaging papers, bags and tissue.\n\nThe most common raw material that we use to produce paper is wood pulp. Different tree species yield different fiber characteristics and, consequently, different paper attributes such as strength, softness and opacity.\n\nThere are two types of wood pulp: hardwood pulp and softwood pulp. Hardwood pulp is produced using hardwood trees, such as eucalyptus, aspen, birch, acacia,  maple,  oaks,  beech  trees  and  poplars,  which  have  shorter  fibers.  Short  fiber  is  generally  best  suited  for  the  manufacture  of  products  that  require smoothness, brightness, uniformity and absorption properties, such as coated and uncoated printing and writing paper, tissue paper, specialty papers as image paper and d\u00e9cor laminate paper as well as packaging paperboard. Softwood pulp is produced using softwood trees (e.g. pine, spruce and fir) and is generally best suited for the manufacture of products that require greater durability and strength, such as kraftliner, newsprint, catalogues, boards, lightweight coated paper and tissue.  However,  paper  producers  may  also  substitute  fibers  used  in  the  paper  manufacturing  process  according  to  market  availability  by  applying  further processing, as refining mechanical treatment. The substitution depends on the raw materials and equipment available and the specifications of the final product. Pulp can be produced by integrated paper producers or by market pulp producers who sell the pulp to non-integrated or semi-integrated paper producers. In 2022, approximately 37% of global pulp virgin fiber consumption was 'market pulp' (Hawkins Wright - The Outlook for Market Pulp (August 2023)); that is, pulp sold by pulp mills and bought by paper mills. We produce pulp for our own paper production (integrated pulp) and to sell to other papermakers (market pulp). We produce only hardwood pulp from our renewable forests of planted eucalyptus trees. Eucalyptus pulp is widely accepted among producers of printing and writing paper, specialty papers and tissue papers worldwide because of its properties and cash production cost, and it has represented an increasing percentage of the world production of hardwood pulp. Eucalyptus trees in Brazil have a shorter growth cycle than other hardwood trees (approximately seven years in Brazil) and higher yield per planted hectare.",

Thus, we believe that we are among Brazilian pulp producers that have the lowest production cost in the global market.\n\nThe key drivers of global virgin pulp demand growth are packaging, tissue and special paper. According to Hawkins Wright these grades presented a production compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2010 to 2022 of 6.5%, 5.1% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nPaper consumption in China has been the main driver of demand growth over the past years.

We believe that we are one of the largest vertically integrated producers of pulp and paper in Latin America and, according to Hawkins Wright, we were the largest producer of eucalypt pulp in the world and virgin market pulp in the world in 2022. As other Brazilian eucalyptus pulp producers, we have one of the lowest cost of pulp production in the world. We believe our modern technology of plantation and harvesting and our strategic location for plantation facilities are among our competitive strengths.\n\nWe believe we are one of Brazil's largest paper producers, and based on data from IB\u00c1, we accounted for nearly 43% of the printing and writing paper and 27% of the paperboard produced in Brazil in 2023.\n\nOur structure includes administrative offices in Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo, two integrated pulp and paper production facilities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Suzano and Limeira units), a non-integrated paper production facility in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo (Rio Verde unit), an integrated pulp, paper and tissue facility in the state of Bahia (Mucuri unit), an integrated pulp and tissue facility in the state of Maranh\u00e3o (Imperatriz unit), two paper facilities in the states of Par\u00e1 and Cear\u00e1 (Facepa), and FuturaGene, a biotechnology research and development unit.

These mills  are  located  approximately  150  km  from  the  port  of  Santos,  an  important  export  hub. They  can  supply  both  domestic  and  international markets in a competitive manner.\n\nOur  Mucuri  and Aracruz  units  are  focused  primarily  on  export  markets.  Mucuri  is  located  approximately  250  km  from  Portocel,  a  port  specialized  in exporting pulp located in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, in which Suzano holds a 51% stake, while Aracruz is located only three km from Portocel.\n\nThe Imperatriz unit, in Maranh\u00e3o, is also focused primarily on export markets. Its gateway for the external market is the Port of Itaqui, 600 km far from Imperatriz. Exports are carried from our mill to the ports by train, which allows for very competitive transportation costs.\n\nThe Tr\u00eas Lagoas unit, in Mato Grosso do Sul, is focused on export markets, and most of its volume is transported by train to the Port of Santos, where all exporting volumes are shipped. The relatively short distances between our planted forests, our mills and most of our Brazilian customers or export facilities provide us with relatively low transportation costs.\n\n## Pulp and Paper\n\nWe manufacture a diverse range of eucalyptus pulp and paper products, including pulp utilized in our paper production processes and market pulp. Our sales encompass both domestic market and international. Our product portfolio includes coated and uncoated printing and writing paper, paperboard, tissue paper, market pulp, and fluff pulp. Specifically within the printing and writing paper category, we offer various sizes and shapes, including cut paper for general purposes (cut-size), folio size, and reels. Our sales are not concentrated in any specific customer, in either the Brazilian or the export markets. As of December 31, 2023, one of our customers was responsible for 10.3% of the net sales of pulp segment (10.7% on December 31, 2022) and no customer was responsible for more than 10.0% of the net sales of paper segment on December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Pulp and Paper Production Process\n\nOur  production  process  comprises  the  three  main  stages:  (i)  planting  and  harvesting  forests;  (ii)  pulp  manufacturing;  and  (iii)  paper  manufacturing. Consistent with our strategy of conducting our business in accordance with the highest environmental standards, we use plantation and harvesting techniques that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, such as minimum-impact cultivation and soil preparation techniques that avoid erosion, maintain soil fertility along generations and promote high levels of efficiency and productivity.\n\n## Planting and Harvesting Forests\n\nThe development of our planted forests starts in our nurseries, where we use the most modern cloning technology available, and in third-party nurseries that use our genetic materials. The saplings we produce in our nurseries are a variety of eucalyptus that increases the production of pulp and are well suited for the climate and other geographic aspects of the micro-regions in which they will be planted. A harvester is used to cut, de-limb and de-bark the trees, and to cut them into logs. Part of the bark and leaves of the harvested trees is left in the planted forests. A forwarder carries the logs to the edge of the planting area, where a loader loads the logs onto a truck for transportation to the mill.\n\nThe management of our forests is the base that  sustains  our  business,  based  on  the  planting  and  management  of  renewable  forests,  targeting  of  a competitive supply of wood through long-term planning and development and application of genetic improvements. As of December 31, 2023, we owned or leased approximately 2.9 million hectares of land, of which approximately 1.5 million hectares were used for eucalyptus cultivation and 1.2 million for forestry reserves, ensuring compliance with Brazilian law that determines the percentage of area required for legal and permanent preservation reserves, located mainly along the rivers. Remaining 0.2 million hectares are related to other uses such as roads. Our production units are in compliance with or exceed environmental standards both Brazilian and international - for the production of pulp and paper.",

Together, these factors enable us to enjoy: a high and increasing average volume of wood per planted hectare; a higher concentration of fibers  per  ton  of  harvested  wood;  the  sustainable  development  of  our  operations;  relatively  low  operating  costs;  and  eucalyptus  tree  harvest  rotations  of approximately seven years, a period shorter than the harvest rotation periods in other regions of the world.\n\n## Pulp Manufacturing\n\nThe pulp manufacturing process takes place in two stages:\n\nThe 'Kraft' Cooking Process. The logs received in our pulp mills are first de-barked, if not already de-barked in the field, and chipped in small pieces. The wood chips are screened by size and then transferred with conveyors to the impregnation stage followed by a pressurization and feeding system to the digester where they are 'cooked' with sodium sulfide and caustic soda. This 'kraft' cooking process is known for minimizing damage to the pulp fibers and allows the recovery of chemicals, thereby preserving high uniformity and strength of the fibers for subsequent paper production or other uses. During the cooking process, the cellulose fibers are separated from lignin and resins to produce unbleached pulp fibers. The unbleached pulp is screened and washed and then submitted to a pre-bleaching stage where oxygen delignification takes place. The Kraft cooking combined with the pre-bleaching removes approximately 95.0% of the lignin. At this point, the pulp can already be used to make certain types of paperboard like in one of the paper machines of the Suzano mill. Although not our main product, unbleached pulp grades can be commercialized or used for specialty of packaging papers or boards. The lignin and by-products of the Kraft process form a substance known as 'black liquor' that are separated and piped to evaporators, to increase the concentration of solids. Thereafter, the concentrated black liquor is burned in recovery boilers. In the recovery boilers, the black liquor is the main source of fuel to produce steam and electricity for the whole production process. Also, approximately 99.0% of the chemicals used in the kraft cooking process are recovered for reuse in a closed chemical recovery process loop. Only make up chemicals are required to recover losses.\n\nBleaching. To produce bleached pulp the unbleached pulp is submitted to a chemical bleaching process. The bleaching process promotes further selective delignification and increases brightness of the fibers. This process consists of a series of medium-consistency bleaching stages in towers. In each bleaching tower a different mixture of bleaching agents is applied and after each stage, the pulp is washed. Three or four bleaching stages are required to obtain a fully bleached pulp. Our modern and low environmental impact bleaching processes are elemental chlorine free (ECF). The bleaching process is designed to be harmless and utilizes  chlorine-dioxide,  sulfuric  acid,  caustic  soda  and  oxygen  peroxide and does not use elemental chlorine. At the end of the bleaching stages, the diluted bleached pulp, in its fluid state, is pumped to storage towers. Thereafter, the bleached pulp may be transferred directly to integrated operations in our own paper production  or  tissue  paper  facilities.  We  produce  paper  in  the  Mucuri,  Suzano  and  Limeira  mills  and  also  supply  slushed  pulp  to  integrated  paper  producing customers in Jacare\u00ed (Ahlstrom) and Tr\u00eas Lagoas (Sylvamo Corporation). Our tissue paper production takes place in the Mucuri and Imperatriz mills. The majority of bleached pulp is, however, sold as raw material after drying in big capacity drying machines and converted to bales. In the Suzano mill, we are also producing dried pulp in rolls for fluff applications.",

        "page_content": "## Paper and Tissue Paper Manufacturing\n\nWe produce (i) uncoated woodfree printing and writing paper at our Mucuri unit, Limeira unit, Suzano unit and Rio Verde unit; (ii) coated woodfree printing and writing paper at our Suzano unit and Limeira unit; (iii) paperboard at our Suzano unit and (iv) tissue papers at Mucuri, Maracanau, Cachoeiro do Itapemirim, Imperatriz, Mogi das Cruzes and Bel\u00e9m. We start the paper production process by sending the pulp to refiners, which increases the fibers' resistance. The pulp slurry is then fed into the paper mill, where it is mixed with fillers and additives to provide the necessary properties required by paper grade and the end users. These additives  include  synthetic  sizing,  precipitated  calcium  carbonate,  optical  dyes,  and  others.  During  the  paper  and  paperboard  production,  the  sheet  is formed, pressed and dried in a continuous process. At the end of the process, jumbo rolls are obtained and then converted into reels, folio sheets or cut-size paper. In the case of coated paper, the paper receives additional surface treatments with coating and additional drying before converting to reels or sized papers. Tissue papers are produced in dedicated tissue machines. Different from other paper machines, the tissue ones seek for other characteristics like softness, bulk and  absorption.  Tissue  paper  production  requires  very  little  additives  and  mechanical  preparation  of  the  fibers  (refining)  in  special  parameters,  normally  low intensity. Tissue papers are produced in dedicated tissue machines, different from other paper machines and seek for other characteristics like softness, volume and absorbance. Tissue paper production requires very little additives and mechanical preparation of the fibers (refining). The produced tissue paper mother rolls can be converted on site, converted in dedicated conversion units or sold.\n\nComputerized  systems  control  or  monitor  all  process  stages.  The  marketing,  sales  and  production,  personnel  work  close  together  to  manage  the programming and control of our paper production process. In this manner, we are able to plan, optimize and customize different product runs and to anticipate, respond and adapt to seasonal variations and customer preferences.\n\n## Pulp and Paper Production Schedule\n\nOur integrated pulp and paper mills operate three shifts, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of scheduled maintenance periods. The dates of these maintenance periods are flexible and may be moved as a result of factors such as production, market conditions and supply of materials. We keep an inventory of certain spare parts that we consider critical to the production process or that are difficult to replace. We have also developed a close relationship with our suppliers to ensure access to spare parts.\n\n## Pulp Sales\n\n## Pulp Sales\n\nIn  the  years  ended  December  31,  2023,  2022  and  2021,  we  sold  10.2  million  tons,  10.6  million  tons  and  10.6  million  tons  of  pulp  as  market  pulp, respectively, of which 6.9%, 7.1% and 7.5% was sold in the Brazilian domestic market and 93.1%, 92.9% and 92.5% was sold in the export market.\n\nThe following table sets forth our Brazilian domestic and export sales of pulp for the periods indicated.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                            | For the year ended December 31,   | For the year ended December 31,   | For the year ended December 31,   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                            | 2023                              | 2022                              | 2021                              |\n|                            | (in tons)                         | (in tons)                         | (in tons)                         |\n| Suzano's pulp sales volume |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Brazilian                  | 700,823                           | 751,212                           | 796,708                           |\n| International              | 9,514,617                         | 9,848,441                         | 9,789,129                         |\n| Total                      | 10,215,440                        | 10,599,653                        | 10,585,837                        |",

Most of our customers are tissue, printing and writing and specialty paper producers that value the high-quality pulp produced and the reliability of supply provided by us. The majority of deliveries to final customers during last year were made from our overseas terminals in the United States, Europe, - and direct shipments to Asia.\n\nPrices may vary among the different geographic regions in which our customers are located. For a specific region, usually the price arrangements under our sales contracts are consistent with each customer profile, varying according to volume negotiated, regularity of purchase and our commercial strategy. Our sales contracts provide for early termination in the event of a material breach, insolvency of one of the parties or a force majeure event of an extended duration.\n\nWe have a diversified customer base for its pulp products. Our customers generally purchase their products using credit provided by us. We believe we have a good knowledge base to manage our credit risk portfolio through financial (letters of credit and insurance) and non-financial instruments (guarantees).\n\n## Paper Sales\n\nWe sell our paper products in Brazil and abroad. The markets we seek to serve are large and very competitive. Although price is very important in these markets, we believe that customers that have high-quality standards prefer our products due to the value and quality our paper imparts to their final products. This preference is shared among customers of all segments, from producers of notebooks and non-promotional materials, to more sophisticated customers, such as producers of promotional materials, high-quality packaging and art books.",

We have a diversified customer base for our paper products. We believe we have a good knowledge base to manage our credit risk portfolio through financial (letters of credit and insurance) and non-financial (guarantees) instruments. Additionally, we believe that our strategy to diversify our portfolio of paper clients improves our credit risk performance due to lower correlation between large, medium, small and micro sized clients.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nForest products, such as pulp and paper products, are typically cyclical. Changes in inventories are usually important in price determination. Furthermore, paper  demand  depends  largely  on  general  economic  conditions,  since  production  capacity  slowly  adjusts  to  changes  in  demand.  Therefore,  we  can  expect seasonal changes in paper net revenues in Brazil depending on such factors. Changes in production capacity may also affect prices.\n\nSimilarly, the pulp industry seasonality pattern has been historically correlated with paper production. World paper production normally increases by the end of the summer vacations in the northern hemisphere, as well as during the Christmas and New Year holidays. In Brazil, specifically, paper demand increases in the second half of the year, mainly due to the production of notebooks and books for the beginning of a new school year, which begins in February, and, in some years, governmental programs such as the National Didactic Book Program ( Programa Nacional do Livro Did\u00e1tico ) purchases.\n\nCompared to the pulp market, paper market has a larger number of producers and consumers and greater product differentiation. Although the price of paper is cyclical and historically tied to the price of pulp, with a slight time difference, it is generally considered less volatile than the pulp price. The main factors affecting the price of paper are economic activity, ability to expand production and fluctuation in exchange rates.\n\nDue to specific  factors,  including  pulp  and  paper  machine  closures,  start-up  of  new  capacities,  changes  in  the  cost  structure  of  the  industry  and  the increase  of  global  pulp  demand,  the  seasonality  trends  observed  in  the  past  for  the  pulp  industry  may  be  subject  to  changes  in  the  future.  Nevertheless, seasonality has not caused significant impacts on us over the last three years. For this reason, we do not measure the impacts of seasonality in our results.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nThe main raw materials used in pulp and paper production are described below.\n\n## Wood\n\nWe use fibers from three primary sources for the production of our paper: (i) our pulp; (ii) recycled paper; and (iii) mechanical pulp. Recycled paper and mechanical pulp are used in the interior layers of certain types of paperboard. We use eucalyptus trees for the production of all of our pulp.\n\nThe management of our planted forests is a key resource for wood. For further information, see 'Item 4.-Business Overview-Our Company-Pulp and Paper-Planting and Harvesting Forests.'\n\n## Energy\n\nOur energy matrix is predominantly renewable, with biomass (classified as an energy resource in the forest energy biomass categories) serving as the primary source. The majority of our energy generation is derived from black liquor, a by-product of the pulp manufacturing process, produced through the kraft chemical recovery process utilized in our mills. This black liquor is burned in chemical recovery boilers, contributing significantly to our steam generation.\n\nAs secondary energy sources, we utilize bark, wood chips, and wood waste in our processes. These materials are used as complementary fuels to meet the energy requirements of our operations and are burned in auxiliary boilers. Consequently, our chemical recovery process enables us to generate energy in an environmentally friendly manner.\n\nA substantial portion of our energy consumption is supplied by our own electricity generation. Several of our industrial plants are self-producers of energy, consuming the energy generated on-site and exporting surplus energy to the Brazilian national grid. The plants that produce 100% of the energy they consume include Mucuri (BA), Imperatriz (MA), Tr\u00eas Lagoas (MS), and Veracel (BA).\n\nSurplus  energy  from  self-producing  plants  is  allocated  to  other  locations  with  energy  deficits  through  contracts  accounted  for  at  the  CCEE  (Brazilian Energy Compensation Chamber).\n\nWe have undergone the certification process to issue the I-REC (International REC Standard) based on the renewable energy generated by the Tr\u00eas Lagoas (MS) industrial unit. This certificate represents the renewable generation attributes of one megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy produced from biomass and can be sold by the generator on the electricity market. In 2023, we commercialized a total of 380,490 I-RECs.\n\nWe also  invest  in  energy  efficiency  and  research  and  innovation,  aiming  to  increase  renewable  energy  generation  by  optimizing  the  use  of  our  own resources. Over the years, we have reduced our consumption of fossil fuels.\n\nIn terms of energy efficiency, the chemical recovery process plays a crucial role in pulp and paper production. This process is consistently emphasized in our actions, and we have developed several projects focused on energy efficiency at our industrial plants. We have set a long-term goal to increase our renewable energy exports to the national grid by 50% by 2030 (baseline 2018). In 2023, we exported approximately 1,329 GWh of energy.\n\nIn 2023, our energy matrix consisted of 88% renewable sources. Non-renewable sources represented 12%, with natural gas being the most significant source, primarily used in the lime kiln process, as well as diesel oil used in forestry, logistics, and transportation.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Chemicals\n\nA variety of chemicals, including sodium sulphate, sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), sodium chlorate, chloride, hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, are utilized in  the  paper  production  process,  mainly  in  the  pulp  production  phase.  In  the  production  of  coated  paper,  we  use  various  additives,  primarily  kaolin,  calcium carbonate, latex, starch, bleaches and binders. The chemicals used in the pulp production process are recovered and recycled within our pulp mills.\n\nAll chemical waste is treated in order to conform to the most current standards and practices of the pulp and paper industry worldwide. The chemicals used in the pulp and paper industry are commonly used in a variety of other industrial activities and do not present a uniquely hazardous threat. Notwithstanding this fact, we strictly adhere to all safety rules and regulations related to the transport, storage and production of chemical products. In addition, we maintain an insurance policy to cover liability in the event of an accident in the transportation, storage or production of chemical products.\n\n## Transportation\n\nThe cost of transportation of pulp and paper products to the consumer market is an important component of our competitiveness. In the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, logistics costs accounted for 19.5%, 21.5% and 23.0% of our cost of goods sold and selling expenses, respectively.\n\nOur scale of production, the proximity of planted forests to our pulp mills and planted forests in relation to our factories and the integration of the processes of pulp and paper production gives us substantial economies of scale and lower production costs. Suzano, Rio Verde and Limeira units, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, are strategically located near our major customers for paper products and approximately 150 kilometers from the port of Santos. The Mucuri unit, which primarily services the external market, is strategically located approximately 250 kilometers from Portocel, a port that specializes in the exportation of paper and pulp, and approximately 320 kilometers from the port of Vit\u00f3ria. The Imperatriz unit, in Maranh\u00e3o, which also primarily services the external market, is located approximately 600 kilometers from the port of Itaqui. The proximity of our forests, factories, Brazilian clients and ports allows us to enjoy relatively low transportation costs, which, in turn, provides a competitive cost structure for exports.\n\nIn addition, the Brazilian market may take advantage of Jacare\u00ed mill's proximity to S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, while the Aracruz mill has the one of the best logistics in the industry, approximately three kilometers to the Portocel port facility. The Tr\u00eas Lagoas mill is located between two important railways in the southeast of Brazil, ensuring the cost competitiveness of this mill, although distance from the port is over 700 km.\n\n## Port Operations\n\nThe  pulp  produced  for  export  is  shipped  on  dedicated  vessels  or  partial-service  vessels  by  carriers  hired  through  long-term  or  spot  contracts  to  our terminals overseas and is then delivered to our customers. We conduct operations in the port of Itaqui, (state of Maranh\u00e3o), port of Santos (state of S\u00e3o Paulo) and port of Barra do Riacho (namely Portocel - state of Esp\u00edrito Santo).\n\n## Port of Itaqui\n\nThe port of Itaqui is located on the coast of the state of Maranh\u00e3o. From this port, we exported in 2023 pulp produced at the Imperatriz mill, which is located approximately 600km away from the port of Itaqui. Since 2014, we have been operating warehouse within the port area to guarantee the continuity of its operations with Empresa Maranhense de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Portu\u00e1ria (EMAP), a public company held by the state government of Maranh\u00e3o.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn  July  27,  2018,  we  participated  in  a  public  auction  conducted  by ANTAQ  for  the  concession  of  public  areas  and  infrastructure  for  general  cargo, especially pulp and paper in the port of Itaqui, for an initial period of 25 years. We were awarded the contract due to our proposal for Itaqui General Cargo Terminal (IQI 18), in the amount of R$0.1 million. In 2020, we hired the companies responsible for building a warehouse of 73,000 tons, and a berth, to support long-term planning  of  the  Imperatriz  mill.  In  2021,  we  concluded  the  construction  of  the  berth  in  the  port  of  Itaqui,  which  will  be  managed  by  EMAP  and  we  will  have preferential berthing rights. The berth was first tested in February 5, 2022, and the warehouse's operations started on September 2, 2022.\n\n## Port of Santos\n\nThe port of Santos is located on the coast of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. From this port, we export pulp produced at the Jacare\u00ed and Tr\u00eas Lagoas, which are located approximately 150, and 750 kilometers away from the port of Santos, respectively. Through a concession, we operate terminal 32 (T32) of the port of Santos and at Vertere (DP World Santos). An expansion process was started in 2023 in both ports to attend the demand for a new mill in Ribas do Rio Pardo (Cerrado Project), completed in the first quarter of 2024. At Terminal 32, we have expanded our infrastructure by adding two additional railway lines, bringing the total to four, and have installed a new portico. At the DP World facility, we have enhanced operational capabilities by incorporating two overhead cranes into the new warehouse.\n\nPaper produced by us for export is mainly shipped out of the port of Santos, which is located approximately 80 kilometers from the Suzano unit and about 250 km from the Limeira unit, where most of the paper production designated to export markets comes from. We also operate with containers at the port of Santos, mainly used in the paper and fluff business.\n\n## Portocel\n\nThe pulp produced for export at the Aracruz, Mucuri and Veracel pulp mills is shipped out of the port of Barra do Riacho (Portocel), which is located approximately three kilometers, away from Aracruz, approximately 250 kilometers away from Mucuri and 260 nautical miles, from Veracel's barge terminal. We own 51% of Portocel, the company that operates the port terminal of Aracruz. The remaining 49% of Portocel is owned by Cenibra, another pulp manufacturer.\n\nThe Portocel is a modern facility that has the capacity to handle approximately 7.5 million metric tons of pulp and wood per year, from their owners and other  players,  and  different  types  of  material  like  aluminum,  steel  coils,  granite  and  project  cargo.  Warehouse  facilities  at  Portocel  are  capable  of  storing approximately 220,000 metric tons of pulp (static storage).\n\n## Marketing and Distribution\n\nWe have our own sales teams for our pulp and paper business units, which sell our products in both the Brazilian and international markets, to final consumer or distribution intermediaries. We sell our products in both the Brazilian and export markets. In the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 77.7%, 82.9% and 83.6%, respectively, of our net sales from market pulp and paper products was attributable to sales made outside of Brazil. Domestically in Brazil, we have a sales staff consisting of employees operating in various regions of Brazil.\n\n## Pulp\n\nOur pulp business unit's commercial strategy is based on three pillars: strong relationships, long-term partnerships and differentiated services. To ensure proximity with our national and international customers and to ensure that our products are tailored to their needs, we use a Brazilian sales team, which services Latin America, and local sales teams in the United States, Austria, China and Singapore. In Brazil and in each of our international offices, we have technical assistance departments that focus on our customers' needs, with the purpose of providing our customers with smart technical solutions for their transition from other  types  of  fiber  to  eucalyptus  fiber.  We  organize  annual  technical  workshops,  in  Brazil  and  in  each  of  the  countries  where  we  operate,  to  share  with  our customers and international offices our innovative initiatives, technical developments and market strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Paper\n\nIn  2023, 74.0% of our paper net sales were made to the Brazilian market. In order to better serve this market, we have divided it into six categories, designing different commercial and marketing strategies for each segment:\n\n- \u00b7 Packaging: this is the main end use of our paperboard sales and involves production of packaging for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, toys, clothing, shoes, food, beverage, hygiene, and cleaning industries;\n- \u00b7 Advertising and Catalogs: this segment mainly involves coated paper sales and production of promotional flyers, catalogues, displays and signs;\n- \u00b7 Books: this segment accounts for the production of books, magazines and newspapers and involves the sale of all of the paper types that we produce (coated, uncoated and paperboard);\n- \u00b7 Notebooks: this  segment  involves  the  production  of  notebooks  and  diaries  in  both  the  local  and  export  markets,  and  uses  uncoated  paper  and paperboard;\n- \u00b7 Mailing: this segment mainly involves the production of forms and invoices, which use uncoated paper;\n- \u00b7 Copy Paper: this segment encompass office end uses and retail channel, which involves the commercialization of uncoated paper in cut-size format (e.g., letter and A4 sizes) in stationery stores and self-service businesses.\n\nTo serve the first five categories listed above, we use various distribution channels: we directly sell large paper volumes to publishers and converters, and sell small paper volumes both indirectly through publishing distributors and directly through our sales team spread across Brazil. In the copy paper segment, we sell indirectly through paper distributors and directly through our call center, e-commerce, or commercial team for customers with large volumes.\n\nWe own distributors for our paper and graphic products, one in Brazil, one in Argentina, Stenfar S.A.I.C. Importadora y Exportadora and (Stenfar), and one in Ecuador, Suzano Ecuador. For Brazilian distribution, we rely on four regional distribution centers: one in S\u00e3o Paulo, one in Serra (Esp\u00edrito Santo) and one in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais (Paran\u00e1), as well as our local distribution centers, in the cities of Campinas and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto (state of S\u00e3o Paulo), Bel\u00e9m (state of Par\u00e1), Bras\u00edlia (federal district), Campo Grande (state of Mato Grosso do Sul), Cuiab\u00e1 (State of Mato Grosso), Londrina (state of Paran\u00e1), Fortaleza (State of Cear\u00e1), Goi\u00e2nia (State of Goi\u00e1s), Manaus (State of Amazonas), Porto Alegre (State of Rio Grande do Sul), Recife (state of Pernambuco), Rio de Janeiro (state of Rio de Janeiro), Salvador (state of Bahia), Uberl\u00e2ndia (state of Minas Gerais), Belo Horizonte (state of Minas Gerais), and a newly inaugurated local distribution center in Chapec\u00f3 (State of Santa Catarina).\n\nOther than distributing our own line of paperboard and printing and writing paper, we also distribute other product lines to reach the graphics, editorial and consumer segments and to public agencies. In Argentina, Stenfar is a company-owned distributor of paper and computer supplies operating in Argentina, through which we conduct such distribution operations. Stenfar has been operating for more than 58 years and has an important and active presence in the market, located in Buenos Aires. Stenfar services the graphics, editorial and consumer segments and public agencies, working with printing and writing paper, paperboard and computer supplies.\n\nIn  Ecuador, Suzano Ecuador is a wholly-owned subsidiary that operates as a paper distributor. Through Suzano Ecuador, we conduct our distribution operations in the country. Suzano Ecuador commenced its operations in 2023, and since then, we have been expanding our presence in the market.\n\nIn  addition  to  providing  a  more  comprehensive  portfolio  of  services  and  products  to  our  customers,  our  distribution  operations  in  Brazil,  Stenfar's distribution operations in Argentina, and the establishment of Suzano Ecuador reflect our commitment to improving our distribution channels. By expanding our network, we aim to benefit our clients directly by increasing proximity and agility in meeting their needs.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nAlongside our own lines of paperboard and writing and printing paper, we also distribute other complementary product lines not produced by us, catering to the graphics, publishing, consumer, converter, and government entities segments.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe pulp industry is highly competitive. The top 20 producers currently supply approximately 76.0% of the global virgin market pulp capacity according to Hawkins Wright. We face substantial competition from numerous producers of paper and hardwood market pulp, including major Brazilian producers, such as Bracell, Eldorado, CMPC and Celulose Nipo Brasileira S.A. (Cenibra). Many factors influence competitive position, including mill efficiency and operating rates and the  availability,  quality  and  cost  of  wood,  energy,  water,  chemicals,  logistics  and  labor,  and  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  Latin American  pulp  producers  have structural cost advantages over other global competitors, mainly in North America and Europe, due to their shorter harvest periods and higher land productivity, which is only partially offset by geographical distance from the end markets. Many of our Latin America competitors enjoy cost advantages similar to ours, including low production costs, and have access to similar sources of funding to finance their expansion projects.\n\nThe international pulp and paper markets are highly competitive and involve a large number of producers worldwide. As a vertically integrated pulp and paper producer, we compete not only with other vertically integrated pulp and paper producers, but also with companies that produce only pulp or paper. Many of these producers have greater financial resources than we do and enjoy lower financing costs. However, as the largest producer of eucalyptus pulp and virgin market pulp in the world in 2023, according to Hawkins Wright, we maintain our competitive advantage by keeping production costs low, maintaining long-term contracts with our customers and vertically integrating our operations.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\n## General\n\nWe are committed to produce pulp and paper with efficiency and with the lowest impact on natural resources and the environment. Our continuing goal is to avoid and mitigate adverse impacts on the environment by controlling our emissions into the air and water, preserving biodiversity and by fully complying with Brazilian environmental regulations and recognized international environmental standards.\n\nOur industrial units are ISO 14001 certified, which attests to our environmental management system. The Mucuri unit was the first in the pulp and paper sector globally to obtain this certification in 1996. We also have received other certifications, including ISO 9001 and ISO 45001.\n\nOur forests units are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae)  and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) , including controlled sources. Both FSC and PEFC seals attests our responsible forest management, wich is environmentally correct and social just.These seals were created by different  multisector  international  organizations,  has  strong  international  recognition  and  it  is  also  labeled  in  several  of  our  products  and  our clients' products. 1 2\n\nAiming for positive environmental impacts, we promote the conservation of biodiversity and eco-efficiency of our operations, optimizing the use of our resources and applying the best environmental management practices, on an ongoing basis, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Conserving ecosystems and their biodiversity;\n- \u00b7 Using renewable and non-renewable natural resources in a rational manner;\n\n1 FSC-C010014",

We  also  maintain  a  strong  partnership  with recognized forums and organizations to discuss and share knowledge on sustainability issues. Some examples are the UN Global Compact, Climate, Forest and Agriculture Brazilian Coalition, the Alliance for the restoration of the Amazon, One Trillion Trees (1t.org); the World Wildlife Fund / New Generation Plantation, The Brazilian Forest Dialogue, Brazilian Tree Industry (IB\u00c1), the Brazilian Corporate Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS), GHG Protocol Brazil, Capitals Coalition, Nature Action 100 and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\nWe also  have  a  strong  commitment  to  community  service  and  participate  in  and  fund  a  variety  of  projects,  including  projects  supported  by Instituto Ecofuturo , a non-governmental organization that we have created and sponsor, whose purpose is to generate and share knowledge and practices that contribute to creating a culture of sustainability.\n\nIn sustainable finance, we have issued sustainability-linked debt at competitive costs. We currently maintain three Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs) with the following targets:\n\n- \u00b7 SLB 2031: Reduce the intensity of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, with a coupon increase of 0.25% if we do not meet the target;\n- \u00b7 SLBs 2032: Reduce water withdrawal in industrial operations per ton of product, with a coupon increase of 0.125% if we fail to achieve this goal.

For 2024 and beyond, as part of our business plan strategy, we will continue to explore opportunities to expand the share of credit lines and debt instruments linked to sustainability commitments within our overall financing framework.\n\n## Water\n\nAfter the disclosure of our Commitments to Renewing Life, a set of 15 Long-Term Goals, in February 2020, we deployed the goal of reducing specific water withdrawal by 15% by 2030, linked to SDG 6 - clean water and sanitation, and governance has been integrated into our management routine.\n\nConsidering the  expected  curve  until  2030,  we  defined  each  mill's  internal  annual  and  monthly  targets.  The  results  of  each  mill's  internal  targets  are monitored monthly in a meeting with the Executive Officer of Pulp Operations, together with representatives of all mills, integrating them with the governance of safety, production, quality and cost indicators.\n\nIn  2022,  we  mapped out best practices with respect to water use in our units and other market participants. As a result, we improved our water use management and governance practices. These actions contributed to maintain the reduction of specific water withdrawal. To reinforce the topic's governance priority, we defined targets linked to variable remuneration to the Chief Operating Officer, Industrial Officers and lower positions.\n\nIn line with our governance model, industrial directors and managers review the performance indicators of each mill on a weekly basis. Any deviations are addressed using the management tools incorporated in our Operational Excellence model. The results are shared with all our employees during the monthly results  meetings  at  each  mill,  fostering  engagement  on  the  topic. Additionally,  at  the  units,  we  have  set  internal  targets  for  each  industrial  sector,  and  their performance is monitored in routine Production Meetings.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved 69% of the target set for 2030. Our performance is on track with our long-term goal to reduce specific water withdrawal by 15% by 2030. To achieve this, we have implemented actions across all mills to optimize water use, including replacing equipment to enhance water efficiency and using recovered water in machines.\n\nIn 2023, we had seven scheduled maintenance downtimes at the Tr\u00eas Lagoas, Limeira, Mucuri, Imperatriz, Aracruz, Suzano, Rio Verde, and Jacare\u00ed units. Scheduled maintenance downtimes typically lead to an increase in the specific water withdrawal indicator, as water usage continues even when production is halted. Consequently, the units optimized water consumption during shutdowns by applying process controls, such as preventing overflow in the cooling tower. Additionally, projects were implemented to optimize water consumption, directly contributing to improvements in the indicator.\n\n## Solid Waste and Wastewater\n\nWaste management is present in our processes and operations, both industrial and forestry. The treatment of effluents in all industrial units is carried out in our own Effluent Treatment Plants and includes primary (physical) and secondary (biological) treatment, a stage in which oxygen and nutrients are added and the pH is controlled. At Limeira, Jacare\u00ed, Tr\u00eas Lagoas and Maranh\u00e3o Mills, the activated sludge technology is used for secondary treatment, while aerated lagoons are used at the Suzano and Aracruz Mills. The Mucuri Mill uses both technologies. The biological sludge generated at the effluent treatment plants has been treated in different eco-efficient ways, such as composting plants at the Limeira Mill, drying and burning at the Jacare\u00ed, Imperatriz and Tr\u00eas Lagoas Mills.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn  addition  to  complying  with  the  applicable  rules  on  solid  waste,  our  mills  have  a  waste  management  plan  and  operational  procedures.  Waste management includes daily monitoring and forums focused on reducing solid waste generation, increased recycling and internal reuse and reduction of shipment to landfills. The mills also receive internal and external audits.\n\nIn 2020, we announced an ambitious goal to reduce the industrial waste sent to landfills by 70% by 2030. In 2023, our units in Limeira, Jacare\u00ed, and Rio Verde continued to maintain their performance of not sending waste to landfills.\n\nOne of the major highlights of the year was the consolidation of the composting project at the Mucuri/BA unit, which reduced the unit's indicator by almost 20%. Each month, 10,000 tons of organic waste is generated at the unit, which is no longer sent to landfills and is now composted in partnership with a composting company, becoming fertilizers. We also saw significant improvement at the Imperatriz unit. During rainy periods, it had not been possible to reuse the primary and secondary sludge as biomass due to the high moisture concentration. As a solution, a drying hothouse was installed, allowing this material to be burned in the boilers for power generation during the rainy months.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nWe are engaged in carrying out and developing responsible forestry operations. We are committed to a zero deforestation policy and adoption of best forest management practices, as defined by FSC. Therefore, our eucalyptus plantations are established exclusively in areas previously anthropized by other uses, such as cattle grazing, and co-exist interleaved with areas destined for biodiversity conservation - the mosaic landscapes approach, favoring the connection of native fragments and the establishment of ecological corridor. Our forest management practices follow all the legislation, standards and commitments undertaken. Also,  being  certified  by  international  widely  recognized  standards,  the  Forest  Stewardship  Council  (FSC)  and  the  Programme  for  the  Endorsement  of  Forest Certification (PEFC), both auditable certification schemes.\n\nWe maintain and protect more than 1 million hectares of native vegetation, which corresponds approximately to 40% of our total area. In this natural preserved  territory,  since  the  nineties,  we  conduce  periodic  biodiversity  monitoring,  species  of  fauna  and  flora.  To  increase  the  protection  and  monitoring  of biodiversity,  we  voluntarily  identified  areas  considered  global  or  nationally  important  for  biodiversity  conservation,  defined  as  High  Conservation  Value Areas (HCVA) and Private Natural Heritage Reserves (IUCN Category IV).\n\nAdditionally, aware of the different levels of fragmentation that the biomes in which we operate faces - which is one of the main threats to the biodiversity loss in Brazil and in the world -, through a collaborative process, in 2021 we launched a long-term commitment to conserve the biodiversity. The scope of the target considered our representativeness extent and territorial influence, focusing on the priority areas for the biodiversity conservation in Brazil, going beyond our properties. We have committed to 'connect half a million hectares of priority areas for the conservation of biodiversity in the Cerrado (Brazilian Savannah), Atlantic Forest and Amazon' by 2030, measuring yearly the connected fragments (in hectares) and other benefits, such as the creation of a network of protected areas; the conservation of key species; business models creation that generate shared value and biodiverse production; biodiversity impact drivers' relief from anthropic pressures, among others.",

Together,  native  forests  and  eucalyptus  plantations  contribute  directly  to  removing  and  storing  CO2  from  the  atmosphere. Therefore, we are committed to doing more than neutralizing direct and indirect emissions from our value chain. Our purpose is to remove significant additional amounts of carbon from the atmosphere, thus mitigating the effects of the global climate crisis. Theses climate ambitions are among our sustainability long-term goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Removing 40 million tons of CO \u2082 equivalent from 2020 to 2025; and\n- \u00b7 Reducing the intensity of carbon emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by ton of product produced (tCO \u2082 eq/t) by 15% by 2030.\n\nOur  Board  of  Directors,  supported  by  the  Sustainability  Committee,  directly  oversees  the  opportunities  and  risks  associated  with  climate  change, monitoring our strategy.  Reflecting  the  growing  importance  of  this  issue  within  our  company,  a  portion  of  the  variable  compensation  for  consultants  up  to  the executive board is linked to sustainability and climate goals. In 2023, approximately 40 goals related to the climate theme were adopted by various areas such as Research and Development, Logistics, Engineering, Digital, Legal, Procurement, Corporate Relations, Climate Change, among others.\n\nClimate change and its potential effects are considered one of our priority risks at the corporate level. To this end, we have a structured system in place for assessment, treatment (i.e., response to risk), monitoring and reporting. Our assessment of the potential physical impacts of climate change, as well as those arising  from  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  is  conducted  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  will  continue  to  evolve. The  Risk  Management  area  monitors  the evolution and mitigation of priority risks through the definition of action plans and controls, with report to the Board at least once a year. Additionally, the risk management process also includes specific approaches at the operational level. One example is the modeling of climate change scenarios and monitoring of indicators for the technical research, development and innovation (R&D&I) team. These data are used to calibrate harvest and planting planning models and to review the assessment of co-related climate risks to define new specific action plans, when necessary.\n\nWe reuse biomass and wood residues from the production process to generate a significant portion of its energy requirements. Approximately 88% of the entire  operation  and  energetic  matrix  (that  involves  forest,  industry,  logistic,  etc.)  comes  from  renewable  fuels  (such  as  black  liquor  and  biomass),  and  the remaining 12% from non-renewable resources (such as natural gas and fuel oil). We are self-sufficient in the Mucuri, Imperatriz and Tr\u00eas Lagoas units in terms of energy needs and some mills are even selling surplus energy back to the grid. In 2023, 1,329,552MWh of renewable electric energy were supplied to the public grid from these units.\n\nOur systemic approach to addressing climate change underscores our belief in the importance of engaging and influencing various sectors toward a lowcarbon economy to build a prosperous and equitable future centered on regeneration and sustainability. To this end, we strengthen our dialogue and partnerships with governments, companies, NGOs, associations, and academia by actively participating in forums and working groups. As part of this effort, our executives were engaged in the COP28 agenda, held between November 30th and December 12th, 2023, in Dubai, participating in various discussions, dialogues, and meetings regarding relevant topics identified as priorities for our engagement, such as the carbon market, biodiversity, energy, and climate change solutions.\n\nSince 2021, we have been participating in the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), a movement that seeks to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting global transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2023, we submitted our greenhouse gas emissions reduction and CO2 removal targets for  validation,  aligned  with  the  methodologies  and  guidelines  established  by  the  SBTi,  with  approval  expected  in  2024.  This  commitment  to  the  initiative's guidelines reflects our efforts to align our sustainability goals with internationally recognized standards. We also take part in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, led by investors to ensure that the largest corporate emitters of greenhouse gases take the necessary measures on climate change.",

On March 30, 2023, Verra, our certifier, completed the validation and verification of 1.9Mt CO2e for the Horizonte Project (VCS ID 3350). Of this amount, 10% will be allocated to Verra's reserve, and 1.7 million metric tons of CO2e are eligible for credit issuance.\n\nThe carbon credits are registered by Verra, an accredited company that holds a global platform, which is also responsible for the custody of the credits. This company has developed the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) program, currently regarded as the global reference standard, in the best understanding of the company.\n\n## Sustainability Strategy\n\nSustainability is an essential part of our strategy and governance practices. Our board of directors has formal responsibility for overseeing sustainability aspects.  The  new  composition  of  the  Committee  has  30%  gender  diversity  and  is  composed  of  board  members  and  independent  members,  with  diverse backgrounds and meets three times a year.\n\nIn our business, we make innovation and sustainability go hand in hand to transform renewable raw material from trees into innovative and sustainable bioproducts for billions of consumers in over 100 countries. We strive to be an agent of change and develop solutions to address the greatest challenges of our society. Combining our energy efficient operations, eucalyptus farms and conservation areas, we are a company contributing to tackling climate change, while improving the lives of the communities where we are present.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved the following results in ESG indices and ratings: MSCI rating \"BB\"; upgraded to Platinum medal in EcoVadis; composed again the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE B3); scored \"A-\" in CDP Climate Change and Water, and \"B\" in CDP Forest; rating for 'Low Risk' on Sustainalytics; and ranked 2  in Paper & Forest Products at DJSI. nd\n\nOur non-financial information is reported annually and audited by an independent third party. The Sustainability Report and Sustainability Center were published before the 2024 General Meeting, adhering to the main sustainability reporting frameworks, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards for disclosure. Further information is available at our Investor Relations website (www.suzano.com.br/ir). The information in our website, including our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 20-F.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to integrate sustainability into our business and decision-making strategy, the process for approving Capex projects for modernization has started to include the Internal Carbon Price. This instrument quantifies the potential of a project to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support  our  decarbonization  curve.  In  practice,  the  Internal  Carbon  Price  is  now  incorporated  into  the  Net  Present  Value  (NPV)  of  projects,  with  a  feasibility scenario. This mechanism will support our decision-making on investment projects.\n\n## Brazilian Environmental Regulation\n\nThe Brazilian federal constitution assigns to the Brazilian federal government, the states, the federal district and the municipalities the authority to enact laws and issue regulations regarding environmental protection and preservation of Brazilian fauna and flora, as well as the power to enforce such laws. States can only enact laws and issue regulations to supplement federal law, exerting full legislative power only in the absence of federal regulations. The municipalities have authority to enact laws and issue regulations only with respect to matters of local interest or to supplement federal and state laws.",

This  procedure  is  necessary  both  for  the  initial  installation  or expansion of any facility  that  meets  any  of  those  characteristics. The  environmental  licensing  process  generally  follows  three  consecutive  stages:  preliminary license, installation license and operating license.\n\nRegarding licensing procedures, municipalities have the jurisdiction to license facilities that only have a local environmental impact, pursuant to definitions issued by the State Environmental Council. The Brazilian federal government is responsible for the environmental licensing of projects and activities: (i) within the Brazilian inland borders; (ii) located in the Brazilian territorial sea, continental platform or exclusive economic zone (which term is defined under Brazilian law); (iii) located in indigenous lands; (iv) located in national parks or other federal conservation areas; (v) between two or more Brazilian states; (vi) of military nature; (vii) regarding radioactive material and/or nuclear power; (viii) of national interest, as defined in the Executive Order No. 8,437/ 2015. Finally, the states are responsible for the environmental licensing of all the other activities located within their borders.\n\nThe preparation of an environmental impact study and its corresponding environmental impact report, or EIA/RIMA, is required for purposes of licensing activities with significant environmental impact. In any such event, the company is required to pay a compensation fee for negative environmental impacts caused by the relevant project. This fee can amount to up to 0.5% of the total cost of the project. Since most of our main activities began before the enacting of the law that established the environmental compensation fee, we were not required to pay such compensation in those cases (projects performed before the year 2000). However, the activities started after the enactment of the National System of Conservation Units - SNUCs law are subject to the obligation to pay environmental compensation. Therefore, new projects may require additional investments to compensate for the environmental impact.\n\nOur licenses and permits for the operation of our plants require, among other things, that we periodically report our compliance with environmental laws, regulations and standards. With regard to our plans, we are currently either (i) in compliance with all operating and environmental licenses or (ii) in the process of renewing these licenses.\n\nOur forestry activities are regulated by the Brazilian federal government and the state governments of the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Piau\u00ed, Tocantins and Maranh\u00e3o. The planting and harvesting of trees can only be done in accordance with a project previously approved by the state agencies, except for the States of S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, where a forestry license is not required. Furthermore, in observance of the new Forestry Code (Federal Law n. 12.651/2012), we must keep at least 20% of our rural landholdings covered with native forests or replanted with native plant species as a Legal Reserve ( Reserva Legal ). Legal Reserves must be registered with a new registry system named the Rural Environmental Registration ( CAR - Cadastro Ambiental Rural ). In such system, the land owners shall provide information on all the environmentally protected areas to the supervisory agency. However, this restriction increases to 35% in the Cerrado biome and up to 80% in the Amazon forest biome. Also, according to federal law, native vegetation from areas along rivers and other water bodies as well as steep slopes and hilltops are to be treated as Permanent Preservation Areas, which are essential to the conservation of water resources, scenery, animal, human and plant health, biodiversity and soil in the area. Our forestry operations are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. See 'Item 4. B - Environmental Matters.'",

In Brazil, individuals or legal entities that violate environmental laws can be punished by criminal sanctions that range from fines, imprisonment and confinement, in the case of individuals, to fines, restriction orders or dissolution, in the case of legal entities. In addition, administrative sanctions that can be imposed include, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 fines that may reach up to R$10 million if operating without a license and R$50 million in the case of severe environmental damages;\n- \u00b7 partial or total suspension of activities;\n- \u00b7 forfeiture or restriction of tax incentives or benefits; and\n- \u00b7 forfeiture or suspension of participation in credit lines with official credit establishments.\n\nIn  addition  to  criminal  and  administrative  sanctions,  pursuant  to  Brazilian  environmental  laws,  the  violator  must  also  provide  compensation  and reimbursement for the damage that was caused to the environment and third parties. At the civil level, there is joint and strict liability for environmental damages. This means that the obligation to compensate for the damage caused to the environment may affect each and every individual or legal entity directly or indirectly involved,  regardless  of  the  existence  of  actual  fault  by  the  agents  involved.  Therefore,  the  engagement  of  third  parties  to  carry  out  any  intervention  in  our operations, such as the final disposal of waste, does not exempt the contracting party from eventual damages to the environment caused by the contractor. In addition, environmental laws provide for the possibility of piercing the corporate veil, in relation to the controlling shareholder, whenever such corporate veil is an obstacle for the reimbursement of damages caused to the environment.\n\nUsing advanced technology, our operations comply with all applicable Brazilian laws and regulations, and we believe that we also meet all recognized international  standards  determined  by  institutions  and  agreements  to  which  we  or  Brazil  are  signatories.  In  the  past  five  years,  we  have  not  received  any administrative  penalties  or  warnings  that  might  be  considered  relevant  or  material  fines  that  might  be  considered  relevant  in  respect  of  violations  of  Brazil's environmental laws or policies.\n\n## Insurance\n\nWe believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage for our facilities related to our operational, commercial and business risks. Consistent with industry norms and practice in Brazil, we do not maintain insurance coverage for fire and other risks to our planted forests. Nonetheless, we adopt a series of measures, such as maintenance of a firefighting brigade and keeping the lanes between our production units of eucalyptus trees unobstructed, which historically has significantly prevented the spread of fires. We use the amounts we would otherwise pay as premiums for fire insurance to implement preventive and safety measures, such as installing  fire  towers  and  fire  control  equipment  and  training  firefighting  personnel.  It  is  our  policy  to  maintain  insurance  coverage  for  our inventory of wood.",

That is due, in part, to the low cost of cultivating and processing eucalyptus trees compared to other species. As shown in the illustration below, the short growth cycle of our eucalyptus trees - seven years presents a significant competitive advantage in relation to the costs associated with other fibers.

Saplings grown from selected seeds and clones are initially cultivated inside climate-controlled greenhouses. These saplings are then transferred to outdoor nurseries, where they are allowed to grow and after which they are moved to be planted.\n\nWe conduct research specific to each of our growing regions, utilizing general concepts of plant physiology and genetics. In the future, our productivity may increase through cloned hybrid cuttings or selected seeds. The research program also continues to seek ways to improve the uniformity of wood quality and maintain ecological balance by studying the soil, plant nutrition and pest control.\n\n## Harvesting\n\nEucalyptus trees are harvested by our employees and by independent contractors through an automated system and, in some cases, manually. Logs are generally transported to our pulp mills as needed and we store small amounts of logs at all of our production facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\n\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, as well as with the information presented under 'Presentation of Financial and Other Information' and 'Item 3. Key Information - A. Financial Data.'\n\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from those discussed in the forward-looking statements for several reasons, including, without limitation, the risks described in 'Forward-Looking Statements' and 'Item 3. Key Information - D. Risk Factors.'\n\n## Overview\n\nWith  almost  100  years  of  experience,  we  operate  mainly  in  the  pulp  (paper  grade  and  fluff)  and  paper  (paperboard,  printing  and  writing  and  tissue) segments. We believe that we are one of the largest vertically integrated producers of pulp and paper in Latin America and, according to Hawkins Wright, we were the largest producer of eucalyptus pulp and virgin market pulp in the world in 2022. In common with other Brazilian eucalyptus pulp producers, we have the lowest cost of pulp production in the world. We believe our modern technology of plantation and harvesting and our strategic location for plantation facilities are among our competitive strengths.\n\nWe believe we are one of Brazil's largest paper producers, and based on data from IB\u00c1, we accounted for nearly 43% of the printing and writing paper and 27% of the paperboard produced in Brazil in 2022.\n\n## Foreign Currency Impact in Our Operations\n\nAs a predominantly exporting company, our results are exposed to exchange variations. As such, fluctuations in the exchange rate, especially with regards to the U.S. dollars, may impact our operating results. We issue debt securities in the international markets as an important part of the capital structure that is also exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate. The mitigation of these risks comes from our own exports, which creates a natural hedge. Furthermore, we employ U.S. dollar sales, in futures markets, including strategies with options, as a way to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of our income. The sales in future markets are limited to a percent of the currency over the 24-month horizon and, as such, are dependent on the availability of exchange ready for sale in the short-term.\n\n## Pulp Segment\n\nThe hardwood pulp market experienced different dynamics in each quarter of 2023. The first quarter continued to see the high prices that began in 2022, while the second quarter was marked by a cyclical downturn in demand and a challenging period for prices. Several factors contributed to the decline in prices, including the normalization of the logistics scenario, an increase in inventories along the supply chain, and the subsequent movement to destock finished products, as well as the start-up of two new short-fiber market pulp plants. Additionally, pulp prices fell below producers' marginal cash costs, leading to several unscheduled shutdowns. The  recovery  in  prices,  more  pronounced  in  the  fourth  quarter,  was  driven  by  improved  market  fundamentals  throughout  the  year,  such  as  high demand  for  pulp  in  the  Chinese  market,  positive  signs  of  improvement  in  Europe  and  North  America,  and  a  reduction  in  supply  due  to  both  market  and unscheduled stoppages.\n\nIn China, several factors influenced pulp demand in 2023: (1) the fall in pulp prices below the marginal cost of integrated producers, encouraging them to purchase market pulp; (2) higher prices for wood chips from Southeast Asia, particularly in the first half of the year, which favored the consumption of imported fiber; (3) high production rates for sanitary paper, cardboard, and printing and writing paper; (4) continued high paper export rates; (5) a process of pulp restocking by paper producers; and (6) a reduction in stocks of finished products, especially printing and writing paper and cardboard, at the end of the year.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn the European market, the destocking process lasted for more than half the year and naturally impacted pulp demand during that period. Despite the slowdown in demand and challenging macroeconomic forces, the European market began to see an uptick in paper production rates and pulp demand in the last two quarters of the year. Additionally, a high differential between long and short fiber prices, as well as closures of long fiber capacity in the region, favored short fiber demand. In both the European and North American markets, the resilience and stability of sanitary papers during this period were notable.\n\nOn the supply side, 2023 saw the entry of three significant projects in Chile, Uruguay, and Finland. However, unscheduled stoppages, mostly market related, and the announcement of definitive closures at less competitive mills helped to mitigate the impact of these new capacity entries on the market.\n\nPulp net sales totaled R$30,677.3 million in 2023 (a decrease of 25.9% compared to 2022). The share of pulp sales from exports was 93.0%, while the domestic market accounted for 7.0%. With regard to distribution for end use, the sanitary paper segment accounted for 63.6% of total sales in 2023, followed by Specialty Papers with 15.4%, Printing & Writing with 12.3%, packaging with 6.0% and other with 2.8%. APAC accounted for 44.3% of the net sales, followed by EMEA with 28.4%, North and South American countries (including Brazil) with 28.4%.\n\nOur average pulp net price in USD sold by Suzano in 2023 was US$601.2/t, 20.5% lower than in 2022. In the export market, our average net price was US$600.3/t, down 21.1% from 2022.\n\n## Paper Segment\n\nAccording to IB\u00c1, domestic sales of printing and writing paper and paperboard decreased by 9.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, while imports increased by 9.4%.\n\nOur domestic sales decreased by 2.9% compared to 2022, as we faced increased levels of inventory throughout the supply chain, which hampered sales of coated paper and paperboard. Additionally, changes in consumption behavior prompted by digitization and a strong comparison period in 2022 also contributed to the decrease. On the tissue side, we experienced an upside as a result of the acquisition of Kimberly Clark's tissue business in Brazil. Overall, paper sales decreased to 1.29 million tons in 2023, compared to 1.31 million tons in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, our net revenue from paper sales totaled R$9,078.3 million, a 7.5% increase from 2022. Net revenue from domestic sales increased 14.7%, while export's decreased 8.8%, with 74.0% coming from domestic sales and 26.0% from exports. The geographic breakdown of our total revenue from paper sales in 2023 was 90.0% in Latin America (including Brazil), 5.2% in North America and 4.9% in other regions.\n\nThe average net paper price in 2023 was R$7,030/ton, 8.7% higher than in 2022. In the domestic market, the average net paper price was R$7,275/ton, a 18.1% increase compared to 2022. In the international market, average price was US$1,284/ton, a 9% decrease compared to 2022. In Brazilian real, the average price in the international market was R$6,415/ton, 12.1% lower than in 2022.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe participate in a number of off-balance sheet arrangements, mainly related to guarantees and take or pay contracts. We also have a number of swap transactions as described in 'Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.' All of these transactions are further described elsewhere in this annual report. See notes 4 and 24 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.",

Our net sales from pulp represented 83.0% of total net sales in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared 77.2% in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nOur net sales  from  pulp  exports  decreased  26.3%,  or  R$10,185.5  million  in  2023,  from  R$38,718.6  million  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  to R$28,533.1 million  in  the  corresponding  period  in  2023,  mainly  due  to  20.5%  decrease  in  pulp  prices  in  U.S.  dollars  and  less  pulp  sales  volume  (-3%).  Net revenues from pulp exports represented 71.8% of total net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nOur  average  international  pulp  price  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023  decreased  21.1%,  or  US$160.8/ton,  from  US$761/ton  in  the  year  ended December  31,  2022  to  US$600/ton  in  the  corresponding  period  in  2023.  In  the  domestic  market,  our  average  net  pulp  sales  price  decreased  10.8%,  or US$74.5/ton, from US$687/ton in the year ended December 31, 2022 to US$613 ton in the corresponding period in 2023. For a discussion of the reasons of the drop in international sales price of pulp, see above 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Pulp Segment'\n\nOur  paper  net  sales  increased  7.5%,  or  R$631.7  million,  from  R$8,446.6  million  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022  to  R$9,078.3  million  in  the corresponding  period  in  2023.  Net  sales  from  paper  represented  17.0%  of  total  net  sales  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  compared  to  22.8%  in  the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in net sales from paper in the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the corresponding period in 2022 is mainly due to higher prices in the domestic market. Net revenues from paper exports represented 5.9% of total net revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023. Our net sales from paper in the domestic market increased 14.7%, or R$860.2 million, from R$5,858.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to R$6,719.1 million in the corresponding period in 2023, impacted by increases in sales price and drop in volume.\n\nOur average international realized paper price realized in 2023 decreased 9.1%, or US$127.9/ton, from US$1,412/ton in the year ended December 31, 2022 to US$1,284/ton in the corresponding period in 2023. In the domestic market, the average net paper sales price increased 18.1%, or R$1,116.5/ton, from R$6,159.0/ton in the year ended in December 31, 2022 to R$7,275.5/ton in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nOur total cost of sales increased 1.0%, or R$255.4 million, from R$24,821.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to R$25,076.7 million in the corresponding period in 2023. The cost of goods sold (COGS) was positively affected by lower sales volume and by lower costs of commodities (mainly Brent and soda),  but  these  were  offset  by  wood,  in  addition  to  higher  expenses  with  scheduled  shutdowns  (more  downtimes  and  inflation  in  the  period)  and  higher depreciation, amortization and depletion costs.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nOur gross profit decreased 41.3%, or R$10,330.8 million, from R$25,009.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to R$14,678.9 million in the corresponding period in 2023, due to the factors mentioned above. Our gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2022 was 50.2% compared to 36.9% in the corresponding period in 2023, mainly due to the decrease in pulp sales price, as described above.",

This increase is mainly due to the acquisition of Kimberly Clark's tissue business in Brazil.\n\nOur general and administrative expenses increased 12.5%, or R$213.5 million, from R$1,709.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to R$1,923.2 million in the corresponding period in 2023. The variation is due to an increase in personnel expenses.\n\n## Income from associates and joint ventures\n\nOur income from associates and joint ventures, decreased R$303.7 million, from income of R$284.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to loss of R$19.4 million in the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease is mainly due to (i) loss from associates and joint ventures in 2023 and (ii) gain from the realization of comprehensive income related to the foreign exchange variation of Suzano Trading Ltd.'s overseas investment, as a result of the merger of Suzano Trading Ltd. into Suzano S.A. on September 30, 2022 (impact of R$235.7 million).

The positive variation refers mainly to the greater adjustment resulting from the update of the fair value of biological assets, positive  variation  in  the  item  'Depreciation,  amortization  and  other  PPA  realizations',  partially  offset  especially  by  the  lower  results  in  the  sale  and  write-off  of assets.\n\n## Operating profit before net financial income (expenses)\n\nOur operating profit before net financial income (expense) decreased 45.0%, or R$10,006.5 million, from a profit of R$22,222.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to a profit of R$12,216.3 million in the corresponding period in 2023, due to the facts mentioned above. Our operating margin in the year ended December 31, 2022 was 44.6% compared to 30.7% in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\n## Net financial income (expenses)\n\nOur net financial income (expenses) decreased 10.1%, from a gain of R$6,432.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to a gain of R$5,780.9 million  in  the  corresponding  period  in  2023.  This  decrease  occurred  largely  due  to  the  decrease  of  R$1,234.9  million  in  derivative  results,  in  addition  to  the negative impact of the currency and monetary variation of R$206.9 million, despite the positive variation of R$789.8 million in net financial expenses.\n\n## Net income (loss) before taxes\n\nOur Net income (loss) before taxes decreased by 37.2%, going from R$28,655.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, to R$17,997.2 million in the corresponding period in 2023.

This  reduction  is  mainly  due  to  a  37%  decrease  in  profit  before  income  taxes,  partially  offset  by  the  increase  in  the  effective  income  tax  and  social contribution rate from 18% in the year ended December 31, 2022, to 22% in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\n## Net income (loss) for the year\n\nOur net income decreased 39.7% or R$9,288.5 million, from R$23,394.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to R$14,106.4 million during the corresponding period in 2023. This result was due to the factors mentioned above.\n\n## B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Sources and Uses of Funds\n\nOur cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities is affected by various factors. The key factors that affect our cash flow from operations are (i) the volume of product sold and the market price of pulp, (ii) the exchange rate between reais and U.S. dollars and (iii) the cost of our raw materials. Investing activities are mainly affected by (i) our capital expenditure program and (ii) our decision to divest some of our assets, such as fixed assets and biological assets. Finally, our cash flow from financing activities is directly related to the level of new debt we have incurred and on the repayment of existing debt.\n\nIn our opinion, we believe that our working capital is sufficient for our present requirements. Our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash flows from operating and financing activities and short-term and long-term borrowings.\n\nOur material cash requirements have historically included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 working capital;\n- \u00b7 debt service; and\n- \u00b7 capital expenditures.\n\nLong-term borrowings have generally been used to finance our major capital expenditure projects and have historically been sourced principally by either export prepayment contracts under which we, or one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, borrow funds by offering the guarantee of export contracts, issuance of Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (CRA), or capital expenditures acquisition financing programs offered by BNDES. The scheduled maturities of these longterm loans have been structured to match the expected cash flow from the conclusion of the related capital expenditure projects and, as a result, reduce the risk of any significant  deterioration  of  our  liquidity  position.  We  also  rely  on  bonds  or  notes  issued  in  the  international  markets  by  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  mainly domiciled in other countries.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents were R$8,345.9 million and R$9,506.0, respectively. Of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held as of December 31, 2023, 35% was denominated in reais invested in both public and private financial investments. The remaining 65% of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe  also  have  access  to  RCF  (Revolving  Credit  Facilities)  in  the  total  amount  of  US$1,275.0  million  that  is  available  until  February  2027,  as  of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments represented a positive net balance of R$1,994.4 million as of December 31, 2023.",

Our current assets as of December 31, 2023, were equivalent to 2.6 times our current liabilities.\n\nFor 2024, we have already announced to the market, as approved by our board of directors, the intention to invest R$7,677.4 million as maintenance capex (for further information please see 'Item 5.B - Capital Expenditures' below). This will primarily be financed by the cash and cash equivalents and cash generation for 2024.\n\nFor the year of 2024, we also believe that we will be able to access either capital or banking markets, if necessary.\n\nWith respect to long term capital needs, we use a model of ten years to monitor our needs in a series of scenarios and variables, including currency exchange rates and commodity prices, with the intention to preserve the liquidity and improve the capital structure. In this context, we work to anticipate exercises of liability management to improve liquidity or if conditions are favorable.\n\nAll of our future liquidity conditions rely on a series of scenarios and may be adversely affected depending on market and other conditions.

Research and development, patents and licenses, etc.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nOur Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) efforts are organized under a Chief Sustainability, Research and Innovation Officer. This initiative targets enhanced synergy between departments to ensure the sustainability of our forests and operations. It aims to foster business growth and transformation, intending to broaden our market beyond pulp and paper. Additionally, we are committed to strengthening our position as an innovative company dedicated to the SDGs.\n\nOur technology and innovation facilities are spread to meet the demands and particularities of all of our mills and forest units. The technology centers, where there are the main assets and laboratories, are located in:\n\n- \u00b7 Aracruz - state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil - where efforts are towards the main business (pulp and forest development);\n- \u00b7 Itapetininga - state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil - biotechnology activities with a focus on later stage development;\n- \u00b7 Jacare\u00ed - state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil - dedicated to work on activities related to our Eucalyptus Breeding Program;\n- \u00b7 Limeira - state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil - focused on biorefinery, consumer goods, fluff, packaging and paper developments;\n- \u00b7 Burnaby, Canada - dedicated to biorefinery research; and\n- \u00b7 Rehovoth, Israel - where concentrates developments of FuturaGene's early to mid-stage biotechnology R&D.\n\nEfforts  in  R&D&I  are  conducted  not  only  within  our  research  facilities,  but  also  in  partnership  with  various  universities,  suppliers  and  private  research institutes in Brazil and abroad.\n\nBy attempting to improve our processes to develop innovative and higher quality products in a sustainable way, our research and development activities are mainly directed at increasing forestry productivity, reducing the operational costs and optimizing industrial processes, making our production more efficient, advance in the value chain with products using our fiber and developing new products through (i) forest management with optimization of natural resources and costs; (ii) robust eucalyptus breeding program; (iii) improving the use of eucalyptus fiber in the manufacture of pulp, paper, packaging, paperboard and consumer goods (tissue, non-woven and diapers); (iv) developing new applications for eucalyptus fiber including nanomaterials; and (v) developing a eucalyptus bio refinery to obtain renewable base chemicals. Aiming to support all these innovation fronts, we invested R$220.0 million in 2023.\n\nIn regard the forest technology and innovation, our efforts are targeted to eucalyptus breeding, biotechnology, forest management, soil nutrition and forest protection. Our goal is to continue improving our planted forest productivity and quality in a sustainable manner. Based on this purpose, our research group is developing new eucalyptus clones based on growth, cellulose content and wood quality, by making use of state-of-the-art techniques like genetic recombination through controlled pollination, to explore all the germplasm's diversity genomic tools for the selection of new clones, extensive field evaluation and laboratory analysis.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn 2023, the breeding team was responsible to recommend new clones in combination with other genetic materials that were planted in different sites. With this allocation we expect to increase our yield in MAIcel (air dry ton of cellulose - adt/ha.year) above the actual recommendation. A key highlight is the project entitled  Clonal  Improvement  of  our  Eucalyptus,  which  has  advanced  the  recombination  of  breeding  populations  and  the  selection  of  new  parental  lines.  This resulted in the cultivation of high-potential seedlings for large-scale selection. Utilizing Tetrys, our innovative software for clonal allocation, we allocated over 300 million trees, which represents approximately 15% of the total area planted in 2023. Additionally, we are implementing a new concept to expand the scope of field trials  using  superior  genetic  materials.  This  aims  to  accelerate  the  operational-scale  recommendation  of  new  clones,  ensuring  genetic  and  phytosanitary perspective.\n\nWe conduct biotechnology research and development at our facilities in Israel and Brazil to maximize forest productivity, resilience, and sustainability. We utilize  state-of-the-art  technologies,  including  bioinformatics,  genomics,  gene  transformation,  and  gene  editing.  Our  FuturaGene  activities  focus  on  improving plantation productivity by enhancing and protecting yield while reducing inputs and the carbon footprint at both forest and industrial operations, thus optimizing natural resource use efficiency. We use bioinformatics and genomic tools, as well as gene transformation and gene editing technologies, to introduce genetic changes into plantation tree species. These changes provide solutions for pest and disease resistance, weed management, drought resistance, and heat tolerance to enhance the resilience of these species in the face of abiotic and biotic threats resulting from climate change.\n\nIn 2023, FuturaGene received commercial approval from CTNBio, the Brazilian biosafety regulatory body, for four new GM eucalyptus varieties. These include two new herbicide-tolerant GM eucalyptus, the first insect-resistant GM eucalyptus and the first-ever GM eucalyptus variety that combines two traits: yield enhancement and herbicide tolerance. After CTNBio approval, the GM eucalyptus varieties are integrated into our breeding program and undergo extensive testing across diverse environmental conditions. During this year, our focus was on expanded field trials with yield-enhanced and herbicide-tolerant GM eucalyptus.\n\nBesides efforts in the genetic field, we have sought innovations to ensure greater efficiency in forest management processes, aiming at greater productivity per planted area and cash cost reduction, while seeking to reduce the use of natural resources in this type of operations. The results in terms of \"innovability\" in forest management were obtained from the development of projects, which were focused on increasing productivity and forest resilience.\n\nForest Management has been continually investing resources to bring resilience to the forests of the future, aiming to characterize large-scale genotypes for pesticide sensitivity, disease and pest resistance, and tolerance to abiotic stresses, accelerating the breeding program and minimizing losses in early stage by identifying clones which shouldn't be recommended to proceed to the next phases. In 2023, algorithms related to climate prediction and erosion risk mapping were made available to the operational areas, as well as technologies focusing on soil and plant remote sensing. As a result, the operational area is now able to have a better planning of scenarios once unpredictable before, being able to select and also prioritize areas for planting, reducing time and cost of soil and plant analyses, as well as eliminate the generation of waste from this activity.\n\nTo  support  the  challenges  and  ambitions  of  our  Long-Term  Goals,  our  Pulp  R&D&I  team  dedicated  its  efforts  to  process  enhancements  and  the development of new products, alongside the evolution and consolidation of new services. In pursuit of advancing our 'Fiber to Fiber' strategy, we expanded our project portfolio by developing new eucalyptus cellulose products with diverse characteristics and physical properties. These innovations enable us to deliver highperformance and competitive products to the market, replacing competing fibers and penetrating new markets such as specialties and packaging. The conversion of these products into paper and packaging has yielded several benefits across the value chain. These include replacing scarce fibers with poor sustainability profiles, reducing the grammage of papers to boost productivity, and decreasing specific energy consumption in paper manufacturing. This contributes to increase energy efficiency and sustainability for end consumers.",

Effective January 2018, the B3 listing rules for its Novo Mercado segment require that a company listed on the Novo Mercado (such as ourselves) create and implement an audit committee in accordance with the CVM rules. Novo Mercado segment of B3 is a premium listing segment for Brazilian companies that meet the highest standards of corporate governance. For further information on the Novo Mercado listing segment, see 'Item 9. The Offer and Listing-Markets-S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards.'\n\nOn April 1, 2019, our shareholders approved an amendment to our bylaws requiring us to establish a statutory audit committee in accordance with CVM Instruction  No.  509/2011.  Our  statutory  audit  committee  is  an  advisory  committee  of  our  board  of  directors,  and  provides  assistance  in  matters  involving  our accounting, internal controls, financial reporting and compliance. Our statutory audit committee also recommends to our board of directors the appointment of our independent auditors and evaluates the effectiveness of our internal financial and legal compliance controls. According to CVM Instruction No. 509/2011, our statutory audit committee must have at least three members, and not more than five members, which must be independent in accordance with the independence requirements of the CVM and at least one of whom must have recognized experience in corporate accounting. Additionally, CVM Instruction No. 509/2011 and the B3 Novo Mercado listing  rules  both  require  that  at  least  one  member  of  the  audit  committee  be  a  board  member,  but  they  permit  the  appointment  of  other members who are not members of the board of directors provided such other members meet the independence requirements of the CVM. Our bylaws expressly require that our statutory audit committee consist of one or more persons who are members of our board of directors and one or more persons who are not members of our board of directors.\n\nOur statutory audit committee is not equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(c)(3), which provides for an exemption under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regarding the audit committees of listed companies, a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee if the foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be composed of one or more members of the board of directors and one or more members that are not also members of the board of directors, (ii) its members not be elected  by  management,  (iii)  no  executive  officer  be  a  member  of  the  body,  and  (iv)  home  country  legal  or  listing  provisions  set  forth  standards  for  the independence  of  the  members  of  the  body.  We  believe  that  our  statutory  audit  committee  complies  with  these  requirements,  and  we  rely  on  the  exemption provided by Rule 10A-3(c)(3) under the Exchange Act. The following table sets forth the name, position, date of appointment and term expiration for each of the members of our audit committee:\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Name                            | Position         | Date of Election   |   Term Expiration |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Ana Paula Pessoa                | Coordinator      | May 4, 2022        |              2024 |\n| Carlos Biedermann               | Financial Expert | May 4, 2022        |              2024 |\n| Marcelo Moses de Oliveira Lyrio | Member           | May 4, 2022        |              2024 |\n| Paulo Rogerio Caffarelli        | Risk Expert      | May 4, 2022        |              2024 |",

We also provide the following benefits, among others, to certain members of our board of directors and our entire board of executive officers: life insurance, health care plans, dental care, meal vouchers, transport, payroll loans and private pension plans. In addition to the benefits, we offer our management team long-term incentive programs.\n\nUntil 2023, we had three long-term Incentive plans based on shares: (i) the Phantom Share Plan, (ii) the SAR Plan (Share Appreciation Rights), and (iii) the Performance Share Plan. In 2024, the Company's management decided to discontinue the SAR Plan and keep the Phantom Share Plan and the Performance Share Plan, upon the approval of two new Plans. With this new structure, the Company's purpose is: i) aligning the interests of managers with the interests of the Company and its shareholders; ii) attracting, rewarding, retaining and encourage them to conduct the Company's business sustainably, within appropriate risk limits and aligned with the interests of shareholders; and iii) grant them a financial incentive. This changes were approved by our shareholders at the Annual and Extraordinary Meetings held on April 25, 2024.\n\n## Performance Shares Plan\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors, both the statutory and non-statutory board officers, and key employees are eligible to be beneficiaries of the our Performance Share Plan.\n\nThe Board of Directors may approve the grant of Performance Shares to Beneficiaries of the Plan, under the terms and conditions established in the Plan, and in the respective Programs and Grant Agreements. Each Performance Share corresponds to one (1) common, registered, book-entry share with no par value issued by the Company, to be delivered to the Beneficiary, once the conditions established in the Plan and the respective Program and Agreement have been met.\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the number of performance shares for each beneficiary, adhering to the global and, if applicable, the extraordinary limit under the plan. The number of performance shares delivered depends on achieving the targets set after the vesting period, as outlined in the programs and agreements. Initially, the grant's financial value is set, then converted into performance shares based on the average price of our common shares during up to ninety trading sessions on the B3 stock exchange before the grant date\n\nThe Board of Directors sets and approves the targets for granting performance shares based on TSR performance indicators and strategic priority metrics for each program.\n\nFor the Performance Share Plan, TSR refers to the performance indicator mechanism related to shareholder return, used to measure the performance of the reference group over a specific period by combining the share price of the comparable to demonstrate the return provided to the shareholder.",

This amount may adjust due to changes in the number, type, and class of shares as a result of bonuses, splits, reverse splits, or conversion of shares of one type or class into another, or conversion into other securities issued by us, or even in the case of eventual declarations of proceeds during the vesting period.\n\nThe Board of Directors may, in exceptional situations to preserve our best interests, establish conditions different from those in this plan for extraordinary grants of performance shares. These may occur when negotiating an entry bonus to hire managers or key employees who may become beneficiaries, or due to bonuses for specific activities or projects that bring significant returns to us. Such grants may not exceed 0.3% of our total issued shares on the plan's approval date, always respecting the overall limit under the plan.\n\n## Phantom Shares Plan\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors, both the statutory and non-statutory board officers, and key employees are eligible to be beneficiaries of our Phantom Shares  Plan.  The  Board  of  Directors  may  approve  grants  of  phantom  shares,  under  the  terms  and  conditions  established  in  the  plan,  and  in  the  respective programs and grant agreements.\n\nEach Phantom Share grants its holder a pecuniary right referenced to the market value of one share we issue. We calculate the number of Phantom Shares for each beneficiary based on their reference salary, salary multiple or financial references linked to their position, and the amount in reais per share, using the average quotation of the reference shares from up to 90 trading days on B3 stock exchange prior to the grant date.\n\nBeneficiaries can only exercise their rights to the phantom shares during the exercise period, after meeting the vesting period and other conditions outlined in the plan and agreements. The grant of phantom shares do not automatically confer rights to beneficiaries, including their exercise and settlement.\n\nThe vesting period is set by the Board of Directors in each program or grant agreement, ranging from three to five years from the grant date. The exercise period, also determined by the Board, may not exceed two years from the end of the vesting period.\n\nThe settlement of phantom shares is conducted through cash payment to the beneficiary of the redemption amount, calculated by multiplying the number of phantom shares by the average quotation of the reference shares over up to 90 trading sessions on the B3 stock exchange, as specified in each program. This amount may include TSR or another strategic metric as a multiplier in the redemption calculation.\n\nTSR, within our phanton shares plan, refers to the performance indicator related  to  shareholder  return,  measuring  the  performance  of  the  Reference Group by combining the share price to demonstrate the return provided to the shareholder.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  based  on  the  Committee's  recommendation  and  in  compliance  with  the  the  plan,  approves  programs  that  specify:  (i)  the beneficiaries of phantom shares, (ii) the number of phantom shares granted; (iii) the conditions and necessary modification for exercising rights related to the phanton shares; (iv) the vesting and exercise periods; and (v) other related terms and conditions.",

The difference between this plan and the phantom shares plan is the fact that there is a minimum appreciation requirement for vesting.\n\nThe options have an exercise price (or minimum level of share appreciation) that represents the average of the last 90 trading days prior to the grant date. The plan is composed of one tranche with a vesting period ending three years after the grant and maturing six months after the end of the vesting period. After five years, the options are exercised automatically.\n\nThe beneficiary is invited to participate in the plan. The acceptance by the beneficiary requires the investment of an amount equivalent to 5% of the grant at the date of the grant, and 20% at the end of the vesting period, which must be deposited in our bank account.\n\nThe beneficiary's gain varies depending on the performance of our shares and may vary up to 25% more depending of the relative performance of our shares and the competing shares (TSR - Total Shareholder Return). This percentage is calculated based on our performance for the relevant period in comparison with our competitors' performance and may vary between 75% and 125%.\n\n## Maximum, Minimum and Average Individual Remuneration of our Board of Directors, Board of Executive Officers and Fiscal Council\n\nTable of Contents\n\n| Year 2023                   |   Number of Members |   Number of Remunerated Members | Highest Remuneration (in reais)   | Lowest Remuneration (in reais)   | Average Remuneration (in reais)   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors          |                   9 |                               9 | 7,482,885.39                      | 1,008,000.00                     | 2,031,746.53                      |\n| Board of Executive Officers |                   7 |                               7 | 37,593,671.73                     | 7,987,386.33                     | 14,015,713.40                     |\n| Fiscal Council              |                   3 |                               3 | 426,720.00                        | 426,720.00                       | 426,720.00                        |\n\n## Note on Calculations:\n\n- \u00b7 The average annual remuneration of each body was calculated by dividing the total  amount  of  annual  compensation  (fixed,  variable  and  indirect benefits, including social contribution) for each body by the number of remunerated members in the respective body.\n- \u00b7 The lowest annual individual remuneration (fixed, variable and indirect benefits, including social contribution) of each body excludes all members of the respective body who have held the position for less than 12 months.\n- \u00b7 The highest annual individual remuneration (fixed, variable and indirect benefits, including social contribution) of each body makes no exclusions, considering all remuneration received by the respective member for functions exercised in the last 12 months.",

The compensation consists of a fixed monthly salary, which is related to the level of complexity of the position, and an annual share in our results through the variable compensation program.\n\nThe  variable  compensation  program  mostly  aims  at  leveraging  business  and  results,  encouraging  employees  to  effectively  contribute  to  our  growth, strengthening the commitment to sustainable results, while making the short- and long-term visions compatible, enabling that our growth results in a financial compensation, as well as retaining employees.\n\nShort-Term Variable Compensation Programs\n\nWe have two variable compensation programs based on the definition of group and individual targets. These targets are cascaded across all hierarchical\n\nlevels.\n\n## Long-Term Variable Compensation Programs\n\nWe have share-based compensation plans for certain non-management employees within our two Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans linked to the price our stock, paid in local currency. These are the Phantom Shares Plan and the Share Appreciation Right (SAR) plan, described above. Both plans depend on the stock price, and the SAR plan also depends on the performance of our shares in relation to our main competitors (TSR - Total Shareholder Return).\n\nOn November 10, 2017, we migrated our class 'A' preferred shares (SUZB5) to common shares (SUZB3). Since then, our common shares have become the underlying asset of our LTI plans.\n\n## Benefits policy\n\nBelow is a list of some of the benefits offered to employees:\n\nDental Care: we offer dental care to employees from certain units, which also covers their dependents. At the Mucuri unit, the benefit also covers the parents of employees.\n\nHealth Insurance Plan: we offer medical assistance to employees through health insurance plans managed by third -parties, according to the relevant work location. Employees, their dependents (i.e., spouse or partner, children younger than 21 and single, children younger than 24 who are students, and children with disabilities in any age) and interns are entitled to health insurance.

The amount  of  the  legal  cases  assessed  as  reasonably  possible,  as  of  December  31,  2023,  is  R$9,775.1  million  for  tax  proceedings,  R$194.9  million  for  labor proceedings and R$4,463.0 million for civil proceedings.\n\n## Tax Proceedings\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were involved as the defendant in approximately 32 administrative and judicial proceedings of tax and welfare nature, which likelihood of loss is probable, involving a plurality of taxes, such as corporate income tax (IRPJ), social contribution on net income (CSLL), retained income tax (IRRF), social integration program (PIS), social contribution on revenue (COFINS), tax on industrialized products (IPI), social contribution, tax on rural real estate (ITR), value added tax on goods and services (ICMS), tax on services (ISS) and real estate tax (IPTU).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had provisions, net of judicial deposits, of R$2,329.4 million related to tax claims for which our legal counsel considers that the likelihood of loss is probable. In addition, the total amount related to proceedings in which we are defendants, and for which our legal counsel considers the likelihood of loss possible, is R$9,775.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had no provision accrued for claims which likelihood of loss is possible.\n\nThe remaining tax and welfare proceedings refer to other taxes, such as social contribution, IRPJ, CSLL, ITR, ICMS, ISS, IRRF, PIS and COFINS, mainly due to divergences on the interpretation of applicable tax rules and ancillary tax obligations.\n\n## We list below our key legal proceedings:\n\n- a.    Tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - exchange of industrial and forestry assets: In December 2012, the Brazilian Federal Revenue (RFB) issued a tax assessment against us, alleging that we failed to pay capital gains tax in February 2007 when we completed an exchange of industrial and forestry assets with International Paper. In January 2016, the Tax Federal Administrative Court (CARF) rejected our administrative appeal. In May 2016, we filed a lawsuit and presented a judicial guarantee, which was accepted. The court ruled in our favor, but the Government Attorney's Office appealed, and the judgment is still pending. In December 2023, considering the terms of the Article 25, \u00a7 9\u00baA, of the Law No. 14,689/23, the Debt Certificates (CDAs) were amended to definitively cancel the amount related to the tax penalty and its charges. We have not made provisions for this matter, as the likelihood of loss is  considered possible based on the opinion of our internal and external legal counsel. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$1,630.5 million (R$2,505.9 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- b. Tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - In October 2023, the RFB issued a tax assessment against us, alleging that we failed to pay IRPJ and CSLL related to profits earned abroad by a subsidiary company in 2019. We submitted a defense at the administrative level, which is pending judgment. We have not made provisions for this matter, as the likelihood of loss is considered possible based on the opinion of our internal and external legal counsel. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure R$845.2 million.\n- c.    Tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - disallowance of depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses - 2010: In December 2015, the RFB issued a tax assessment  against  us,  alleging  that  we  failed  to  pay  IRPJ  and  CSLL  related  to  the  non-deductibility  of  depreciation,  amortization,  and  depletion expenses in 2010. We filed an administrative appeal, which was partially upheld. We then appealed this decision in November 2017, and the case was converted  into  a  diligence  proceeding. As  of  December  31,  2023,  the  amount  of  the  possible  exposure  is  R$827.2  million  (R$777.4  million  as  of December 31, 2022).",

Tax assessment - Corporate Income Tax and Social Contribution: In October 2020, the RFB issued a tax assessment against us, alleging that we failed to pay IRPJ and CSLL related to the remeasurement of profit of our wholly-owned subsidiary Suzano Trading Ltd for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Certain statutory executive officers from Suzano Trading were also included as defendants. Our legal counsel considers the risk of loss as possible for us and, for the officers, also possible with greater chances of success (possible to remote). We presented an administrative defense and the case was converted into a diligence proceeding. The diligence is expected to be initiated. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$563.7 million (R$516.4 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- e.    PIS/COFINS - Goods and Services - 2009 to 2011: In December 2013, the RFB issued a tax assessment against, alleging that the collection of PIS and COFINS credits disallowed because they were allegedly not linked to our operating activities. Our initial administrative defense was dismissed. We filed  an  administrative  appeal  that  was  partially  upheld  in April  2016.  Subsequently,  both  we  and  the  National  Treasury  filed  a  new  appeal  to  the Superior  Chamber,  where  our  appeal  was  partially  accepted.  We  have  filed  another  administrative  appeal,  which  is  still  pending  judgment. As  of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$190.9 million (R$180.2 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- f.    Tax assessment - taxation on a universal basis - year 2015: In November 2020, the RFB issued a tax assessment against, alleging that we failed to pay IRPJ and CSLL related to the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the absence of profits earned by subsidiaries abroad in the determination of taxable income and social contribution calculation basis. We filed an administrative defense that was partially upheld. We filed an appeal, which is pending judgment. Our legal counsel considers the risk of loss as possible for us. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$176.9 million (R$163.1 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- g.    Tax incentive - Agency for the Development of the Northeastern Brazil (ADENE): In 2002, the RFB granted our request to benefit from reductions in corporate income tax and nonrefundable surcharges calculated on operating profits for Aracruz facilities A and B (period from 2003 to 2013) and plant C (period from 2003 to 2012), contingent upon approval of the qualification reports for the tax reductions by SUDENE. In 2004, we received a notice from the liquidator of the former Superintendence for the Development of the Northeast (SUDENE) stating that the right to use the previously granted benefit was unfounded and would be canceled. In 2005, the RFB issued an assessment notice requiring the payment of the amounts of the tax incentive used, plus interest. After administrative discussions, the assessment notice was partially upheld, recognizing our right to the tax incentive through 2003. Our management, supported by our legal counsel, believes that the decision to cancel the tax benefits is erroneous and should not prevail for both benefits already  used  and  benefits  not  used  until  the  corresponding  final  periods.  The  publication  of  the  decision  regarding  the  request  for  clarification  is currently pending. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$143.9 million (R$136.7 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- h. Compensation - IRRF - period 2000: We filed a lawsuit requesting the compensation of IRRF credits originated in the year ended December 31, 2000, regarding debts owed to the RFB. In April 2008, the RFB partially recognized the credit in our favor. We filed an administrative appeal with CARF and the case was converted into a diligence proceeding, which is still in process. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$120.9 million (R$116.1 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- i. IRPJ /CSLL - partial approval - 1997: We requested approval to offset 1997 tax losses with amounts owed to the RFB. In March 2009, the authorities approved  only  R$83.0  million,  which  generated  a  difference  of  R$51.0  million.  We  are  still  awaiting  the  conclusion  of  the  analysis  of  the  credits discussed at the administrative level following a favorable decision of CARF in August 2019, which granted the Voluntary Appeal filed by us. For the remaining credit, we have appealed the rejection of the tax credits and obtained a partially favorable decision, and the final decision is under discussion in the judicial level which is still pending. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the amount of the possible exposure is R$117.1 million (R$111.8 million as of December 31, 2022)",

Tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL: In December 2019,the RFB issued a tax assessment against, alleging that we failed to pay IRPJ and CSLL related to certain transfer pricing issues in 2015. We have filed an administrative defense in January 2020, which was partially upheld. We have filed another administrative appeal, which is still pending judgment. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the amount of the possible exposure is R$106.5 million (R$97.5 million as of December 31, 2022).\n- k.        Tax  assessment  -  IRPJ  and  Negative  Balance: An administrative procedure was initiated due to the use of credits by us regarding the negative balance  of  the  period  between  January  2016  and  December  2016.  We  presented  our  legal  defense  at  the  administrative  level,  which  is  currently pending judgment. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of the possible exposure is R$102.5 million (R$93.2 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## Labor Proceedings\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were involved as defendant in 1,241 labor proceedings assessed as reasonably probable, which represents a contingency provision, net of judicial deposits, of R$266.8 million, duly provisioned in our audited consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we were involved in 1,034 labor proceedings assessed as reasonably possible, with a total amount under dispute of R$194.9 million. We are also involved in collective disputes filed by labor unions located in the states of Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Maranh\u00e3o and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nThe  labor  proceedings  filed  against  us  involve  common  matters  under  dispute  in  other  agroindustrial  companies,  such  as  overtime  and  termination payments, additional compensation for allegedly unsafe/unhealthy labor conditions, in addition to lawsuits filed by outsourced and third-party employees claiming that we are secondarily or jointly liable for compensation owed to them by their original employers.\n\n## Civil, Land and Environmental Proceedings\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  we  were  involved  in  76  judicial  civil  and  environmental  proceedings  assessed  as  reasonably  probable,  representing  a contingency provision, net of judicial deposits, of R$264.2 million duly provisioned in our audited consolidated financial statements. In addition, we have 219 civil and environmental proceedings assessed as reasonably possible, amount under dispute totaling R$4,463.0 million.\n\nThe civil judicial proceedings refer mainly to indemnification claims, real estate possession challenges, claims for the revision of contractual provisions, bankruptcy, reimbursement of funds claimed from landowners and land lawsuits. The environmental judicial proceedings involving us mainly relate to licensing issues  and  environmental  impacts  of  our  activities.  We  are  also  a  party  in  administrative  proceedings  that  discuss  issues  related  to  forestry  operations  and environmental licensing. Claims deemed material are outlined below.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe currently have two relevant public civil claims ( a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablica ) filed by the Federal Public Prosecution Office in the north and northeast regions of Brazil,  which  challenge  the  jurisdiction  of  the  state's  environmental  agency  to  grant  environmental  licenses  and  claiming  compensation  for  the  impacts  of  our operation. The Federal Public Prosecution Office alleges that the environmental licensing proceedings related to the installation of our industrial plant in the state of Maranh\u00e3o should be carried out by the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency - IBAMA. The risks involved in such proceedings include delays in our plantation schedule and the suspension of the activities carried out in our Maranh\u00e3o unit until a new permit is issued and the impacts are repaired. The superior court is still to rule on an appeal against the injunction granted against us, and the other claim are still pending judgement by the trial judge.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn December 2020, the Prosecutor's Office of the State of Bahia initiated a public civil action against us, questioning the applicability of the concept of \"Consolidated Rural Areas,\" established by Federal Law No. 12,651/2012, in areas within the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica Biome. The case is still in its preliminary stages, and a preliminary injunction was issued recognizing the Regulatory Decree for the Atlantic Forest biome as applicable. It also requested in-depth technical studies from the Bahia Environmental Institute (INEMA) to identify possible Consolidated Rural Areas in the region. This decision is subject to appeal by both us and INEMA.\n\nThe  municipality  of  Nova  Vi\u00e7osa,  located  in  the  state  of  Bahia,  filed  a  Public  Civil  Action  against  us,  claiming  collective  damages  due  to  alleged consequences of our dredging operations in a navigation channel in the Municipality of Caravelas, operated by us until 2021. Although these operations were conducted in accordance with environmental permits issued by INEMA and the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (IBAMA), the municipality alleges that the dredging caused impacts on fishing and aesthetic elements.\n\nThe motion by the municipality was mostly denied due to the lack of legal and factual requirements for an injunction, except for a partial grant obliging us to  hire  an  audit  to  attest  to  the  robustness  of  our  corporate  governance.  We  appealed  to  the  State  Court,  which  ruled  against  us  in  a  decision  that  was contradictory and unclear. We filed a motion for clarification to reverse the decision, which is pending judgment. However, if the unfavorable ruling is upheld, the granted injunction presents little to no risk to us.\n\nAdditionally, 50 individuals filed lawsuits against us, claiming individual damages due to alleged consequences of the dredging operations. All motions for preliminary injunctions by these individuals were rejected by the Judge and upheld by the State Court of Appeals.\n\nIn August 2023, the Federal Prosecutor's Office filed a Public Civil Action against us, another company, the State of Bahia, and the Federal Union, seeking the suspension and subsequent revocation of our licenses and authorizations related to activities allegedly impacting traditional communities in southern Bahia. The action also seeks to identify and allocate vacant properties under the control of these companies for the demarcation of traditional territories.\n\nWe contend that this action lacks merit. The areas in question have been operated by us and our predecessors since the 1980s, with all operations authorized through environmental licenses. There are no demarcated traditional territories in the direct influence area of our activities in southern Bahia, and we do not operate in demarcated indigenous territories.\n\nThe injunction requested by the Plaintiff was rejected by the Judge, who found the alleged facts and claims more likely to be unsubstantiated than truthful, and due to the absence of risk to justify an urgent order. The prosecutor's office filed a preliminary appeal with the First Circuit Federal Court of Appeals to overrule the  decision  and  grant  the  injunction.  In  our  understanding,  most  of  the  claims  are  not  supported  by  the  prosecutor's  office's  investigations  or  are  based  on speculative and vague documents and opinions.\n\nWe restate our compliance with the rights of native and traditional peoples, in line with our guidelines for relations with this public, and maintain a series of social and environmental programs within our environmental license procedures that benefit indigenous and traditional peoples in our area of influence.\n\n## Civil Matters\n\nRegarding  civil  matters,  we  are  involved  in  two  public  civil  claims (a\u00e7\u00e3o  civil  p\u00fablica) filed  by  the  Federal  Public  Prosecution  Office  requesting  (i)  a preliminary injunction to prohibit our trucks from transporting wood in federal highways above legal weight restrictions, (ii) an increase in the amount of fines for cases  of  overweight,  and  (iii)  compensation  for  damages  to  property  allegedly  caused  to  federal  highways,  the  environment  and  the  economic  order,  and compensation for moral damages. One of these claims was ruled against us. We presented an appeal to the Court of Appeals, requesting an interim relief to stay the effects of such ruling until a final decision is reached. We are currently waiting for the ruling on the interim relief by the 1st Regional Federal Court Appeals. In 2021, both were suspended due to the decision of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) to evaluate the points of discussion in the form of a repetitive appeal. Still no date for judgment.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn November 2020, a sea logistic supplier initiated an arbitration proceeding against us due to the early termination of an agreement. The plaintiff seeks to enforce a put provision (imposing the ownership and acquisition of barges) allegedly foreseen in the agreement as a penalty for the early termination, and the payment of purported losses and damages suffered because of termination. Our position is that the put is not due, and, even if it was due, the put provision is abusive under the economic ratio of the contract. The court of arbitration ruled the matter, partially accepting our counterparty claims'. Afterwards, the parties settled an agreement in August 2023, and the case was closed by the arbitrary court decision on agreed terms, in September 2023.\n\nIn 2015, we sued a competitor who improperly and unauthorizedly used a variety of eucalyptus protected by intellectual property rights (cultivar) of Fibria. The prohibition of cultivation of this biological asset by the competitor is protected by an injunction still in force. The district court ruled the case, confirming the preliminary injunction and ordering the respondent to cease and refrain from planting and propagating eucalyptus clones of VT02 throughout the national territory, as well as ordering it to pay compensation for material damages to be fixed in a further phase of calculation of the award, which was already initiated by us. While the sentence was pending, the competitor filed an action to annul the cultivar registration, but the course of the first action was not harmed. The first claim was ruled on in April 2021, and there are appeals from both parties awaiting decision. Until this point, there has not been any decision capable of restraining our rights in this matter.\n\n## Land Disputes\n\nWe were served in March 2014 in a public civil claim (a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablic a) filed by the Federal Prosecutor's Office regarding real property acquired by us in the northern part of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. The Federal Prosecutor requested the nullity of the deeds, compensation for moral damages and suspension of financing for our operations in the municipalities of S\u00e3o Mateus and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Barra, both located in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. A preliminary injunction was granted, which blocked around 6,000 hectares of our land in such municipalities and suspended any financing for us by BNDES for either production or planting of eucalyptus pulp on the properties relating to the public civil claim.\n\nIn September 2015, we were served a notice of another public civil claim ( a\u00e7\u00e3o civil p\u00fablic a) filed by the same Federal Prosecutor's Office, requesting the nullity of the deeds of other certain proprieties acquired in the northern part of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo. A preliminary injunction was granted blocking around 5,601 hectares of our land in the same municipalities of S\u00e3o Mateus and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Barra. We filed our judicial defense and an appeal against such injunction, which is still pending judgment.\n\nIn October 2021, both cases were ruled and the Federal District Court, decided for the nullity of the land titles and determined the return of these areas and respective properties rights to the State's title.\n\nThe decisions rendered are not final and the company has filed appropriate appeals claiming for reversal of this decision before the Federal State Court of Espirito Santo.\n\nIt is important to highlight that Suzano is the legitimate owner of the properties under discussion and will continue to discuss the matter in court, in order to prove the legality of the acquisitions made at the time of acquisition, in accordance with applicable laws and practices applicable at the time of purchase.\n\n## Land Issues\n\nIn April and October 2006, and in December 2009, the Brazilian Institute for Land Reform - INCRA, published a public notice informing that certain reports issued by commissions created by INCRA concluded that approximately 34,430 hectares of land located in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo should belong to certain quilombola communities  ( comunidades  quilombolas  de  Linharinho,  S\u00e3o  Jorge  e  S\u00e3o  Domingos ).  From  that  total  area,  approximately  25,330  hectares corresponded to property owned by us. The issues raised by INCRA reports are still underway, and there is no final decision by the INCRA. We are confident that the acquisition of this area by us complied with the applicable legislation and was duly registered with the appropriate governmental offices.",

On August 28, 2023, following a request from the Public Prosecutor's Office, the court ordered the closure of all investigations, citing no evidence of illegal activity.\n\n## Dividends\n\n## General\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law and our bylaws require that we distribute annually to our shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, which we refer to as the mandatory dividend, equal to at least 25% of our net income after taxes, after certain deductions, including accumulated losses and any amounts allocated to employee and management participation, any amount allocated to our legal reserve, and any amount allocated to the contingency reserve and any amount written off in respect of the contingency reserve accumulated in previous fiscal years, in each case in accordance with Brazilian law.\n\nIn  accordance with article 26 of our bylaws, the minimum mandatory dividend corresponds to the lower of: (i) 25% of the adjusted annual net profits, adjusted according with the Brazilian Corporate Law, and (ii) 10% of the Operating Cash Flow Generation in the relevant fiscal year. The Operating Cash Flow Generation (GCO) is calculated using the following formula: GCO = Adjusted EBITDA - Maintenance Capex, where 'GCO' means the consolidated Generation of Operational Cash of the Fiscal Year, expressed in national currency, 'EBITDA' means our net profit of the fiscal year expressed in national currency, before the income tax and social contribution on net income, financial income and expenses, depreciation, amortization and depletion. 'Adjusted EBITDA' means the EBITDA excluding items not recurrent and/or not cash and gains (losses) arising from changes in fair value of sale of the biological assets.\n\nDividends must be distributed within 60 days from the date of its declaration, unless a shareholders' resolution determines another date, not later than the end of the fiscal year in which such dividend was declared. The Brazilian Corporation Law permits, however, a company to suspend the mandatory distribution of dividends if  its  board  of  directors  reports  to  the  shareholders'  meeting  that  the  distribution  would  be  incompatible  with  the  financial  condition  of  the  company, subject to approval by the shareholders' meeting and review by the fiscal council. Net income not distributed due to the suspension mentioned here must be attributed to a special reserve and, if not absorbed by subsequent losses, must be paid as dividends as soon as the financial situation of the company permits.\n\nThe amounts available for distribution are determined on the basis of financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Brazilian Corporation Law. In addition, amounts arising from tax incentive benefits or rebates are appropriated to a separate capital reserve in accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law. This investment incentive reserve is not normally available for distribution, although it can be used to absorb losses under certain circumstances or be capitalized. Amounts appropriated to this reserve are not available for distribution as dividends.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law permits a company to pay interim dividends out of preexisting and accumulated profits for the preceding fiscal year or semester, based on financial statements approved by its shareholders. We may prepare financial statements semiannually or for shorter periods. Our board of directors  may  declare  a  distribution  of  dividends  based  on  the  profits  reported  in  semiannual  financial  statements.  Our  board  of  directors  may  also  declare  a distribution of interim dividends based on profits previously accumulated or in profits reserve, which are reported in such financial statements or in the last annual financial statement approved by resolution taken at a shareholders' meeting.",

The common shares underlying the ADSs are held in Brazil by Banco Ita\u00fa S.A., also known as the custodian, as agent for the depositary, which is the registered owner on the records of the registrar for our shares.\n\nPayments of cash dividends and distributions, if any, are made in reais to the custodian on behalf of the depositary, which then converts such proceeds into U.S. Dollars and causes such U.S. Dollars to be delivered to the depositary for distribution to holders of ADSs. In the event that the custodian is unable to convert immediately the foreign currency received as dividends into U.S. Dollars, the amount of U.S. Dollars payable to holders of ADSs may be adversely affected by devaluations of the Brazilian currency that occur before the dividends are converted. Under the Brazilian Corporation Law, dividends paid to persons who are not Brazilian residents, including holders of ADSs, will not be subject to Brazilian withholding tax.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nFor the year 2023, on December 1, 2023, our Board of Directors approved the distribution of interest on equity in the total gross amount of R$1,500.0 million at the rate of R$1.163375077 per share, considering the number of \"ex-treasury\" shares at the date of the distribution, as remuneration based on the profit shown in the balance sheet dated September 30, 2023. Interest on own capital was subject to a withholding income tax of 15%, except for shareholders who are proven to be exempt, in accordance with legislation in force. Income tax in the amount of R$190.1 million was withheld and paid in December 2023. The interest on own capital declared was attributed to the minimum mandatory dividend for the 2023, in accordance with the approval at the Annual General Meeting held in April 25, 2024 and with statutory and legal provisions. Payment of such proceeds was made in January 2024.\n\nFor the year 2022, on December 1, 2022, our Board of Directors approved the distribution of interim dividends in the total amount of R$2,350.0 million at the  rate  of  R$1.794780909  per  share,  considering  the  number  of  \"ex-treasury\"  shares  on  the  present  date,  declared  to  the  balance  of  retained  earnings ascertained in the balance sheet dated September 30, 2022. Interim dividends were distributed \"ad referendum\" of the Annual General Meeting that approves the accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, pursuant to Brazilian Corporations Law and our bylaws. The early payment of dividends related to 2022, in the amount of R$2,350.0 million, was imputed to the mandatory minimum dividends determined at the end of the 2022, in accordance with the approval at the Annual General Meeting held in April 27, 2023 and with statutory and legal provisions. Payment of interim dividends was made in December 2022.\n\nFor  the  year  2021,  on April  25,  2022,  our  shareholders  in  the Annual  Ordinary  and  Extraordinary  Shareholder's  meeting  approved  the  distribution  of dividends in the total amount of R$1,800.0 million, related to: a) R$1,000.0 million as anticipated dividends to the net income account for the year, as approved by our board of directors on January 7, 2022, and R$90.0 thousand due to variations in stock ownership verified in January 2022; and b) R$799.9 million declared at the Annual and Extraordinary Shareholder's meetings held on April 25, 2022, paid in May 2022.\n\nIn accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law and our bylaws, our shareholders approved that there would be no distribution of dividends for the fiscal year of 2020, given that there was no net profit for such year.",

Significant Changes\n\nSee notes 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report, to see our significant changes on period.\n\n## Capital Increase\n\nOn April 25, 2024, our shareholders at Annual General Meeting approved a share capital increase in R$ 10,000.0 million, without issue of shares, upon the capitalization of part of the Capital Increase Reserve. Therefore, the share capital of R$9,269.3 million divided into 1,304,117,615 registered, book-entry common shares with no par value became R$19,269.3 million, comprised of 1,304,117,615 registered, book-entry common shares, with no par value.\n\n## Other Significant Changes\n\nOther significant changes or events have occurred after the close of the balance sheet at December 31, 2023. For further information on such events, please see note 32 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\n\n## ITEM 9. THE OFFER AND LISTING\n\n## A. Offer and Listing Details\n\nOur ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol 'SUZ.' Our common shares trade on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange under the symbol 'SUZB3.' On December 31, 2023, we had approximately 75,000 shareholders of record at the B3.\n\n## B. Plan of Distribution\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## C. Markets\n\n## Trading on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange\n\nSettlement of transactions conducted on the B3 becomes effective two business days after the trade date. Delivery of, and payment for, shares is made through the facilities  of  separate  clearinghouses  for  each  exchange,  which  maintain  accounts  for  member  brokerage  firms. The  seller  is  ordinarily  required  to deliver the shares to the clearinghouse on the second business day following the trade date. The clearinghouse for the B3 is Companhia Brasileira de Liquida\u00e7\u00e3o e Cust\u00f3dia , or CBLC.\n\nIn order to better control volatility, the B3 has adopted a 'circuit breaker' system pursuant to which trading sessions may be suspended for a period of 30 minutes or one hour whenever the indices of these stock exchanges fall below the limits of 10% and 15%, respectively, in relation to the index registered in the previous trading session.\n\nThe  B3  is  less  liquid  than  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  other  major  exchanges  in  the  world.  At  December  31,  2023,  the  aggregate  market capitalization of the 83 companies listed on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Index (Ibovespa) was equivalent to approximately US$839 billion. Although any of the outstanding shares of a listed company may trade on a Brazilian stock exchange, in most cases fewer than half of the listed shares are actually available for trading by the public, the remainder being held by small groups of controlling persons, governmental entities or one principal shareholder.\n\nTrading on the B3 by non-residents of Brazil is subject to certain limitations under Brazilian foreign investment and tax legislation. See 'Item 10.D Exchange Controls.' and 'Item 10.E - Taxation'.",

The inclusion of a company in any of these listing segments requires adherence to a series of corporate governance rules. These rules are designed to increase shareholders' rights and enhance the quality of information provided by Brazilian corporations.\n\nIn 2004, we listed our shares on the Level 1 segment of the BM&FBOVESPA (former name of the B3), thus guaranteeing transparency in our operations and accountability to our shareholders. In September 2017, we approved the admission of our shares for trading on the listing segment called Novo Mercado of B3, followed by the conversion of the preferred shares issued by us into common shares at the ratio of one preferred share, class 'A' or class 'B', for one common share. In addition, we also approved the restatement of our bylaws to adapt them to Novo Mercado rules and a change of our methodology to calculate mandatory dividends, also reflecting best corporate governance practices. We concluded the migration to Novo Mercado segment of B3 in November 2017.\n\nAs a result, in addition to the disclosure obligations imposed by the Brazilian Corporation Law and the CVM, we also must comply with the following additional disclosure requirements set forth by the Novo Mercado rules:\n\n- \u00b7 no later than six months following our listing on the Novo Mercado , we must disclose financial statements and consolidated financial statements at the end of each quarter (except the last quarter of the year) and at the end of each fiscal year, including a statement of cash flows which must indicate, at a minimum, the changes in our cash and cash equivalents, divided into operating, financing and investing activities;\n- \u00b7 from the date on which we release our financial statements relating to the second fiscal year following our listing on the Novo Mercado we must, no later than four months after the end of the fiscal year: (i) prepare our annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, if applicable, in accordance with U.S. GAAP or IFRS Accounting Standards, in reais or U.S. dollars, in the English language, together with\n- \u00b7 management reports, (b) notes to the financial statements, including information on net income and shareholders' equity calculated at the end of such fiscal year in accordance with Brazilian GAAP, as well as management proposals for allocation of net income, and (c) our independent auditors' report; or  (ii)  disclose,  in  the  English  language,  complete  financial  statements,  management  reports  and  notes  to  the  financial  statements,  prepared  in accordance  with  the  Brazilian  Corporation  Law,  accompanied  by  (a)  an  additional  note  regarding  the  reconciliation  of  year-end  net  income  and shareholders' equity calculated in accordance with Brazilian GAAP to U.S. GAAP or IFRS Accounting Standards, as the case may be, which must include the main differences between the accounting principles used, and (b) the independent auditors' report; and\n- \u00b7 from the date on which we release our first financial statement prepared as provided above, no more than 15 days following the term established by law  for  the  publication  of  quarterly  financial  information,  we  must:  (i)  disclose,  in  its  entirety,  our  quarterly  financial  information  translated  into  the English language or (ii) disclose our financial statements and consolidated financial statements in accordance with Brazilian GAAP, U.S. GAAP or IFRS Accounting Standards as provided above, accompanied by the independent auditors' report.",

The notification must occur at least 21 days prior to the meeting scheduled date, pursuant to Brazilian Corporation Law. If the meeting so noticed is not held for any reason on first notice, a second notification must be published at least eight days before the second meeting date.\n\nOn the first notice, meetings may be held only if shareholders holding at least one-fourth of voting shares are represented. Extraordinary meetings for the amendment of the bylaws may be held on the first notice only if shareholders holding at least two thirds of the voting capital are represented. On a second call, the meetings are held regardless of quorum.\n\nPursuant to our bylaws and Brazilian Corporation Law, shareholders at our annual shareholders' meeting, which is required to be held within the first four months following the end of the fiscal year, will convene to: (i) take the management accounts; examine, discuss and vote on the financial statements; (ii) decide on the uses to which the net income of the fiscal year should be put and on the distribution of dividends; and (iii) elect the members of the Fiscal Council and, when applicable, the members of the board of directors.\n\nAn Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened whenever the Company interests so require, and to resolve on following matters pursuant to the Brazilian Corporation Law: (i) amend our bylaws; (ii) elect or dismiss members of the board of directors (Conselho de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o ), at any time; (iii) install our fiscal council and elect and dismiss its members, if such body was not installed in the annual shareholders' meeting; (iv) authorize the issuance of debentures; (v) suspend the rights of a shareholder in the event such shareholder does not comply with obligations imposed by law or our bylaws; (vi) accept or reject in-kind contributions offered by a shareholder in consideration for issuance of capital stock; (vii) resolve on the bonus share, division or reverse split of shares; (viii) pass resolutions to reorganize the legal form of, merge, consolidate or split the company, to dissolve and liquidate the company, to elect and dismiss our liquidators and to examine their accounts; (ix) waiver of the requirement to hold a public offering for the acquisition of shares as a condition for the Company's delisting from Novo Mercado;  (ix)  authorize  management  to  declare  us  insolvent  and  to  request  a  judicial  recovery  ( recupera\u00e7\u00e3o  judicial ,  a  procedure  involving  protection  from creditors available under Brazilian law); (x) resolve on the execution of transactions with related parties or the sale or the contribution, to another company, if the transaction value represents more than 50% of the company's total assets, according to the previous financial statement approved by the shareholders; (vi) any matter submitted by the board of directors.\n\nIn  accordance  with  our  bylaws,  a  shareholders'  meeting  must  be  convened  with  a  minimum  notice  period  of  60  days  if  the  agenda  includes  (i)  the cancellation of the company's registration as a publicly held company, or (ii) any amendment or removal of Article 30, which pertains to the tender offer in case of acquisition of relevant interest.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law and our bylaws require that we distribute annually to our shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, which we refer to as the  mandatory  dividend,  after  certain  deductions,  including  accumulated  losses  and  any  amounts  allocated  to  employee  and  management  participation,  any amount allocated to our legal reserve, and any amount allocated to the contingency reserve and any amount written off in respect of the contingency reserve accumulated in previous fiscal years, in each case in accordance with Brazilian law.",

The Operating Cash Flow Generation (GCO) is calculated using the following formula: GCO = Adjusted EBITDA - Maintenance Capex, where 'EBITDA' means the net profit of the fiscal year of the Company expressed in national currency, before the income tax and social contribution on net income, financial income and expenses, depreciation, amortization and depletion. 'Adjusted EBITDA' means EBITDA excluding items not recurrent and/or not cash and gains (losses) arising from changes in fair value of sale of the biological assets. 'Maintenance Capex' means the amount, expressed in national currency, of the investments in maintenance executed in the fiscal year.\n\n## Acquisition of a Relevant Interest\n\nAny person, including, without limitation, any natural or legal person, investment fund, condominium, securities portfolio, universality of rights, or other form of organization, resident, domiciled or headquartered in Brazil or abroad solely or jointly with another bound person(s) (person or group of persons bound by a voting agreement or similar agreement, or acting jointly representing the same interests), shareholder(s) or not of the Company, which subscribes, acquires or, in any other form, including, without limitation, by means of exchange, conversion, corporate reorganization (including, but not limiting to the merger of the Company and/or of its shares or the merger by the Company of other company or the shares thereof), or even upon acquisition of preemptive rights and/or subscription of shares  or  other  securities  issued  by  the  Company  convertible  into  shares  or  which  give  the  right  to  its  subscription  or  purchase  of  shares  of  the  Company, becomes holder, directly or indirectly, in Brazil or offshore, of any percentage equal to or greater than 20% of the total shares issued by the Company shall, within the maximum term of 30 days counting from the date of the event which results in the ownership of the relevant interest, launch or, in the case of a registered tender offer in the terms of CVM Resolution 85/22, file a registry request before CVM of, a tender offer for the acquisition of the totality of the shares issued by the Company, which shall be liquidated in the maximum term of (a) 48 days counting from the launch of the offer not subject to registration, and (b) 180 days counting from the date of registry filing, in the case of an offer subject to registration, in the terms of the law and applicable legislation, except for certain delays which do not arise from any act or omission of the offeror.\n\n## Disclosure of Significant Interest\n\nCVM rules provides that all shareholders or groups of shareholders will be required to disclose, through notice to us and to the stock exchanges on which our securities are traded, the negotiation of securities that results in the shareholder surpassing or decreasing the thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, and so on, of participation in a certain class or type of share representative of a company's capital stock.\n\nPursuant to our bylaws, any person who holds Outstanding Shares in an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the total shares issued by us, and that wishes to carry out a new acquisition of shares issued by us ('New Acquisition'), shall be obliged, prior to each New Acquisition, to communicate in writing to our Investor Relations Officer, at least three (3) business days prior to the date of the New Acquisition: (i) the number of Outstanding Shares that it intends to acquire; (ii) the intention to acquire; (iii) if it has an interest to appoint a member to the board of directors or to the Audit Committee; (iv) the source of the resources that will be used for such acquisition; and (v) the strategic plans related to its investment in the Company.

The  tender  offer  is  subject  to applicable laws and regulations, our bylaws and the rules of the Novo Mercado.\n\n## Delisting from the Novo Mercado\n\nAccording to  the  new  Novo  Mercado  Listing  Rules  the  withdrawal  from  the  Novo  Mercado  may  be:  (i)  voluntary;  or  (ii)  mandatory,  as  a  result  of  the violation of any the rules of the Novo Mercado or the deregistration as publicly-held company.\n\nThe withdrawal, however, shall only occur after the launching of a public tender offer for our outstanding shares, which shall (i) follow, as applicable, the CVM regulation that rules that the mandatory tender offer for the deregistration as publicly held company (including the above mentioned possibility to request a second valuation report); and (ii) be launched at a fair price, as appointed in the appraisal report issued by a specialized institution with proven experience for the purposes of the tender offer; and (iii) be approved by at least one third (1/3) of the shareholders representing the free float that participate in the tender offer auction (whether by selling its shares or expressly agreeing with the withdrawal from the Novo Mercado).\n\nThe obligation to launch such public tender offer, however, may be waived by the majority of the shareholders representing our free float present at the shareholders' meeting convened to resolve on that matter. Such shareholders' meeting may be held on first call with the attendance of shareholders representing two thirds (2/3) of the free float or, on second call, with the attendance of any number of shareholders representing the free float.\n\nThe withdrawal from the Novo Mercado does not necessarily result in our deregistration as a publicly-held company on the B3. If we participate in a corporate  reorganization  involving  the  transfer  of  our  shareholders'  base  to  a  company  that  is  not  listed  in  the  Novo  Mercado,  such  resulting  company  or companies must apply for listing on Novo Mercado within 120 days from the date of the general shareholders meeting that approved the reorganization, unless the majority of the shareholders representing our free float present at such shareholders' meeting agrees with the non-listing of the resulting company.\n\nPursuant to the new rules of the Novo Mercado, the voluntary withdrawal shall be preceded by a public tender offer at fair market value. For the withdrawal to move forward, shareholders representing more than one third (1/3) of the outstanding shares shall need to accept the tender offer or expressly agree to delist without selling the shares.\n\nAccording to the rules of the Novo Mercado, in the event of a transfer of our shareholding control within 12 months following our delisting from the Novo Mercado, the selling controlling shareholder(s) and the acquirer must offer to acquire the remaining shares for the same price and terms offered to the selling controlling shareholders, duly updated, or pay the difference, if any, between the tender offer price accepted by the former shareholders, duly updated, and the price obtained by the controlling shareholder in selling its shares.\n\n## Delisting as Publicly-Held Company\n\nOur delisting as publicly-held company shall be conditioned to: (i) the launching of a public tender offer for the acquisition of all of our outstanding shares in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Brazilian  Corporation  Law,  the  CVM  rules  and  regulations,  by  us,  our  controlling  shareholders  or  a  group  of  controlling shareholders and (ii) the acceptance of at least two thirds (2/3) of the shareholders representing the free float that show up at the tender offer auction (whether by selling  its  shares  or  expressly  agreeing  with  the  delisting),  in  which  case  we  would  become  a  privately-held  company. The  price  offered  for  such  outstanding shares must at least correspond to the fair value of such shares as set forth in the respective appraisal report issued by a specialized institution with proven experience hired by the offeror for the purposes of the tender offer.",

This request must be made within 15 days following the disclosure of the price to be paid for the shares in the public tender offer. If the new valuation price is equal to or lower than the original valuation price, the shareholders making such request as well as those who vote in its favor must reimburse the Company for any costs incurred in preparing the new appraisal report. If the new valuation price is higher than the original valuation price, the offeror shall then decide whether to proceed with the public tender offer observing the new price or withdraw the tender offer, in which case the Company will continue to be registered as a publicly-held company.\n\n## Preemptive Rights\n\nEach of our shareholders has a general preemptive right  to  subscribe  for  shares  or  convertible  securities  in  any  capital  increase,  in  proportion  to  its shareholding, except (i) in case of sale on a stock exchange or by public subscription, (ii) pursuant to an exchange for shares in a public offer for the acquisition of control, in accordance with the Brazilian Corporate Law, (iii) for subscription of shares in accordance with the special law for tax incentives, (iv) conversion of debentures and other securities into shares, since, in these cases, the preemptive right must be exercised when the security is issued, (v) in the event of the grant and exercise of any stock option to acquire or subscribe for shares of our capital stock; and (vi) in the context of a capital increase derived from merger, merger of shares and/or spin-off implemented according to Brazilian Corporation Law. A minimum period of 30 days following the publication of notice of the issuance of shares or convertible securities is allowed for exercise of the right, and the right is negotiable. However, according to our bylaws, our board of Directors can eliminate this preemptive right or reduce the 30-day period in case we issue debentures that are convertible into shares, warrants ( b\u00f4nus de subscri\u00e7\u00e3o ) or shares within the limits authorized by the bylaws and the Brazilian Corporate Law: (i) through a stock exchange or through a public offering or (ii) through an exchange of shares in a public offering to acquire control of another publicly-held company.\n\nYou may not be able to exercise the preemptive rights relating to the common shares underlying your ADSs unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective with respect to the shares to which the rights relate or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available and our ADS depositary determines to make the rights available to you. See 'Item 3. Key Information - Risk Factors -Holders of ADSs may be unable to exercise the preemptive rights relating to our shares underlying the ADSs.'\n\n## Right of Withdrawal\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law provides that, under certain circumstances, a shareholder has the right to withdraw its equity interest from the company and to  receive  payment  for  the  portion  of  shareholders'  equity  attributable  to  its  equity  interest.  Withdrawal  rights  may  be  exercised  by  dissenting  or  non-voting shareholders, if a vote of at least 50% of voting shares authorizes us:\n\n- \u00b7 to establish new shares or to disproportionately increase an existing class of preferred shares relative to the other classes of shares, unless such action is provided for or authorized by the bylaws;\n- \u00b7 to modify a preference, privilege or condition of redemption or amortization conferred on one or more classes of preferred shares, or to create a new class with greater privileges than the existing classes of preferred shares;\n- \u00b7 to reduce the mandatory distribution of dividends;\n- \u00b7 to merge with another company (including if we are merged into one of our controlling companies) or to consolidate, except as described in the fourth paragraph following this list;\n- \u00b7 to approve our participation in a centralized group of companies, as defined under the Brazilian Corporation Law, and subject to the conditions set forth therein, except as described in the fourth paragraph following this list;\n- \u00b7 to change our corporate purpose;\n- \u00b7 to terminate a state of liquidation of the corporation;",

In  those  cases,  the  30-day  term  is counted from the date the minutes of the special meeting are published. We would be entitled to reconsider any action giving rise to withdrawal rights within ten days following the expiration of such rights if the withdrawal of shares of dissenting shareholders would jeopardize our financial stability.\n\nThe  Brazilian  Corporation  Law  allows  companies  to  redeem  their  shares  at  their  economic  value,  subject  to  certain  requirements.  Since  our  bylaws currently  do  not  provide  that  our  shares  be  subject  to  withdrawal  at  their  economic  value,  our  shares  would  be  subject  to  withdrawal  at  their  book  value, determined on the basis of the last balance sheet approved by the shareholders. If the shareholders' meeting giving rise to withdrawal rights occurs more than 60 days after the date of the last approved balance sheet, a shareholder may demand that its shares be valued on the basis of a new balance sheet that is of a date within 60 days of such shareholders' meeting.\n\nPursuant  to  the  Brazilian  Corporation  Law,  in  events  of  consolidation,  merger, incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o  de  a\u00e7\u00f5es ,  participation  in  a  group  of  companies,  and acquisition of control of another company, the right to withdraw does not apply if the shares meet certain tests relating to liquidity and dispersal of the type or class of shares on the market. In such cases, shareholders will not be entitled to withdraw their shares if the shares are a component of a general securities index in Brazil or abroad admitted to trading on the securities markets, as defined by the CVM, and the shares held by persons unaffiliated with the controlling shareholder represent more than half of the outstanding shares of the relevant type or class.\n\n## Arbitration\n\nWe,  our  shareholders,  managers  and  members  of  the Audit  Committee,  whether  sitting  or  alternate  members,  if  any,  undertake  to  resolve,  through arbitration, before the Market Arbitration Chamber ( C\u00e2mara de Arbitragem do Mercado ),  pursuant to its regulations, any controversies that may arise between them, relating to or arising from their respective condition as an issuer, shareholder, administrator and/or member of the Audit Committee, in particular, of the provisions contained in Law No. 6,385/76, the Brazilian Corporations Law, our bylaws, in the rules issued by the National Monetary Council, by the Central Bank of Brazil and by the Brazilian Securities and Exchanges Commission ( CVM ), as well as in the other rules applicable to the operation of the capital markets in general, in addition to those contained in the Novo Mercado Rules, the other regulations of B3 and the Novo Mercado Listing Agreement.",

Exchange Controls\n\nThere  are  no  restrictions  on  ownership  of  our  common  shares  by  individuals  or  legal  entities  domiciled  outside  Brazil.  However,  the  right  to  convert dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of common shares into foreign currency and to remit such amounts outside Brazil is subject to exchange control restrictions and foreign investment legislation, which generally require, among other things, obtaining an electronic registration with the Central Bank of Brazil.\n\nUnder Resolution No. 4,373/2014, foreign investors may invest in almost all financial assets and engage in almost all transactions available in the Brazilian financial  and  capital  markets,  provided  that  some  requirements  are  fulfilled.  In  accordance  with  Resolution  No.  4,373/2014,  the  definition  of  foreign  investor includes individuals, legal entities, mutual funds and other collective investment entities that are domiciled or headquartered abroad.\n\nInvestors under Resolution No. 4,373/2014, from no favorable tax regime countries, who are not a Tax Haven Holder that does not impose income tax or in which the maximum income tax rate is lower than 20%, are entitled to favorable tax treatment. See 'Item 10.E - Taxation-Material Brazilian Tax Considerations.'\n\nResolution No. 1,927 provides for the issuance of depositary receipts in foreign markets in respect of shares of Brazilian issuers. An application was filed to have the ADSs approved by the Central Bank of Brazil and the CVM under Annex V, and we received final approval before the ADSs Offering.\n\nAn electronic registration, which replaced the amended Certificate of Registration, was issued in the name of the depositary with respect to the ADSs and is  maintained  by  the  Custodian  on  behalf  of  the  Depositary.  This  electronic  registration  was  carried  on  through  the  SISBACEN.  Pursuant  to  the  electronic registration, the Custodian and the Depositary are able to convert dividends and other distributions with respect to the common shares represented by the ADSs into foreign currency and remit the proceeds outside Brazil. In the event that a holder of ADSs exchanges the ADSs for common shares, the holder will be entitled to  continue to rely on the Depositary's electronic registration for only five business days after the exchange. Thereafter, a holder must seek to obtain its own electronic registration. Unless the common shares are held pursuant to Resolution No. 4,373/2014 by a duly registered investor or a holder of common shares, who applies for and obtains a new electronic registration, that holder may not be able to obtain and remit abroad U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies upon the disposition of the common shares, or distributions with respect thereto. In addition, if the foreign investor resides in a no favorable tax regime country or is not an investor registered pursuant to Resolution No. 4,373/2014, the investor will also be subject to less favorable tax treatment.\n\n## E. Taxation\n\n## Brazilian Tax Considerations\n\nThe following discussion contains a description of the material Brazilian income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by a holder which is non-resident or not domiciled in Brazil for Brazilian tax purposes (Non-Brazilian Holder). It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all Brazilian tax considerations that may be applicable to any particular Non-Brazilian Holder.\n\nThis summary is based upon tax laws of Brazil and administrative and judicial decisions as in effect on the date of this annual report, which are subject to changes (possibly with retroactive effect) and to differing interpretations. You should consult your own tax advisors as to the Brazilian tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and sale of our common shares or ADSs.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\nAlthough there is no treaty for the avoidance of double taxation between Brazil and the United States, the tax authorities of the two countries have been having discussions that may culminate in such a treaty. No assurance can be given, however, as to whether or when a treaty will enter into force or how it will affect the U.S. holders of our common shares or ADSs.\n\nFor purposes of Brazilian taxation, there are two types of Non-Brazilian Holders of common shares or ADSs: (a) Non-Brazilian Holders registered before the Central Bank of Brazil and the CVM to invest in Brazil in accordance with CMN Resolution No. 4,373/14 ('4,373 Holders'); and (b) other Non-Brazilian Holders, which include Non-Brazilian Holders who invest in Brazilian companies under Law 14.286/2021 and BCB Resolution No. 277 ('foreign direct investment'). As a general rule, 4,373/2014 Holders are subject to a favorable tax regime in Brazil, as described below.\n\nCMN Resolution  No.  4,373/2014  permits  foreign  investors,  defined  to  include  individuals,  legal  entities,  mutual  funds  and  other  collective  investment entities, domiciled or headquartered abroad to invest in almost all financial assets and to engage in almost all transactions available in the Brazilian financial and capital markets, provided that certain legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled. The foreign investors must (a) appoint at least one representative in Brazil with powers to perform actions relating to the foreign investment; (b) file the appropriate foreign investor registration form; (c) obtain the register as a foreign investor before the Brazilian securities commission; and (d) obtain the register of the foreign investment before the Central Bank of Brazil.\n\n## Taxation of Gains\n\nGains realized on the disposal of common shares are subject to income tax in Brazil, regardless of whether the sale or the disposal is made by a NonBrazilian Holder to a resident or person domiciled in Brazil. This is due to the fact that the common shares can be considered assets located in Brazil for purposes of Law No. 10,833/2003.\n\nAccording to our interpretation of the applicable law, capital gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder on the disposal of common shares sold on a Brazilian stock exchange (which includes a transaction carried out on the organized over-the-counter market) are:\n\n- \u00b7 exempt from income tax when realized by a Non-Resident Holder that (i) is a 4,373 Holder, and (ii) is not resident or domiciled in a country or location which is defined as a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as described below);\n- \u00b7 arguably subject to income tax at a 15% rate in the case of gains realized by (A) a Non-Brazilian Holder that (1) is not a 4,373 Holder and (2) is not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction; or by (B) a Non-Brazilian Holder that (1) is a 4,373 Holder and (2) is resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction; and\n- \u00b7 subject to income tax at a rate of up to 25% in the case of gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that is not a 4,373 Holder, and is resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction.\n\nAny other gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder on a sale or disposal of the shares that is not carried out on a Brazilian stock exchange are:\n\n- \u00b7 subject to income tax at the rate of 15% when realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that (i) is a 4,373 Holder and (ii) is not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below), although different interpretations may be raised to sustain the application of the progressive rates set forth by Law No. 13,259/2016;\n- \u00b7 subject to income tax at progressive rates ranging from 15% to 22.5% (15.0% for the part of the gain that does not exceed R$5.0 million, 17.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$5.0 million but does not exceed R$10.0 million, 20.0% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$10.0 million but does not exceed R$30.0 million and 22.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$30.0 million) in case of gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that (1) is not a 4,373 Holder and (2) is not resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below); and\n- \u00b7 subject to income tax at a 25% rate in case of gains realized by a Non-Brazilian Holder that is resident or domiciled in a Low or Nil Tax Jurisdiction (as defined below).",

Any gains realized by a Non-Resident Holder on the  sale  or  disposal  or  assignment  of  preemptive  rights  relating  to  our  common  shares  will  be  subject  to  Brazilian  income  tax  according  to  the  same  rules applicable to the sale or disposal of common shares (see above). Tax authorities may attempt to tax such gains even when sale or assignment of such rights takes place outside Brazil, based on the provisions of Law No. 10,833/03.\n\nThere is no assurance that the current preferential treatment for Non-Brazilian Holders of common shares under CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014 will continue in the future or that it will not be changed in the future. Reductions in the rate of tax provided for by Brazil's tax treaties do not apply to the tax on gains realized on sales or exchange of common shares.\n\n## Sale of ADSs by non-Brazilian holder to another non-Brazilian holder\n\nGains realized outside Brazil by a Non-Brazilian Holder on the disposal of ADSs should not be subject to Brazilian tax. As mentioned above, according to Law No. 10,833/2003 of December 2003, the disposal of assets located in Brazil by a Non-Brazilian Holder, whether to other Non-Brazilian Holder or Brazilian holders, may become subject to taxation in Brazil. Although we believe that the ADSs do not fall within the definition of assets located in Brazil for the purposes of Law no. 10,833, considering the general and unclear scope of it and the lack of definitive judicial court ruling to act as the leading case in respect thereto, we are unable to predict whether such understanding will ultimately prevail in the courts of Brazil.\n\nIn case the ADSs are considered assets located in Brazil, gains on disposal of ADSs by a Non-Brazilian Holder to a resident in Brazil or even to a NonBrazilian  resident  may  be  subject  to  income  tax  in  Brazil  according  to  the  rules  described  below  for ADSs  or  the  tax  rules  applicable  to  common  shares,  as applicable.\n\n## Exchange of ADSs for common shares\n\nAlthough there is no clear regulatory guidance, the withdrawal of ADSs in exchange for common shares is not subject to Brazilian income tax to the extent that, as described above, ADSs do not fall within the definition of assets located in Brazil for the purposes of Law No. 10,833/2003.\n\nUpon receipt of the underlying common shares in exchange for ADSs, Non-Brazilian Holders may also elect to register with the Central Bank the U.S. dollar amount of such preferred shares or common shares as a foreign portfolio investment under CMN Resolution No. 4,373/2014 or as a foreign direct investment under BCB Resolution No. 277.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Exchange of common shares for ADSs\n\nRegarding the deposit of common shares in exchange for ADSs, the difference between the acquisition cost of the common shares and the market price of the common shares may be subject to Brazilian income tax at progressive rates that may vary from 15.0% to 22.5% (15.0% for the part of the gain that does not exceed R$5.0 million, 17.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$5.0 million but does not exceed R$10.0 million, 20.0% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$10.0 million but does not exceed R$30.0 million and 22.5% for the part of the gain that exceeds R$30.0 million), except for Non-Brazilian Holders located in a Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction, which, in this case, would be subject to income tax at a flat rate of 25.0%. In some circumstances, there may be arguments to claim that this taxation is not applicable in the case of a Non-Brazilian Holder that is a 4,373 Holder and is not a resident of or domiciled in a Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\nAs a result of the tax legislation adopted on December 26, 1995, dividends based on profits generated after January 1, 1996, including dividends paid in kind, payable by us regarding common shares or ADSs, are exempt from withholding income tax. Dividends relating to profits generated prior to January 1, 1996 may be subject to Brazilian withholding income tax at varying rates, depending on the year the profits were generated.\n\nBeginning in 2008, the Brazilian accounting rules were significantly modified in order to align them with IFRS Accounting Standards. After the issuance of such new rules, a transitory tax regime ( regime tribut\u00e1rio de transi\u00e7\u00e3o ), or RTT, was created mainly to ensure neutrality of the new accounting rules in connection with the calculation and payment of corporate taxes on income. Thus, according to the RTT, Brazilian companies had, only for purposes of calculation of their taxable profit, to use the accounting rules and criteria that existed until December 2007.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  application  of  the  RTT,  the  accounting  profit  of  a  Brazilian  company  might  be  significantly  higher  (or  lower)  than  its  taxable  profit. Although  this  specific  matter  has  not  been  expressly  regulated  by  law,  the  Brazilian  tax  authorities  issued  a  normative  instruction  stating  that  the  amount  of dividends paid in excess of the profit of a company determined as per the accounting rules and criteria that existed until December 2007 should be subject to taxation.\n\nOn April 14, 2014, Law No. 12,973 was issued to, among other, terminate the Transitory Regime (RTT) and regulate how corporate taxable income should be assessed taking as a starting point the accounting profit calculated according to the new accounting rules introduced as from 2008. Such Law states that dividends related to all accounting profits generated between January 2008 and 31 December 2013 in excess of the established methods and criteria in force in December 31, 2007, are not subject to withholding tax, and does not integrate the calculation of income tax and social contribution. With reference to 2014, the law is not clear, but tax authorities state that dividends paid in excess of the profit of a company determined as per the accounting rules and criteria that existed until December 2007 should be subject to withholding income tax at the rate of 15%, or 25% if the Non-Brazilian Holder is domiciled in a country or location that does not impose income tax or where the maximum income tax rate is lower than 20% ('Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction'). As of 2015, in view of the termination of the RTT, there would be no differences between the accounting and the taxable profit, so that dividends generated since 2015 should be fully paid with no Brazilian withholding tax implications.\n\n## Interest Attributed to Shareholders' Equity\n\nAccording to Brazilian laws and our bylaws, we may opt to distribute income as interest attributed to shareholders' equity as an alternative to the payment of dividends.\n\nDistribution of an interest on equity charge attributed to shareholders' equity regarding common shares or ADSs as an alternative form of payment to shareholders, including non-Brazilian holders of common shares or ADSs, is subject to Brazilian withholding income tax at the rate of 15% or 25%, in case of a Nil or Low Taxation Jurisdiction holder.",

This interest is limited to the daily pro rata variation of the federal government's long-term interest rate, as determined by the Central Bank from time to time, and cannot exceed the greater of:\n\n- (a) 50% of net income (after the social contribution on net profits and before the provision for corporate income tax, and the amounts attributable to shareholders as interest on net equity) for the period with respect to which the payment is made; or\n- (b) 50% of the sum of retained earnings and earnings reserves as of the date of the beginning of the period with respect to which the payment is made.\n\n## Tax on foreign exchange transactions (IOF/Exchange)\n\nPursuant to Decree No. 6,306/2007, dated December 14, 2007, as amended, or Decree No. 6,306/2007, the conversion of Brazilian currency into foreign currency (e.g., for purposes of paying dividends and interest) and the conversion of foreign currency into Brazilian currency may be subject to the Tax on Foreign Exchange Transactions or IOF/Exchange. Currently, for most exchange transactions, the rate of IOF/Exchange is 0.38%. However, exchange transactions carried out for the inflow of funds in Brazil for investments in the Brazilian financial and capital market made by a foreign investor (including a Non-Resident Holder, as applicable) are subject to IOF/Exchange at a 0%. The IOF/Exchange rate will also be 0% for the outflow of funds from Brazil related to these types of investments, including payments of dividends and interest on shareholders' equity and the repatriation of funds invested in the Brazilian market.\n\n- On March 15, 2022, the Decree 10,997/2022 was published, establishing an immediate reduction of the IOF/Exchange for some transactions, such as the reduction of the rate applicable to short-term foreign loan operations to zero. In other cases, however, the rate reduction is gradual over the next years and it is expected that the IOF-Exchange rate will be decreased to zero for all transactions as of 2029.\n\nThe Brazilian government may increase the rate of the IOF/Exchange to a maximum of 25.0% of the amount of the foreign exchange transaction at any time, but such an increase would not apply retroactively.\n\n## Tax on transactions involving bonds and securities (IOF/Bonds Tax)\n\nThe IOF may also be imposed on any transactions involving bonds and securities, including those carried out on Brazilian futures and commodities stock exchanges. As a general rule, the rate of this tax for transactions involving common shares or ADSs is currently zero. The executive branch, also by a Presidential Decree, may increase the IOF rate by up to 1.5% per day, but only with respect to future transactions.\n\n## U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThis summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that are likely to be relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common shares or ADSs by a U.S. holder (as  defined  below). This  summary  is  based  on  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  of  1986  (the  Code),  as  amended,  its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this summary assumes the deposit agreements governing our shares and ADSs, and all other related agreements, will be performed in accordance with their terms.",

In particular, this summary is directed only to U.S. holders (as defined below) that hold our shares or ADSs as capital assets and does not address tax consequences to U.S. holders who may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market, financial institutions, life insurance companies, tax exempt entities, regulated investment entities, entities or arrangements that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or partners therein), holders that own or are treated as owning 10% or more of our shares, by vote or value, persons holding our shares or ADSs as part of a hedging or conversion transaction or a straddle, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, or U.S. expatriates. Moreover, this summary does not address state, local or non-U.S. taxes, the U.S. federal estate and gift taxes, or the Medicare contribution  tax  applicable  to  net  investment  income  of  certain  non-corporate  U.S.  holders,  or  alternative  minimum  tax  consequences  of  acquiring,  holding  or disposing of our shares or ADSs.\n\nAs used below, a 'U.S. holder' is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADSs that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) a citizen or individual resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to its source, or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust, and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.\n\nIf a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder of our shares or ADSs that is a partnership and partners in that partnership should consult their own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our shares or ADSs.\n\nYou should consult your own tax advisors about the consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our shares or ADSs, including the relevance to your particular situation of the considerations discussed below and any consequences arising under foreign, state, local or other tax laws.\n\n## Treatment of our ADSs for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes\n\nIn  general,  a  holder  of  our  ADSs  will  be  treated,  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes,  as  the  beneficial  owner  of  the  underlying  shares  that  are represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, except as specifically noted below, the tax consequences discussed below with respect to ADSs will be the same for our shares,  and  exchanges  of  our  shares  for ADSs  (or  vice  versa),  generally  will  not  result  in  the  realization  of  gains  or  losses  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax.  For purposes of the following summary, any reference to our shares shall be understood to also include reference to the ADSs, unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\nSubject to the discussion below under 'Item 10.E - Taxation-Passive Foreign Investment Company Status', the gross amount of any distribution of cash or property with respect to our shares or ADSs that is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) will generally be includible in your taxable income as ordinary dividend income on the day on which you receive the dividend, in the case of our shares, or the date the depositary receives the dividends, in the case of our ADSs, and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code. If such distribution exceeds the amount of the current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital (and reduction in tax basis) to the extent of your tax basis in the shares on which they are paid, and to the extent it exceeds that basis it will be treated as capital gain from the sale or exchange of the shares. We do not expect to maintain calculations of our earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. U.S. holders therefore should expect that distributions generally will be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",

A U.S. holder will have a tax basis in any distributed Brazilian currency equal to its U.S. dollar amount on the date of receipt, and any gain or loss realized on a subsequent sale, conversion or other disposition of the Brazilian currency generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss. If dividends paid in Brazilian currency are converted into U.S. dollars on the date they are received by a U.S. holder or the Depositary or its agent, as the case may be, the U.S. holder generally should not be required to recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the Brazilian currency. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the treatment of foreign currency gain or loss, if any, on any foreign currency received that is converted into U.S. dollars after it is received.\n\nThe U.S. dollar amount of dividends received by an individual with respect to our shares or ADSs will be subject to taxation at a preferred rate if the dividends  are  'qualified  dividends.'  Subject  to  certain  exceptions  for  short-term  positions,  dividends  paid  on  our  shares  or ADSs  will  be  treated  as  qualified dividends if:\n\n- \u00b7 the shares and ADSs on which the dividend is paid are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States; and\n- \u00b7 we were not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend was paid, and are not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC).\n\nOur ADSs are listed on the NYSE and our ADSs should qualify as readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States so long as they are  so  listed. As  described  in  more  detail  under  'Item  10.E  -  Taxation-Passive  Foreign  Investment  Company  Status,'  below,  based  on  our  audited  financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, we believe that we were not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to our 2023 and 2022 taxable years and do not expect to be a PFIC in our current taxable year. Given that the determination of PFIC status involves the application of complex tax rules, and that it is based on the nature of our income and assets from time to time, no assurances can be provided that we will not be considered a PFIC for the current (or any past or future) taxable year. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in light of their own particular circumstances.\n\nBecause our shares are not themselves listed on a U.S. exchange, dividends received with respect to our shares that are not represented by ADSs may not be treated as qualified dividends. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential availability of the reduced dividend tax rate in respect of our shares.\n\nSubject to generally applicable limitations and conditions, Brazilian dividend withholding tax paid at the appropriate rate applicable to the U.S. holder may be eligible for a credit against such U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability. These generally applicable limitations and conditions include new requirements recently  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  in  regulations  promulgated  in  December  2021  and  any  Brazilian  tax  will  need  to  satisfy  these requirements in order to be eligible to be a creditable tax for a U.S. holder. In the case of a U.S. holder that consistently elects to apply a modified version of these rules under recently issued temporary guidance and complies with specific requirements set forth in such guidance, the Brazilian tax on dividends will be treated as meeting the new requirements and therefore as a creditable tax. In the case of all other U.S. holders, the application of these requirements to the Brazilian tax on dividends is uncertain and we have not determined whether these requirements have been met. If the Brazilian dividend tax is not a creditable tax or the U.S. holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued in the same taxable year, the U.S. holder may be able to deduct the Brazilian  tax  in  computing  such  U.S.  holder's  taxable  income  for  U.S.  federal  income  tax  purposes.  Dividend  distributions  will  constitute  income  from  sources without the United States and, for U.S. holders that elect to claim foreign tax credits, generally will constitute 'passive category income' for foreign tax credit purposes.",

The  temporary  guidance  discussed  above  also  indicates  that  the  Treasury  and  the  IRS  are  considering proposing amendments to the December 2021 regulations and that the temporary guidance can be relied upon until additional guidance is issued that withdraws or modifies the temporary guidance. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their particular situations.\n\nU.S. holders that receive distributions of additional shares or rights to subscribe for our shares as part of a pro rata distribution to all our shareholders generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of the distributions, unless the U.S. holder has the right to receive cash or property, in which case the U.S. holder will be treated as if it received cash equal to the fair market value of the distribution.\n\n## Taxation of Dispositions of our Shares or ADSs\n\nSubject to the discussion below under 'Item 10.E - Taxation-Passive Foreign Investment Company Status,' if a U.S. holder realizes gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our shares or ADSs, that gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares or ADSs have been held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nA U.S. holder generally will not be entitled to credit any Brazilian tax imposed on the sale or other disposition of the shares against such U.S. holder's U.S. federal  income  tax  liability,  except  in  the  case  of  a  U.S.  holder  that  consistently  elects  to  apply  a  modified  version  of  the  U.S.  foreign  tax  credit  rules  that  is permitted  under  recently  issued  temporary  guidance  and  complies  with  the  specific  requirements  set  forth  in  such  guidance. Additionally,  capital  gain  or  loss recognized  by  a  U.S.  holder  on  the  sale  or  other  disposition  of  the  shares  generally  will  be  U.S.  source  gain  or  loss  for  U.S.  foreign  tax  credit  purposes. Consequently, even if the withholding tax qualifies as a creditable tax, a U.S. holder may not be able to credit the tax against its U.S. federal income tax liability unless such credit can be applied (subject to generally applicable conditions and limitations) against tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign sources. If the Brazilian tax is not a creditable tax, the tax would reduce the amount realized on the sale or other disposition of the shares even if the U.S. holder has elected to claim a foreign tax credit for other taxes in the same year. The temporary guidance discussed above also indicates that the Treasury and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to the December 2021 regulations and that the temporary guidance can be relied upon until additional guidance is issued that withdraws or modifies the temporary guidance. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foreign tax credit rules to their investment in, and disposition of, our shares or ADSs.\n\nIf a U.S. holder sells or otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs in exchange for currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the currency received at the spot rate on the date of sale or other disposition (or, if the shares or ADSs are traded on an established securities market at such time, in the case of cash basis and electing accrual basis U.S. holders, the settlement date). An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not elect to determine the amount realized using the spot exchange rate in effect on the settlement date will recognize foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the settlement date. A U.S. holder generally will have a tax basis in the currency received equal to the U.S. dollar value of the currency received at the spot rate in effect on the settlement date. Any currency gain or loss realized on the settlement date or the subsequent sale, conversion, or other disposition of the non-U.S. currency received for a different U.S. dollar amount generally will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss, and will not be eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains. If an accrual basis U.S. holder makes the election described in the first sentence of this paragraph, it must be applied consistently from year to year and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder should consult its own tax advisors regarding the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss realized with respect to any currency received in a sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs.\n\nDeposits and withdrawals of shares by U.S. holders in exchange for ADSs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.",

        "page_content": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Passive Foreign Investment Company Status\n\nSpecial U.S. tax rules apply to companies that are considered to be PFICs. We will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if, either:\n\n- \u00b7 75 percent or more of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or\n- \u00b7 the value of our assets (generally determined on the basis of a quarterly average) that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50 percent.\n\nFor this purpose, passive income generally includes dividends, interest, gains from certain commodities transactions, rents, royalties and the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets that produce passive income.\n\nWe believe, and the following discussion assumes, that we were not a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2022 and that, based on the present composition of our income and assets and the manner in which we conduct our business, we do not expect to be a PFIC in our current taxable year. However, the determination of whether we are a PFIC is a factual determination made annually, and our status could change depending, among other things, upon changes in the composition of our gross income and the relative quarterly average value of our assets. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will not be a PFIC in the current year or in future years. If we were a PFIC for any taxable year in which you hold our shares or ADSs, you (including certain indirect U.S. holders) will generally be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible imposition of ordinary income treatment for gains or 'excess distributions' (generally a distribution in excess of 125% of the average distributions received during the past three years or, if shorter, your holding period) that would otherwise be taxed as capital gains or dividends, along with an interest charge on gains or 'excess distributions' allocable to prior years in your holding period during which we were determined to be a PFIC regardless of whether we continued to be a PFIC in any subsequent year, unless you elect to mark your shares or ADSs to market for tax purposes on an annual basis. If we are deemed to be a PFIC for a taxable year, dividends on our shares would not constitute 'qualified dividends' subject to preferential rates of U.S. federal income taxation for non-corporate taxpayers. In addition, if we are deemed to be a PFIC for a taxable year, you would be subject to increased reporting requirements. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor as to our status as a PFIC and the tax consequences to you of such status.\n\n## Foreign Financial Asset Reporting\n\nCertain U.S. holders that own 'specified foreign financial assets' with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or US$75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required to file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on IRS Form 8938, with respect to such assets. 'Specified foreign financial assets' include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individuals living abroad and to certain  married  individuals.  Regulations  extend  this  reporting  requirement  to  certain  entities  that  are  treated  as  formed  or  availed  of  to  hold  direct  or  indirect interests  in  \"specified  foreign  financial  assets'  based  on  objective  criteria.  The  understatement  of  income  attributable  to  'specified  foreign  financial  assets'  in excess of US$5,000 extends the statute of limitations with respect to the tax return to six years after the return was filed. U.S. holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties. Holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of these rules, including the application of the rules to their particular circumstances.",

Backup withholding is not an additional tax.

As such, fluctuations in the exchange rate, especially with regards to the U.S. dollars, may impact our results.\n\nWe issue debt securities in the international markets as an important part of the capital structure that is also exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate. The  mitigation  of  these  risks  comes  from  our  own  exports,  which  creates  a  natural  hedge.  Furthermore,  we  enter  in  derivatives  transactions  in  the  financial markets, including using strategies with options, as a way to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of our income. The foreign exchange hedging strategy follows our financial policies.\n\nFor the net exposure of assets and liabilities in foreign currency see note 4.4.1. of our audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis - Foreign Exchange Exposure\n\nFor purposes of risk analysis, we use scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity that the variations in long and short positions, indexed in foreign currency, may suffer.  We  take  as  a  base  case  the  values  recognized  in  accounting  on  December  31,  2023  and,  from  there  onwards,  appreciations  and  depreciation  are simulated, between 25% and 50%, of the real compared to other foreign currencies. For the sensitivity analysis see notes 4.4.1.1. and 4.4.1.2. of our audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to  commodity  prices  reflected  primarily  in  the  sale  price  of  pulp  in  the  international  market.  Increases  and  decreases  in  production capacities in the global market, as well as the macroeconomic conditions may impact our operational results.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that prices will remain at levels that are beneficial to our results. We may use financial instruments to mitigate the sales price of part of the production, but in certain cases the employment of price protection for pulp may not be available.\n\nWe are also exposed to international oil prices, reflected in the logistical costs of transportation and commercialization.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, we held a long position in VLSFO (very-low sulfur fuel oil) and Brent Crude Oil in the notional amount of US$305.9 million to hedge its logistics costs.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis - Exposure to Commodity Prices\n\nTable of Contents\n\n|                               | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023        | December 31, 2023      |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n|                               | As of               | Effect on income         | Effect on income       |\n|                               | Probable            | Possible increase (+25%) | Remote increase (+50%) |\n|                               | (in millions of R$) | (in millions of R$)      | (in millions of R$)    |\n| Oil derivatives (Brent/VLSFO) | 19.1                | 331.8                    | 682.0                  |\n\n## Derivatives by Contract Type\n\nFor the open positions of derivatives negotiated in the over-the-counter market, grouped by class of asset and reference index as of December 31, 2023, 2022, see note 4.5. of our audited consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.",

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's Statutory Audit Committee, the Company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with and in compliance with the IFRS Accounting Standards.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  our  assets;  (b)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with and in compliance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2023,  is  based  on  the  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  Integrated  Framework  (2013),  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO).  Based  on  that  assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAudit  of  the  Effectiveness  of  Internal  Control  over  Financial  Reporting:  Our  independent  registered  public  accounting  firm,  PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda., has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report as of December 31, 2023, which is included herein.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

EXEMPTIONS FROM THE LISTING STANDARDS FOR AUDIT COMMITTEES\n\nUnder the listed company audit committee rules of the NYSE and the SEC, we must comply with Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, which requires that we establish an audit committee composed of members of the board of directors that meets specified requirements. Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(c)(3), a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee if the foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be separate from the full board, (ii) its members not be elected by management, (iii) no executive officer be a member of the body, and (iv) home country legal or listing provisions set forth standards for the independence of the members of the body. We believe that our statutory audit committee complies with these requirements, and we rely on the exemption provided by Rule 10A-3(c)(3) under the Exchange Act.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Significant Differences between our Corporate Governance Practices and NYSE Corporate Governance Standards\n\nWe are subject to the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. As a foreign private issuer, the standards applicable to us are considerably different than  the  standards  applied  to  U.S.  listed  companies.  Under  the  NYSE  rules,  we  are  required  to:  (i)  have  an  audit  committee  or  audit  board,  pursuant  to  an applicable  exemption  available  to  foreign  private  issuers,  that  meets  certain  requirements,  as  discussed  below,  (ii)  provide  prompt  certification  by  our  chief executive officer of any material noncompliance with any corporate governance rules, (iii) adopt a Clawback Policy under NYSE rules; and (iv) provide a brief description of the significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE corporate governance practice required to be followed by U.S. listed companies. The significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those required for U.S. listed companies follows below.\n\n## Majority of Independent Directors\n\nThe NYSE rules require that a majority of a company's board of directors must consist of independent directors. Independence is defined by various criteria, including the absence of a material relationship between the director and the listed company. Under Brazilian law, according to the provisions of the Novo Mercado, at least 20% or two of the members of our board of directors (whichever is the greater) must be independent directors, as defined under Brazilian law. Currently, our board of directors consists of nine members, four of which are independent members.\n\n## Executive Sessions\n\nNYSE  rules  require  that  the  non-management  directors  must  meet  at  regularly  scheduled  executive  sessions  without  management.  The  Brazilian Corporation Law does not have a similar provision. According to the Brazilian Corporation Law, up to one third of the members of a company's board of directors can be elected by management. There is no requirement under Brazilian law that our directors meet regularly in the absence of our executive officers. As a result, our directors do not typically meet in executive sessions .\n\n## Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors and governed by a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and detailing its responsibilities, which include, among others, identifying and selecting qualified board member nominees and developing a set of corporate governance principles applicable to a company. We are not required under applicable Brazilian law to have a nominating committee/corporate governance committee and the Brazilian law also does not require that this committee be composed entirely of independent directors, if created. We do have an Appointment and Compensation Committee governed by a written charter, which is an advisory committee of our board of directors composed of three members, two of which are independent. The purpose of such committee is (i) to propose to the board of directors compensation policies and guidelines for managers, members of the Audit Committee and other remunerated committees, subject to the legislation and regulations applicable to the bylaws; (ii) to evaluate and propose appointment of members to compose the Company's management positions, verifying and attesting their qualification to perform their activities, according to the regulations, policies and other rules to which the Company is subject or has voluntarily adopted.",

We are not required under applicable Brazilian law to have a compensation committee, although we have established an advisory committee, comprised of board members and independent members, to advise on certain of these matters. Under the Brazilian Corporation Law, the total amount available for compensation of our directors and executive officers and for profit sharing payments to our executive officers must be established by our shareholders at the annual general meeting. Our board of directors, based on recommendations and analysis of the compensation committee, is responsible for determining the compensation and profit-sharing of our executive officers, as well as the compensation of our board and committee members, which is established according to market standards and internal rules of compensation\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nUnder NYSE Rule 303A.06 and the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the SEC, domestic listed companies are required to have an audit committee consisting entirely of independent directors that otherwise complies with Rule 10A-3. In addition, a company's audit committee must have a written charter that addresses the matters outlined in NYSE Rule 303.A.06(c), have an internal audit function and otherwise fulfill the requirements of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3. Under the B3 listing rules for its Novo Mercado segment, we are required to have a 'statutory audit committee' that complies with the CVM rules. The statutory audit committee is an advisory committee of the board of directors, and provides assistance in matters involving accounting, internal controls, financial reporting and compliance. The statutory  audit  committee  also  recommends to our board of directors the appointment of our independent auditors and evaluates the effectiveness of internal financial  and  legal  compliance  controls. The  statutory  audit  committee  is  not,  however,  equivalent  to  or  comparable  with  a  U.S.  audit  committee.  Pursuant  to Exchange Act Rule 10A-3(c)(3), which provides for an exemption under the rules of the SEC regarding the audit committees of listed companies, a foreign private issuer is not required to have an audit committee equivalent to or comparable with a U.S. audit committee if the foreign private issuer has a body established and selected pursuant to home country legal or listing provisions expressly requiring or permitting such a body, and if the body meets the requirements that (i) it be composed of one or more members of the board of directors and one or more members that are not also members of the board of directors, (ii) its members not be elected  by  management,  (iii)  no  executive  officer  be  a  member  of  the  body,  and  (iv)  home  country  legal  or  listing  provisions  set  forth  standards  for  the independence  of  the  members  of  the  body.  See  'Item  6.A  -  Directors  and  Senior  Management  - Audit  Committee'  for  a  description  of  our  statutory  audit committee.\n\n## Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\n\nNYSE rules  require  that  shareholders  be  given  the  opportunity  to  vote  on  all  equity  compensation  plans  and  material  revisions  thereto,  with  limited exceptions. Under Brazilian corporate law, shareholders must approve all stock option plans. In addition, any issuance of new shares that exceeds our authorized share capital is subject to shareholder approval.\n\n## Corporate Governance Guidelines\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. We have a Corporate Governance Policy which exists to guarantee that principles of transparency, ethics, accountability, compliance with the law, and respect are always assured for everyone, regardless of whether they are shareholders, employees, stakeholders, or other persons related to Suzano. Moreover, it is used as the basis for the Company's business models, policies, and guidelines. We also observe the requirements of the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) and we adhere to the Novo Mercado listing standards of the B3 .",

Applicable Brazilian law does not have a similar requirement. We believe our code substantially addresses the matters required to be addressed by the NYSE rules. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Conduct has been filed as Exhibit 11.1 to this annual report. For a further discussion of our Code of Ethics and Conduct, see 'Item 16.B - Code of Ethics and Conduct.'\n\n## Internal Audit Function\n\nNYSE rules require that listed companies maintain an internal audit function to provide management and the audit committee with ongoing assessments of the  company's  risk  management  processes  and  system  of  internal  control.  Brazilian  law  does  not  require  that  companies  maintain  an  internal  audit  function. However, as an issuer on the New York Stock Exchange, we maintain an internal audit function. Our internal audit function is under the supervision of our statutory audit  committee  and  is  responsible  for  independently  evaluating  corporate,  forest  and  industrial  processes,  verifying  compliance  with  standards  and  policies adopted by us and analyzing possible cases of irregularities, such as fraud, bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest, insider information, embezzlement and damage to property.\n\nThe internal audit considers a risk-based approach and the views of our management and members of our audit committee. The audit results are reported to our chief executive officer and our statutory audit committee.\n\n## Clawback Policy\n\nThe issuer must adopt and comply with a written Recovery Policy providing that the issuer will recover reasonably promptly the amount of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation in the event that the issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the issuer with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. We have adopted a Clawback Policy that complies with the requirements of Section 303A.14 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.\n\n## ITEM 16.H. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## ITEM 16.

Our processes and policies are periodically reviewed to cover relevant risks.\n- \u00b7 We  utilize  components  in  our  information  security  and  cybersecurity  framework  such  as  multi-factor  authentication,  firewalls,  antivirus  software, vulnerability and penetration testing, among others.\n- \u00b7 Additionally, we collaborate with other areas of the Company, encompassing those responsible for day-to-day Information Security and Cybersecurity matters, including our Information Security team, Legal, Audit, Human Resources, and Corporate.\n- \u00b7 We frequently conduct training and awareness campaigns on information security and cybersecurity so that everyone receives guidance and can identify and report information security events or incidents, both in the corporate and industrial environments. These actions are intended to promote familiarity  with  our  Information  Security  Policy.  We  also  leverage  internal  communications  to  raise  awareness  and  conduct  phishing  simulation exercises.\n- \u00b7 We  regularly  review,  test,  and  update  our  information  security  and  cybersecurity  processes  by  conducting  penetration  testing,  vulnerability assessments, and attack simulations. Measures are implemented to deter, prevent, detect, and respond to unauthorized activities in our systems.\n\nWe annually conduct assessments of cybersecurity controls through independent consulting firms, which contribute to the evolution of the maturity on the subject. The results of these assessments are shared with the executive leadership, and relevant points are addressed throughout the year.\n\nOur  information  security  risk  management  aims  to  identify,  analyze,  evaluate,  and  treat  all  of  our  information  security  risks,  as  a  continuous  and measurable process. Relevant information security risks are treated so that they are mitigated, avoided, or accepted. When mitigating, we seek to reduce the likelihood  of  damage  to  our  assets  and  business  impact  whenever  possible.  Information  security  risks  are  periodically  reported  to  the  Information  Security Management, responsible Head, and Company Senior Management, as well as relevant Information Security Incidents.\n\nOur  business  strategy,  operational  results,  and  financial  situation  have  not  been  materially  affected  by  information  security  risk  or  incident,  including previous information security incidents. We cannot provide assurance that they will not be affected in the future by such risks and any future incidents.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Head of Technology\n\nThe Head of Technology is primarily responsible for overseeing cybersecurity threat-related risks through the specific Cybersecurity management, and always connects with the Company's corporate risks. The Head of Technology has 30 years of experience in information technology, business management, operations  and  logistics  acquired  through  the  leadership  of  projects  and  in  different  types  of  industries  such  as  consumer  goods,  electronics,  metallurgy, steelmaking, and petrochemicals during 16 years of consulting, and 14 years at a global mining company.\n\nAt  Suzano,  she  leads  a  robust  Information  Technology  team,  where  one  of  the  managements  is  responsible  for  Cybersecurity.  In  the  position  of Cybersecurity Manager, we have a leader with expertise in the subject and over 13 years of experience in Cybersecurity, having led the topic in various industries.\n\nTo fulfill  this  responsibility,  it  is  equipped  with  information  from  established  information  security  processes  and  controls,  periodically  reporting  strategic indicators to the security committee, and to the audit and executive committees as requested.",

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.",

A Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## \u00b7 Valuation of biological assets\n\nAs described in Notes 3.2.15 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's consolidated biological assets balance as of December 31, 2023, of BRL 18,278,582 thousand, are measured at fair value less costs necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use or sale. The fair value is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model. Management's cash flow projections included significant judgments and assumptions including gross average sale price of eucalyptus in different regions and the average annual growth (IMA) of biological assets.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of biological assets is a critical audit matter are (i) there was a high degree of auditor subjectivity in applying our procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the biological assets due to the significant amount of judgment required by management when developing these estimates; (ii) significant audit effort was required in assessing the significant assumptions relating to average annual growth (IMA) and gross average sale price of eucalyptus in different regions; and (iii) professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained regarding the estimated discount cash flow model and discount rate.",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the completeness of data and the model used to measure the fair value of the biological assets. Our procedures also included testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, related to the average annual growth (IMA) and the gross average eucalyptus sale price. In evaluating management's assumptions relating to average annual growth (IMA) and gross average eucalyptus sale price involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering; (i) the consistency with external market and industry data; (ii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and (iii) the disclosure requirements established by the accounting standard were met. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's discounted cash flow model and the discount rate.\n\n## \u00b7 Goodwill impairment test - Pulp Cash-Generating Unit\n\nAs described in Notes 3.2.18 and 16.1 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill associated with the Pulp Cash-Generating Unit (\"CGU\") as of December 31, 2023, of BRL 7,897,051 thousand, arose from Fibria acquisition in January 2019. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the value in use of the CGU to its carrying amount, including the goodwill. Value in use is estimated by management using a discounted cash flow model. Management's cash flow projections for Pulp CGU included significant judgments and assumptions relating to net average pulp prices and the discount rate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment test of Pulp CGU is a critical audit matter are there was the significant judgment by management when developing the value in use measurement for the CGU. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management's cash flow projections and the significant assumptions net average pulp prices and discount rate. In addition, professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained regarding the estimated discounted cash flow model and discount rate.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment test, including controls over the valuation of the Company's Pulp CGU. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the value in use estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, related to the net average pulp prices and the discount rate. Evaluating management's assumptions relating to net average pulp prices involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering; (i) the current and past performance of the CGU; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit; (iv) assess and evaluate the objectivity, competence and capacity of the experts engaged by management in developing the value in use measurement of the CGU. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company's discounted cash flow model and the discount rate.",

The Company recognizes liabilities in the consolidated financial statements for the resolution of pending litigation when management determines that a loss is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. No liability for an estimated loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes when, after assessing the information available, (i) management concludes that it is not probable that a loss will be incurred in any of the pending litigation; or (ii) management is unable to estimate the loss for any of the pending matters.\n\nThe main consideration for determining that performing procedures relating to judicial liabilities relating to tax, social security and uncertainty over income tax treatments is a critical audit matter is the use of significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss for each claim can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in evaluating management's assessment of the loss contingencies associated with litigation claims.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's evaluation of tax and social security litigation claims and uncertainty over income tax treatments, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management's assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company's litigation contingency disclosures. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the likelihood of loss being incurred.\n\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Auditores Independentes Ltda.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.",

Major events in the year\n\n## 1.2.1. Effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine, and Middle East conflict\n\nThe Company has continuously monitored the impacts of the current war between Russia and Ukraine, and the Middle East conflict, both direct and indirect, on society, the economy and markets (global and domestic), with the objective of evaluating possible impacts and risks for the business.\n\nThe Company's assessment has covered five main areas:\n\n- (i) Personnel:  Suzano  has  local  employees  and  facilities  in  the  city  of  Rehovot  in  Israel,  through  its  subsidiary,  FuturaGene  Israel  Ltd.  The  Company continuously monitors the situation.\n- In the context of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Suzano does not have employees or facilities of any kind in locations related to the conflict.\n- (ii) Supply Chain: the Company did not identify any short-term or long-term risk of possible interruptions or shortages of materials for its industrial and forestry activities. So far, the only effects observed have been greater volatility in commodities and energy prices.\n- (iii) Logistics:  internationally,  there  was  no  material  change  in  the  Company's  logistical  operations,  with  all  the  routes  used  remaining  substantially unchanged and the moorings in the planned locations being maintained. At the domestic level, no changes in logistical flows were identified.\n- (iv) Commercial: to date, the Company has continued with its transactions as planned, maintaining service to its customers in all its sectors of activity. Sales to a few customers located in Russia were suspended, without any significant financial impact.\n- (v) Continuity of operations: The conflict in Israel may result in disruptions to the biotechnology research and development operations of FuturaGene Israel Ltd.",

Cerrado Project\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the realization of the Cerrado Project, which consists of building a pulp production mill in the municipality of Ribas do Rio Pardo, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nThe plant will have an estimated nominal capacity of 2,550,000 tons of eucalyptus pulp production per year, with an estimated period for starting operations in the first semester of 2024. The total investment is R$22,200,000, with substantial payments during the years of 2021 to 2025.\n\n## 1.2.3. Acquisition of tissue business in Brazil\n\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company acquired the totality of the quotas held by Kimberly-Clark Brasil Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio de Produtos de Higiene Ltda. ('KC Brasil') in MMC Brasil  Ind\u00fastria  e  Com\u00e9rcio  Ltda  ('MMC  Brasil'),  located  in  Mogi  das  Cruzes  (S\u00e3o  Paulo),  for  the  consideration  of  US$212,029  million  (equivalent  to R$1,072,657) paid in cash ('Transaction'). On September 15, 2023, Suzano was reimbursed in the amount of R$11,939 due to variations on the closing balance related to working capital, cash and estimated value of inventory which results with an adjusted total purchase consideration of R$1,060,718.\n\nMMC Brasil had no operations until the contribution made by KC Brasil as a result of the carve out carried out in May 25, 2023 of the assets related to the business of manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling of tissue products, including toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, tissues, as well as other paper products in Brazil, including ownership of the brand 'NEVE' of KC Brasil.\n\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price:\n\n| Total purchase consideration (full payment on closing)       | 1,072,657   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Price Adjustment (working capital)                           | (11,939)    |\n| Final total purchase consideration (full payment on closing) | 1,060,718   |\n| Book value of Shareholders' Equity of MMC Brasil             | 587,226     |\n| Fair value adjustment                                        |             |\n| Inventories  (1)                                             | 7,120       |\n| Property, plant and equipment  (2)                           | 105,858     |\n| Trademark and patents  (3)                                   | 189,655     |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                             | 889,859     |\n| Goodwill  (4)                                                | 170,859     |",

Federal Supreme Court ('STF') decision - Effectiveness of final and unappealable tax decisions\n\nOn February 8, 2023, the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil concluded the judgments of Items 881 and 885, which discussed the effects of res judicata. The Company is not a party to any litigation related to a tax not being collected due to a past decision considered unappealable, therefore, the Company has no material adjustment due to the decision.\n\n## 1.2.5. Treasury shares cancelled\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the Board of Directors decided to cancel 37,145,969 common shares, with an average cost of R$40.84 (forty reais and eighty-four cents) per share, in the amount of R$1,517,224, that were being held in treasury, without changing the share capital and against the balances of available profit reserves. After the cancellation of shares, the share capital of R$9,269,281 is now divided into 1,324,117,615 common shares, all nominative, book-entry and without par value.\n\n## 1.2.6. Biomas\n\nOn September 5, 2022, Biomas Servi\u00e7os Ambientais, Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o e Carbono Ltda. ('Biomas') was initially established by Suzano S.A.\n\n- On November 12, 2022, Suzano in partnership with Ita\u00fa Unibanco S.A, Marfrig Global Foods S.A., Rabobank Foundational Investments B.B., Santander Corretora de Seguros, Investimentos e Servi\u00e7os S.A. and Vale S.A., announced an alliance during an event held at the Climate Conference, COP27, in Egypt, for the creation of a company focused entirely to forest restoration, conservation and preservation activities in Brazil.\n\nAfter the transformation of Biomas into a joint venture, Suzano, together with Marfrig, Rabobank and Vale, made a commitment to invest R$20,000 each partner, in accordance to the terms of the respective investment agreements on February 27, 2023, once the conditions precedent and closing acts established in said agreements were fulfilled. Ita\u00fa and Santander made their respective capital contributions on March 21, 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the amount of R$30,000 (R$5,000 for each partner) was fully paid with a remaining balance of R$90,000 (R$15,000 for each partner) to be paid.\n\nWith the above investments, each company now holds 16.66% of equity interest at Biomas.\n\n## 1.2.7. Interest on own capital\n\nOn  December  1,  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  distribution  of  interest  on  equity  in  the  total  gross  amount  of  R$1,500,000,  at  the  ratio  of  BRL 1.163375077 per share, considering the number of 'ex-treasury' shares at the date of the distribution, as remuneration based on the profit shown in the balance sheet dated September 30, 2023.",

Income tax in the amount of R$190,119, was withheld and paid in December 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the interest on own capital declared herein was attributed to the minimum mandatory dividend for the 2023 fiscal year and deducted from the amount declared by the Ordinary General Meeting, to be held in 2024, in accordance with statutory and legal provisions. (Note 25.2).\n\n## 1.2.8. Tax reform consumption\n\nOn December 20, 2023, Constitutional Amendment ('EC') no. 132 was enacted, which establishes the Tax Reform ('Reform') on consumption. Several topics, including the rates of new taxes, are still pending regulation via infraconstitutional legislation, in particular Complementary Laws ('LC'), which must be forwarded for evaluation by the National Congress within 180 days.\n\nThe Reform model is based on a VAT (Value Added Tax) divided into two competences ('dual VAT'), one federal (Contribution on Goods and Services - CBS) and one subnational (Tax on Goods and Services - IBS), which will replace the PIS, COFINS, ICMS and ISS taxes.\n\nA Selective Tax ('IS') was also created - under federal jurisdiction, which will apply to the production, extraction, commercialization or import of goods and services that are harmful to health and the environment, under the terms of LC.\n\nThere will be a transition period between the years 2026 and 2033, in which the two tax systems - old and new - will coexist. The impacts of the Reform on the calculation  of  the  aforementioned  taxes,  from  the  beginning  of  the  transition  period,  will  only  be  fully  known  upon  effective  regulation  via  infraconstitutional legislation. Consequently, there is no effect of the Reform on the financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## 1.2.9. Forestry assets acquisition\n\nOn December 23, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreements for the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of the companies Timber VII SPE S.A. and Timber XX SPE S.A., owned by BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, LLC.\n\nThe price to be paid in cash for these acquisitions is R$1,826,000 and is subject to usual adjustments in operations of this nature. Additionally, the price will be converted to dollars if the closing occurs after March 31, 2024. This transaction is subject to the approval of the Brazilian antitrust authorities ('CADE') and other usual conditions precedent for this type of deal. The transaction will be accounted for once the conditions for closing are fulfilled.",

BASIS OF PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  issued  by  the International Accounting Standards Board ('IFRS Accounting Standards') and disclose all the applicable significant information related to the financial statements, which is consistent with the information utilized by Management in the performance of its duties.\n\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are expressed in thousands of Brazilian Reais ('R$'), as well as the amounts of other currencies disclosed in the financial statements, when applicable, were also expressed in thousands, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Management to make judgments, use estimates and adopt assumptions in the process of applying accounting practices, which can affect the disclosed amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities. However, the uncertainty inherent in these judgements, assumptions and estimates could result in material adjustments to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities in future periods. The accounting practices requiring a higher level of judgment, and those which are more complex, as well as areas in which assumptions and estimates are significant, are disclosed in Note 3.2.34.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  on  a  historical  costs  basis,  considering  the  historical  cost  as  a  value  basis  and  adjusted  to  reflect  the attributed cost of land and buildings on the date of transition to IFRS Accounting Standards, except for the following material items recognized:\n\n- (i)        Derivative and non-derivative financial instruments measured at fair value;\n- (ii)     Share-based payments and employee benefits measured at fair value; and\n- (iii)    Biological assets measured at fair value;\n\nThe material accounting policies applied to the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are presented in Note 3.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the going concern assumption.\n\n## 3.    SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the information of Suzano and its subsidiaries on the same base date (except for associates Ensyn and Spinnova), as well as in accordance with consistent accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe accounting policies have been consistently applied to all of the consolidated companies.\n\nThere was no change in the policies and methods for calculating estimates, except for the new accounting policies presented in Note 3.1, adopted from January 1, 2023.",

New accounting policies and changes in accounting policies adopted\n\nThe new standards and interpretations issued, until the issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements, are described below.\n\n## 3.1.1. Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements - Disclosure of Accounting Policies (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023)\n\nThe amendments change the requirements in IAS 1 with regard to  the  disclosure  of  accounting  policies. The  amendments  replace  all  instances  of  the  term 'significant accounting policies' with 'material accounting policy information'. Accounting policy information is material if, considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that the primary users of the financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\nThe  supporting  paragraphs  in  IAS  1  are  also  amended  to  clarify  that  accounting  policy  information  that  relates  to  immaterial  transactions,  other  events  or conditions is immaterial, and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material.\n\nThe Company assessed the content of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.2. Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023)\n\nThe  amendments  replace  the  definition  of  a  change  in  accounting  estimates  with  a  definition  of  accounting  estimates.  Under  the  new  definition,  accounting estimates are 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'. The definition of a change in accounting estimates was deleted. However, the Board retained the concept of changes in accounting estimates in the Standard through the following clarifications:\n\n- (i) A change in accounting estimates that results from new information or new developments does not constitute the correction of an error\n- (ii) The  effects  of  a  change  in  an  input  or  a  measurement  technique  used  to  develop  an  accounting  estimate  represent  changes  in  accounting estimates if they do not result from the correction of prior period errors\n\nThe Company assessed the content of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.3. Amendments to IAS 12 - Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction (applicable for annual periods beginning on/or after January 1, 2023)\n\nThe  amendments  introduce  a  further  exception  to  the  initial  recognition  exemption.  Under  the  amendments,  an  entity  may  not  apply  the  initial  recognition exemption for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nDepending  on  the  applicable  tax  law,  equal  taxable  and  deductible  temporary  differences  may  arise  from  the  initial  recognition  of  an  asset  and  liability  in  a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit. For example, this may arise upon the recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset, applying IFRS 16 at the commencement date of a lease.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period, an entity recognized:\n\n- (i) A deferred tax asset (to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized) and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with:\n- \u00b7 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities and the corresponding amounts recognized as part of the cost of the related asset.\n- (ii) The cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or another component of equity, as appropriate) at that date.\n\nThe Company assessed the content of this pronouncement and did not identify any impacts.\n\n## 3.1.4. Amendment to IAS 12 - Taxes on Profit - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules\n\nIn December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') released of the Pillar Two model, to reform international corporate taxation to ensure that multinational economic groups, covered by such regulations, contribute an effective minimum tax at the rate 15% on profit. Each country's effective profit tax rate, as calculated by this model, is called the GloBE (Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules) effective tax rate. These rules await approval in the local legislation of each country.\n\nIn  May  2023,  the  International Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  scope  changes  to  IAS  12  -  Income  Taxes,  aiming  to  grant  a  temporary  exemption  in  the accounting for deferred taxes resulting from enacted or substantially enacted legislation relating to the implementation of OECD Pillar Two.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are currently in the process of evaluating the impact on the implementation of Pillar Two rules and the calculation of GloBE revenue.\n\n## 3.2. Accounting policies adopted\n\n## 3.2.1. Consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial information of Suzano and its subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2023 (except for associates Ensyn and Spinnova), and in accordance with consistent accounting practices and policies. The Company consolidates all subsidiaries over which it has direct or indirect control, that is, when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns on the basis of its investment with the subsidiary, and has the capacity and ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary.\n\nAdditionally,  all  transactions  and  balances  between  Suzano  and  its  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint  ventures  are  eliminated  in  the  consolidated  financial statements, as well as unrealized gains or losses arising from these transactions, net of tax effects. Non-controlling interests are highlighted.",

Subsidiaries\n\nThese include all entities for which the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally through a majority of voting rights. The Company controls an entity when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns on its investment in the investee, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained and de-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.\n\n## 3.2.3. Joint operations\n\nThese include all entities for which the Company maintains contractually established control over its economic activity, and exists only when the strategic, financial and operational decisions regarding the activity requiring the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the balance of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses are recognized proportionally to the interest in joint operations.\n\n## 3.2.4. Associated and joint ventures\n\nThese include all entities initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter for the equity method, being increased or reduced from its interest in the investee's income after the acquisition date.\n\nIn the investments in associates, the Company must have significant influence, which means the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, without having control or joint control over those policies. In investments in joint ventures, there is a contractually agreed sharing of control through an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities requiring the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn relation to the associates Ensyn and Spinnova, the equity is measured based on the latest available information and does not have a material impact on the consolidated  financial  statements  and,  if  any  significant  event  had  occurred  up  to  December  31,  2023,  it  would  be  adjusted  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## 3.2.5. Translation of financial statements into the functional and presentation currency\n\nThe Company defined that, for all its wholly owned subsidiaries, the functional and presentation currency is the Brazilian Real, except for investments in associates abroad related to Ensyn Corporation, F&E Technologies LLC, Spinnova, Woodspin and Celluforce, with functional currencies other than the Real, the accumulated gains or losses of which affect the conversion of the financial statements, which are recorded in other comprehensive income, in equity.\n\nThe individual financial information of each of the subsidiaries, included in the consolidated financial statement, are prepared in the local currency in which the subsidiary operates and are translated into the Company's functional and presentation currency.",

Transactions and balances in foreign currency\n\nThese are translated using the following criteria:\n\n- (i) Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at year-end;\n- (ii) Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the historical rate of the transaction;\n- (iii) Revenue and expenses are translated based on monthly average rate; and\n- (iv) The cumulative effects of gains or losses upon translation are recognized in the other comprehensive income.\n\nThe  cumulative  translation  adjustment  ('CTA')  arising  from  the  translation  of  a  foreign  operation  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  are reclassified from equity to profit or loss at the disposal of the operations. The total or partial disposal of interest in wholly-owned subsidiaries occurs through sale or dissolution, of all or part of operation.\n\n## 3.2.6. Hyperinflationary economies\n\nEntities  based  in  Argentina,  a  country  considered  to  have  a  hyperinflationary  economy,  are  subject  to  the  requirements  of  IAS  29  -  Financial  Reporting  in Hyperinflationary  Economies.  Non-monetary  items,  as  well  as  income  and  expenses,  are  adjusted  by  the  changes  in  the  inflation  index  between  the  initial recognition and the closing date, so the balances are stated at their current value.\n\nHowever, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, based in Argentina, has the Real as its functional currency, and therefore is not considered an entity with a hyperinflationary currency, and does not present its individual financial statements in accordance with IAS 29 - Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies. The financial statements are presented at historical cost.\n\n## 3.2.7. Business combinations\n\nThese are accounted for using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the acquirer. The cost of an acquisition is the sum of the consideration paid, evaluated based on the fair value at the acquisition date, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquirer's net assets.  The  costs  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  are  recorded  as  expenses  when  they  are  incurred,  except  for  costs  related  to  the  issuance  of  debt instruments or equity instruments, which are presented as reductions in debt or equity, respectively.\n\nIn a business combination, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are evaluated in order to classify and allocate them, assessing the terms of the agreement, the economic circumstances and other conditions at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost, net of any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill recognized in a business combination, as from the acquisition date, is allocated to each of the Company's cash generating units.\n\nGains on an advantageous purchase are recognized immediately in the result. The borrowing costs are recorded in the income statement as they are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the investments defined based on the equity method, investments are initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted for the recognition of changes in the Company's share of the acquirer's Shareholders' equity as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is measured and segregated from the carrying amount of the investment. Other intangible assets identified in the transaction shall be allocated in proportion to the interest acquired by the Company, based on the difference between the carrying amounts recorded in the acquired entity and its fair value assets, which may be amortized.\n\n## 3.2.8. Segment information\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that carries out business activities from which it can obtain revenue and incur expenses. The operating segments reflect how the Company's management reviews the financial information used to make decisions. The Company's management has identified two reportable segments, which meet the quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements. The segments identified for disclosure mainly represent sales channels.\n\n## 3.2.9. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nInclude cash on hand, bank deposits and highly liquid short-term investments with maturities, upon acquisition, of 90 days or less, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 3.2.10. Financial instruments\n\n## 3.2.10.1.Classification\n\nFinancial instruments are classified based on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired, as set forth below:\n\n- (i) Amortized cost;\n- (ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income; and\n- (iii) Fair value through profit or loss.\n\nRegular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date, meaning the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial instruments are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flow from the investments have expired or have been transferred, substantially, all of the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## 3.2.10.1.1. Financial instruments measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial instruments held by the Company: (i) in order to receive their contractual cash flow and not to sell to realize a profit or loss; and (ii) whose contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flow that exclusively represents payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Any changes are recognized under financial income (expenses) in the income statement.",

Financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income are financial assets held by the Company: (i) either to receive their contractual cash flow through sale with the realization of a profit or loss; and (ii) whose contractual terms give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows constituting, exclusively, repayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. In addition, this category includes investments in equity instruments where, upon initial recognition, the Company elected to present subsequent changes in its fair value within other comprehensive income. Any changes are recognized under net financial income (expenses) in the income statement, except for the fair value of investments in equity instruments, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nIncludes the balance presented in Note 14.1 as 'Other investments evaluated at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## 3.2.10.1.3. Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. Any changes are recognized  within  financial  income  (expenses)  in  the  income  statement  for  non-derivative  financial  instruments  and  for  financial  derivative  instruments  within income from derivative financial instruments.\n\nThis  category  includes  the  balance  of  marketable  securities,  classified  as  financial  assets  financial  and  derivative  financial  instruments,  including  embedded derivatives, stock options, classified as financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## 3.2.10.2.Impairment of financial assets\n\n## 3.2.10.2.1. Financial instruments measured at amortized cost\n\nAnnually, the Company assesses whether there is evidence that a financial asset is impaired. A financial is impaired only if there is evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flow of the financial asset that can be estimated reliably.\n\nThe criteria the Company uses to determine whether there is evidence of an impairment loss includes:\n\n- (i) Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or debtor;\n- (ii) Defaults on or late payment of interest or principal under the agreement;\n- (iii) Where the Company, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty, grants to the borrower a concession that a lender would not otherwise consider;\n- (iv) It becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization;\n- (v) The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; and\n- (vi) Observable data indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flow from a portfolio of financial assets after the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the portfolio.",

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThe Company periodically evaluates, when measuring fair value, whether there is evidence that a financial asset is impaired.\n\nFor such financial assets, a significant or prolonged decrease in the fair value of the security below its cost is evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists, an impairment loss measured at the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income, shall be recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 3.2.11. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative agreement is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recorded within the results of derivative financial instruments in the income statement.\n\nEmbedded derivatives in non-derivative main contracts are required to be separated when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the respective main contracts, and these are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nNon-option embedded derivatives are separated from the respective main contracts in accordance with the stated or implied substantive terms, so they have a zero fair value upon initial recognition.\n\n## 3.2.12. Trade accounts receivable\n\nThese are recorded at their invoiced amounts, in the normal course of the Company's business, adjusted for exchange rate variations where denominated in foreign currency and, if applicable, net of expected credit losses.\n\nThe Company applies an aging-based provision matrix with appropriate groupings for its portfolio. When necessary, based on individual analyses, the provision for expected losses is supplemented.\n\nThe Company examines the maturity of receivables on a monthly basis and identifies those customers with overdue balances, assessing the specific situation of each client, including the risk of loss, the existence of contracted insurance, letters of credit, collateral and the customer's financial situation. In the event of default, collection attempts are made, which include direct contact with customers and collection efforts through third parties. Should these efforts prove unsuccessful, legal measures are considered, and expected credit losses are recognized. The notes are written off from the credit expected loss when Management considers that they are not recoverable after taking all appropriate measures to collect them.",

Inventories\n\nThese are evaluated at the average acquisition or formation cost of the finished products, net of recoverable taxes, not exceeding their net realizable value.\n\nFinished products and work-in-process consist of raw materials, direct labor, production costs, freight, storage and general production expenses, which are related to the processes required to make the products available for sale.\n\nImports in transit are presented at the cost incurred up to the balance sheet date.\n\nRaw materials derived from biological assets are measured based on their fair value, less costs to sell at the point of harvest and freight costs.\n\nProvisions for obsolescence, adjustments to net realizable value, impaired items and slow-moving inventories are recorded when necessary. Usual production losses are recorded and are an integral part of the production costs for the respective month, whereas unusual losses, if any, are recorded directly as part of cost of sales.\n\n## 3.2.14. Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThese are measured at their carrying amount or fair value less costs to  sell,  whichever  is  lower,  and  are  not  depreciated  or  amortized.  Such  items  are  only classified in this account when the sale is highly probable and the assets are available for immediate sale in their current condition.\n\n## 3.2.15. Biological assets\n\nThe biological assets for production (mature and immature forests) are reforested eucalyptus forests, with a formation cycle between planting and harvest from 6 to 7 years, measured at fair value. Depletion is measured based on the amount of biological assets depleted (harvested) and measured at fair value at the time of harvest.\n\nFor the determination of the fair value, the income approach technique was applied, using the discounted cash flow model, according to the projected productivity cycle for these assets. The assumptions used to measure the fair value are reviewed every six months, as the Company considers that this interval is sufficient to ensure no significant gaps in the fair value balance of biological assets booked. Significant assumptions are presented in Note 13.\n\nThe gain or loss on the assessment of fair value is recognized in operating income (expenses), net.\n\nBiological  assets  in  the  process  of  formation  under  the  age  of  2  (two)  years  are  recorded  for  at  their  formation  cost.  Areas  of  permanent  environmental preservation are not recorded, because these are not characterized as biological assets, and are not included in the measurement at fair value.\n\n## 3.2.16. Property, plant and equipment\n\nStated at their cost of acquisition, formation, construction or dismantling, net of recoverable taxes. This cost is deducted from the accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, when incurred, at the higher of the value in use or the proceeds from sale less cost to sell. The borrowing costs are capitalized as a component of construction in progress, at the weighted average rate of the Company's debt at the capitalization date, adjusted for the equalization of exchange rate effects.\n\nDepreciation is recognized based on the estimated economic useful life of each asset on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually, and the effects of any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively. Land is not depreciated.",

Impairment for losses on property, plant and equipment are only recognized if the related cash-generating unit is devalued, or if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its value in use, and its fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe  cost  of  major  renovations  is  capitalized  if  the  future  economic  benefits  exceed  the  performance  standards  initially  estimated  for  the  asset  and  are  then depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n\nRepairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nGains and losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are measured by comparing the proceeds with the book value and are recognized as other operating income (expenses), net, at the disposal date.\n\n## 3.2.17. Leases\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time is transferred in exchange for consideration, for which it is necessary to assess whether:\n\n- (i) The contract involves the use of an identifiable asset, which may be explicit or implicit, and may be physically distinct or represent almost the entire capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantial right to replace the asset, then the asset is not identified;\n- (ii) The Company has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset during the contract period; and\n- (iii) The Company has the right to direct the use of the asset, meaning the Company has the right to decide to change how and for what purpose the asset is used, if:\n- \u00b7 It has the right to operate the asset, or\n- \u00b7 It designed the asset, in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.\n\nAt the beginning of the contract, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability that represents the obligation to make payments related to the asset underlying the lease.\n\nThe right-to-use asset is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any payments made up to the contract start date,  plus  any  direct  initial  costs  incurred,  and  estimated  costs  of  disassembly,  removal,  or  restoration  of  the  asset  in  the  place  where  it  is  located,  less  any incentives received.\n\nThe right-to-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the start date to the end of the useful life of the right to use, or the end of the lease term, whichever is shorter. Except for land agreements that are automatically extended for the same period through a notification to the lessor, other agreements are not allowed automatic renewals for an indefinite period, since both parties have the right to terminate the agreements.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the payments not made, less the incremental loan rate.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change:\n\n- (i) In future payments resulting from a change in index or rate;\n- (ii) In the estimate of the expected amount to be paid, at the guaranteed residual value; or\n- (iii) In the assessment of whether the Company will exercise the purchase option, extension or termination.",

Intangible assets\n\nThese are measured at cost at the time when they are initially recognized. The cost of intangible assets acquired during a business combination corresponds to the fair value at the acquisition date. After initial recognition, intangible assets are presented at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, when applicable.\n\nThe useful life of intangible assets are assessed as finite or indefinite.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the economically useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication that their carrying values may be impaired. The amortization period and method for intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at the end of each fiscal year. The amortization of intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in the statement of income as an expense related to its use, and in line with the economically useful life of the intangible asset.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment losses, individually or at the CGU level. The allocation is made to the CGU or group of CGUs that represents the lowest level within the entity for which goodwill is monitored for management's internal purposes, that has benefited  from  the  business  combination.  The  Company  mainly  records  in  this  subgroup  goodwill  for  expected  future  profitability  (goodwill)  and  easement  of passage.\n\nThis testing involved the adoption of assumptions and judgments, disclosed in Note 16.\n\n## 3.2.19. Current and deferred income tax and social contribution and uncertainty over income tax treatments (IFRIC 23)\n\nIncome taxes include income tax and social contribution on net income, current and deferred. These taxes are recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that they relate to items recognized directly in equity. In this case, they are recognized in equity under other reserves.\n\nThe current charge is calculated based on the tax laws enacted in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate and generate taxable  income.  Management  periodically  evaluates  the  positions  assumed  in  the  income  tax  returns  with  respect  to  situations  in  which  the  applicable  tax regulations give rise to interpretations and establishes provisions, when appropriate, based on the amounts that must be paid to the tax authorities.",

Recognition is only performed when there are guarantees or favorable judicial decisions and the amounts of these can be measured reliably. Contingent assets for which such conditions are not met are only disclosed in the notes to the financial statements when their amounts are material.\n\nProvisions  are  made  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  expects  that  is  probable  that  it  will  disburse  cash,  and  the  amount  can  be  reliably  estimated. Tax,  civil, environmental and labor proceedings are accrued when losses are assessed as probable, and the amounts involved can be measured reliably, being recorded net of  judicial  deposits,  under  'provisions  for  judicial  liabilities'.  When  the  expectation  of  loss  is  possible,  a  description  of  the  processes  and  amounts  involved  is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Contingent liabilities assessed as representing remote losses are neither accrued nor disclosed.\n\nContingent liabilities arising from business combinations are recognized if they arise from a present obligation as a result of from past events, and if their fair values can be measured reliably, and are subsequently measured at the higher of:\n\n- (i)    The amount that would be recognized in accordance with the accounting policy for the provisions above that comply with IAS 37; or\n- (ii)    The amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, revenue recognized in accordance with the accounting treatment of revenue from customer contracts under IFRS 15.\n\nPrincipal and penalties amounts related to Tax, civil, environmental and labor proceedings are under other operating income and expenses and the interest is recognized in the net financial result.\n\nThe realization of provisions for judicial liabilities and contingent liabilities arising from business combinations, with possible and remote probability of loss, are recognized under other operating income and expenses or cash depending on the court decision.\n\n## 3.2.23. Asset retirement obligations\n\nThese primarily relate to future costs for the decommissioning of industrial landfill sites and related assets. A provision is recorded as a long-term obligation within property, plant and equipment. The provision and the corresponding property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at fair value, based on the present value of the estimated cash flow for future cash payments discounted at an adjusted risk-free rate. The long-term obligation accrues interest using a long-term discount rate, recognized under other liabilities. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the principal, against cost of sales in the income statement.\n\n## 3.2.24. Share based payments\n\nThe  Company's  executives  and  managers  receive  their  compensation  partially  through  share-based  payment  plans  to  be  settled  in  cash  and  shares,  or alternatively in cash only.\n\nPlan-related expenses are recognized in the income statement as a corresponding entry within financial liabilities during the vesting period when the services will be  rendered.  The  financial  liability  is  measured  at  its  fair  value  on  every  balance  sheet  date,  and  its  variations  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement  as administrative expenses.\n\nAt the option exercise date, if such options are exercised by the executive in order to receive shares in the Company, financial liabilities are reclassified under stock options granted in shareholders' equity. In the case of options exercised in cash, the Company settles the related financial liability in favor of the Company's executives.",

Employee benefits\n\nThe Company offers benefits through a supplementary contribution plan to all employees, as well as medical assistance and life insurance for a determined group of former employees, and for the latter two benefits an annual actuarial appraisal is prepared by an independent actuary, and are reviewed by Management. The respective impact is recognized in employee benefit plans.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are recognized in other reserves when incurred. The interest incurred, resulting from changes in the present value of the actuarial liability, is recorded in the income statement within financial expenses.\n\n## 3.2.26. Other assets and liabilities, current and non-current\n\nAssets are recognized only when it is  probable  that  the  economic  benefit  associated  with  the  transaction  will  flow  to  the  entity,  and  its  cost  or  value  can  be measured reliably.\n\nA liability is recognized when the Company has a legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event, and it is probable that an economic resource will be required to settle this liability.\n\n## 3.2.27. Government grants and assistance\n\nGovernment  grants  and  assistance  are  recognized  at  fair  value  when  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  the  conditions  established  by  the  granting  Governmental Authority  were  observed,  and  that  these  subsidies  will  be  obtained.  These  are  recorded  as  deductions  expenses  in  the  income  statement  for  the  period  of enjoyment of the benefit, and subsequently allocated to the tax incentives reserve under shareholders' equity, when applicable.\n\n## 3.2.28. Dividends and interest on own capital\n\nThe distribution of dividends or interest on own capital is recognized as a liability, calculated based on the Corporate Law, the bylaws and the Company's Dividend Policy, which establishes that the minimum annual dividend is the lower of: (i) 25% of adjusted net income, or (ii) 10% the consolidated operating cash flow for the year, provided they are declared before the end of the year. Any portion in excess of the minimum mandatory dividends, if declared after the balance sheet date, must be recorded as part of the additional dividends proposed in shareholders' equity, until approved by the shareholders at a General Meeting. After approval, the reclassification to current liabilities is made.\n\nThe tax benefit of interest on own capital is recognized in the income statement under income tax.\n\n## 3.2.29. Share capital\n\nCommon shares are classified in shareholders' equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to a public offer are stated in shareholders' equity as a deduction from the amount raised, net of taxes.\n\n## 3.2.30. Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized at the time when control of the products is transferred to customers, represented by the ability to determine the use of products and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the products.\n\nThe  Company  follows  the  five-step  model:  (i)  identification  of  contracts  with  customers;  (ii)  identification  of  performance  obligations  under  the  contracts;  (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations provided for in the contracts; and (v) recognition of revenue when the performance obligations have been met.",

Amendments to IAS 21: Absence of interchangeability (applicable for annual on/or after January 1, 2025)\n\nThe changes will create requirements for the entity to apply a consistent approach to assessing whether a currency is exchangeable for another currency and, when it is not, to determining the appropriate exchange rate to use and the disclosures to be made.\n\nIn this context, exchangeability is considered non-existent when, for a given purpose, the entity is unable to obtain more than an insignificant amount of foreign currency.

Fair value of loans and financing\n\nThe financial instruments are recognized at their contractual amounts. Derivative financial instrument agreements, used exclusively for hedging purposes, are measured at fair value.\n\nIn order to determine the market values of financial instruments traded in public and liquid markets, the market closing prices were used at the balance sheet dates. The fair values of interest rate and index swaps are calculated based on the present value of their future cash flow, discounted at the current interest rates available for transactions with similar remaining terms to maturity. This calculation is based on the quotations of B3 and ANBIMA for interest rate transactions in Brazilian Reais, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Bloomberg for Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') transactions. The fair value of forward or forward exchange agreements is determined using the forward exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates, in accordance with B3 prices.\n\nIn order to determine the fair values of financial instruments traded in over-the-counter or unliquidated markets, a number of assumptions and methods based on normal market conditions and not for liquidation or forced sale, are used at each balance sheet date, including the use of option pricing models such as GarmanKohlhagen, and estimates of discounted future cash flow. The fair value of agreements for the fixing of oil bunker prices is obtained based on the Platts index.\n\nThe results of the trading of financial instruments are recognized at the closing or contract dates, where the Company undertakes to buy or sell these instruments. The obligations arising from the contracting of financial instruments are eliminated from the financial statements only when these instruments expire or when the risks, obligations and rights arising therefrom are transferred.",

Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Company's purpose is to maintain a strong cash and marketable securities position to meet its financial and operating commitments. The amount held in cash is intended to cover the expected outflows in the normal course of its operations, while the cash surplus is generally invested in highly liquid financial investments according to the Cash Management Policy.\n\nThe cash position is monitored by the Company's Management, by means of management reports and participation in performance meetings with determined frequencies.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, the variations in cash and marketable securities were as expected, and the cash generated from operations was mostly used for investments and debt service.\n\nAll derivative financial instruments were traded over the counter and do not require deposit guarantee margins.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market risk management\n\nThe Company is exposed to several market risks, mainly related to fluctuations in exchange rate variations, interest rates, inflation rates and commodity prices that could affect its results and financial situation.\n\nTo mitigate the impacts, the Company has processes to monitor its exposure and policies that could support the implementation of risk management.\n\nThese policies establish the limits and the instruments to be implemented for the purpose of:\n\n- (i) Protecting cash flow due to currency mismatch;\n- (ii) Mitigating exposure to interest rates;\n- (iii) Reducing the impacts of fluctuations in commodity's prices; and\n- (iv) Changes to debt indexes.\n\nMarket  risk  management  involves  the  identification,  assessment  and  implementation  of  the  strategy,  with  the  effective  contracting  of  adequate  financial instruments.",

Exchange rate risk management\n\nThe fundraising, financing and currency hedging policies of the Company are guided by the fact that a substantial part of the net revenue arises from exports with prices negotiated in US Dollars, while a substantial part of the production costs are in Brazilian Reais. This structure allows the Company to enter into export financing  arrangements  in  US  Dollars,  and  to  reconcile  the  financing  payments  with  the  cash  flow  of  receivables  from  sales  in  foreign  markets,  using  the international bond market as an important portion of its capital structure, and providing a natural cash hedge for these commitments.\n\nMoreover,  the  Company  enter  into  US  Dollar  sales  transactions  in  the  futures  markets,  including  strategies  involving  options,  to  ensure  attractive  levels  of operating margins for a portion of revenue. Such transactions are limited to a percentage of the net surplus of foreign currency over an 24-month time horizon, and therefore are matched to the availability of currency for sale in the short term. The Company's Board of Directors approved the contracting of extraordinary hedge, in addition to the policy mentioned above, for investments in the Cerrado Project, with a term of up to 36 months as of November 2021, in an amount of up to US$1,000,000. On July 27, 2022, the Board of Directors approved the expansion of the program, increasing the maximum amount (notional) to US$1,500,000, maintaining the previously established deadline. In order to provide transparency on the hedge program for the Cerrado Project, since December 31, 2021 the Company has started to prominently disclose the respective contracted operations.\n\nThe assets and liabilities that are exposed to foreign currency, substantially in U.S. Dollars, are set forth below:\n\n|                                                     | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Assets                                              |                     |                     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                           | 6,432,557           | 8,039,218           |\n| Marketable securities                               | 7,378,277           | 4,510,652           |\n| Trade accounts receivable                           | 5,049,609           | 7,612,768           |\n| Derivative financial instruments                    | 3,070,594           | 3,393,785           |\n|                                                     | 21,931,037          | 23,556,423          |\n| Liabilities                                         |                     |                     |\n| Trade accounts payable                              | (1,625,011)         | (2,030,806)         |\n| Loans and financing                                 | (61,304,673)        | (61,216,140)        |\n| Liabilities for asset acquisitions and subsidiaries | (127,598)           | (2,053,259)         |\n| Derivative financial instruments                    | (1,867,882)         | (4,698,323)         |\n|                                                     | (64,925,164)        | (69,998,528)        |\n|                                                     | (42,994,127)        | (46,442,105)        |\n\n## 4.4.1.1. Sensitivity analysis - foreign exchange rate exposure - except for derivative financial instruments\n\nFor market risk analysis, the Company uses scenarios to evaluate both its asset and liability positions in foreign currency, and the possible effects on its results. The probable scenario represents the amounts recognized, as they reflect the conversion into Brazilian Reais on the balance sheet date (R$ to U.S.$ = R$4.8413).\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, particularly interest rates, remain constant. The other scenarios considered the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. Dollar at the rates of 25% and 50% before taxes.",

Sensitivity analysis - foreign exchange rate exposure - derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company has sales operations in US$ in the futures markets, including strategies using options, to ensure attractive levels of operating margins for a portion of  its  revenue. These operations are limited to a percentage of the total exposure to US$ over a 24-month horizon, or to investments in the Cerrado Project, according to the extraordinary hedge described above, and are therefore pegged to the availability of ready-to-sell foreign exchange in the short term.\n\nIn addition to the transaction described above, the Company also taken out derivative instruments linked to the US$ and subject to exchange fluctuations, seeking to adjust the debt's currency indexation to the cash generation currency, as provided for in its financial policies.\n\nFor the calculation of the mark-to-market ('MtM') price, the exchange rate of the last business day of the period is used. These market movements caused a positive impact on the mark-to-market position entered into by the Company.\n\nThis  analysis  below  assumes  that  all  other  variables,  particularly  the  interest  rates,  remain  constant.  The  other  scenarios  considered  the  depreciation  of  the Brazilian Real against the US$ by 25% and 50%, before taxes, based on the base scenario on December 31, 2023.",

Interest rate risk management\n\nFluctuations in interest rates could increase or reduce the costs of new loans and existing contracted operations.\n\nThe Company is constantly looking for alternatives for the use of financial instruments in order to avoid negative impacts on its cash flow due to fluctuations in interest rates in Brazil or abroad.\n\nOn July 1, 2023, loan contracts (in the amount of R$15,566,016) and derivatives (in the amount of R$15,150,974) began to be indexed by Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR') (and no longer by London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR')), adopted as the new reference interest rate by capital market. The change in the interest rate did not have a material impact on the balances presented in the loan and financing and derivative instrument categories.\n\n## 4.4.2.1. Sensitivity analysis - exposure to interest rates - except for derivative financial instruments\n\nFor its market risk analysis, the Company uses scenarios to evaluate the sensitivity of changes in operations impacted by the following rates: Interbank Deposit Rate ('CDI'), Long Term Interest Rate ('TJLP'), Special System for Settlement and Custody ('SELIC') and SOFR, which could impact the results.\n\nThe probable scenario represents the amounts already booked, as they reflect Management's best estimates.\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, particularly exchange rates, will remain constant. The other scenarios considered a depreciation of 25% and 50% in market interest rates.",

Sensitivity analysis to changes in the consumer price indices of the US economy\n\nFor  the  measurement  of  the  probable  scenario,  the  United  States  Consumer  Price  Index  ('US-CPI')  was  considered  on  December  29,  2023.  The  probable scenario was extrapolated considering a depreciation of 25% and 50% in the US-CPI to define the possible and remote scenarios, respectively.\n\nThe following table sets out the possible impacts:\n\n|                                                                                                                | December 31, 2023 Effect on profit or loss   | December 31, 2023 Effect on profit or loss   | December 31, 2023 Effect on profit or loss   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                | Probable (base value)                        | Possible (25%)                               | Remote (50%)                                 |\n| Embedded derivative in a commitment to purchase standing wood, originating from a forest partnership agreement | 230,471                                      | (30,667)                                     | (63,157)                                     |\n\n## 4.4.3. Commodity price risk management\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  commodity  prices,  mainly  in  the  selling  price  of  pulp  in  the  international  market.  The  dynamics  of  rising  and  falling  production capacities in the global market and macroeconomic conditions may impact the Company's operating results.\n\nThrough a specialized team, the Company monitors hardwood pulp prices and analyses future trends, adjusting the forecasts aimed at assisting with preventive measures to calculate the different scenarios. There is no sufficiently liquid financial market to mitigate the risk of a material portion of the Company's operations. Hardwood pulp price protection instruments available on the market have low liquidity and low volume, and high levels of distortion in price formation.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to international oil prices, reflected in logistical costs for selling in the export market, and indirectly in the costs of other supply, logistics and service contracts. In such cases, the Company evaluates whether to contract derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of price variations in its results.\n\n## 4.5. Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company determines the fair value of derivative contracts, which differ from the amounts realized in the event of early settlement due to bank spreads and market factors at the time of quotation. The amounts presented by the Company are based on an estimate using market factors and use data provided by third parties, measured internally and compared to calculations performed by external consultants and by counterparties.\n\nThe fair value does not represent an obligation to make an immediate disbursement or receipt of cash, given that such an effect will only occur on the dates of contractual fulfillment or upon the maturity of each transaction, when the result will be determined, depending on the case and on the market conditions on the agreed dates.",

The present value of the US Dollar-denominated tip is measured using the discount based on the exchange coupon curve (the remuneration, in US Dollars, of the Reais invested in Brazil) and in the case of the R$-denominated tip, the discount is made using Brazil's interest  curve,  being  the  future  curve  of  the  DI,  considering  the  credit  risk  of  both  the  Company  and  the  counterparty.  The  exception  is  pre-fixed contracts  x  US$,  for  which  the  present  value  of  the  tip  denominated  in  US$  is  measured  through  a  discount  using  the  SOFR  curve  disclosed  by Bloomberg. The fair value of the contract is the difference between these two points. Interest rate curves were obtained from B3.\n- (ii) Options (Zero Cost Collar): the fair value was calculated based on the Garman-Kohlhagen model, considering both the Company's and the counterparty credit risk. Volatility information and interest rates are observable and obtained from the B3 exchange, and are used to calculate the fair values.\n- (iii) Non-deliverable forward ('NDF') contracts: a projection of the future currency quote is made, using the exchange coupon curves and the future DI curve for each maturity. Next, the difference between this quotation and the rate at which the operation was contracted is verified, considering the credit risk of the Company and the counterparty. This difference is multiplied by the notional value of each contract, and brought to its present value based on the future DI curve. Interest rate curves were obtained from B3.\n- (iv) Swap US-CPI: liability cash flows are projected based on the US inflation curve US-CPI, obtained based on the implicit rates for inflation-linked US securities (Treasury Protected against Inflation - 'TIPS'), disclosed by Bloomberg. Cash flows from the asset components are projected at the fixed rates implicit in the embedded derivatives. The fair value of an embedded derivative is the difference between the two components, adjusted to present value base on the curve of the exchange coupon obtained from B3.\n- (v) Swap VLSFO (marine fuel): a future projection of the asset price is made, using the future price curve disclosed by Bloomberg. Next, the difference between this projection and the rate at which the operation was contracted is verified, considering both of Company's and the counterparty's credit risk. This difference is multiplied by the notional value of each contract and adjusted to present value using the SOFR curve disclosed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe yield curves used to calculate the fair value as of December 31, 2023 are as set forth below:\n\n| Term     | Brazil      | Interest rate curves United States of America   | US Dollar coupon   |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 1 month  | 11.65% p.a. | 5.35% p.a.                                      | 2.54% p.a.         |\n|          | 10.79% p.a. | 5.15% p.a.                                      | 5.55% p.a.         |\n| 6 months | 9.99% p.a.  | 4.77% p.a.                                      | 5.58% p.a.         |\n| 1 year   | 9.55% p.a.  | 4.16% p.a.                                      | 5.18%p.a.          |\n| 2 years  | 9.66% p.a.  | 3.89% p.a.                                      | 4.99% p.a.         |\n| 3 years  | 10.04% p.a. | 3.76% p.a.                                      | 5.00% p.a.         |\n| 5 years  | 10.33% p.a. | 4.02% p.a.                                      | 5.74% p.a.         |\n| 10 years |             |                                                 |                    |",

The objective is to change the debt indexed in reais, in compliance with the Company's cash position in Brazilian Reais, which is also indexed to DI.\n- (iii) Swap IPCA x Fixed US$: positions in conventional swaps exchanging the variations of the IPCA for a fixed rate in US$. The objective is to change the debt indexed in Brazilian Reais to US$, in compliance with the Company's natural exposure to US$ receivables.\n- (iv) Swap SOFR x Fixed US$: positions in conventional swaps exchanging a post-fixed rate (SOFR) for a fixed rate in US$. The objective is to protect the cash flow against changes in the US interest rate.\n- (v) Pre-Fixed Swap R$ x Fixed US$: positions in conventional swaps of a fixed rate in Reais for a fixed rate in US$. The objective is to change the exposure of debts in Brazilian Reais to US$, in compliance with the Company's natural exposure to US$ receivables.\n- (vi) SOFR x SOFR Swap: swap position exchanging a fixed rate added to SOFR for another fixed rate added to SOFR. The objective is to generate a fee discount for Prepayment with the banking institution, allowing for reversal mechanisms.\n- (vii) CDI x SOFR Swap: positions in conventional swaps exchanging the variation in the Interbank Deposit rate ('DI') for a post-fixed rate ('SOFR') in United States Dollars ('US$'). The objective is to change the debt index in reais to US$, aligning with the natural exposure of the Company's US$ receivables and capturing a lower cost of debt through the fluctuation of SOFR rate projections.\n- (viii) Swap Fixed(US$) x SOFR: positions in conventional swaps exchanging a pre-fixed rate in US$ for a post-fixed rate (SOFR) also in US$. The objective is to capture a lower cost of debt by fluctuating SOFR rate projections.\n- (ix) Zero-Cost Collar: positions in an instrument that consists of the simultaneous combination of a purchase of put options and the sale of call options in US$, with the same principal amount and maturity, with the objective of protecting the cash flow of exports. Under this strategy, an interval is established where there is no deposit or receipt of financial margin at the option maturity. The objective is to protect the cash flow of exports against the depreciation of the Brazilian Real.\n- (x) Non-Deliverable Forward contracts ('NDF'): short positions in US$ futures contracts with the objective of protecting the cash flow from exports against the depreciation of the Brazilian Real.\n- (xi) Swap US-CPI: The embedded derivative refers to the swap contracts for selling price variations in US$ and the US-CPI in forest partnership with a standing wood supply contract.\n- (xii) Non-Deliverable Forward contracts: EUR and US$: call positions at EUR/US$ parity to protect the Capex cash flow of the Cerrado project against the appreciation of the Euro.\n- (xiii) Swap Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil / Brent ('VLSFO'): Long positions in oil, aimed at hedging logistical costs related to maritime freight contracts and costs of other oil derivatives against the increase in oil prices.",

Fair value hierarchy\n\nFinancial instruments are measured at fair value, which considers the fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an unforced transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nDepending on the inputs used for measurement, the financial instruments at fair value may be classified into three hierarchical levels:\n\n- (i) Level 1 - Based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. A market is considered active if it trades frequently and at  a  sufficient  volume  to  provide  pricing  information  immediately  and  continuously,  usually  obtained  from  a  commodity  and  stock  exchange,  pricing service or regulatory agency, and if the prices represent actual market transactions, which occur regularly on a commercial basis;\n- (ii) Level 2 - Based on the prices quoted in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, the prices quoted for identical or similar assets or liabilities in nonactive markets, evaluation models for which inputs are observable , such as rates of interest and yield curves, credit volatilities and spreads, and market corroborated  information.  Assets  and  liabilities  classified  in  this  category  are  measured  based  on  the  discounted  cash  flow  and  interest  accrual, respectively, for derivative financial instruments and marketable securities. The observable inputs include interest rates and curves, volatility factors and foreign exchange rates; and\n\n<!-- image -->",

The observable inputs used are the IMA, discount rate and eucalyptus average gross sales price.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no changes between the levels of hierarchy and no transfers between levels 2 and 3.\n\n|                                                  | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                  | Level 2             | Level 3             | Total               |\n| Assets                                           |                     |                     |                     |\n| At fair value through profit or loss             |                     |                     |                     |\n| Derivative financial instruments                 | 4,430,454           |                     | 4,430,454           |\n| Marketable securities                            | 13,267,286          |                     | 13,267,286          |\n|                                                  | 17,697,740          |                     | 17,697,740          |\n| At fair value through other comprehensive income |                     |                     |                     |\n| Other investments - CelluForce                   |                     | 23,606              | 23,606              |\n|                                                  |                     | 23,606              | 23,606              |\n| Biological assets                                |                     | 18,278,582          | 18,278,582          |\n|                                                  |                     | 18,278,582          | 18,278,582          |\n| Total assets                                     | 17,697,740          | 18,302,188          | 35,999,928          |\n| Liabilities                                      |                     |                     |                     |\n| At fair value through profit or loss             |                     |                     |                     |\n| Derivative financial instruments                 | 2,436,072           |                     | 2,436,072           |\n|                                                  | 2,436,072           |                     | 2,436,072           |\n| Total liabilities                                | 2,436,072           |                     | 2,436,072           |",

Risks linked to climate change and the sustainability strategy\n\nIn view of the nature of the Company's operations, there is inherent exposure to risks related to climate change.\n\nThe Company's assets, notably biological assets, which are measured at fair value (Note 13), property, plant and equipment (Note 15) and intangible assets (Note 16), may be impacted by climate change, the risks of which were evaluated in the context of preparation of financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Management considered the main risk data and assumptions highlighted below:\n\n- (i) Possible impacts on the determination of fair value in biological assets due to: Effects of climate change, such as temperature rises and scarcity of water resources, could impact some of the assumptions used in accounting estimates related to the Company's biological assets, as follow:\n- \u00b7 Loss of biological assets due to fires and impacts arising from the greater presence and resistance of pests and other forest diseases favored by the gradual increase in temperature;\n- \u00b7 Reduction in productivity and expected growth ('IMA') due to reduced availability of water resources in river basins and other atypical weather events such as droughts, frosts and torrential rains; and\n- \u00b7 Interruptions to the production chain due to adverse weather events.\n- (ii) Scarcity of water resources in the industry: although our units are efficient in the use of water, there are contingency plans for all units affected by possible water shortages and action plans to confront the water crisis in critical regions.\n- (iii) Structural changes in society and their impacts on business, such as:\n- \u00b7 Regulatory and legal: arising  from  changes  in  the  Brazilian  and/or  international  scope  that  require  capital  investment  in  new  technologies and/or operating costs. Among the expected topics are carbon pricing, customs carbon taxation, trade barriers and/or commercial restrictions related to businesses' alleged contributions, even if indirect, to the intensification of climate change, which increase the risk of litigation;\n- \u00b7 Technological: arising from the emergence of improvements and innovations towards an economy with greater energy efficiency and lower carbon. Suzano should continue investing in R&D to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u00b7 Markets: arising from changes to the supply of and demand for certain products and services as climate-related issues begin to be considered in  decision-making. The  market  should  increasingly  prioritize  the  reduction  of  carbon  emissions  and  more  sustainable  business  practices, which may lead to a drop in demand and revenue for Suzano's disposable products and an increase in demand for renewable forests and other sustainable products; and\n- \u00b7 Reputational: related to the perceptions of customers and society in general regarding the positive or negative contribution of an organization to a low carbon economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compliance with contractual clauses related to sustainability in debt securities and sustainable loans (Sustainability Linked Bonds - 'SLB' and Sustainability Linked Loans - 'SLL')\n\nThe Company issued debt securities and loans linked to sustainability performance targets (\"Sustainability Performance Targets - SPT\") related to the reduce the intensity  of  our  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  reduce  the  intensity  of  water  capture  for  use  in  industrial  processes  and  increase  the  percentage  of  women  in leadership positions by December 31, 2025. Non-compliance with these targets may generate future increases in the cost of said debts, as provided for in the respective contracts.\n\nIn 2020, the company issued its first bond based on the SLB Principles. In 2021, Suzano issued two additional Sustainability Linked bonds that, for the first time, were  linked  to  something  other  than  an  environmental  or  social  target:  a  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  target.  Its  first  Sustainability  Linked  Loan  (SLL)  was contracted in 2021 and, in 2022, the company obtained a new loan with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) following the guidelines of the SLL Principles.\n\n## 4.8.3. Climate risk management\n\nThe Company has a structure dedicated to corporate risk management, including risks related to climate change, with its own methodologies, tools and processes aimed at ensuring the identification, assessment and treatment of its main short, medium and long-term risks. This allows the continuous monitoring of risks and their  eventual  impacts,  control  of  the  variables  involved,  and  the  definition  and  implementation  of  mitigating  measures,  which  aim  to  reduce  the  identified exposures. The Company's assessment of the potential physical impacts of climate change, as well as those arising from the transition to a low carbon economy is carried out on an ongoing basis, and will continue to evolve.\n\n## 4.8.4. Opportunities linked to climate change and the sustainability strategy\n\n## 4.8.4.1. Biomas\n\nAs disclosed in Note 1.2.6, Suzano and five other global companies created Biomas with objective of restoring, conserving and preserving native forests in Brazil.\n\nThe initiative aims to restore and protect, over a period of 20 years, native forest in some of Brazil's most valuable ecosystems, such as the Amazon, Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes - The area is equivalent to the territory of Switzerland or the state of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.\n\nThe initiative aims to promote a sustainable business model from a financial perspective, enabling each restoration, conservation, and preservation projects to be viable through the commercialization of carbon credits, as removals and avoided emissions, reducing tons of CO2e from the atmosphere.\n\nThe  first  stage  will  involve  the  identification  and  prospecting  of  areas,  promoting  nurseries  for  the  large-scale  production  of  native  trees,  engaging  local communities in Biomas activities, discussing the application of the project in public areas, partnering with carbon certification platforms and implementing pilot projects.",

Production of wood-based textile fiber\n\nIn May 2023, Woodspin, located in Finland, inaugurated the first factory producing sustainable, recyclable and fully biodegradable textile fiber from responsibly grown wood, the result of the joint venture between Spinnova and Suzano. This new type of fabric was developed to replace less sustainable materials used in many products. This unit will be used for market development and technology improvement.\n\nFor the construction and operation of textile fiber projects, Woodspin uses Suzano's microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) as raw material.\n\n## 4.8.4.3. Securities with clauses related to sustainability\n\nAs disclosed in note 4.8.2, Suzano has Sustainability Linked Bonds (SLB) and Sustainability Linked Loan (SLL) linked to environmental performance indicators associated with a goal to reduce greenhouse gases, intensity the capture of water resources, and aspects of diversity and inclusion, evidencing the Company's commitment  as  part  of  the  solution  to  the  global  climate  crisis  and  in  convergence  with  the  implementation  of  its  long-term  goal.  These  funding  linked  to sustainability goals allow differentiated rates.\n\n## 4.9. Capital management\n\nThe main objective is to strengthen the Company's capital structure, aiming to maintain an appropriate level of financial leverage while mitigating risks that could affect the availability of capital for business development.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors significant indicators, such as consolidated financial leverage, which is the ratio of total net debt to adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ('Adjusted EBITDA').\n\n## 5.

Suzano  provides  eucalyptus  seedlings,  input  subsidies  and  cash  advances,  and  the  latter  are  not subject to valuation at their present value since they will be settled in volume standing or cut wood. In addition, the Company supports producers by providing technical advice on forest management but does not have joint control over decisions effectively implemented. At the end of the production cycles, the Company has a contractually guaranteed right to make an offer to purchase the forest and/or wood at its market value. However, this right does not prevent producers from negotiating the sale of the forest and/or wood with other market participants, provided the incentive amounts are fully paid.\n\n## 11.

In order to ensure its right to non-double taxation, the Company filed a lawsuit in April 2019, which aims to exempt the double taxation in Brazil, of profits earned by its subsidiary located in Austria, according to Law No. 12,973/14. Due to the preliminary injunction granted in favor of the Company in the aforementioned lawsuit, the Company decided not to add the profit from Suzano International Trading GmbH, located in Austria, when determining its taxable income and social contribution basis of the net profit of  the  Company  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023.  There  is  no  provision  for  tax  related  to  the  non-double  taxation  profits  of  such  subsidiary  in  2023.

The IRPJ reduction incentive is calculated based on the activity profits (exploitation profits) and considers the allocation of the operating profit based on the incentive production levels for each product.",

OECD Pillar Two model rules\n\nSuzano is within the scope of the rules of the OECD Pillar Two model, as it has subsidiaries that sell its products in geographic regions subject to said regulation. The Company applied the exception to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to taxes on profit under Pillar Two, as provided for in the amendments to IAS 12, issued in May 2023, and, therefore, there is no impact of Pillar legislation Two in the calculation of taxes on deferred profits in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are currently in the process of evaluating the impact on the implementation of Pillar Two rules and the calculation of GloBE revenue. In this context, the Company is counting on the support of tax experts to guide it in the effective application of this legislation.\n\n## 13.    BIOLOGICAL ASSETS\n\nThe roll-forward of biological assets is as set forth below:\n\n|                                | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Opening balance                | 14,632,186          | 12,248,732          |\n| Additions                      | 5,777,952           | 4,957,380           |\n| Depletions                     | (3,680,997)         | (3,665,057)         |\n| Transfers                      | (136,297)           |                     |\n| Gain on fair value adjustments | 1,989,831           | 1,199,759           |\n| Disposals                      | (128,370)           | (82,331)            |\n| Other write-offs               | (175,723)           | (26,297)            |\n| Closing balance                | 18,278,582          | 14,632,186          |\n\nThe calculation of fair value of the biological assets falls under Level 3 in the hierarchy set forth in IFRS 13 - Measurement of Fair Value, due to the complexity and structure of the calculation.\n\nThe assumptions such as the average annual growth ('IMA'), discount rate, and average gross selling price of eucalyptus, stand out as being the most sensitive, where increases or reductions in these assumptions could generate significant gains or losses in the measurement of fair value.",

Capitalized expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company capitalized loan costs in the amount of R$1,160,364 (R$359,407 as of December 31, 2022). The weighted average interest rate, adjusted by the equalization of the exchange rate effects, utilized to determine the capitalized amount was 10.98% p.a. (12.49% p.a. as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## 16.    INTANGIBLE\n\n## 16.1.

In 2023, the Company used the strategic plan and the annual budget with projected increases to 2028 and the average rate in perpetuity of the cash generating units considering a nominal rate of 3.5% p.a. from this date, based on historical information for previous years, economic and financial projections from each specific market in which the Company has operations, and additionally include official information disclosed by independent institutions and government agencies.\n\nThe discount rate, after taxes, adopted by Management was 8.9% p.a., calculated based on the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC'). The assumptions in the table set forth below were also adopted:\n\n| Net average pulp price - Foreign market (US$/t)   | 662.1       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Net average pulp price - Internal market (US$/t)  | 648.7       |\n| Average exchange rate (R$/US$)                    | 5.15        |\n|                                                   | 8.9% p.a.   |\n| Discount rate (pos-tax)                           |             |\n|                                                   | 12.25% p.a. |\n| Discount rate (pre-tax)                           |             |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not identify the need to record any impairment provision for intangible assets.\n\nIf the post-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections of both cash-generating units had been 1% higher than management's estimates (9.9% instead of 8.9%), the Company would still not need to record an impairment provision.",

Tax and social securities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had 733 (seven hundred and thirty-three) (766 (seven hundred and sixty-six) as of December 31, 2022) tax proceedings whose likelihood of loss is considered possible, in the total amount of R$9,775,068 (R$8,201,246 as of December 31, 2022) for which no provision was recorded.\n\nThe other  tax  and  social  security  lawsuits  refer  to  various  taxes,  such  as  IRPJ,  CSLL,  PIS,  COFINS,  ICMS,  ISS,  Withholding  Income  Tax  ('IRRF'),  PIS  and COFINS, mainly due to differences of interpretation regarding the applicable tax rules and information provided in the accessory obligations.\n\nThe most relevant tax cases are set forth below:\n\n- (i) Income tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - Swaps of industrial and forestry assets: in December 2012, the Company received a tax assessment for the collection of income tax and social contribution, alleging unpaid tax on a capital gain in February 2007, the closing date of the transaction, when the Company executed an agreement with International Paper regarding a swap of industrial and forestry assets.\n\nOn January 19, 2016, the Tax Federal Administrative Court (Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais - 'CARF') rejected, as per the casting vote of the CARF's President, the appeal filed by the Company in the administrative process. The Company was notified of the decision on May 25, 2016 and, due to the impossibility of a new appeal and the consequent closure of the case at the administrative level, decided to continue the discussion with the Judiciary.  The  lawsuit  was  judged  in  a  favorable  manner  to  the  Company's  interests  and  the  appeal  of  the  National  Treasury  is  currently  awaiting judgment at the lower court. In December 2023, in view of the terms of article 25, \u00a7 9\u00baA, of Law No. 14,689/23, the Active Debt Certificates were rectified in order to definitively cancel the amounts related to the tax assessment penalty and its charges. On the opinion of the Company and its external legal advisors the probability of loss in this case is possible, except for the provisioning of the amount equivalent to the contingent liability assumed arising from the business combination. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the estimated amount of the possible exposure is R$1,630,537 (R$2,505,970 as of December 31, 2022).",

Imputed infractions regarding (i) non-deductible expenses; (ii) improper deduction of operating expenses; (iii) profits earned by the subsidiaries abroad; (iv) goodwill amortization; (v) lack of addition of bonus paid to directors to the CSLL calculation basis, and (vi) tax loss and negative CSLL basis. The Company filed an administrative objection, currently pending judgment at the first administrative level.\n- In the year ending December 31, 2023, the total amount of the possible exposure is R$845,164.\n- (iii) Income tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL - disallowance of depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses - 2010. In December 2015, the Company received a tax assessment requiring the payment of IRPJ and CSLL, questioning the deductibility of depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses of 2010 included by the Company in the calculation of the income tax expense. We presented administrative appeals within the legal period, which were judged partially valid. The decision was subject to a voluntary recourse, presented by the Company in November 2017. The judgment was converted into  a  due  diligence, and currently, the Company is waiting for the completion of the due diligence. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the total amount of the possible exposure is R$827,186 (R$777,362 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (iv) Tax Assessment - Corporate Income Tax and Social Contribution: on October 5, 2020, the Company was notified of the tax assessment issued by the Brazilian Internal Revenue Service claiming the payment of Corporate Income Tax and Social Contribution, resulting from the remeasurement of the profit  of  its  subsidiary  Suzano Trading  Ltd  in  the  years  ended  December  31,  2014,  2015  and  2016.  Besides  the  Company,  the  Statutory  Executive Officers ('Officers') of Suzano Trading were also included as co-defendants. The Company, based on the opinion of its legal advisors, considered the risk of loss as possible with reference to the Company and, with reference to the Officers, also possible but with a higher chance of winning (possible to remote). The Company presented the administrative defense and, currently, through Resolution No.104000033, the judgment was converted into a diligence, which is awaiting the beginning. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the total amount of the possible exposure is R$563,723 (R$516,433 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (v) PIS/COFINS  -  Goods  and  services  -  2009  to  2011:  in  December  2013,  the  Company  was  assessed  by  the  Brazilian  Federal  Revenue  Service demanding the collection of PIS and COFINS credits which were disallowed because they are not allegedly linked to its operating activities. In the first instance, the objection filed by the Company was dismissed. After the Voluntary Appeal was filed, it was partially obtained in April 2016. Following this decision, the National Treasury filed a Special Appeal to the Superior Chamber, which is still pending judgment and the Company filed a Statement of Appeal, which was partially accepted. The total amount of the possible exposure in December 31, 2023 is R$190,875 (R$180,219 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (vi) Tax assessment - taxation on a universal basis - year 2015: on November 3, 2020, the Company received a tax assessment for the collection of income tax and social contribution, alleging unpaid tax for the calendar year 2015, due to the failure to include in the calculation the taxable income and social contribution the profits  earned by the subsidiaries abroad. The Company, based on the legal advisors, considered the risk of loss as possible. The Company presented  the  administrative  defense. At  the  lower  court,  the  objection  filed  by  the  Company  was  partially  upheld.  Thus,  in  view  of  the decision, a Voluntary Appeal was filed, which is currently pending judgment. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the total amount of exposure is R$176,917 (R$163,059 as of December 31, 2022).",

In  2005,  the  Brazilian  Federal  Revenue Service  served  the  Company  an  assessment  notice  requiring  the  payment  of  the  tax  incentive  mounts  claimed,  plus  interest.  After  administrative discussions, the assessment notice was partially upheld, and recognized the Company's right to the tax incentive through 2003.\n- The Company's Management, supported by its legal counsel, believes that the decision to cancel the tax benefits is erroneous and should not be upheld, either with respect to the benefits already used, or with respect to benefits not used until the final relevant periods.\n- The contingency is being discussed in the judicial sphere. Currently awaiting publication of the decision that dismissed the Motion for Clarification. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the total amount of the possible exposure is R$143,912 (R$136,733 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (viii)    Offsetting - IRRF - period 2000: the Company filed a lawsuit for the offsetting of IRRF credits measured in the year ended December 31, 2000, with debts owed to the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service. In April 2008, the Brazilian Federal Revenue Service partially recognized the credit in favor of the Company. Following this decision, the Company filed a Voluntary Appeal with CARF, and the judgment was converted into a diligence. Currently, we are waiting for the start of the due diligence. In the year ended December 31, 2023 the total amount of the possible exposure is R$120,871 (R$116,105 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (ix)        IRPJ/CSLL  -  partial  approval:  the  Company  requested  approval  to  offset  tax  losses  for  the  year  1997  with  amounts  owed  to  the  tax  authorities. The authorities approved in March 2009, only R$83,000, which generated a difference of R$51,000. The Company is still awaiting the conclusion of the analysis  of  the  credits  discussed  at  the  administrative  level  following  a  favorable  decision  from  CARF  in August  2019,  which  granted  the  Voluntary Appeal filed by the Company. For the remaining credit, the Company has appealed the rejection of the tax credits and obtained a partially favorable decision, and the final decision is currently under discussion in the judicial level. Shortly afterwards, an appeal was filed, which was judged in session, determining the conversion of the done in diligence. In the year ended December 31, 2023, the total amount of the possible exposure is R$117,130 (R$111,775 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (x)    Income tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL: Administrative process requiring the collection of IRPJ and CSLL for the 2015 calendar year. Infractions are alleged regarding  (i)  transfer  pricing;  and  (ii)  non-deductible  expenses.  The  Company  filed  an  objection  in  January  2020,  which  was  partially  upheld.  The Voluntary Appeal presented by the Company is currently awaiting judgment. In the year ended December 31, 2023, the total amount of the possible exposure is R$106,477 (R$97,515 as of December 31, 2022).\n- (xi)    Income tax assessment - IRPJ/CSLL: This is a Decision Order that partially approved the compensation carried out by the Company, due to the use of credits arising from Negative Balance, arising from withholding at source, calculated in the period of January 2016 to December 2016. The Company filed an administrative objection, currently pending judgment at the first administrative level. In the year ended December 31, 2023, the total amount of the possible exposure is R$102,496 (R$93,232 as of December 31, 2022).",

Labor\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company was a defendant in 1,034 (one thousand thirty-four) labor lawsuits, totaling R$194,883 (1,248 (one thousand, two hundred and forty-eight) labor lawsuits, totaling R$321,428 as of December 31, 2022).\n\nThe Company also has several lawsuits in which employees' unions in the states of Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Maranh\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul are included.\n\n## 20.2.3. Civil, environmental and real estate\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company was a defendant in approximately 219 (two hundred and nineteen) civil, environmental and real estate lawsuits, totaling R$4,462,964 (221 (two hundred and twenty-one) lawsuits totaling R$4,414,877 as of December 31, 2022).\n\nIn general, the civil and environmental proceedings in which the Company, including its subsidiaries, is a defendant, are mainly related to discussions regarding eligibility for environmental licenses, repair of environmental damage, matters relating to indemnities, including those arising from discussions about contractual obligations,  precautionary  measures,  possessory  actions,  damage  repair  and  revision  actions,  actions  aimed  at  the  recovery  of  credits  (collection  actions, monitoring, execution, credit qualifications related to bankruptcy and judicial recovery), actions of social movements interest, such as landless workers, quilombola communities, indigenous people and fishers, and actions resulting from traffic accidents. The Company has a general civil liability insurance policy that aims to cover, within the limits contracted in the policy, any legal convictions arising from damages to third parties (including employees).\n\nThe most relevant civil cases are set forth below:\n\n- (i) We are involved in 2 (two) Public Civil Claims ( 'A\u00e7\u00e3o Civil P\u00fablica' ) filed by the Federal Public Prosecution Office, requesting: (i) a preliminary injunction to prohibit the Company's trucks from transporting wood in federal highways above legal weight restrictions; (ii) an increase in the fines for cases of overweight  loads;  and  (iii)  compensation  for  damages  allegedly  caused  to  federal  highways,  the  environment  and  the  economic  order,  and compensation for moral damages. One of the Claims was ruled partially against the Company. Suzano presented an appeal to the Court of Appeals, requesting interim relief to stay the effects of such ruling until a final decision is reached. The other ACP was dismissed and an appeal is pending. In September 2021, both were suspended by decision of the STJ to evaluate the points of discussion in the form of a repetitive appeal. Not yet scheduled for judgment.\n- (ii) The  Company  also  sued  a  competitor  from  the  midwest  region  due  to  the  improper  and  unauthorized  use  of  a  variety  of  eucalyptus  protected  by intellectual property rights (cultivar) of the merged subsidiary Fibria. The prohibition against the cultivation of this biological asset by the competitor is protected by an injunction still in force, which was confirmed in a sentence favorable to the Company, and, currently, the procedure for liquidating the sentence by the Company has been initiated. It should be noted that, even before the said sentence, the competitor handled an action to cancel the registration of the cultivar, but, so far, there has been no decision in this process capable of restricting the Company's right.",

The counterparty pleads the execution of a put option clause (imposing the ownership and acquisition of barges) supposedly provided for in the contract as a penalty for early termination, as well as for the payment of alleged losses and damages suffered as a result of the termination. Suzano, in turn, claims that the put option is not due and, even if it had been due, the put option clause is abusive within the economic relationship under the contract. The demand was judged partially valid and the parties decided to enter into an agreement, which had already been approved on September 11, 2023 by the Arbitration Court, bringing this arbitration to an end.\n- (iv) The Company is still a defendant in 2 ('two') ACPs, filed in 2015 by the Federal Public Ministry ('MPF') and the National Institute for Colonization and Agricultural Reform ('INCRA') against the merged subsidiary Fibria, from the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo and BNDES, aiming at nullifying some property titles granted by the State to the Company in the municipalities of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Barra and S\u00e3o Mateus. The decisions, issued by the judge of the 1 instance of Federal Justice, declare the these titles invalid and demanded the return of these properties to the State. The decisions rendered are not final, and the Company has filed appropriate appeals for the reversal of this decision in the 2 instance. It is important to highlight that the properties whose titles were discussed in the ACPs add up to a total of approximately 10,500 hectares, and of this total, according to Suzano's best information, only approximately 4,000 hectares are included in the demarcation procedures initiated by INCRA in favor of quilombola communities in the region. None of these demarcation procedures has been finalized. Suzano is the legitimate owner of the properties under discussion, and will continue to discuss the matter in court, in order to prove in court the legality of the acquisitions made at the time of acquisition. st nd\n- (v) Among the environmental lawsuits, 1 ('one') ACPs filed by the MPF in the northeast region of Brazil stand out, challenging the jurisdiction of the state environmental agency to grant environmental licenses. The MPF alleges that the environmental licensing procedures related to our industrial plant in the state  of  Maranh\u00e3o  must  be  carried  out  by  the  Federal  Environment  Agency  ('IBAMA').  The  risks  involved  are  delays  to  the  Company's  planting schedule, and the suspension of activities at the Maranh\u00e3o industrial unit until a new license is issued. We believe that there are good chances of defense in this case, since IBAMA does not recognize that it has the competence to execute the licensing process, and there is no clear legal basis to support such jurisdiction.\n- (vi) In addition, the Company are involved in 1 ('one') ACP filed by the MPF regarding the negative impacts of operations in the Baixo Parna\u00edba Region. The MPF claims that the occupation of these areas caused socio-environmental impacts in eastern Maranh\u00e3o. Currently, the action is in the preparatory phase, with the beginning of the expert procedures. The Company believes that there is a remote chance of loss in this case, since the report used to support the requests was made unilaterally, and will be questioned during the expert investigation.\n\n## 21.

This plan is called Basic Contribution 1.\n\nThe  Company's  contributions  to  the  employees  are  0.5%  of  the  nominal  salary  that  does  not  exceed  10  URS,  even  though  there  is  no  contribution  by  the employees. This plan is called Basic Contribution 2.\n\nFrom August 2020, employees who have a salary lower than 10 URS will be able to invest 0.5% or 1.0% of their nominal salary, and the Company will monitor the employee's contributions. The employee can choose to invest up to 12% of their salary in the Suzano Prev pension plan, and the excess of Basic Contribution 1 or 2 may be invested in the supplementary contribution, where there is no counter-entry from the Company, and the employee must consider the two contributions within the limit of 12% of the salary.\n\nAccess to the balance constituted by the Company's contributions only occurs upon dismissal, and is directly related to the length of the employment relationship.\n\nContributions made by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled R$18,342 recognized under employee benefits (R$15,248 as of December 31, 2022, including the balance from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Senador Jos\u00e9 Erm\u00edrio de Moraes - Funsejem, terminated in July 2020).\n\nThe Company offers the following post-employment benefits in addition to the pension plans, which are measured based on actuarial calculations and recognized in the financial statement, as detailed below.\n\n## 21.2.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023    , the Company has 3 (three) share-based, long-term compensation plans: (i) Phantom stock option plan ('PS'); (ii) Share Appreciation Rights ('SAR'), both settled in local currency; and (iii) restricted shares, settled in shares.\n\nThe characteristics and measurement method of each plan are disclosed below.\n\n## 22.1. Long term compensation plans ('PS and SAR')\n\nCertain executives and key members of Management have a long-term compensation plan linked to the share price, with payment in cash.\n\nUnder the PS plan, the beneficiary does not make any investments, and under the SAR plan, the beneficiaries should invest 5% of the total amount corresponding to the number of options on phantom shares at the grant date, and 20% after 3 (three) years to acquire the option. The Company also granted long-term incentive plans to its key members as part of its retention policy.\n\nThe vesting period of options may vary from 3 (three) to 5 (five) years, as of the grant date, in accordance with the characteristics of each plan.\n\nThe share price is calculated based on the average share quote for the 90 previous trading sessions, starting from the closing quote on the last business day of the month prior to the month of the grant. The installments of these programs will be adjusted by the variation in the prices on the SUZB3 at B3, between the granting and the payment period. On dates when the SUZB3 shares are not traded, the quote of the previous trading session will be considered.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plan associates the quantity of restricted shares granted to the Company's performance, which in 2023 was linked to the operating cash generation and culture, diversity and inclusion target. The quantity of the restricted stock granted is defined in financial terms, and is subsequently converted into shares based on the last 60 (sixty) stock exchange trading days on December 31, 2023 of SUZB3 at B3.\n\nAfter the measurement of the target, which takes place 12 months after the execution of the contract, the restricted shares will be granted immediately (conditional on the achievement of the established goals), as they do not have to comply with the vesting period. However, the beneficiaries of the grant must comply with the lockup period of thirty-six (36) months during which they will not be able to sell the shares.",

Measurement assumptions\n\nIn the case of the phantom shares plans since the settlement takes place in cash, the fair values of the options are remeasured at the end of each period based on the Monte Carlo Method, which is multiplied by the Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') during the period, which varies between 75% and 125%, depending on the performance of SUZB3 in relation to its peers in Brazil.\n\nThe restricted stock plan considers the following assumptions:\n\n- (i) The expectation of volatility was calculated for each exercise date, considering the remaining time to complete the vesting year, as well as the historical volatility of returns, using the GARCH model for calculating volatility;\n- (ii) The expected average life of phantom stocks and stock options was defined by the remaining term to the limit exercise date;\n- (iii) The expected dividends were defined based on the historical earnings per share of Suzano; and\n- (iv) The risk-free weighted average interest rate used was the Brazilian Reais yield curve (DI expectation) observed on the open market, which is the best comparison basis for the Brazilian market risk-free interest rate. The rate used for each exercise date changes according to the vesting year.",

It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, our bylaws, Brazilian Corporate Law and any other applicable law concerning Brazilian companies, as amended from time to time.\n\nA copy of our bylaws is attached to our annual report as Exhibit 1.1. We encourage you to read our bylaws and the applicable sections of our annual report for additional information.\n\n## Share Capital\n\nOur capital stock is composed of common shares, all without par value and denominated in reais . As of December 31, 2023 our share capital, including shares in treasury, was represented by 1,324,117,615 common shares.\n\nIn addition to the negotiation in the U.S., as detailed in item II below, our common shares are negotiated on the B3 (ticker symbols SUZB3). All of our shares are registered  in  book-entry  form  on  behalf  of  their  holders,  without  share  certificates,  and  Ita\u00fa  Corretora  de  Valores  S.A.  performs  services  of  safe-keeping  and transfer of shares. To make the transfer, Ita\u00fa Corretora de Valores S.A. makes an entry in the register, debits the share account of the transferor and credits the share account of the transferee.\n\nPursuant to CVM regulations, any Brazilian public company's (i) direct or indirect controlling shareholders, (ii) shareholders who have elected members of such company's board of directors or fiscal council, as well as (iii) any person or group of persons representing the same interest, in each case that has directly or indirectly acquired or sold an interest that exceeds (either upward or downward) the threshold of 5%, or any multiple thereof, of the total number of shares of any type or class, must disclose such shareholder's or person's share ownership or divestment, immediately after the acquisition or sale, to the CVM and the B3.\n\n## Changes to Our Share Capital\n\nEach of our shareholders has a general preemptive right to subscribe for shares or convertible securities in any capital increase, in proportion to its shareholding, except  (i)  by  sale  on  a  stock  exchange  or  by  public  subscription,  (ii)  pursuant  to  an  exchange  for  shares  in  a  public  offer  for  the  acquisition  of  control,  in accordance with the Brazilian Corporate Law, (iii) for subscription of shares in accordance with the special law for tax incentives, (iv) conversion of debentures and other securities into shares, since, in these cases, the preemptive right must be exercised when the security is issued, (iv) in the event of the grant and exercise of any stock option to acquire or subscribe for shares of our capital stock; and (v) in the context of a capital increase derived from merger, merger of shares and/or spin-off  implemented  according  to  Brazilian  Corporation  Law. A  minimum  period  of  30  days  following  the  publication  of  notice  of  the  issuance  of  shares  or convertible securities is allowed for exercise of the right, and the right is negotiable. However, according to our bylaws, our board of directors can eliminate this preemptive right or reduce the 30-day period in case we issue debentures that are convertible into shares, warrants ( b\u00f4nus de subscri\u00e7\u00e3o ) or shares within the limits authorized by the bylaws and the Brazilian Corporate Law: (i) through a stock exchange or through a public offering or (ii) through an exchange of shares in a public offering to acquire control of another publicly-held company.\n\nAny  shareholders'  resolution  must  satisfy  the  quorum  and  all  other  legal  requirements  established  in  the  Brazilian  Corporate  Law  and  in  our  bylaws.  No shareholder is liable to make any further contribution to our capital stock other than with respect to the liability to pay the issue price of the shares subscribed or acquired by such shareholder.",

        "page_content": "## Dividends\n\nOur dividend payments are subject to the provisions of Brazilian Corporate Law, applicable local laws and regulations and our bylaws. Our distributions can include dividends or interest on net equity ( juros sobre capital pr\u00f3prio ). The payment of interest on net equity is subject to withholding income tax, pursuant to Brazilian tax laws, which is not levied upon payments of dividends.\n\nThe profits  are  distributed  in  proportion  to  the  number  of  shares  owned  by  each  shareholder  on  the  applicable  record  date.  In  accordance  with  the  Brazilian Corporation Law, our bylaws require that we distribute annually to our shareholders a mandatory minimum dividend, which we refer to as the mandatory dividend, equal  to  at  least  25%  of  our  net  income  after  taxes,  after  certain  deductions,  including  accumulated  losses  and  any  amounts  allocated  to  employee  and management participation, any amount allocated to our legal reserve, and any amount allocated to the contingency reserve and any amount written off in respect of the contingency reserve accumulated in previous fiscal years, in each case in accordance with Brazilian law.\n\nPayments of dividends for each fiscal year or payment of interest on net equity must be within 60 days from the shareholders' meeting in which the distribution was approved, unless a shareholders' resolution determines another date, not later than the end of the fiscal year in which such dividend was declared.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law permits, however, a company to suspend the mandatory distribution of dividends if its board of directors reports to the shareholders' meeting that the distribution would be incompatible with the financial condition of the company, subject to approval by the shareholders' meeting and review by the fiscal council.\n\nThe  amounts  available  for  distribution  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Brazilian Corporation Law. In addition, amounts arising from tax incentive benefits or rebates are appropriated to a separate capital reserve in accordance with the Brazilian Corporation Law. This investment incentive reserve is not normally available for distribution, although it can be used to absorb losses under certain circumstances or be capitalized. Amounts appropriated to this reserve are not available for distribution as dividends.\n\nThe Brazilian Corporation Law permits a company to pay interim dividends out of preexisting and accumulated profits for the preceding fiscal year or semester, based on financial statements approved by its shareholders. We may prepare financial statements semiannually or for shorter periods. Our board of directors may declare a distribution of dividends based on the profits reported in semiannual financial statements. Our board of directors may also declare a distribution of interim dividends based on profits previously accumulated or in profits reserve, which are reported in such financial statements or in the last annual financial statement approved by resolution taken at a shareholders' meeting.\n\nIf any dividend has not been claimed for 3 years after the date such dividend became due for payment, it will be forfeited and will revert to us.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nOur annual shareholders' meeting takes place at our headquarter, in Bahia, Brazil, in April of each year. Additionally, our board of directors or, in some specific situations set forth in Brazilian Corporate Law, our shareholders or our fiscal council, may call our extraordinary shareholders' meetings.\n\nHolders of our common shares are entitled to one voting right for each unit of common shares held.",

        "page_content": "Generally, the quorum required to hold shareholders' meetings is at least \u00bc of our issued and outstanding common shares, except as provided for by Brazilian Corporate Law and our bylaws in relation to decisions regarding certain matters. Decisions are made by simple majority, except where Brazilian Corporate Law or our bylaws provide for a different quorum.\n\nCertain matters require majority quorum for approval, including any amendment to our bylaws and the issuance of new shares. In addition, the appointment of a specialized firm to prepare an appraisal report of our shares in case of cancellation of our registration as a publicly-held company requires a special quorum, pursuant to the terms of B3 regulations.\n\nUnder Brazilian Corporate Law, minority shareholders representing at least 5% of our voting capital stock have the right to demand a cumulative voting procedure to elect a member of our board of directors.\n\n## Restrictions on Non-Brazilian Holders\n\nThere are no restrictions on ownership of our common shares by individuals or legal entities domiciled outside Brazil. Foreign investors may trade their shares through ADSs on the NYSE or directly on the B3.\n\nHowever, the right to convert dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of common shares into foreign currency and to remit such amounts outside Brazil is subject to exchange control restrictions and foreign investment legislation, which generally require, among other things, obtaining an electronic registration with the Central Bank of Brazil. Nonetheless, any non-Brazilian holder who registers with the CVM may use the dividend payments and proceeds from the sale of shares to buy and sell securities directly on the B3.\n\n## Liquidation Rights\n\nWe can only be dissolved by shareholders' resolution passed by at least 50% of our share capital. In the event of our liquidation, after payment of all liabilities, the balance of assets available for distribution will be distributed among the shareholders, each receiving a sum on a pro rata basis.\n\n## Right to Withdraw\n\nSubject to Brazilian Corporate Law, our shareholders have the right to withdraw their equity interests and receive the relevant payment for their shares in case such shareholders are adversely affected by specific resolutions from shareholders' meeting, as well as if after a corporate reorganization involving us, the resulted entity  does not negotiate new shares in the secondary market. This withdraw right may be exercised by dissenting or non-voting shareholders, if the relevant resolution is authorized by the vote of at least 50% of voting shares.\n\nThe right of withdrawal lapses 30 days after publication of the minutes of the relevant shareholders' meeting. We would be entitled to reconsider any action giving rise to withdrawal rights within 10 days following the expiration of such rights if the withdrawal of shares of dissenting shareholders would jeopardize our financial stability.\n\nGiven that our bylaws do not provide for rules to determine any value for redemption, any redemption of shares arising out of the exercise of such withdrawal rights would be made generally based on the book value per share, determined on the basis of the last balance sheet approved by our shareholders. However, if a shareholders' meeting giving rise to redemption rights occurred more than 60 days after the latest approved balance sheet, the shareholders would be entitled to demand that their shares be valued based on a more updated balance sheet.",

A material participation is defined in Suzano's bylaws as a stake equal to 20% or more of the total number of Suzano shares.\n\nThe price per share of a tender offer in the event of the acquisition of a material participation will correspond to the higher of the following values: (i) the economic value of Suzano Shares determined in a valuation report; and (ii) 145% of the highest price per Suzano Share during the 24-month period prior to the tender offer, corrected by the SELIC rate up to the time of payment.\n\nCarrying out the tender offer above will not exclude the possibility of a third party submitting a competing tender offer, in accordance with applicable law.\n\nFor the purposes of calculating the percentage of 20% of the total of shares issued by us, involuntary increases of equity interest resulting from the cancellation of shares  in  treasury  or  redemption  of  shares  will  not  be  computed.  The  tender  offer  will  not  be  applicable  to  direct  and  indirect  controlling  shareholders  on September 29, 2017 and their successors (as defined in our bylaws).\n\nIn  the  event  that  a  person  does  not  comply  with  the  tender  offer  obligations  described  above,  our  board  of  directors  must  call  an  extraordinary  shareholders' meeting, in which such person is not allowed to vote, in order to resolve on the suspension of the rights held by such person.\n\n## Delisting from the Novo Mercado\n\nSee Item 10. 'Additional Information - B - Delisting from the Novo Mercado' of our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Delisting as Publicly-Held Company\n\nSee Item 10.

The ADSs representing common shares are traded with ticker symbol SUZ.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon acts as depositary for our ADSs ('BNYM'). In its capacity, the depositary will register and deliver the ADSs, each representing an ownership interest in one common share deposited with the custodian, as agent of the depositary, under the amended and restated deposit agreement dated December 10, 2018 between us, the depositary, and registered holders and beneficial owners from time to time of the ADSs (the 'Deposit Agreement'), and (ii) any other securities, cash or other property which may be held by the depositary.\n\nThe principal executive office of BNYM is currently located at 240 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10286, United States of America and the office at which the ADSs will be administered is currently located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, United States of America.\n\nYou may hold ADSs either directly or indirectly through your broker or other financial institution. If you hold ADSs directly, by having an ADS registered in your name on the books of the depositary, you are an ADS holder. If you hold the ADSs through your broker or financial institution nominee, you must rely on the procedures of such broker or financial institution to assert the rights of an ADS holder described in this section. You should consult with your broker or financial institution to find out what those procedures are.\n\nHolders of ADSs may not be able to exercise the preemptive rights relating to the common shares underlying their ADSs, unless a registration statement under the Exchange Act is effective with respect to those rights.\n\nThe depositary will be the holder of the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs. As a holder of ADSs, you will have ADS holder rights, which are set out in the Deposit Agreement. The Deposit Agreement also sets out the rights and obligations of the depositary.\n\n## Share Dividends and Other Distributions\n\nWe may make various types of distributions with respect to our common shares, as detailed below. The depositary has agreed that, to the extent practicable, it will pay to ADS holders the dividends or other distributions it or the custodian receives on common shares, making any necessary deductions provided for in the Deposit Agreement. The depositary may utilize a division, branch or affiliate of BNYM to direct, manage and/or execute any public and/or private sale of common shares under the Deposit Agreement. Such division, branch and/or affiliate may charge the depositary a fee in connection with such sales, which fee is considered an expense of the depositary. ADS holders will receive these distributions in proportion to the number of underlying common shares that such ADSs represent. Except as stated below, the depositary will deliver such distributions to ADR holders in proportion to their interests in the following manner:",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Cash. The depositary will convert any cash dividend or other cash distribution we pay on the shares into U.S. dollars, if it can do so on a reasonable basis and can transfer the U.S. dollars to the United States. If that is not possible or if any government approval is needed and cannot be obtained, the deposit agreement allows the depositary to distribute the foreign currency only to those ADS holders to whom it is possible to do so. The depositary will hold the foreign currency it cannot convert for the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid. The depositary will not invest the foreign currency and it will not be liable for any interest. Before making a distribution, any withholding taxes, or other governmental charges that must be paid will be deducted. The depositary will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round fractional cents to the nearest whole cent. If the exchange rates fluctuate during a time when the depositary cannot convert the foreign currency, ADS holders may lose some of the value of the distribution.\n- \u00b7 Shares. The depositary may distribute additional ADSs representing any shares we distribute as a dividend or free distribution. The depositary will only distribute  whole ADSs. The depositary will  sell  shares  which  would  require  it  to  deliver  a  fraction  of  a ADS  (or ADSs  representing  those  shares)  and distribute the net proceeds in the same way as it does with cash. If the depositary does not distribute additional ADSs, the outstanding ADSs will also represent the new shares. The depositary may sell a portion of the distributed shares (or ADSs representing those shares) sufficient to pay its fees and expenses in connection with that distribution.\n- \u00b7 Rights to purchase additional shares. If we offer holders of our securities any rights to subscribe for additional shares or any other rights, the depositary may (i) exercise those rights on behalf of ADS holders, (ii) distribute those rights to ADS holders or (iii) sell those rights and distribute the net proceeds to ADS holders, in each case after deduction or upon payment of its fees and expenses. To the extent the depositary does not do any of those things, it will allow the rights to lapse. In that case, ADS holders will receive no value for them. The depositary will exercise or distribute rights only if we ask it to and provide satisfactory assurances to the depositary that it is legal to do so. If the depositary will exercise rights, it will purchase the securities to which the rights relate and distribute those securities or, in the case of shares, new ADSs representing the new shares, to subscribing ADS holders, but only if ADS holders have paid the exercise price to the depositary. U.S. securities laws may restrict the ability of the depositary to distribute rights or ADSs or other securities issued on exercise of rights to all or certain ADS holders, and the securities distributed may be subject to restrictions on transfer.",

It  may  decide  to  sell  what  we  distributed  and  distribute  the  net proceeds, in the same way as it does with cash.

This means that ADS holders may not receive the distributions we make on our shares or any value for them if it is illegal or impractical for us to make them available to you.\n\n## Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation\n\nThe depositary will deliver ADSs if investors or their broker deposits shares or evidence of rights to receive shares with the custodian. Upon payment of its fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will register the appropriate number of ADSs in the names requested and will deliver the ADSs to or upon the order of the person or persons that made the deposit.\n\nADS holders may surrender their ADSs to the depositary for the purpose of withdrawal. Upon payment of depositary's fees and expenses and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees, the depositary will deliver the shares and any other deposited securities underlying the ADSs to the ADS holder or a person the ADS holder designates at the office of the custodian. Or, at the ADS holder request, risk and expense, the depositary will deliver the deposited securities at its office, if feasible. However, the depositary is not required to accept surrender of ADSs to the extent it would require delivery of a fraction of a deposited share or other security. The depositary may charge a fee and its expenses for instructing the custodian regarding delivery of deposited securities.\n\nInvestors may surrender their ADR to the depositary for the purpose of exchanging ADRs for uncertificated ADSs. The depositary will cancel that ADR and will send to the ADS holder a statement confirming that the ADS holder is the registered holder of uncertificated ADSs. Upon receipt by the depositary of a proper instruction from a registered holder of uncertificated ADSs requesting the exchange of uncertificated ADSs for certificated ADSs, the depositary will execute and deliver to the ADS holder an ADR evidencing those ADSs.",

        "page_content": "The depositary may only restrict the withdrawal of deposited securities in connection with the reasons set forth in General Instruction I.A.(1) of Form F-6 under the Securities Act of 1933:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary delays caused by closing our transfer books or those of the depositary or the deposit of common or preferred shares in connection with voting at a shareholders' meeting, or the payment of dividends;\n- \u00b7 the payment of fees, taxes and similar charges; or\n- \u00b7 compliance with any U.S. or foreign laws or governmental regulations relating to the ADRs or to the withdrawal of deposited securities.\n\nThis right of withdrawal may not be limited by any other provision of the Deposit Agreement.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nHolders of the ADSs do not have the same voting rights as holders of our shares. Holders of the ADSs are entitled to the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the Deposit Agreement.\n\nADS holders may instruct the depositary how to vote the number of deposited shares their ADSs represent. If we request the depositary to solicit ADS holders voting instructions (and we are not required to do so), the depositary will notify you of a shareholders' meeting and send or make voting materials available to you. Those materials will describe the matters to be voted on and explain how ADS holders may instruct the depositary how to vote. For instructions to be valid, they must reach the depositary by a date set by the depositary. The depositary will try, as far as practical, subject to the laws of Brazil and the provisions of our bylaws or similar documents, to vote or to have its agents vote the shares or other deposited securities as instructed by ADS holders. If we do not request the depositary to  solicit  your  voting  instructions, ADS  holders  can  still  send  voting  instructions,  and,  in  that  case,  the  depositary  may  try  to  vote  as  you  instruct,  but  it  is  not required to do so. Except by instructing the depositary as described above, ADS holders won't be able to exercise voting rights unless they surrender their ADSs and withdraw the shares. However, ADS holders may not know about the meeting enough in advance to withdraw the shares. In any event, the depositary will not exercise  any  discretion  in  voting  deposited  securities  and  it  will  only  vote  or  attempt  to  vote  as  instructed,  as  set  forth  in  the  amended  and  restated  deposit agreement.\n\nWe cannot assure ADS holders that they will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that they can instruct the depositary to vote their shares. In addition, the depositary and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions. This means that ADS holders may not be able to exercise voting rights and there may be nothing they can do if their shares are not voted as requested. In order to give ADS holders a reasonable opportunity to instruct the depositary as to the exercise of voting rights relating to securities deposited with the Depositary as part of our ADR program, if we request the Depositary to act, we agree to give the depositary notice of any such meeting and details concerning the matters to be voted upon at least 45 days in advance of the meeting date.\n\n## Amendment and Termination\n\nWe may agree with the depositary to amend the amended and restated deposit agreement and the ADRs without your consent for any reason. If an amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes and other governmental charges or expenses of the depositary for registration fees, facsimile costs, delivery charges or similar items, or prejudices a substantial right of ADS holders, it will not become effective for outstanding ADSs until 30 days after the depositary notifies ADS holders of the amendment. At the time an amendment becomes effective, you are considered, by continuing to hold your ADSs, to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the ADRs and the amended and restated deposit agreement as amended.",

        "page_content": "The depositary will initiate termination of the deposit agreement if we instruct it to do so. The depositary may initiate termination of the deposit agreement if: (i) 60 days have passed since the depositary told us it wants to resign but a successor depositary has not been appointed and accepted its appointment; (ii) we delist our  shares  from  an  exchange  on  which  they  were  listed  and  do  not  list  the  shares  on  another  exchange;  (iii)  we  appear  to  be  insolvent  or  enter  insolvency proceedings;  (iv)  all  or  substantially  all  the  value  of  the  deposited  securities  has  been  distributed  either  in  cash  or  in  the  form  of  securities;  (v)  there  are  no deposited  securities  underlying  the ADSs  or  the  underlying  deposited  securities  have  become  apparently  worthless;  or  (vi)  there  has  been  a  replacement  of deposited securities.\n\nIf the deposit agreement will terminate, the depositary will notify ADS holders at least 90 days before the termination date. At any time after the termination date, the depositary may sell the deposited securities. After that, the depositary will hold the money it received on the sale, as well as any other cash it is holding under the deposit agreement, unsegregated and without liability for interest, for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders that have not surrendered their ADSs. Normally, the depositary will sell as soon as practicable after the termination date.\n\nIf the depositary is advised by counsel that it could be subject to material legal liability because we failed to provide information required by Brazilian regulators, the depositary may terminate the amended and restated deposit agreement on as little as 15 days' notice.\n\nAfter the termination date and before the depositary sells, ADS holders can still surrender their ADSs and receive delivery of deposited securities, except that the depositary may refuse to accept a surrender for the purpose of withdrawing deposited securities or reverse previously accepted surrenders of that kind if it would interfere with the selling process. The depositary may refuse to accept a surrender for the purpose of withdrawing sale proceeds until all the deposited securities have been sold. The depositary will continue to collect distributions on deposited securities, but, after the termination date, the depositary is not required to register any transfer of ADSs or distribute any dividends or other distributions on deposited securities to the ADSs holder (until they surrender their ADSs) or give any notices or perform any other duties under the amended and restated deposit agreement except as described in this paragraph.\n\n## Limitations on Obligations and Liability to ADS Holders\n\nPrior to the issue, registration, registration of transfer, split-up, combination, or cancellation of any ADRs, or the delivery of any distribution in respect thereof, and from time to time in the case of the production of proofs as described below, we or the depositary or its custodian may require:\n\n- \u00b7 payment with respect thereto of (i) any stock transfer or other tax or other governmental charge, (ii) any stock transfer or registration fees in effect for the registration of transfers of common shares or other deposited securities upon any applicable register and (iii) any applicable fees and expenses described in the Deposit Agreement;\n- \u00b7 the production of proof satisfactory to it of (i) the identity of any signatory and genuineness of any signature and (ii) such other information, including without  limitation,  information  as  to  citizenship,  residence,  exchange  control  approval,  beneficial  or  other  ownership  of,  or  interest  in,  any  securities, compliance with applicable law, regulations, provisions of or governing deposited securities and terms of the Deposit Agreement and the ADRs, as it may deem necessary or proper; and\n- \u00b7 compliance with such regulations as the depositary may establish consistent with the Deposit Agreement.",

It is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by the respective indentures, any supplement to such indentures, the instruments representing each series of the Notes and any applicable law, as amended from time to time. Certain terms, unless otherwise defined here, have the meaning given to them in the relevant indenture.\n\nWe encourage you to read the indentures governing the Notes, as well as the applicable sections of our annual report for additional information.\n\n## General\n\nAny debt securities issued by Suzano Austria or Suzano Netherlands is governed by a document called an indenture. The indenture is a contract entered into between any one of us, and a trustee, currently Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the 'Trustee'), as well as us, as guarantor and as successor of Fibria Celulose S.A. ('Fibria'). The Trustee has the following main roles:\n\n- (i) first,  the  trustee  can  enforce  debt  securities  holders'  rights  against  us  if  we  default  on  our  obligations  under  the  indenture  or  the  debt  securities, although there are some limitations on the extent to which the trustee acts on debt securities holders behalf that are described under '-Events of Default'; and\n- (ii) second, the trustee performs administrative duties for the debt securities holders, such as sending payments and notices to debt securities holders.\n\nSuzano Austria will issue debt securities guaranteed by Suzano under an indenture we refer to as the Suzano Austria indenture. Suzano Netherlands will issue debt securities guaranteed by Suzano under an indenture we refer to as the Suzano Netherlands indenture.\n\nTogether or separately, Suzano Austria, Suzano Netherlands and us may issue as many distinct series of debt securities under our indentures as are authorized by the corporate bodies that are required under applicable law and our corporate organizational documents to authorize the issuance of debt securities. Specific issuances of debt securities will also be governed by a supplemental indenture, an officer's certificate or a document evidencing the authorization of any such corporate  body.  This  summary  contains  material  terms  of  the  debt  securities  that  are  common  to  all  series  and  to  each  of  the  indentures,  unless  otherwise indicated in this Exhibit 2.4 and in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series.\n\nAs  listed  in  the  table  above,  until  December  31,  2023  we  have  7  outstanding  Notes  issued  in  U.S.  dollar,  which  were  all  based  on  the  following  4  different indentures, as applicably amended: (i) indenture entered into by Suzano Austria and the Trustee on September 20, 2018 ('2018 Suzano Austria Base Indenture'); (ii)  indenture entered into by Suzano Austria and the Trustee on May 29, 2019 ('2019 Suzano Austria Base Indenture'); (iii) indenture entered into by Suzano Austria and the Trustee on January 24, 2020 ('2020 Suzano Austria Base Indenture' and, together with the 2018 Suzano Austria Base Indenture and the 2019 Suzano Austria  Base  Indenture,  the  'Suzano Austria  Base  Indentures');  (iv)  indenture  entered  into  by  Suzano  Netherlands,  as  successor  of  Fibria  Overseas Finance, and the Trustee on May 12, 2014 ('2014 Suzano Netherlands Base Indenture'); and (v) indenture entered into by Suzano Netherlands, as successor of Fibria  Overseas, and the Trustee on November 14, 2017 ('2017 Suzano Netherlands Base Indenture' and, together with the 2014 Suzano Netherlands Base Indenture, 'Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures').",

        "page_content": "In addition, as result of a merger of Fibria into us, on April 1, 2019, we assumed all of Fibria's obligations under the Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures. Also, as provided for in, and permitted by, the Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures, on September 1, 2023, Suzano Netherlands assumed all of Fibria Overseas Finance's obligations under the Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures. Terms such as 'Suzano,' the 'Company,' 'we,' 'us' and 'our' as used in this Exhibit 2.4 shall refer to Suzano itself, together with its subsidiaries (including Fibria Overseas Finance, Suzano Netherlands and Suzano Austria) or as Fibria's successor, as the case may be.\n\nEach of the indentures and their associated documents contain the full legal text of the matters described herein. We have agreed that New York law governs the indentures and the debt securities. We have filed a copy of all applicable indentures with the SEC as exhibits to our respective registration statements. We have consented in each indenture to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any U.S. federal court sitting in the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, United States and any appellate court from any thereof.\n\n## Types of Debt Securities\n\nThis section summarizes material terms of the debt securities that are common to all series and to the Suzano Austria and Suzano Netherlands indentures, unless otherwise indicated in this section or in the prospectus supplement relating to a particular series.\n\nBecause this section is a summary, it does not describe every aspect of the debt securities. This summary is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to all  the  provisions of the indentures, including the definition of various terms used in the indentures. For example, we describe the meanings for only the more important terms that have been given special meanings in the indentures.\n\nWe may issue original issue discount securities, which are debt securities that are offered and sold at a substantial discount to their stated principal amount. We may also issue indexed securities or securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, currency units or composite currencies, as described in more detail in the prospectus supplement relating to any such debt securities. We will describe the U.S. federal income tax consequences and any further specific U.S. federal income tax consequences and any other special considerations applicable to original issue discount, indexed or foreign currency debt securities in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIn addition, the material financial, legal and other terms particular to a series of debt securities will be described in the prospectus supplement relating to that series. Those terms may vary from the terms described here. Accordingly, this summary also is subject to and qualified by reference to the description of the terms of the series described in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nIn addition, the prospectus supplement will state whether we will list the debt securities of the series on any stock exchanges and, if so, which ones.\n\n## Form, Exchange and Transfer\n\nThe  notes  will  be  issued,  unless  otherwise  indicated  in  the  applicable  prospectus  supplement,  in  fully  registered  form  without  interest  coupons,  in  minimum denominations of U.S.$200,000, in case of the 2018 Suzano Austria Base Indenture and the 2019 Suzano Austria Base Indenture, or U.S.$2,000 in case of the Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures and any integral multiples of U.S.$1,000 thereof, and minimum denominations of U.S.$1,000 in case of the 2020 Suzano Austria Base Indenture and integral multiples thereof. The debt holders may have the debt securities broken into more debt securities of smaller denominations or combined into fewer debt securities of larger denominations, as long as the total principal amount is not changed. This is called an exchange.",

        "page_content": "Debt holders may exchange or transfer their registered debt securities at the office of the trustee. The Trustee will maintain an office in New York, New York. The trustee  acts  as  our  agent  for  registering  debt  securities  in  the  names  of  holders  and  transferring  registered  debt  securities.  The  entity  performing  the  role  of maintaining the list of registered holders is called the ' security registrar .' It will also register transfers of the registered debt securities.\n\nHolders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange debt securities, but may be required to pay any tax or other governmental charge associated with the registration of transfer or exchange. The transfer or exchange of a registered debt security will only be made if holders have duly endorsed the debt security or provided the security registrar with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory in form to the security registrar.\n\nIf we designate additional transfer agents, they will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We may cancel the designation of any particular transfer agent. We may also approve a change in the office through which any transfer agent acts or choose to act as our transfer agent.\n\nIf  the  debt securities are redeemable and we redeem less than all of the debt securities of a particular series, we may block the transfer or exchange of debt securities in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing during the period beginning 15 days before the day we mail the notice of redemption and ending on the day of that mailing. We may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of debt securities selected for redemption. However, we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any debt security being partially redeemed.\n\n## Payment and Paying Agents\n\nDebt securities in registered form, will have interest paid to the direct holder listed in the trustee's records at the close of business on a particular day in advance of each due date for interest, even if such holder no longer own the security on the interest due date. That particular day is called the 'regular record date' and will be stated in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n\nWe will pay interest, principal (and premium, if any) and any other money due on global registered debt securities pursuant to the applicable procedures of the depositary or, if the debt securities are not in global form, at our office or agency maintained for that purpose in New York, New York. We may also choose to pay interest by mailing checks. For the Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures, upon application by a holder to the specified office of the trustee or any paying agent not less than 10 business days before the due date for any payment in respect of a debt security, such payment may be made by transfer to a U.S. dollar account maintained by the holder with a bank in New York City. We may also arrange for additional payment offices, and we may cancel or change our use of these offices, including our use of the trustee's corporate trust office. These offices are called ' paying agents .' We may appoint paying agents outside the United States for a specific issuance of securities. We may also choose to act as our own paying agent.\n\nRegardless of who acts as paying agent, all money that we pay as principal, premium or interest to a paying agent, or then held by us in trust, that remains unclaimed at the end of two years after the amount is due to a direct holder will, subject to any unclaimed property laws, be repaid to us or (if then held in trust) discharged from trust. After that two-year period, direct holders may look only to us for payment and not to the trustee, any other paying agent or anyone else.\n\n## Notices\n\nWe and the trustee will send notices only to direct holders, using their addresses as listed in the registrar's records. In addition, if the debt securities of a series are listed on a securities exchange, we will provide notice to the holders in accordance with the applicable rules of such exchange.",

Each indenture provides that there are changes to the indenture that cannot be made without the approval of each holder of the outstanding debt securities affected thereby. Those types of changes include:\n- \u00b7 reduce the rate of interest on any debt security or extend the stated maturity of any payment of interest on any debt security;\n- \u00b7 reduce the principal amount of any debt security or extend the stated maturity of any payment of principal of (and premium, if any, on) any debt security;\n- \u00b7 reduce the amount payable upon the redemption of any debt security (i) for the Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures, or change the time at which any debt security may be redeemed; or (ii) for the Suzano Austria Base Indentures, in respect of an optional redemption, change the times at which any debt security may be redeemed or, once notice of redemption has been given, change the time at which it must thereupon be redeemed;\n- \u00b7 a change in the currency of any payment on a debt security or its place of payment;\n- \u00b7 an impairment of the holder's right to sue for payment of any amount due on a debt security;\n- \u00b7 a reduction in the percentage in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities the consent of the holders of which is needed to modify or amend the indenture or a debt security or waive compliance with various provisions of the indenture; and\n- \u00b7 Specifically for Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures:\n- \u00b7 a waiver of specified defaults in payment of principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest on a debt security;\n- \u00b7 amend any provisions of the payment obligations under guarantees in a manner that would materially and adversely affect the holders; and\n- \u00b7 make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require each holder's consent.\n\nIt  is  not  necessary for holders of the debt securities to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, supplement or waiver, but is sufficient if their consent approves the substance thereof.\n\nNeither Suzano nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates may, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any consideration, whether by way of interest, fee or otherwise, to any holder for or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the indentures or the debt securities unless such consideration is offered to be paid or agreed to be paid to all holders of the debt securities that consent, waive or agree to amend such term or provision within the time period set forth in the solicitation documents relating to the consent, waiver or amendment.",

Each indenture provides that there are changes to the indenture that do not require any approval by holders of outstanding debt securities under that indenture. Those types of changes include:\n- \u00b7 to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture or the debt securities;\n- \u00b7 to comply with the covenant described under the caption '-Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Substantially All Assets';\n- \u00b7 to evidence and provide for the acceptance of an appointment by a successor trustee;\n- \u00b7 to provide for uncertificated debt securities in addition to or in place of Certificated debt securities;\n- \u00b7 to provide for any guarantee of the debt securities, to secure the debt securities or to confirm and evidence the release, termination or discharge of any guarantee of or Lien securing the debt securities when such release, termination or discharge is permitted by the indenture;\n- \u00b7 to provide for or confirm the issuance of additional debt securities; or\n- \u00b7 to make any other change that does not materially, adversely affect the rights of any holder or to conform the indenture to this 'Description of the Debt Securities' or the 'Description of the Notes' in the applicable prospectus supplement.\n- 3)  Changes  Requiring  a  Majority  Vote.  Each  indenture  provides  that  other  changes  to  the  indenture  and  the  outstanding  debt  securities  under  the  indenture requires the approval by the holders of debt securities that together represent a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the particular series affected. This approval  would  also  be  required  for  us  to  obtain  a  waiver  of  all  or  part  of  any  covenants  described  below  under  '-Certain  Covenants  of  Suzano'  or  in  the applicable prospectus supplement, for us to obtain a waiver of a past default, or to rescind or annul a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee if subject to the conditions described in 'Events of Default -Remedies Upon an Event of Default.' The required approval must be given by written consent. However, we cannot obtain a waiver of a payment default or any other aspect of an indenture or the debt securities issued under that indenture described above under '-Changes Requiring Each Holder's Approval' unless we obtain the consent of all holders of the debt securities issued under that indentures to the waiver.\n\n## Further Details Concerning Voting\n\nDebt securities will not be considered outstanding, and therefore the holders of those debt securities will not be eligible to vote or take other action under the applicable indenture, if we have deposited or set aside in trust for the holders money for their payment or redemption. Debt securities will also not be eligible to vote or take other action under the applicable indenture if they have been defeased as described under '-Defeasance and Discharge.' Debt securities held by us, Suzano Austria, Suzano Netherlands or our affiliates are not considered outstanding.",

If a record date is set for a vote or other action to be taken by holders of a particular series, that vote or action may be taken only by persons who are holders of outstanding debt securities of that series on the record date and must be taken within 180 days following the record date or another period that we or, if it sets the record date, the trustee may specify. This period may be shortened or lengthened (but not beyond 180 days).\n\nStreet name and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how approval may be granted or denied if we seek to change the indenture or the debt securities or request a waiver.\n\n## Redemption\n\nUnless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund; that is, we will not deposit  money  on  a  regular  basis  into  any  separate  custodial  account  to  repay  the  debt  securities.  In  addition,  other  than  as  set  forth  in  '-Optional  Tax Redemption' below, unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, we will not be entitled to redeem the debt securities before their stated maturity.\n\nIf the applicable prospectus supplement specifies a redemption date, it will also specify one or more redemption prices, which may be expressed as a percentage of the principal amount of your debt security or by reference to one or more formulae used to determine the redemption price. It may also specify one or more redemption periods during which the redemption prices relating to a redemption of debt securities during those periods will apply.\n\nIf the applicable prospectus supplement specifies a redemption commencement date, we may redeem the debt securities at our option at any time on or after that date. If we redeem the debt securities, we will do so at the specified redemption price, together with interest accrued to the redemption date. If different prices are specified for different redemption periods, the price we pay will be the price that applies to the redemption period during which the debt securities is redeemed. If less than all of the debt securities are redeemed at any time, the trustee will authenticate and deliver to the holder of such debt securities without service charge, a new debt security or securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the debt security so surrendered. If less than all of the debt securities are redeemed, the debt securities to be redeemed will be determined in accordance with the applicable procedures of the depositary.\n\nIn the event that we exercise an option to redeem any debt securities, we will give to the trustee and the holders written notice of the principal amount of the debt securities  to  be  redeemed,  not  less  than  five  business  days  nor  more  than  60  days  for  the  Suzano Austria  Base  Indentures  or  60  business  days  for  Suzano Netherlands Base Indentures, before the applicable redemption date.

This is called 'covenant defeasance.' In that event, you would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection of having money and securities set aside in trust to repay the debt securities.

If an event of default has occurred and has not been cured, the trustee or the holders of 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series may declare the entire principal amount of all the debt securities of that series to be due and immediately payable. This is called a declaration  of  acceleration  of  maturity.  If  an  event  of  default  occurs  because  of  certain  events  in  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or  reorganization,  or  an  equivalent proceeding under the applicable law, the principal amount of all the debt securities of that series will be automatically accelerated without any action by the trustee, any holder or any other person. A declaration of acceleration of maturity may be canceled by the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of the affected series.\n\nExcept in cases of default, where the trustee has some special duties, the trustee is not required to take any action under the indenture at the request of any holders unless the holders offer the trustee satisfactory security or indemnity from expenses and liability. If satisfactory indemnity is provided, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of the relevant series may direct the time, method and place of conducting any lawsuit or other formal  legal  action  seeking  any  remedy  available  to  the  trustee.  These  same  holders  may  also  direct  the  trustee  in  performing  any  other  action  under  the indenture.\n\nBefore you bypass the trustee and bring your own lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce your rights or protect your interests relating to the debt securities, the following must occur:\n\n- \u00b7 You must give the trustee written notice that an event of default has occurred and remains uncured.\n- \u00b7 The holders of 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of the relevant series must make a written request that the trustee take action because of the default, and must offer satisfactory indemnity or security to the trustee against the cost and other liabilities of taking that action.\n- \u00b7 The trustee must have not taken action for 60 days after receipt of the above notice and offer of indemnity or security.\n- \u00b7 The holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of the relevant series must not have given the trustee a direction during the sixty-day period that is inconsistent with the above notice.",

If this happens, the default will be treated as if it had not occurred.

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federative Republic of Brazil, and the reader shall consider the 'Definitions,' which clarify and complete the text of this Agreement and is part of Appendix I hereto.\n- 6.2.

The  Conflict  Notice  shall  always  be  sent  by  the  interested  party  to  the  party(ies)  involved  in  the  Conflict  with  a  copy  to  all  other Shareholders. If the parties try to resolve the dispute through mediation, any of the parties may start the mediation following the Mediation Procedure of the Arbitration and Mediation Center of the Brazil-Canada Chamber of Commerce ('CAM/CCBC').\n- 6.3. Rules. After the period established in Clause 6.2.1 above, or in the event of the impossibility of reaching an amicable solution, the interested party shall submit the dispute to Arbitration, which shall be started and processed in accordance with the CAM/CCBC Arbitration Rules ('Rules'), in effect on the date of institution of the arbitration request. The CAM/CCBC shall conduct the arbitration procedure. Any controversy related to the start of arbitration process shall be settled in a definitive and binding manner by the Arbitrators.\n- 6.4. Participation of all Shareholders. Regardless of the Conflict to be settled through Arbitration, all Shareholders shall participate in it either as a party (when the dispute involves them directly as applicant, respondent or counterclaimant), or as an interested third party. Similarly, the arbitration award shall be  definitive  and  binding  on  all  Shareholders,  regardless  of  refusal,  by  any  of  them,  to  participate  in  an  arbitration  procedure,  either  as  a  party  or interested  third  party.  The  interested  party  to  start  the Arbitration  shall  notify  the  other  party(ies)  involved  in  the  Conflict  of  their  decision  to  start  the Arbitration ('Arbitration Notice'), with copy to the Shareholders who are not involved in the Conflict, if applicable. The Shareholders not involved in the Conflict shall reply to the Arbitration Notice within five (5) days as from receipt of the Arbitration Notice, indicating whether they will participate as a party in the Conflict or participate in the Arbitration as an interested third party. If no reply is sent to the Arbitration Notice, it is assumed that the Shareholder will participate as an interested third party.\n- 6.5. Arbitrators. The arbitration tribunal is formed by three (3) arbitrators ('Arbitrators'), and one is appointed by the applicant(s) and the other by the respondent(s), in accordance with the Rules. In the event of participation of Shareholders as interested third parties, they shall appoint an Arbitrator jointly with the applicant(s) or respondent(s), as applicable. The two (2) Arbitrators appointed by the parties shall choose jointly the third Arbitrator, who shall preside over the arbitration tribunal.

Each  Shareholder  is  the  owner  of  the  shares  identified  in Appendix  II  of  this Agreement  ('Attached  Shares'),  issued  by  SUZANO  PAPEL  E CELULOSE  S.A.,  inscribed  in  the  roll  of  corporate  taxpayers  (CNPJ/MF)  under  number  16.404.287/0001-55  ('Company'),  which  are  free  of Encumbrances, except as otherwise described in Appendix II. For the purposes of this Agreement, Attached Shares also include: (i) shares resulting from bonuses attributed to Attached Shares, from the splitting or grouping of the Attached Shares; (ii) preemptive rights arising from the Attached Shares; (iii) shares arising from the exchange, conversion, merger (including of shares), consolidation, spin-off or other type of corporate reorganization and, in any case, arising from the Attached Shares; or (iv) new shares subscribed to in the exercise of preemptive rights attributed to the Attached Shares, as well as warrants, options and other securities attributed to the Attached Shares and convertible into shares issued by the Company.\n- 2.1.1. Attached Shares do not include, restrict or encumber shares issued by the Company and/or its successors that are held or that come to be held by Shareholders and/or Successors who are not on the list in Appendix II and/or arising therefrom, in accordance with Clause 2.1.\n- 2.2.    The Shareholders recognize that the Attached Shares compose or may compose directly or indirectly the Controlling group of the Company and, in the latter's interest, irrevocably agree to restrict their Transfer and the constitution of Encumbrance on them, as stated herein.\n- 2.3.    This Agreement binds the Attached Shares and, consequently, the Shareholders, their respective spouses, partners, curators, heirs, devisees and successors who become, for any reason, holders of the Attached Shares and/or the voting rights inherent to them (including in the case of an interdict and/or minor Shareholder represented by a curator or board of curators) (jointly referred to as 'Successors'). In the event of the death of any Individual who is or comes to be a Shareholder of the Company, their Successors shall assume all the rights and obligations of the deceased Individual provided for in this Agreement, as a member of the same Shareholder Group of the deceased. This assumption shall be automatic in the event of legal or testamentary succession, and the corresponding Successor shall inherit the Attached Shares in accordance with this Agreement, as well as everything attached thereto (ownerships, encumbrances, rights and obligations), in accordance with all the terms and conditions agreed upon by the Shareholders. The same rule also applies to the spouse and/or partner in the event of the division of assets arising from a separation, divorce and/or dissolution of steady union. In the case of judicial interdiction of the Shareholder or minority (absolutely or relatively incompetent), the curator or curators (in the case of a board) are equally obligated and bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the legal provisions, personal statements (in public or private written documents) regarding guardianship of the interdicted person or minor.\n\n## III.

The Proposal shall contain the irrevocable commitment by the Offeror Third Party to  acquire  the  Offered Attached  Shares for  the  net  and  exact  price,  payable  at  sight,  in  an  amount  not  less  than  the  Proposed Transfer Amount  and adjusted as provided for above, conditioned, exclusively, upon the non-exercise of the Right of First Refusal by the Offeree Shareholders in accordance with Clause 3.3 below, and upon the audit process and/or anti-trust regulatory approval, if applicable, and valid for a minimum period of ninety (90) days as from the date of its submission to the Offeree Shareholders.

POLICY FOR THE\n\n## RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n\n- 1. Purpose. The purpose of this Policy is to describe the circumstances in which Executive Officers will be required to repay or return Erroneously Awarded Compensation  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  Clawback  Rules.  Each  Executive  Officer  shall  be  required  to  sign  and  return  to  the  Company  the Acknowledgement and Acceptance Form attached hereto as Exhibit A pursuant to which such Executive Officer will acknowledge that he or she is bound by the terms of this Policy; provided, however, that this Policy shall apply to, and be enforceable against, any Executive Officer and his or her successors (as specified in Section 10 of this Policy) regardless of whether or not such Executive Officer properly signs and returns to the Company such Acknowledgement and Acceptance Form and regardless of whether or not such Executive Officer is aware of his or her status as such.\n- 2. Administration. Except as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Administrator. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be prior approved by the Board to be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by this Policy. Subject to any limitation under applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee).\n- 3. Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\n- (a) ' Accounting Restatement '  shall  mean  an  accounting  restatement:  (i)  due  to  the  material  noncompliance  of  the  Company  with  any  financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (a 'Big R' restatement); or (ii) that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a 'little r' restatement).\n- (b) ' Administrator ' shall mean the Committee.\n- (c) ' Board ' shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.\n- (d) ' Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation ' shall mean, with respect to each individual who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the  applicable  performance  period  for  any  Incentive-based  Compensation  (whether  or  not  such  individual  is  serving  as  an  Executive  Officer  at  the  time  the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is required to be repaid to the Company), all Incentive-based Compensation Received by such individual: (i) on or after the Effective Date; (ii) after beginning service as an Executive Officer; (iii) while the Company has a class of securities listed on the Listing Exchange; and (iv) during the applicable Clawback Period.\n- (e) ' Clawback  Period '  shall  mean,  with  respect  to  any  Accounting  Restatement,  the  three  completed  fiscal  years  of  the  Company  immediately preceding the Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company's fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.",

(and as the Board determines is applicable, together with each of its direct and indirect subsidiaries).\n- (i) ' Effective Date ' shall mean October 2, 2023.\n- (j) ' Erroneously Awarded Compensation ' shall mean, with respect to each Executive Officer in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\n- (k) 'Executive Officer' shall mean any individual who is or was indicated as an statutory executive officer as appointed in accordance to the Article 18 of the Bylaws of the Company and any other individual that may be considered by the Board an 'Executive Officer' in accordance to the Item 303A.14 of the Listed Company Manual of NYSE.\n- (l) ' Exchange Act ' shall mean the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n- (m) ' Financial Reporting Measures ' shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return shall for purposes of this Policy be considered Financial Reporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, a Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company's financial statements or included in a filing with the SEC.\n- (n) ' Incentive-based Compensation ' shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n- (o) ' Impracticable ' shall mean, in accordance with the good faith determination of the majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, that either: (i) the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy against an Executive Officer would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Erroneously Awarded Compensation, documented such reasonable attempt(s) and provided such documentation to the Listing Exchange; (ii) recovery would violate Brazilian law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before concluding that it would be Impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of Brazilian law, the Company has obtained an opinion of Brazilian counsel, acceptable to the Listing Exchange, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to the Listing Exchange; or (iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.",

For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered received when the Financial Reporting Measure is achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition.\n- (t) ' Restatement Date ' shall mean the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officer or officers of the Company authorized  to  take  such  action  if  Board  action  is  not  required,  concludes,  or  reasonably  should  have  concluded,  that  the  Company  is  required  to  prepare  an Accounting Restatement; or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\n- (u) ' SEC ' shall mean the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n## 4. Repayment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n\n- (a) In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator shall reasonably promptly (in accordance with the applicable  Clawback Rules) determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Executive Officer in connection with such Accounting Restatement  and  shall  reasonably  promptly  thereafter  provide  each  Executive  Officer  with  written  notice  containing  the  amount  of  Erroneously  Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as applicable. For Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return  where  the  amount  of  Erroneously  Awarded  Compensation  is  not  subject  to  mathematical  recalculation  directly  from  the  information  in  the  applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be determined by the Administrator based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock  price  or  total  shareholder  return  upon  which  the  Clawback  Eligible  Incentive  Compensation  was  Received  (in  which  case,  the  Company  shall  maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Listing Exchange). The Administrator is authorized to engage, on behalf of the Company, any third-party advisors it deems advisable in order to perform any calculations contemplated by this Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, recovery under this Policy with respect to an Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Executive Officer or such Executive Officer being found responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement.",

For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent permitted pursuant to the Clawback Rules, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer's obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to  take  the  actions  contemplated  in  this  Section  4(b)  if  recovery  would  be  Impracticable.  In  implementing  the  actions  contemplated  in  this  Section  4(b),  the Administrator will act in accordance with the listing standards and requirements of the Listing Exchange and with the applicable Clawback Rules.\n- (c) Subject to the discretion of the Board and as calculated by the Administrator an applicable Executive Officer may be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with Section 4(b).\n- (d) Reporting and Disclosure. The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of U.S. federal securities laws, including any disclosure required by applicable SEC rules.\n- 5. Indemnification  Prohibition.  The  Company  shall  not  be  permitted  to  indemnify  any  Executive  Officer  against  the  loss  of  any  Erroneously  Awarded Compensation  that  is  repaid,  returned  or  recovered  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Policy  and/or  pursuant  to  the  Clawback  Rules,  including  any  payment  or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Executive Officer to cover any such loss under this Policy and/or pursuant to the Clawback Rules. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation from the application of this Policy or that waives the Company's right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date). Any such purported indemnification (whether oral or in writing) shall be null and void.\n- 6. Interpretation. The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Clawback Rules. The terms of this Policy shall also be construed and enforced in such a manner as to comply with applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and any other law or regulation that the Administrator determines is applicable. In the event any provision of this Policy is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be applied to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required by applicable law.\n- 7. Effective Date. This Policy shall be effective as of the Effective Date.",

Amendment; Termination. The Board may modify or amend this Policy, in whole or in part, from time to time in its discretion and shall amend any or all of the provisions of this Policy as it deems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally required by the Clawback Rules, or any federal securities law, SEC rule or Listing Exchange rule. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time, and this Policy shall remain in effect only so long as the Clawback Rules apply to the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8 to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate  the  Clawback  Rules,  or  any  federal  securities  law,  SEC  rule  or  Listing  Exchange  rule.  Furthermore,  unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Board  or  as otherwise amended, this Policy shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner necessary to comply with any change in the Clawback Rules.\n- 9. Other Recoupment Rights; No Additional Payments. The Board and the Administrator intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The Board may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement, or any other agreement entered into on or after the Effective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require an Executive Officer to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Executive Officers shall be deemed to have accepted continuing employment on terms that include compliance with the Policy, to the extent of its otherwise applicable provisions, and to be contractually bound by its enforcement provisions. Executive Officers who cease employment or service with the Company shall continue to be bound by the terms of the Policy with respect to Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, cash-based bonus plan, equity award agreement or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. To the extent that an Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. Nothing in this Policy precludes the Company from implementing any additional clawback or recoupment policies with respect to Executive Officers or any other service provider of the Company. Application of this Policy does not preclude the Company from taking any other action to enforce any Executive Officer's obligations to the Company, including termination of employment or institution of civil or criminal proceedings or any other remedies that may be available to the Company with respect to any Executive Officer.\n- 10. Successors. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, estates, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives to the extent required by the Clawback Rules or as otherwise determined by the Board.",
