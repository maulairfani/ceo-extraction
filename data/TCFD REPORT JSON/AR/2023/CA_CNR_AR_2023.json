In 2023, we did so despite a number of external challenges, from climate-related impacts to our network and our customers' operations, to labour disruptions at Canada's vital West Coast ports. We also managed through a meaningful decline in demand, and a volatile economic and geopolitical environment that saw high inflation, rising interest rates, and changing trade flows.\n\nThroughout 2023, our disciplined scheduled operating model drove improved efficiency and resiliency, and enabled a higher, more reliable level of customer service. With this solid foundation of operational and service excellence, the strong leadership of Tracy Robinson and the management team, and the commitment and engagement of our nearly 25,000 employees, we are well positioned to accelerate sustainable, profitable growth.\n\nThe Board remains steadfast in our commitment to ensure leading governance practices and we are confident in the Company's strategic direction.\n\n## strong governance\n\nOver the past year, we continued to focus on several critical areas: strategy, growth, operational performance and safety, and enterprise risk management. And given the economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we sought to challenge our own thinking, taking a dynamic and continuous improvement approach to our governance.\n\nOur work encompassed ongoing oversight of capital allocation, management, and efficiency to ensure our investments are well aligned with our growth plan, deployed in the most strategic areas, and earning the appropriate returns. We took an enterprise-level approach to evaluating our risks, our risk tolerance, and our mitigation capabilities. We reviewed our strategic enablers, including the development and evolution of our talent and culture, employee engagement, stakeholder and Indigenous\n\nrelations, and our overall approach to sustainability. We also brought in external experts to inform our thinking and our approach on emerging issues, risks, and opportunities, and to make sure we are anticipating scenarios that could impact our Company and our people.\n\nWith respect to climate change, CN remains firmly committed to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and our annual advisory vote on the Company's Climate Action Plan reinforces that commitment. The advisory vote complements our long-standing and robust climate change plans and disclosures, our public reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as our year-over-year progress, and our strategy to reduce emissions.\n\nWhen it comes to stakeholder and Indigenous relations, we understand our important responsibilities to the diverse mix of customers and geographies we serve, and to the communities along our network. Given the increasing complexity of our operating environment and our desire to grow, 2023 afforded us the opportunity to refresh our stakeholder and Indigenous engagement strategy with the aim to deepen our relationships and to further build trust and reciprocity. An important step in our journey towards reconciliation with Indigenous peoples was our issuance of a formal acknowledgement of the historical role railways played as instruments of colonial policies. We are now developing a Reconciliation Action Plan, which we plan to release in 2024 and which will include specific, measurable targets that support our reconciliation journey.",

We have further refined and aligned our Board and Committee agendas to ensure that we are spending the necessary time and focus on the right strategic topics.\n\nIn addition to benefiting from dialogue and engagement with external experts, the Board also had the opportunity to engage with customers, employees, shareholders, and our Indigenous communities, and to benefit from continued director education. Collectively and individually, Board members have responded to the changing environment with additional training in areas that include climate change, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. I am grateful for my Board colleagues' diligence and commitment. I am confident that we have the right skills and diversity around the table to work constructively, ask the right questions, and hold each other and the management team accountable, with integrity and transparency.\n\nThe Board remains steadfast in our commitment to ensure leading governance practices and we are confident in the Company's strategic direction.\"\n\n## thank you\n\nI want to thank our employees, customers, shareholders, the communities in which we operate, and other stakeholders for their insight and ongoing support and collaboration.\n\nAs your Chair and on behalf of every member of the Board of Directors, thank you for your continued trust and support as we work to accelerate sustainable, profitable growth and fulfill our purpose to power the economy today and into the future.\n\nWe encourage you to join us at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on April 26, 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shauneen Bruder\n\nChair of the Board\n\n## Recognized for governance and sustainability leadership\n\nCN is proud to have our governance and sustainability best practices recognized. The 2023 Globe and Mail 's Report on Business evaluated the work of Canada's corporate boards using a strict set of governance criteria, and CN's Board of Directors was recognized for its performance and ranked first place among companies listed on the S&P/TSX Composite Index. We earned a leadership score from the global environmental non-profit CDP for our dedication to corporate transparency and performance on tackling climate change. We have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World Index for 12 consecutive years, and the DJSI North America Index for 15 consecutive years. And, CN was honoured to be recognized by the 2024 S&P Global Yearbook as one of the top sustainability performers in the transportation industry.",

Through planning, strategic investments and relentless execution, we maintained the reliability, efficiency and resilience of our network, despite a landscape filled with challenges.\n\nThese challenges manifested in various forms for CN from a record Canadian wildfire season, floods and labour disruptions at ports, to evolving trade flows and a decline in demand that impacted our entire industry. Despite these obstacles, our team rallied together, demonstrating resiliency and an unwavering commitment to serve our customers and move the economy.\n\n## safety\n\nSafety remains at the heart of everything we do. And while we achieved continued improvement in key metrics, we cannot celebrate these milestones, as we also mourned the tragic loss of two colleagues. Mohammed Khan and John Thornton were both fatally injured while on duty last year. Our deepest sympathies go out to their families, friends and colleagues. The best way for us to honour our fallen colleagues is to continue to prioritize safety, every minute of each and every day. This takes leadership and a safety culture that embraces and embeds commitment, not simply compliance. We are also leaning into advancements in technology alongside comprehensive training and development and near-miss reporting to support our aspiration of zero harm.\n\n## sustain and build service excellence\n\nWe have made unique and innovative structural changes to further integrate and align our teams and to entrench the 'Make the Plan, Run the Plan, Sell the Plan' model. This allows us to balance what we need to be successful today\n\nwhile driving equal focus on what we need to win in the longer term. Within Operations, we created a Chief Field Operations Officer position and Chief Network Operating Officer position to acknowledge two distinct responsibilities, and we named highly experienced leaders to these roles.\n\nAt the core of our operations is our planning process, orchestrated by our Network Operations team. They optimize our rail network and 'Make the Plan,' ensuring seamless operations and alignment with customer demands through continuous refinement. Patrick Whitehead is responsible for the Operations teams who 'Make the Plan' by optimizing volumes for our entire network and looking ahead to ensure we are set up for future growth with the right network, assets and crew resources.\n\nDerek Taylor is accountable for leading the teams that 'Run the Plan,' as it takes a lot of day-to-day focus to keep our trains moving safely and on time. Our Field Operations team assumes responsibility to ensure that trains depart on time, making trains meet efficiently and reducing dwell times, keeping us on schedule, maximizing asset utilization and fostering consistency and predictability in customer service.\n\nWe constantly review our performance to align our performance with our objectives. We look at metrics such as velocity, dwell times, origin and destination train performance. I'm happy to report that in 2023, velocity improved by 9%, dwell times by 8%, Origin Train Performance by 12.6% and Destination Train Performance by 18%.",

We work closely with our customers to understand where they want to grow and how that traffic fits our network. This lets us determine the best plan, as well as the best ways to build out our network capacity, assets and people to enable that growth. In some cases, we have capacity available. In other cases, we may need to come together in different ways with other supply chain partners. Our network is well positioned to benefit from shifting trade flows and emerging markets both within North America and globally. Whether it's new energy sources, the electrification of vehicles, working with other railroads to provide best-in-class cross-continental connections, expanding existing connections, or acquiring existing assets to offer more options for shippers, our Company continues to provide opportunities for customers to win in their markets. Our Local Service Commitment Plan, or LSCP, which measures our performance with our customers, was up 11%. We are also investing in tools and technology, including CN One, that improve our customers' ease of doing business with us.\n\nAs part of our succession planning, Remi G. Lalonde was appointed as Executive Vice-President and Special Advisor to the CEO, in anticipation of his transition in 2024 to Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) - a critical role in overseeing our talented Commercial team to 'Sell the Plan' and deliver our growth agenda.\n\n## grow our people\n\nOur railroaders are the engine who drive our success today and in the future. We want to be the best company to work for, and across the organization, we are evolving our way of working to be more innovative and inclusive.\n\nIn the field, we are looking to evolve and improve our relationship with our unionized workforce and union leadership. We want them to benefit from the transformation our Company is undergoing by leveraging our model to improve their work-life balance and provide them with more predictable work schedules while ensuring our service levels remain strong.\n\nMore broadly, we aim to ensure our team reflects the communities where we operate and embraces the chance to make a difference and grow their careers. In the past year, we started to change some of the things we do and how we do them because we believe that everyone deserves a good leader, and everyone deserves development. In addition to our scheduled operations and structural changes, we are investing in the development and succession of our people, attracting the right talent, and empowering them to step in and act based on our clear values and strategic priorities, thus supporting their and our growth.\n\n## delivering responsibly\n\nWe have been railroading for over 100 years, and we aim to be here for at least 100 more. Delivering Responsibly is at the heart of how we are building for a sustainable future. Our vision is to be the safest and most carbon-efficient, operationally effective and customer-centric railroad in North America. Our sustainability commitment is anchored by five key pillars: Environment, Safety, People, Community, and Governance.\n\n## prepared for what's ahead\n\nWe are determined to accelerate sustainable, profitable growth by building on our scheduled railroading approach, capabilities and talent. We power the economy and aim to drive growth through CN specific initiatives, as well as from improving economic conditions.\n\nWe have the right operating model. We have the right people. We are committed to driving continued improvements in the safety and efficiency of our operations. And we are committed to continuing to provide the service that our customers need to grow in their markets.\n\nThank you,\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## make the plan\n\nRail networks are complex systems that require careful planning and execution to ensure trains run on time and reach their destinations safely. CN's Network Operations team is the plan architect. They create a plan that optimizes capacity for the entire network and makes the best use of operating assets like crews, locomotives, rolling stock and rail infrastructure. The team analyzes all volumes across the network to build the most efficient train plan to meet customer demand.\n\nBy continuously assessing volumes, train movements, and performance, CN refines the plan to minimize delays, optimizing customer service and efficiency. Network Operations also manages and directs the safe and effective movement of trains everywhere along our tracks. Having this coordinated and all-encompassing network plan makes it easier to adjust to volume fluctuations, deliver the level of service predictability our customers need and expect, and ensure the whole network is more resilient to disruptions, such as weather events or market challenges.\n\n## run the plan\n\nWhen it comes to running the plan, CN's Field Operations team focuses on execution. Trains need to depart on time and make their connections at the scheduled time with the correct blocks of cars. CN teams work hard to reduce dwell, or the time trains spend in our terminals and yards. When running on a schedule, it is critical that every train departs on time because its locomotives are expected at the next terminal to be put on another train with a new crew. The railcars are also planned for connections so the team can get them to customers on time. Strict adherence to the schedule drives higher asset velocity, more consistent utilization of power and crews, and more predictable and consistent customer service from the first to the last mile.\n\nThe plan is sacred. Together, our Network Operations and Field Operations teams refine the plan on a continuous basis. Coordination, communication and collaboration are key. Any changes are made with a view to optimizing the whole network.\n\nBy making and running a network-wide plan with discipline, we unlock additional capacity to safely move more goods and grow our network in the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## sell the plan\n\nBy making and running a network-wide plan with discipline, we unlock additional capacity to safely move more goods and grow our network in the future. CN's Commercial team sells into our available capacity. We sit down with customers to identify and plan what we can transport today, and then our Commercial team works in lockstep with their Operations colleagues to deliver on our commitments.\n\nWe also have in-depth conversations with our customers to understand their business cycles, trade flows and growth plans. This close collaboration with our customers and across our teams helps us strategically determine why, where, when and how to make the right investments to expand our network, build new capabilities or grow capacity in line with the needs of our customers. No matter if it means adding train starts, extending or laying new track, investing in additional equipment, or tapping existing corridors that have capacity, CN follows this rigorous and integrated process to win with our customers and to enable sustainable, profitable growth.",

The plan, along with our significant infrastructure investment, is responsive to customer needs, lets us sell into available capacity in the Eastern corridor, and keeps our network fluid.'\n\nDaniel Chan\n\nManager Business Development, CN\n\n'Our partnership with CN on the new rail terminal helps us efficiently utilize our fleet, safely move in-demand fuel products, and serve our customers in sustainable ways. It's a win-win.'\n\nMike Thompson President, Norcan\n\n## this is scheduled railroading\n\nOur scheduled railroading approach drove outstanding operating results in 2023. Car velocity was 213 miles per day, up 9% from the prior year. In fact, our velocity reached levels not seen since our record performance in 2016. Dwell time across all yards was 7.0 hours, an improvement of 8% from the prior year. Through a local service commitment plan (LSCP), CN measures if a customer receives the right cars and in the committed switch window. The LSCP measured 91% in 2023, compared with 80% in 2022.\n\nOf course, nothing is more important than safety. We recorded a 13% improvement in our injury frequency rate in 2023 versus 2022, and a 17% improvement in our accident rate over the same period. Our safety aspiration remains anchored in our commitment to eliminate injuries and accidents. Every minute of every day, our top priority is ensuring everyone returns home safely.\n\n## structured to sustain and build on our performance\n\nWe evolved our Operations structure in late 2023 to align with the distinct focus and capabilities required to develop our plan and the day-to-day demands of safely executing the plan. The restructuring embeds our 'Make the Plan, Run the Plan, Sell the Plan' approach in our business and will help us sustain our service and performance, while serving as a platform for growth as we move forward.\n\nPatrick Whitehead, Executive Vice-President and Chief Network Operating Officer, 'makes the plan,' leading Network Operations, Mechanical, Engineering and the corporate Safety team. Derek Taylor, Executive Vice-President and Chief Field Operations Officer, 'runs the plan,' with system-wide leadership for Transportation and Intermodal Operations. This innovative structure is intended to further integrate all teams in creating, executing and selling into the plan. It also allows us to remain focused on the intense day-to-day demands of running our network and maintaining our customer service levels. At the same time, it gives our team the ability to continuously optimize the overall network while looking ahead to determine future requirements when it comes to our workforce, track and other infrastructure investments, as well as operating technologies to support safety, growth and efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our ambition is to be the safest railroad in North America with an uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of our employees, the customers we serve, and the communities and environments in which we operate.\n\nWe aspire to ZERO. Our aim is to eliminate serious injuries and fatalities, and we are committed to providing the leadership, training and resources necessary to achieve our goals. To continually reinforce our safety culture, field employees participate in regular hands-on training and daily job safety briefings. Ongoing exposure reduction discussions and hazard inspections are also organized to identify any workplace and personal safety risks and to take any necessary and immediate corrective actions. Field employees also have a mobile technology application (Enablon Go) that enables real-time and voluntary, confidential reporting of near misses or safety hazards while helping CN take action and create a safer working environment (see sidebar). Since its deployment, multiple issues and potential hazards have been reported and addressed through Enablon Go.\n\nSince 2021, Operations employees have completed more than 8,800 Safety Leadership Training courses, which include workshops and ongoing in-field coaching with this basic tenet: Leaders create the culture, culture determines behaviour, and behaviour drives safety. This is helping instill a safety culture based on values versus compliance.\n\nIn June 2023, thousands of employees participated in CN's first Safety Week, which included meaningful opportunities to discuss safety and recognize each others' achievements and efforts to stay safe. CN senior executives also engaged shoulder to shoulder with field employees across the network. The week culminated with a Safety Celebration award ceremony to honour railroaders who have dedicated their careers to staying safe on our network and looking out for each other.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReal-time hazard and near-miss reporting technology\n\nCN's field employees have safety technology at their fingertips. A new mobile application enabling real-time safety reporting earned a 2023 Railway Association of Canada (RAC) Safety Award. Enablon Go lets field employees quickly report near misses or safety hazards while on-site, in real time. This enables us to take action, helping to ensure potential issues don't become injuries or accidents. The app captures GPS coordinates when employees report near misses or hazards - voluntarily and confidentially - into their mobile devices, and they can upload photo, video and audio files to provide additional information.

Technology systems and data analytics are helping us to better predict potential issues, helping to drive improved safety outcomes.\n\n## Wayside detection network\n\nWe are proactively monitoring the mechanical health of our trains to help prevent incidents before they happen. CN has an extensive wayside detection network, utilizing over 24 million data points per day across more than 2,800 detectors along our mainline, providing layers of protection to measure things like wheel bearing temperature and noise, wheel load impacts and any dragging equipment on the undercarriage of railcars. These detection technologies generate alarms and notifications, allowing CN to take action to address a problem in real time.\n\nTechnology systems and data analytics are helping us to better predict potential issues, helping to drive improved safety outcomes.\n\n## Autonomous Track Inspection Program\n\nCN has also installed powerful sensors and AI technology into our Autonomous Track Inspection Program (ATIP) railcars, which are positioned in regularly scheduled trains, enabling 24/7 track inspections at normal track speed. Using this technology, our 11 ATIP cars inspected over one million miles of track in 2023. In the future, CN intends to continue to upgrade our ATIP cars with new technologies like ground-penetrating radar to scan into the roadbed looking for soft spots.\n\n## Automated Inspection Portals\n\nOur Automated Inspection Portals (AIPs) feature ultra-high-definition panoramic cameras and high-intensity LED lighting that capture a full 360-degree view of the train and undercarriage as it travels at track speed through the portals for real-time inspection. This complements current manual railcar inspections and detector systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) then helps experienced railcar mechanics identify railcars needing repair before a train arrives at the yard. CN currently has seven AIPs in operation, contributing to increased safety, capacity and fluidity.\n\n## Electronic Track Authority Verification\n\nOur Electronic Track Authority Verification (ETAV) system is fully deployed across our network to help improve safety for our field employees who operate on-track inspection and repair equipment. Leveraging CN's Geospatial Information System (GIS), ETAV provides hi-rail vehicle operators with visual and audible alerts as they approach their track authority limits. ETAV complements existing processes that on-track equipment operators use to get permission from rail traffic controllers to access and work on tracks.",

Our team moves a balanced and diversified portfolio of products - fertilizers and grain that help feed the world, lumber and panels that support housing construction, raw materials that drive all kinds of manufacturing, as well as emerging commodities that are enabling the transition to a lower-carbon economy, and so much more. This commodity diversity positions CN to better weather economic fluctuations and enhances our ability to help us and our customers grow their business.\n\nOur network is also geared for growth, resiliency and speed, which is enabled by our disciplined scheduled railroading. We provide customers a transcontinental network with strong access to key natural resources, three-coast optionality and service through 22 inland rail terminals. For example, our bypass loop around Chicago saves up to 48 hours of transit time, and we have access to nine ports on three coasts with capacity to grow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## seizing unique growth opportunities\n\nCN is well positioned to develop end-to-end supply chain solutions and address global trade and commodity trends to support the growth and success of our customers. In 2023, we helped our customers take advantage of opportunities, and we took steps to be prepared for what's next.\n\n## New energy sources\n\nWorldwide efforts to combat climate change are driving demand shifts toward new energy sources like wood pellets, biofuels, propane and hydrogen. CN is a key player in these rapidly developing markets, creating hubs to consolidate products onto rail to support the overall supply chain and strengthen the green energy transition. For example, with Keyera, CN is jointly developing the Alberta Clean Energy (ACE) terminal, the most efficient rail logistics solution in the Alberta Industrial Heartland, where as many as nine new plants are planned to be built in the next decade. ACE will look to aggregate clean energy fuels, creating opportunities for CN to transport more goods, more efficiently to markets across North America and around the world.\n\nIn addition, CN is building a high-throughput fuel distribution centre at MacMillan Yard in the Greater Toronto Area. The new rail facility will receive imported lower-carbon fuels, like lower-carbon-intensity ethanol and renewable diesel. CN also plans to use renewable diesel for our locomotives. In 2023, CN also renewed and expanded a five-year transportation agreement with AltaGas, leveraging our exclusive access to the Port of Prince Rupert, while supporting AltaGas' ongoing resource development across Western Canada and providing its downstream customers with energy security to support economic activity.",

In partnership with Union Pacific (UP) and Ferromex (FXE), CN in 2023 launched the Falcon Premium intermodal service - a best-in-class, Mexico-U.S.-Canada route with seamless interconnection in Chicago. The service connects all CN origin points to FXE terminals in Monterrey and Silao, Mexico. Falcon Premium is the fastest, most reliable intermodal service between Canada and Mexico by combining the unique advantages of each partner: FXE's leading transit times between Silao and Eagle Pass, TX; UP's superior route from Eagle Pass to Chicago; and CN's time-saving Chicago bypass loop. This service directly benefits intermodal customers shipping automotive parts, food (especially temperature-controlled products), and freight of all kinds. Falcon Premium is also designed to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reduced rail miles and truck-to-rail conversion. For added optionality, CN is developing a partnership with Crowley Container Lines to provide a new intermodal vessel service called the Mexico Gulf Express, which offers competitive transit times and avoids congested borders. The marine highway service goes from the Port of Mobile (AL) to the recently modernized Port of Tuxpan in Mexico - the closest port to Mexico City. CN provides in-land service between Canada, the U.S. Midwest and Port of Mobile.\n\nFor the growing Southern U.S. markets, CN strengthened its partnership with Norfolk Southern (NS) to launch an all-rail domestic intermodal service. The new service links\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN-served Canadian markets with NS-served Kansas City and Atlanta, the heart of the fast-growing manufacturing and consumer base in the Southeastern U.S. With fast and dependable transit times, the solution works through interchanges in Detroit and Chicago to convert long-haul truck traffic to/from Kansas City and Atlanta to rail.\n\nCN is also expanding Gulf Coast connections for customers. CN is offering a new intermodal service to the Port of Gulfport (MS), providing shippers with new ocean-connectivity options to move goods between the U.S. Gulf Coast, U.S. Midwest and Canada. The service is in partnership with the Mississippi State Port Authority at Gulfport and Ports America.\n\nCN's three core terminals in Montreal, Toronto and Chicago touch about 70% of our intermodal business every day. Our commitment to the realization of CN's Milton Logistics Hub is steadfast, and we remain focused on obtaining all necessary approvals. This Hub is expected to provide additional and much-needed intermodal capacity in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area.\n\n## Strategic investments support our customers' growth plans\n\nCN is making strategic investments based on where our customers need or plan to grow. In 2023, for example, CN announced an agreement to acquire Iowa Northern Railway, which operates 175 route miles in Iowa, connects to CN's U.S. rail network, and serves Midwest agricultural and industrial markets, including grain and biofuels. The transaction, which is pending regulatory review with a decision expected in 2024, is aimed at supporting local business growth by creating a single-line service to North American destinations. In addition, CN acquired from Genesee & Wyoming, Inc., a stake in the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway that includes 150 route miles. The partnership reinforces CN's presence in Eastern Canada and enables longer-term growth opportunities.",

For example, CN is making a positive contribution in the urgent fight against climate change, and we are playing a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Rail has a tremendous potential to reduce the environmental impact of transportation services. Shipping heavy freight by rail can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 75% when compared to trucks. We are actively working with many of our customers to help them reduce their transportation supply chain GHG emissions by leveraging rail for the long haul and trucking over shorter distances. To further reduce GHG emissions, we are actively working with the industry on testing and exploring the greater use of sustainable renewable fuel blends, beyond regulated amounts, in our locomotives. Along with Progress Rail and Chevron Renewable Energy Group, we continue testing high-level renewable fuel blends, including both biodiesel and renewable diesel. In 2023, we also joined forces with another Class I railroad to share the costs and resources needed to test a blend of renewable fuels on two classes of locomotives. Through a modernization program with Wabtec, we announced an order to upgrade 60 additional locomotives in our fleet to further improve reliability, while reducing our rail carbon footprint. It will bring our total modernized fleet to 110 locomotives through this program.

As a Canadian reporting issuer with securities listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), CN ensures its corporate governance practices comply with the highest standards and rules adopted by the Canadian Securities Administrators, applicable provisions of the U.S. Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CN is exempted from complying with many of the NYSE corporate governance rules, provided it complies with Canadian governance requirements. Except as summarized on our website at www.cn.ca/governance, CN's governance practices comply with the NYSE corporate governance rules in all significant respects.\n\nConsistent with the belief that ethical conduct goes beyond compliance and resides in a comprehensive governance culture, CN publishes and enforces its Corporate Governance Manual, Code of Business Conduct, Anti-Corruption Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy. We also maintain several methods for employees and third parties to anonymously report accounting, auditing and other concerns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCN is proud of the leadership demonstrated by its Board of Directors with respect to diversity. In January 2024 CN established that moving forward it aspires to maintain a Board composition in which independent Board members are comprised of at least 40% of each gender (male and female) and at least two members come from the broader underrepresented groups, beyond gender. Currently, five out of 10, or 50% of independent Board members are women and two, or 20% of independent Board members are from underrepresented groups.\n\nCN has enhanced its stakeholder and rightsholder engagement approach, with an aim to further build trust, credibility, respect and reciprocity, while protecting our social license to operate. This includes our ongoing dialogue and engagement with Indigenous communities across our network. In 2023, as part of our Reconciliation journey, CN published a formal acknowledgement of the historical role railways played as instruments of colonial policies. CN also has a team of nine managers, with Indigenous and regional representation, who is working with CN leadership on creating a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) set to be released in 2024. CN is committed to continuing this journey, building awareness and understanding of Indigenous culture at CN, increasing economic opportunities and partnerships to grow CN's Indigenous supplier base, and establishing and strengthening our relationships to enhance our ability to attract Indigenous talent.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is aligned with international standards, including the United Nations Global Compact, the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, the World Bank Mobility Goals, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. These expectations are integrated into our five sustainability pillars: Environment, Safety, People, Communities, and Governance.\n\nFor more information on CN's sustainability disclosures, visit: www.cn.ca/en/delivering-responsibly/\n\nEarned 1st place out of 219 companies listed on the S&P/TSX Composite Index in 2023 for corporate governance with a score of 98% by the Globe and Mail .",

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. CN cautions that its assumptions may not materialize and that current economic conditions render such assumptions, although reasonable at the time they were made, subject to greater uncertainty.

All  financial  information reflected  herein  is  expressed  in  Canadian  dollars  and  prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles (GAAP), unless otherwise noted.\n\nCN's common shares are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Additional information about CN filed with Canadian securities regulatory authorities and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the Company's 2023 Annual Information Form and Form 40-F, may be found online on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov through EDGAR, and on the Company's website at www.cn.ca in the Investors section. Printed copies of such documents may be obtained by contacting CN's Corporate Secretary's Office.\n\n## Business profile\n\nCN is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. CN's network of 18,800 route miles of track spans Canada and the United States of America (U.S.), connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. South. CN's extensive network and efficient connections to all Class I railroads  provide  CN  customers  access  to  Canada,  the  U.S.  and  Mexico.  Essential  to  the  economy,  to  the  customers,  and  to  the communities it serves, CN safely transports more than 300 million tons of cargo annually, serving exporters, importers, retailers, farmers and manufacturers. CN and its affiliates have been contributing to community prosperity and sustainable trade since 1919. CN is committed to programs supporting social responsibility and environmental stewardship.\n\nCN's  freight  revenues  are  derived  from  seven  commodity  groups  representing  a  diversified  and  balanced  portfolio  of  goods  transported between  a  wide  range  of  origins  and  destinations.  This  product  and  geographic  diversity  better  position  the  Company  to  face  economic fluctuations  and  enhances  its  potential  for  growth  opportunities.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  CN's  largest  commodity  group, Intermodal, accounted for 23% of total revenues. From a geographic standpoint, 34% of revenues relate to overseas traffic, 32% to transborder traffic,  18%  to  Canadian  domestic  traffic  and  16%  to  U.S.  domestic  traffic.  The  Company  is  the  originating  carrier  for  over  85%,  and  the originating and terminating carrier for over 65%, of traffic moving along its network, which allows it both to capitalize on service advantages and build on opportunities to efficiently use assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Corporate organization\n\nThe Company manages its rail operations in Canada and the U.S. as one business segment. Financial information reported at this level, such as revenues,  operating  income  and  cash  flow  from  operations,  is  used  by  the  Company's  corporate  management  in  evaluating  financial  and operational  performance  and  allocating  resources  across  CN's  network.  The  Company's  strategic  initiatives  are  developed  and  managed centrally  by  corporate  management  and  are  communicated  to  its  regional  activity  centers  (the  Western  Region,  Eastern  Region  and  U.S. Region), whose role is to manage the day-to-day service requirements of their respective territories, control direct costs incurred locally, and execute the strategy and operating plan established by corporate management.\n\nSee Note 24 - Segmented information to  the  Company's  2023  Annual  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  additional  information  on  the Company's corporate organization, as well as selected financial information by geographic area.\n\n## 2023 Highlights\n\n## Financial results - 2023 compared to 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Revenues of $16,828 million, a decrease of $279 million, or 2%.\n- \u00b7 Operating income of $6,597 million, a decrease of $243 million, or 4%.\n- \u00b7 Operating ratio, defined as operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, of 60.8%, an increase of 0.8 points, or an increase of 0.9 points on an adjusted basis. (1)(2)\n- \u00b7 Net income of $5,625 million, an increase of $507 million, or 10% and adjusted net income of $4,800 million, a decrease of $334 million, or 7%. (1)(2)\n- \u00b7 Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $8.53, an increase of 15% and adjusted diluted EPS of $7.28, a decrease of 2%. (1)(2)\n- \u00b7 The Company generated free cash flow of $3,887 million, a 9% decrease. (1)(3)\n- \u00b7 ROIC of 16.8%, an increase of 1.0-point and adjusted ROIC of 14.5%, a decrease of 1.4 points. (1)(4)\n\n## Operating performance 2023 compared to 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Injury frequency rate at a record low of 0.96 (per 200,000 person hours), an improvement of 13%.\n- \u00b7 Accident rate of 1.74 (per million train miles), an improvement of 17%.\n- \u00b7 Through dwell of 7.0 (entire railroad, hours), an improvement of 8%.\n- \u00b7 Car velocity of 213 (car miles per day), an improvement of 9%.\n- \u00b7 Through network train speed of 19.8 (mph), an improvement of 5%.\n- \u00b7 Fuel efficiency of 0.874 (US gallons of locomotive fuel consumed per 1,000 gross ton miles (GTMs)), less efficient by 1%.\n- \u00b7 Train length of 7,891 (feet), a decrease of 3%.\n- \u00b7 Revenue ton miles (RTMs) of 232,614 (millions), a decrease of 1%.\n- (1)    These non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n- (2)     See the section of this MD&A entitled Non-GAAP measures Adjusted performance measures for an explanation of these non-GAAP measures.\n- (3)     See the section of this MD&A entitled Liquidity and capital resources - Free cash flow for an explanation of this non-GAAP measure.\n- (4)     See the section of this MD&A entitled Non-GAAP measures ROIC and adjusted ROIC for an explanation of these non-GAAP measures .\n\n## 2023 Financial outlook\n\nDuring the year, the Company issued and updated its 2023 financial outlook. The 2023 actual results were in line with the Company's last 2023 outlook that was updated on July 25, 2023.\n\n## Recent developments\n\n## Business acquisitions and combinations\n\nIowa Northern Railway Company\n\nOn December 6, 2023, the Company acquired the shares of the Iowa Northern Railway Company (IANR), a Class III short-line railroad that owns and leases approximately 175 route miles in northeast Iowa that are connected to CN's U.S. rail network. CN paid US$230 million ($312 million), including transaction costs to date. IANR serves upper Midwest agricultural and industrial markets covering many goods, including biofuels and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\ngrain.  This  transaction  represents a meaningful opportunity to support the growth of local business by creating single-line service to North American destinations, while preserving access to existing carrier options.\n\nThe shares of IANR were deposited into an independent voting trust while the U.S Surface Transportation Board (STB) considers the Company's application  to  acquire  control  of  IANR.  During  the  trust  period,  IANR  will  continue  to  be  operated  under  its  current  management  and  the Company cannot exercise day-to-day control. As a result, the Company recorded its investment in IANR at its acquisition cost under the equity method of accounting. Subject to final approval by the STB, the Company would obtain control of IANR and would account for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nOn the acquisition date of December 6, 2023, immediately prior to the acquisition, there was a basis difference of $236 million between the consideration paid to acquire IANR and the underlying carrying value of the net assets of IANR. The basis difference related to depreciable properties and if any, intangible assets with definite lives will be amortized over the related assets' remaining useful lives. The remainder of the basis difference, relating to land, intangible assets with indefinite lives if any, and equity method goodwill, would not be amortized and would be carried at cost subject to an assessment for impairment. The estimated fair value of IANR's underlying net assets is preliminary based on information available to the Company to date and subject to change over the measurement period, which may be up to twelve months from the acquisition date.\n\n## Cape Breton & Central Nova Scotia Railway\n\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company acquired from Genesee & Wyoming Inc. a stake in the Cape Breton & Central Nova Scotia Railway (CBNS), a Class III short-line railroad that owns approximately 150 route miles. CN paid $78 million in cash, net of cash acquired and including working capital adjustments. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. As a result, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the net assets of CBNS as of November 1, 2023, which were comprised of $101 million in fair value of properties mostly track and roadway assets, partly offset by $18 million in deferred tax liabilities. The remaining net assets were comprised of current assets and liabilities which were individually insignificant and there were no identifiable intangible assets. No goodwill was recognized. The fair value of CBNS's underlying net assets has been estimated on a preliminary basis and may be subject to change as additional information becomes available over the next twelve months.\n\n## Canadian regulatory update\n\nOn June 22, 2023, Bill C-47 an Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023, received Royal Assent and  the  proposed  amendments  to  the  Canada  Transportation  Act  were  adopted.  These  amendments  provide  for  the  extension  of  the interswitching limits located in the Prairie provinces from 30 kilometers to 160 kilometers. This extension will be in force for a trial period of 18 months. On November 24, 2023 the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) established interswitching rates for 2024. On December 22, 2023, the Company sought leave to appeal this decision on rates. No assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the Canadian federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## U.S. regulatory update\n\nOn September 7, 2023, the STB proposed new regulations for reciprocal switching for inadequate service. Under the STB's proposal, the new rule allows customers to obtain reciprocal switching access to an alternate carrier in a terminal area if the incumbent railroad's service falls below  one  of  three  objective  metrics  (original  estimated  time  of  arrival,  transit  time,  and  first-mile/last-mile  service)  and  if  certain  other conditions are met. The STB has proposed that if a reciprocal switch were granted for a facility in the United States, that switch would be available for a period between two to four years and could be renewed. In addition, the STB also closed consideration of a 2016 proposal to amend its existing regulations for reciprocal switching to increase competition, which was the subject of a public hearing in 2022. Comments were submitted in November and December 2023, and the STB members conducted meetings with stakeholders. No assurance can be given that these and any other current or future regulatory or legislative initiatives by the U.S. federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Labor workforce and negotiations - Canada\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the collective  agreement  with  Unifor  was  ratified  by  its  members,  renewing  the  collective  agreement  for  a  two-year  term, retroactive to January 1, 2023, which will expire on December 31, 2024. Unifor represents approximately 3,400 employees in Canada working in various departments such as Mechanical, Intermodal, Facility Management, and in clerical positions.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nOn May 26, 2023, the collective agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) was ratified by its members, renewing the collective agreement for a one-year term, retroactive to January 1, 2023, which expired on December 31, 2023. TCRC represents approximately 6,000 employees  in  Canada  working  as  Locomotive  Engineers,  Yard  Coordinators  and  Yard  Conductors  on  our  mainline,  short  lines  and  yards. Bargaining commenced on November 27, 2023.\n\nOn  September  6,  2023,  the  United  Steel  Workers  Union  (USW)  served  notice  to  commence  bargaining  for  the  renewal  of  the  collective agreement with the Company, governing approximately 2,500 bridge and structures and work equipment employees in Canada, which expired on December 31, 2023. Bargaining commenced on October 23, 2023.\n\nOn  January  17,  2024,  CN  reached  a  tentative  agreement  with  owner-operators  affiliated  with  Unifor.  The  four-year  agreement  covers approximately  750  owner-operator  truck  drivers  in  Canada  under  contract  with  Canadian  National  Transportation  Limited,  a  wholly  owned subsidiary of the Company, until December 31, 2027. Ratification by the membership is expected in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Company's collective agreements remain in effect until the bargaining process outlined under the Canada Labor Code has been exhausted.\n\n## Leadership changes\n\nOn January 8, 2024, CN announced that Remi G. Lalonde was appointed as CN's Executive Vice-President and Special Advisor to the CEO, in anticipation  of  his  transition  to  the  role  of  Executive  Vice-President  and  Chief  Commercial  Officer  (CCO).  Mr.  Lalonde  will  succeed  Doug MacDonald, Executive Vice-President and Chief Marketing Officer, who will remain in his current role until Mr. Lalonde's transition is completed later this year.\n\nOn October 18, 2023, CN announced that Patrick Whitehead was appointed as CN's Executive Vice-President and Chief Network Operating Officer  and  Derek  Taylor  was  appointed  as  CN's  Executive  Vice-President  and  Chief  Field  Operating  Officer  effective  November  15,  2023. Mr. Whitehead and Mr. Taylor succeed Edmond (Ed) Harris who has taken on a consultant role until March 31, 2024 to ensure a seamless transition.\n\n## Future value creation\n\nOn January 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) that allows for the repurchase of up to  32.0  million  common  shares  between  February  1,  2024  and  January  31,  2025.  In  addition,  on  that  same  day,  the  Company's  Board  of Directors approved an increase of 7% to the quarterly dividend to common shareholders, from $0.7900 per share in 2023 to $0.8450 per share in 2024, effective for the first quarter.\n\n## 2024 Business outlook and assumptions\n\nThe Company assumes slightly positive North American industrial production in 2024. For the 2023/2024 crop year, the grain crop in Canada was below its three-year average (also below when excluding the significantly lower 2021/2022 crop year) and the U.S. grain crop was above its three-year average. The Company assumes that the 2024/2025 grain crop in Canada will be in line with its three-year average (excluding the significantly lower 2021/2022 crop year) and the U.S. grain crop will also be in line with its three-year average.\n\nIn 2024, the Company expects to invest approximately $3.5 billion in its capital program, net of amounts reimbursed by customers, to improve the safety, efficiency and integrity of its network. These investments are intended to also enable and support the growth of the Company and will be financed with cash generated from operations or with cash from financing activities.\n\nThe forward-looking statements discussed in this section are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements and are based on certain factors and assumptions which the Company considers  reasonable  about  events,  developments,  prospects  and  opportunities  that  may  not  materialize  or  that  may  be  offset  entirely  or partially by other events and developments. In addition to the assumptions and expectations discussed in this section, reference should be made to the section of this MD&A entitled Forward-looking statements for assumptions and risk factors affecting such statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

CN is committed to delivering a safe, consistent and reliable scheduled service that creates value for customers, shareholders and stakeholders. In 2023, CN continued its 'back to basics' approach, re-establishing a disciplined scheduled operation. CN's 'make the plan, run the plan, sell the plan' operating approach has driven strong operational, safety, and customer service outcomes.\n\nCN aims to drive consistent shareholder returns and earnings growth by striving for sustainable financial performance, including profitable topline growth, strong free cash flow generation and return on invested capital well above the Company's cost of capital. CN also returns value to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\n## Build service excellence, grow our business and invest in our people\n\nGoing  forward,  CN  will  continue  to  focus  on  sustaining  and  building  service  excellence,  growing  the  business  and  developing  our  people. Providing reliable and efficient customer service is the foundation for growth. CN aims to leverage its strong customer service and operating efficiency of rail to grow the business profitably. CN continues to invest in the safety and fluidity of the network, and in increasing capacity to cost effectively grow volumes. CN is also investing to drive incremental fuel and carbon efficiency and to improve network resiliency. Critical to CN's  long-term  success  are  also  the  people  investments  being  made  to  ensure  the  optimal  workforce,  with  the  right  skills  and  leadership capabilities, are available to meet the challenges of tomorrow.\n\n## Delivering Responsibly\n\nSustainability is at the heart of how CN is building for the future.

The Company is focused on transporting goods safely and efficiently, doing so in a manner that seeks to minimize the impact on the environment, attracting, retaining and engaging top talent, and helping to build stronger, safer communities, while adhering to the  highest  governance  standards.  CN  understands  that  transparency  is  essential  for  stakeholder  trust  concerning  the  Company's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments. In that regard, CN seeks to align its ESG disclosures with global best practice frameworks,  reporting  on  commitments  and  performance  with  focus,  clarity  and  comparability.  In  2023,  CN  published  its  latest  biennial sustainability  report,  outlining  the  Company's  targets,  programs  and  achievements  in  corporate  governance,  environment,  safety,  people, community involvement and stakeholder engagement. CN is proud of its 2023 accomplishments as the Company's sustainability practices earned it a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability World and North American Indices, for the 12th and 15th consecutive year, respectively.\n\n## Safety is a core value\n\nCN is committed to the health and safety of its employees, the communities and environments in which it operates and the customers it serves. The Company embraces a values-based safety culture. CN's objective is to reduce serious injuries and fatalities. The Company is employing advanced technologies and innovative training to help achieve this goal. More specifically, CN is:\n\n- \u00b7 Fostering an engaged workforce that understands and respects Life Critical Rules .\n- \u00b7 Embedding a mindset whereby employees take ownership for their own safety and the safety of others by Looking Out for Each Other .\n- \u00b7 Training employees to identify and mitigate exposures.\n- \u00b7 Using advanced technologies to proactively mitigate human error and reduce risk.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining reliable and safe equipment and infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Investing in employee training, coaching, recognition and engagement initiatives.\n\nSee the section of this MD&A entitled Human capital management - Health and safety for additional information regarding CN's safety initiatives.\n\n## Tackling the impact of climate change\n\nThe Company's goal is to conduct its operations in a way that seeks to minimize environmental impact, while offering a carbon-efficient and sustainable way to move goods. CN is focused on making a positive contribution in the fight against climate change and playing a key role in the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nWith approximately 85% of its direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated from rail operations, CN focuses on five key strategic areas: fleet  renewal,  innovative  technology,  big  data,  operating  practices  and  cleaner  fuels.  Over  the  years,  this  focus  has  resulted  in  significant progress in decoupling volume growth from carbon emissions intensity. CN continues to maintain its leadership position among Class I North American railways, generating approximately 15% less locomotive GHG emissions per gross ton mile than the industry average. CN was also the first North American railway, and among the first 100 companies globally, to announce an approved science-based climate target. CN aims to reduce GHG emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and in 2021, committed to setting a net-zero target by joining the \"Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C\" and the United Nations' \"Race to Zero\" campaign.\n\nTo  achieve  its  decarbonization  targets,  CN  will  need  to  continue  improving  the  fuel  efficiency  of  its  fleets,  increase  its  use  of  sustainable renewable fuels and test, and eventually deploy alternative propulsion locomotive technologies. Collaboration with suppliers, customers, supply chain partners, innovators and regulators is critical for CN to deliver on its climate commitments and to help drive economic prosperity in a lower-carbon emissions environment.\n\nThe Company's CDP Report, including a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) index, is available on CN's website in the Delivering Responsibly section. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this MD&A.\n\n## Building the talent and culture to drive CN's continuous performance\n\nCN  people  have  always  been  the  Company's  most  important  differentiator,  caring  passionately  about  railroading  and  bringing  optimism, commitment and resilience to daily tasks. CN aims to attract, develop, and retain the very best talent, with a focus on a diverse and inclusive work environment where employees are engaged, inspired and motivated. CN trains its employees with the necessary skills for an increasingly automated and data-driven work environment.\n\nSee the section of this MD&A entitled Human capital management for additional information regarding CN's human capital initiatives.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nAt CN, we are committed to being good neighbors who listen, learn, and do our part to help build safer, stronger, more prosperous communities. Connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. Gulf Coast, CN spans eight provinces, 16 states, and operates within or adjacent to nearly 230 reserve lands of more than 120 First Nations and M\u00e9tis communities in Canada, seven Tribal communities in the United States, and  more  than  2,000  towns  and  cities  across  its  network.  CN  plays  an  essential  role  and  contributes  to  economic  prosperity  through  job creation,  investments and freight transportation services. The Company seeks open and proactive engagement to ensure stakeholders and Indigenous  communities  are  aware  of  its  strategy,  operations,  opportunities  and  obligations,  and  aims  to  foster  effective  two-way communications that ensures a respectful and beneficial exchange.\n\nCN also partners with communities to enhance railway safety. Under CN's structured Community Engagement program, the Company engages with municipal officers and their emergency responders to assist them in their emergency response planning. During this frequent outreach, CN discusses its comprehensive safety programs and performance, the nature, volume and economic importance of dangerous goods it transports through their communities and emergency response planning. CN annually conducts hundreds of training events for thousands of emergency responders,  totaling  over  130,000  first  responders  since  1988.  Additional  training  sites  have  been  constructed  to  offer  onsite  full  scale dangerous goods training.\n\nThe outreach builds on CN's involvement in Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER \u00ae ), through which the Company has been working for many years to help communities in Canada and the U.S. understand the movement of hazardous materials and what is required in the event of transportation incidents. All Aboard for Safety is CN's flagship community education program. Every year, CN employees make hundreds of presentations and talk to thousands of children and adults at schools and community events in Canada and the U.S. about the importance of rail safety and the dangers of walking or playing on or near railway tracks.\n\nAs part of CN's year-round outreach effort, the CN Police Service continues to be active in communities across the CN network to promote safe behavior  around  railroad  infrastructure.  Activities  include  conducting  enforcement  initiatives  with  external  agencies  and  delivering  safety presentations  to  high-risk  groups.  During  the  industry's  annual Rail  Safety  Week campaign,  CN  police  officers  and  other  employees,  in partnership with Operation Lifesaver \u00ae ,  participate  in  numerous  safety  initiatives  to  raise  awareness  about  preventing  accidents  and  injuries around railway property.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The CN Railroaders  in  the  Community program  recognizes  these  acts  of  kindness  by  providing  grants  to  the  community-based  not-for-profit organizations  employees  (current,  retired  or  family)  choose  to  support  through  their  volunteer  efforts.  CN  also  encourages  employee community involvement through its annual volunteer CN In Your Community Day .\n\nWorking  alongside  Indigenous  communities,  CN  makes  it  a  priority  to  strengthen  its  ties,  cultivate  respectful  and  mutually  beneficial relationships,  and  work  toward  reconciliation.  CN  continues  to  engage  in  open  dialogue  with  Indigenous  communities,  identify  and  foster business  opportunities,  increase  our  employees'  awareness  and  understanding  of  Indigenous  culture,  and  enhance  its  ability  to  attract Indigenous  talent.  CN  provides  awareness  training  on  Indigenous  culture,  beliefs,  and  history  to  its  employees  to  foster  an  inclusive  work environment. Since the program began in 2014, more than 24,000 employees have completed the training.\n\n## Disciplined capital allocation and execution\n\nCN's success depends on a steady stream of capital investments that are aligned with and support its business strategy. These investments cover a wide range of areas, from track infrastructure and rolling stock to information and operating technologies, as well as other equipment and  assets  that  are  intended  to  improve  the  safety,  efficiency,  capacity  and  reliability  of  CN's  service  offering.  Investments  in  track infrastructure are designed to enhance the safety and integrity of the physical plant, increase the capacity and fluidity of the network, promote service  excellence,  and  support  growth.  New  locomotives  equipped  with  distributed  power  capability  increase  capacity,  fuel  and  carbon productivity  and  efficiency,  and  improve  service  reliability,  particularly  in  cold  weather,  while  improving  train  handling  and  safety.  Targeted railcar acquisitions aim to tap growth opportunities, complementing the fleet of privately owned railcars that traverse CN's network. CN is also investing in and deploying advanced technologies to automate labor-intensive tasks like track and railcar inspections, as well as to improve the customer  experience  through  'track  and  trace'  functionality.  CN's  long-term  economic  viability  depends  on  the  presence  of  a  supportive regulatory and government policy environment that encourages investment and innovation.\n\nThe multi-year implementation of CN's strategic plan requires a disciplined, analysis-driven approach to capital investment. Talent, technology and capital need to be fully aligned. The Company's capital investment roadmap includes several core elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in the maintenance of a safe and reliable network.\n- \u00b7 Investing in asset infrastructure to increase the capacity of its three-coast network.\n- \u00b7 Developing a portfolio approach to technology with business-led investment decisions, delivering value at each stage of implementation.\n- \u00b7 Deepening supply chain partnerships with its customers, including road-to-rail conversion.\n- \u00b7 Investing in data analytic systems, including artificial intelligence (AI), to support data-driven decision-making.\n- \u00b7 Investing in technologies and capital assets to support decarbonization of its footprint.\n- \u00b7 Growing its physical and commercial reach through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.\n\n## Human capital management\n\nCN's ability to develop the best railroaders in the industry has been a key contributor to the Company's success. CN recognizes that without the right people, no matter how good a service plan or business model a company may have, it will not be able to fully execute. The Company continues to focus on hiring the right people, onboarding them successfully, helping them build positive relationships with their colleagues and supporting all employees to grow and develop, while deepening its commitment to develop talent and plan for the future.\n\n|",

CN's Board and its committees, including the Governance, Sustainability and Safety Committee and Human  Resources  and  Compensation  Committee  (HRCC)  provide  oversight  of  the  Company's  human  capital  management  strategies, programs,  practices  and  performance.  The  HRCC  is  responsible  for  monitoring  executive  management's  performance  assessment, compensation  and  succession  planning  as  well  as  ensuring  effective  talent  management  and  monitoring  union  relations  and  strategy  for consistency with CN's strategic  direction.  The  HRCC  also  has  the  mandate  to  review  human  resources  practices  and  policies  by  ensuring, amongst  other  things,  that  appropriate  human  resources  programs,  practices  and  systems  are  in  place  so  that  the  Company  can  attract, motivate  and  retain  the  quality  and  diversity  of  employees  required  to  meet  its  business  objectives.  The  Company's  senior  management provides regular briefings on human capital matters to the Board and its committees to facilitate oversight.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  and  management  are  committed  to  maintaining  and  instilling  a  strong  ethical  culture  at  CN,  and  as  such,  have developed  a  solid  ethics  program  based  on  CN's  core  values  of  integrity  and  respect.  Each  director,  executive  officer  and  management employee must certify annually their compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and employees are required to complete an online training course on the Code of Business Conduct. Integrity training is also part of every new employee's onboarding program. In addition, Anti-Fraud Policy and Guidelines apply to all employees of CN and its wholly owned subsidiaries and set out steps to be taken in response to reported or suspected fraud in all its forms, as well as measures that are taken to identify, prevent and manage fraud-related risks.\n\n## Total employees\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, CN employed a total of 18,162 employees in Canada (2022 - 17,392), of which 13,346, or 73%, were unionized employees (2022 - 12,841, or 74%) and 6,825 employees in the U.S. (2022 - 6,579) of which 5,786, or 85%, were unionized employees (2022 5,571, or 85%).\n\n## Canadian workforce\n\nAs of January 31, 2024, three of the eight collective agreements in Canada are open for negotiation. See the section of this MD&A entitled 2023 Highlights - Recent developments for additional information regarding labor negotiations. The Company's collective agreements remain in effect until the bargaining process outlined under the Canada Labor Code has been exhausted.\n\n## U.S. workforce\n\nAs  of  January  31,  2024,  collective  agreements  covering  all  non-operating  and  operating  craft  employees  at  Grand  Trunk  Western  Railroad Company (GTW), companies owned by Illinois Central Corporation (ICC), companies owned by Wisconsin Central Ltd. (WC) and Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Company (BLE), and all employees at Pittsburgh and Conneaut Dock Company (PCD) were ratified and remain in place. The agreements in place have various moratorium provisions, which preserve the status quo with respect to the given collective agreement during the terms of such moratoriums. Where negotiations are ongoing, the terms and conditions of existing agreements generally continue to apply until new agreements are reached or the processes of the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. The general approach to labor negotiations by U.S. Class I railroads is to bargain on a collective national basis with the industry, which GTW, ICC, WC and BLE currently participate in, for collective bargaining agreements covering all union-represented employees.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nCN  has  an  uncompromising  commitment  to  the  health  and  safety  of  its  employees,  the  customers  it  serves,  and  the  communities  and environments in which it operates. The Company's long-term safety improvement is driven by continued investments in infrastructure, rigorous safety processes and exposure reduction efforts, as well as efforts to continue deepening the Company's safety culture. The attainment of annual accident and injury targets is a component of management's annual incentive bonus plan. The Company's injury frequency rate and accident rate, defined according to the criteria of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), are provided for the entire company's operations and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis. See the section of this MD&A entitled Selected railroad statistics for additional information on CN's safety measures.\n\nCN's culture and commitment to safety is supported by its focus on training, leadership, and technology. CN's Safety Management System is the framework for putting safety at the center of its day-to-day operations. This proactive plan is designed to minimize risk, drive continuous improvement in the reduction of injuries and accidents, and engage employees at all levels of the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The Company's Life Critical Rules address the day-to-day activities that have the potential to cause serious harm or even loss of life. They are based on past incidents and are designed to help ensure they do not happen again. CN's safety leadership training program is heavily focused on teaching employees the importance of controlling exposures to risk and on developing the attitudes and behaviors required for a values-driven safety culture.\n\nCN also continues to leverage new technology to drive improved safety performance including installing powerful sensor and AI technology into specially equipped autonomous track inspection cars positioned in existing train service, enabling track inspections at normal track speed. AI technology is also enhancing how CN inspects its railcar fleet. Automated inspection portals feature ultra-high-definition cameras that capture a 360\u00b0 view of a train as it travels through at track speed. Both these innovations in automation increase inspection frequency and quality and play an important role in preventing incidents. CN has also implemented Electronic Track Authority Verification (ETAV), a geospatial navigation aid application that improves safety by leveraging precise location information to warn track maintenance vehicle operators of approaching or exceeded limits of Track Authority (TA).\n\nCN strives  for  continuous  improvement  in  our  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  security  (EHS&S)  performance  and  is  proud  to  be  a  longstanding Responsible Care\u00ae Partner. Triennially, CN undergoes a Responsible Care\u00ae audit conducted by an external audit team to ensure CN's processes,  programs  and  policies  meet  the  rigorous  Responsible  Care\u00ae  Management  System  Specifications,  Guiding  Principles  and Stewardship Codes.\n\nCN works closely with all of its customers and suppliers to ensure adherence to Life Critical Rules where applicable, and to encourage a shared commitment to a values-based safety culture.\n\n## Talent management\n\n## Attraction and recruitment\n\nCN continues to align its talent strategies to the business objectives, by focusing on acquiring as well as developing the various skills and capabilities required to meet its commitments, address challenges, and ensure a solid bench of talent to mitigate risk. CN recruits and hires talent  with  a  broad  range  of  strengths,  perspectives  and  experiences,  while  also  engaging  with  partners  across  our  network,  including Indigenous and other equity-seeking groups to ensure CN reflects the communities it crosses. Over the last year, similar to other organizations, CN has had to compete extensively to attract talent, however its refreshed early career strategy with partner universities and its community engagement and partnerships  with  diversity  organizations  across  Canada  and  the  U.S.,  has  helped  create  strong  visibility  of  our  jobs  and opportunities.\n\nOnce again in  2023,  CN  was  recognized  as  one  of  Canada's  Top  100  Employers  and  Montreal's  Top  Employers  and  also  listed  as  one  of Canada's best Diversity Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc.\n\n## Training and development\n\nCN offers a variety of training programs, which cover regulatory or CN mandated requirements or are part of an employee's learning journey and development. This ensures that its employees are equipped to perform in their roles and prepare for career advancement opportunities, as required.\n\nThe Company offers trainings in technical, business and leadership programs, with either online, e-learning or virtually-led courses, and, when possible, through in-person sessions. People leaders are supported in building the skills and knowledge needed to successfully perform at each level  and  this  includes  a  focus  on  enhancing  communication  skills,  increasing  collaboration  across  teams  and  creating  a  strong  base  of inclusive leadership throughout our workforce. In 2023, CN continued to provide an expanded offering of online and curated playlists/curricula for more self-guided and self-paced learning to allow for development tools to be available throughout the year and to be self-directed by the employee,  when  it  is  most  convenient.  For  the  Operations  group,  CN  has  various  entry-level  supervisory  programs,  to  onboard  front-line management with a focus on providing those leaders with an understanding of railway operations, safety leadership, people leadership and a perspective on customer service. Furthermore, CN also supports its employees through a structured performance management process. At the beginning of each year, non-unionized employees set goals for the year that align to its business strategy and objectives. At mid and year-end, there is a formal discussion and review of progress against these goals as well as how they were achieved. CN continues to emphasize the\n\n|",

In  2023,  CN  also  introduced  development  planning  tools  and  launched  the  'Aspire  to  develop yourself' campaign where the Company encourages and equips our employees to own their career and build actionable development plans for growth. In addition,  there  are  also  development  discussions  with  key  talent  to  enhance  skills,  capabilities  and  experience  across  the  talent pools.\n\n## Compensation\n\nCN's  approach  to  compensation  continues  to  be  driven  by  our  goal  to  deliver  sustainable  value  creation,  while  ensuring  that  target compensation supports the attraction and retention of talent. Compensation programs are designed to encourage appropriate behaviors and include appropriate risk mitigation mechanisms. In addition, compensation best practices adopted by CN include industry benchmarking and pay positioning as well as pay equity reviews.\n\nCN  offers  a  competitive  compensation  portfolio  that  consists  of  base  salary,  employee  share  investment  plan,  short-term  and  long-term incentives (applicable to certain employees only), benefits, retirement plans and other non-monetary elements.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nAt CN, employees are the Company's single greatest asset and the importance of creating a work environment that welcomes the contribution and  uniqueness  of  every  employee  is  recognized.  CN  is  committed  to  creating  a  workforce  of  top  talent  that  reflects  the  diversity  of  the population  and  stakeholders  it  serves.  The  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  Plan  (\"Diversity  Plan\")  focuses  on  developing  a  more  inclusive workplace by increasing the representation of women, people of color, Indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities and veterans. The plan applies at all levels within the organization and includes strategies on sourcing (among others, early career sourcing through internships, co-op and new graduate programs), selection, hiring, training and development of diverse candidates, anchoring CN's commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I).\n\nThe Company has embedded diversity in its policy regarding composition of the Board and executive management. The Diversity Policy, which also  applies  to  executive  management,  states  that  in  fulfilling  its  oversight  role,  the  HRCC  regularly  reviews  CN's  integrated  approach  to executive and high-potential talent management and succession planning, in order to ensure that CN has diverse candidate pools for potential successors for executive roles.\n\nCN is undertaking various initiatives aimed at better promoting and reinforcing diversity, equity and inclusion which are strongly supported through active involvement by management and the Board. Some examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 building on established DE&I fundamentals by conducting a DE&I diagnostic and creating a revised multi-year DE&I strategy and vision;\n- \u00b7 running regular reviews of pay equity and defining a roadmap to address identified gaps;\n- \u00b7 refocusing our sponsorships and donations budget to better align with our strategic DE&I vision;\n- \u00b7 continually  assessing  hiring  practices  to  leverage  diversity  focused  recruitment  agencies  and  requiring  diverse  candidate  slates  for  all recruitment mandates;\n- \u00b7 developing  inclusive  leaders  through  targeted  training  and  education,  including  unconscious  bias  and  inclusive  leadership  training,  as leaders will be critical in creating and sustaining an inclusive environment;\n- \u00b7 continuing to support and leverage the Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that are backed by executive sponsors (currently eight ERGs); and\n- \u00b7 having sufficient resources to support our DE&I vision.\n\nIn  January 2024 CN established that moving forward it aspires to maintain a Board composition in which independent Board members are comprised of at least 40% of each gender (male and female) and at least two members come from the broader underrepresented groups, beyond gender. Currently, five out of 10, or 50% of independent Board members are women and two, or 20% of independent Board members are from  underrepresented  groups.  CN  has  also  elected  to  revise  the  gender  diversity  target  for  executive  management  (comprising  all  VicePresidents and more senior positions), whereby by the end of 2027, and thereafter, CN aspires to maintain an executive management team in which at least 35% of this group are women. As at December 31, 2023 27%, or eight of the 30 executive management roles, were held by women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The decrease of $279 million, or 2%, was mainly due to lower shipments of intermodal, crude oil, U.S. grain and forest products as well as lower container storage fees and lower fuel surcharge revenues as a result of lower fuel prices; partly offset by freight rate increases, higher Canadian grain export shipments and higher shipments of potash and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $10,231 million compared to $10,267 million in 2022. Operating expenses remained flat mainly due to lower fuel prices; offset by the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar and higher labor and fringe benefits expense mainly driven by general wage increases and higher average headcount.\n\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $243 million, or 4%, to $6,597 million, when compared to the same period in 2022. The operating ratio was 60.8% in 2023, compared to 60.0% in 2022, a 0.8-point increase.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5,625 million, an increase of $507 million, or 10%, when compared to 2022, and diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to $8.53. The increase was mainly due to a net deferred income tax recovery of $713 million resulting from tax filings consistent with a ruling that the Company received in a non-U.S. foreign jurisdiction in connection with prior taxation years; partly offset by lower revenues.\n\n|",

GTMs were negatively impacted in 2023 when compared to 2022 primarily due to weaker demand for freight services. Fuel efficiency decreased by 1% mainly due to running shorter trains.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to 2021, the Company's focus on scheduled railroading resulted in improvements in car velocity, through dwell and fuel efficiency, as well as a decrease in train length and train weight, despite negative impacts from the harsh winter in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, the Company's fuel initiatives allowed it to achieve a new record for fuel efficiency.\n\n## Non-GAAP measures\n\nThis MD&A makes reference to non-GAAP measures including adjusted performance measures, constant currency, return on invested capital (ROIC) and adjusted ROIC, free cash flow, and adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. From management's perspective, these non-GAAP measures are useful measures of performance and provide investors with supplementary information to assess the Company's results of operations and liquidity. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nFor further details of these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, refer to the sections of this MD&A entitled Non-GAAP measures: Adjusted performance measures , ROIC and adjusted ROIC and Constant currency ,  as well as the section entitled Liquidity and capital resources: Free cash flow and Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Management believes that these adjusted performance measures provide additional insight to management and investors into the Company's operations and underlying business trends as well as facilitate period-to-period comparisons, as they exclude certain significant items that are not reflective of CN's underlying business operations and could distort the analysis of trends in business performance. These items may include:\n\n- i. operating expense adjustments: workforce reduction program, depreciation expense on the deployment of replacement system, advisory fees related to shareholder matters, losses and recoveries from assets held for sale, business acquisition-related costs;\n- ii. non-operating expense adjustments: business acquisition-related financing fees, merger termination income, gains and losses on disposal of property; and\n- iii. the effect of changes in tax laws including rate enactments, and changes in tax positions affecting prior years.\n\nThese  non-GAAP  measures  do  not  have  any  standardized  meaning  prescribed  by  GAAP  and  therefore,  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's adjusted net income was $4,800 million, or $7.28 per diluted share, which excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 a gain on disposal of property within the Bala Subdivision located in Markham and Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada of $129 million, or $112 million after-tax ($0.17 per diluted share) recorded in the fourth quarter in Other income within the Consolidated Statements of Income; and\n- \u00b7 a  net  deferred  income  tax  recovery  of  $713  million  ($1.08  per  diluted  share)  recorded  in  the  fourth  quarter  resulting  from  tax  filings consistent with a ruling that the Company received in a non-U.S. foreign jurisdiction in connection with prior taxation years.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company's adjusted net income was $5,134 million, or $7.46 per diluted share, which excludes advisory fees related to shareholder matters of $22 million, or $16 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) of which $12 million, or $9 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the second quarter and $10 million, or $7 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the first quarter in Other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  reported  adjusted  net  income  of  $4,225  million,  or  $5.95  per  diluted  share,  which excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 employee termination benefits and severance costs related to a workforce reduction program of $39 million, or $29 million after-tax ($0.04 per diluted share) recorded in the third quarter in Labor and fringe benefits within the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n- \u00b7 advisory fees related to shareholder matters of $20 million, or $15 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share) of which $13 million, or $10 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the fourth quarter and $7 million, or $5 million after-tax ($0.01 per diluted share) was recorded in the third quarter in Other expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n- \u00b7 the recovery of $137 million, or $102 million after-tax ($0.14 per diluted share) recorded in the first quarter related to the loss on assets held for sale in the second quarter of 2020, to reflect an agreement for the sale for on-going rail operations, certain non-core rail lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario to a short line operator;\n- \u00b7 transaction-related costs, consisting of an advance to Kansas City Southern (KCS) and a related refund, net of transaction costs, of $84 million, or $70 million after-tax ($0.10 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter resulting from the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS;\n- \u00b7 amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $97 million, or $84 million after-tax ($0.11 per diluted share), of which $65 million, or $60 million after-tax ($0.08 per diluted share) was recorded in the third quarter and $32 million, or $24 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) was recorded in the second quarter, resulting from the KCS transaction, recorded in Interest expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income; and\n- \u00b7 merger termination fee paid by KCS to CN of $886 million, or $770 million after-tax ($1.08 per diluted share), recorded in the third quarter resulting from KCS' notice of termination of the CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\n|",

The Company calculates ROIC as return divided by average invested capital, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Return is defined as Net income plus interest expense after-tax, calculated using the Company's effective tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of Total shareholders' equity, Long-term debt and Current portion  of  long-term  debt  less  Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  Restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  averaged  between  the  beginning  and ending  balance  over  the  last  twelve-month  period.  The  Company  calculates  adjusted  ROIC  as  adjusted  return  divided  by  average  invested capital, both of which are non-GAAP measures. Adjusted return is defined as adjusted net income plus interest expense after-tax, calculated using the Company's adjusted effective tax rate. Return, average invested capital, ROIC, adjusted return and adjusted ROIC do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net income and adjusted net income to return and adjusted return, respectively, as well as the calculation of average invested capital, which have been used to calculate ROIC and adjusted ROIC:\n\n| In millions, except percentage                                                               | As at and for the year ended December 31,                                                    | 2023     | 2022      | 2021      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net income $                                                                                 | Net income $                                                                                 | 5,625    | $  5,118  | $  4,899  |\n| Interest expense                                                                             | Interest expense                                                                             | 722      | 548       | 610       |\n| Tax on interest expense  (1)                                                                 | Tax on interest expense  (1)                                                                 | (177)    | (133)     | (139)     |\n| Return                                                                                       | Return                                                                                       | $  6,170 | $  5,533  | $  5,370  |\n| Average total shareholders' equity 20,751                                                    | Average total shareholders' equity 20,751                                                    | $        | $  22,064 | $  21,198 |\n| Average long-term debt                                                                       | Average long-term debt                                                                       | 15,253   | 13,175    | 11,987    |\n| Average current portion of long-term debt                                                    | Average current portion of long-term debt                                                    | 1,699    | 783       | 709       |\n| Less:  Average cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (879) | Less:  Average cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (879) |          | (1,088)   | (1,221)   |\n| Average invested capital $  36,824                                                           | Average invested capital $  36,824                                                           |          | $  34,934 | $  32,673 |\n| ROIC                                                                                         | ROIC                                                                                         | 16.8%    | 15.8%     | 16.4%     |\n| Adjusted net income  (2) $                                                                   | Adjusted net income  (2) $                                                                   | 4,800    | $  5,134  | $  4,225  |\n| Interest expense                                                                             | Interest expense                                                                             | 722      | 548       | 610       |\n| Less:  Amortization of bridge financing and other fees  (3)                                  | Less:  Amortization of bridge financing and other fees  (3)                                  | -        | -         | (97)      |\n| Adjusted tax on interest expense  (4)                                                        | Adjusted tax on interest expense  (4)                                                        | (177)    | (133)     | (123)     |\n| Adjusted return  $                                                                           | Adjusted return  $                                                                           | 5,345    | $  5,549  | $  4,615  |\n| Average invested capital $                                                                   | Average invested capital $                                                                   | 36,824   | $  34,934 | $  32,673 |\n| Adjusted ROIC                                                                                | Adjusted ROIC                                                                                | 14.5%    | 15.9%     | 14.1%     |\n\n|",

Measures at constant currency are considered nonGAAP measures and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Financial results at constant currency are obtained by translating the current period results denominated in US dollars at the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate transactions denominated in US dollars of the comparable period of the prior year.\n\nThe average foreign exchange rates were $1.350 and $1.301 per US$1.00, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On a constant currency basis, the Company's Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 would have been lower by $96 million ($0.15 per diluted share).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of constant currency and related percentage change at constant currency on the financial results, as reported for the year ended December 31, 2023:\n\n| In millions, except per share data              | Year ended December 31,   | 2023     | Constant  currency impact   | 2022     | % Change at  constant  currency  Fav (Unfav)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                        |                           |          |                             |          |                                                |\n| Petroleum and chemicals                         |                           | $  3,195 | $  (71)                     | $  3,229 | (3%)                                           |\n| Metals and minerals                             |                           | 2,048    | (59)                        | 1,911    | 4%                                             |\n| Forest products                                 |                           | 1,943    | (55)                        | 2,006    | (6%)                                           |\n| Coal                                            |                           | 1,017    | (14)                        | 937      | 7%                                             |\n| Grain and fertilizers                           |                           | 3,265    | (57)                        | 2,783    | 15%                                            |\n| Intermodal                                      |                           | 3,823    | (45)                        | 4,906    | (23%)                                          |\n| Automotive                                      |                           | 945      | (25)                        | 797      | 15%                                            |\n| Total freight revenues                          |                           | 16,236   | (326)                       | 16,569   | (4%)                                           |\n| Other revenues                                  |                           | 592      | (12)                        | 538      | 8%                                             |\n| Total revenues                                  |                           | 16,828   | (338)                       | 17,107   | (4%)                                           |\n| Operating expenses                              |                           |          |                             |          |                                                |\n| Labor and fringe benefits                       |                           | 3,150    | (41)                        | 2,935    | (6%)                                           |\n| Purchased services and material                 |                           | 2,254    | (29)                        | 2,191    | (2%)                                           |\n| Fuel                                            |                           | 2,097    | (69)                        | 2,518    | 19%                                            |\n| Depreciation and amortization                   |                           | 1,817    | (25)                        | 1,729    | (4%)                                           |\n| Equipment rents                                 |                           | 359      | (10)                        | 338      | (3%)                                           |\n| Other                                           |                           | 554      | (13)                        | 556      | 3%                                             |\n| Total operating expenses                        |                           | 10,231   | (187)                       | 10,267   | 2%                                             |\n| Operating income                                |                           | 6,597    | (151)                       | 6,840    | (6%)                                           |\n| Interest expense                                |                           | (722)    | 23                          | (548)    | (28%)                                          |\n| Other components of net periodic benefit income |                           | 479      | -

The decrease of $279 million, or 2%, was mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 lower  RTMs of  1%  mainly  due  to  lower  shipments  of  intermodal,  crude  oil,  U.S.  grain  and  forest  products;  partly  offset  by  higher Canadian grain export shipments and higher shipments of potash.\n- \u00b7 lower Freight revenue per RTM of 1% due to lower container storage fees and lower fuel surcharge revenues as a result of lower fuel prices; partly offset by freight rate increases, a decrease in the average length of haul and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n|",

The  primary  markets  for  these  commodities  are  within  North  America,  and  as  such,  the performance of this commodity group is closely correlated with the North American economy as well as oil, gas production, petroleum refining activity, pipeline capacities and related petrochemical commodity prices. Most of the Company's petroleum and chemicals shipments originate in  the  Alberta  Industrial  Heartland,  a  key  oil  and  gas  development  area  and  a  major  center  for  natural  gas  feedstock  and  world-scale petrochemicals and plastics. In addition to servicing the Louisiana petrochemical corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge as well as Sarnia's  \"Chemical  Valley\"  in  Southwestern  Ontario,  the  Company  also  supplements  pipeline  capacity  by  moving  petroleum  products  from facilities in Saskatchewan, British Colombia, Quebec, and Illinois.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues for this commodity group decreased by $34 million, or 1%, when compared to 2022, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 lower RTMs of 5%, mainly due to lower shipments of crude oil due to unfavorable crude oil price spreads;\n- \u00b7 partly offset by higher Revenue per RTM of 4%, mainly due to a decrease in the average length of haul, freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nRTMs decreased more than Carloads in 2023 when compared to 2022, mainly due to lower shipments of crude oil, which has a longer length of haul.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Refined petroleum products               | 47 %   | 45 %   |\n| Chemicals and plastics                   | 39 %   | 37 %   |\n| Crude and condensate                     | 9 %    | 13 %   |\n| Sulfur                                   | 5 %    | 5 %    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Canadian  thermal  and metallurgical coal are largely exported via terminals on the west coast of Canada to offshore markets. In the U.S., thermal coal is transported from mines served in southern Illinois, or from western U.S. mines via interchange with other railroads, to major utilities in the Midwest and Southeast U.S., as well as offshore markets via terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast and inland river system. Petroleum coke, a by-product of the oil refining process, is exported to offshore markets via terminals on the west coast of Canada, the U.S. Gulf Coast and inland river system, as well as shipped to industrial users in domestic markets. The key drivers for this market segment are weather conditions, environmental regulations, global energy, coal and steel supply and demand conditions, and for U.S. domestic utility coal, the price of natural gas.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues for this commodity group increased by $80 million, or 9%, when compared to 2022, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 higher Revenue per RTM of 8% mainly due to freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n- \u00b7 RTMs remained flat mainly due to higher shipments of Canadian coal and U.S. petroleum coke; offset by lower shipments of U.S. coal exports.\n\nRTMs remained flat while Carloads increased in 2023 when compared to 2022, mainly due to higher Canadian coal export shipments, which have a longer length of haul; partly offset by lower U.S. coal export shipments which have a longer length of haul.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Canadian coal - export                   | 53 %   | 54 %   |\n| Petroleum coke                           | 21 %   | 20 %   |\n| U.S. coal - export                       | 13 %   | 14 %   |\n| U.S. coal - domestic                     | 13 %   | 12 %   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The grain segment consists of wheat, oats, barley, flaxseed, rye, peas, lentils, corn, corn meal, ethanol, dried distillers grain, canola seed and canola products, soybeans, soybean products, sweeteners and animal fat. Production of grain varies considerably from year to year, affected primarily by weather conditions, seeded and harvested acreage, the mix of grains produced and crop yields. Grain exports are sensitive to the size and quality of the crop produced, international market conditions and foreign government policy. The majority of grain produced in Western Canada  and  moved  by  CN  is  exported  via  the  ports  of  Vancouver,  Prince  Rupert  and  Thunder  Bay.  These  rail  movements  are  subject  to government regulation that establishes a maximum revenue entitlement that railways can earn. Although railway companies are free to set freight rates for western grain shipments, total revenue is limited based on a formula that takes into account tonnage, length of haul, and a specified price index. Shipments of grain that are exported to the U.S. are not regulated. Grain grown in the U.S. Midwest is exported as well as transported to domestic processing facilities and feed markets. The Company also serves major producers of potash in Canada, as well as producers of ammonium nitrate, anhydrous ammonia, urea and other fertilizers across Canada and the U.S. The key drivers for fertilizers are input prices, demand, government policies, and international competition.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues for this commodity group increased by $482 million, or 17%, when compared to 2022, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 higher RTMs of 15% mainly due to higher Canadian grain export shipments primarily as a result of a larger 2022/2023 crop versus the prior year and higher shipments of potash due to a major outage at a competitor's export terminal and stronger domestic demand, partly offset by reduced U.S. grain shipments as a result of increased global grain supply; and\n- \u00b7 higher Revenue per RTM of 2% mainly due to freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by an increase in the average length of haul and lower fuel surcharge revenues.\n\nRTMs increased more than Carloads in 2023 when compared to 2022, mainly due to higher Canadian grain export shipments, which has a longer length of haul.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Canadian grain - regulated               | 37 %   | 32 %   |\n| U.S. grain - domestic                    | 19 %   | 22 %   |\n| Fertilizers - potash                     | 16 %   | 13 %   |\n| Canadian grain - commercial              | 13 %   | 13 %   |\n| Fertilizers - other                      | 9 %    | 9 %    |\n| U.S. grain - exports                     | 6 %    | 11 %   |\n\n## Intermodal\n\n|                       | Year ended December 31,   | 2023   | 2022     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $                         | 3,823  | $  4,906 | (22%)      | (23%)                           |\n| RTMs  (millions)      |                           | 47,886 | 56,029   | (15%)      | (15%)                           |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  |                           | 7.98   | 8.76     | (9%)       | (10%)                           |\n| Carloads  (thousands) |                           | 2,078  | 2,450    | (15%)      | (15%)                           |\n| Revenue/carload  ($)  |                           | 1,840  | 2,002    | (8%)       | (9%)                            |\n\n|",

Domestic  intermodal  transports  consumer  products  and  manufactured  goods,  serving  retail,  wholesale  and  logistics  provider channels, within domestic Canada, domestic U.S., Mexico and transborder, while international intermodal handles import and export container traffic,  serving  the  major  ports  of  Vancouver,  Prince  Rupert,  Montreal,  Halifax,  Saint  John,  New  Orleans  and  Mobile.  CN's  network  of  inland intermodal terminals, located near ports and large urban centers, and a number of interline partnerships with other Class I railroads, connects customers to major markets in North America and overseas. Domestic intermodal is driven by consumer markets, with growth generally tied to the economy. International intermodal is driven by North American economic and trade conditions as well as global trade patterns. Revenues for CN owned trucking businesses, including TransX, are included in this commodity group within the domestic market.\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023,  revenues  for  this  commodity  group decreased  by  $1,083  million,  or  22%,  when  compared  to  2022, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 lower RTMs of 15% mainly due to decreased shipments in the international and domestic segments driven by weaker demand for consumer goods and the lingering negative impact of the Canadian West Coast dock workers strike; and\n- \u00b7 lower Revenue per RTM of 9% mainly due to lower container storage fees compared to significantly higher container storage fees in 2022 resulting from customer supply chain challenges, reduced trucking services and lower fuel surcharge revenues; partly offset by a decrease in the average length of haul, freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| International                            | 60 %   | 63 %   |\n| Domestic                                 | 40 %   | 37 %   |\n\n## Automotive\n\n|                       | Year ended December 31, 2023   | 2022   | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  945                         | $  797 | 19%        | 15%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 3,136                          | 2,822  | 11%        | 11%                             |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 30.13                          | 28.24  | 7%         | 4%                              |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 232                            | 208    | 12%        | 12%                             |\n| Revenue/carload  ($)  | 4,073                          | 3,832  | 6%         | 3%                              |\n\nThe automotive commodity group moves both domestic finished vehicles and parts throughout North America, providing service to certain vehicle assembly plants in Ontario, Michigan and Mississippi. The Company also serves vehicle distribution facilities in Canada and the U.S., as well as parts production facilities in Michigan and Ontario. The Company serves shippers of finished vehicle imports via the ports of Halifax and Vancouver, and through interchange with other railroads for vehicles produced outside CN's directly served network, including in Mexico. CN's broad network of auto compounds is used to facilitate distribution of vehicles throughout Canada and the U.S. Midwest. The primary drivers for this market are automotive sales in North America, which are driven by population growth, age of vehicles and household spending.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues for this commodity group increased by $148 million, or 19%, when compared to 2022, mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 higher RTMs of 11% mainly due to higher shipments of finished vehicles as a result of automotive dealership restocking; and\n- \u00b7 higher Revenue per RTM of 7% mainly due to freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues and an increase in the average length of haul.\n\n| Percentage of commodity group revenues   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Finished vehicles                        | 93 %   | 93 %   |\n| Auto parts                               | 7 %    | 7 %    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Labor and fringe benefits\n\nLabor and fringe benefits expense includes wages, payroll taxes and employee benefits such as incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation, health and welfare, current service cost for pensions and postretirement benefits. Certain incentive compensation plans are based mainly on financial performance targets and the related expense is recorded in relation to the attainment of such targets.\n\nLabor and fringe benefits expense increased by $215 million, or 7%, in 2023 when compared to 2022. The increase was mainly due to higher general  wage  increases, higher  average  headcount  and  the  negative  translation  impact  of  a  weaker  Canadian  dollar;  partly  offset  by  lower pension expense, lower incentive compensation and the incremental wage accrual in 2022 for the agreements with the U.S unions.\n\n## Purchased services and material\n\nPurchased services and material expense includes the cost of services purchased from outside contractors; materials used in the maintenance of  the  Company's  track,  facilities  and  equipment;  transportation  and  lodging  for  train  crew  employees;  utility  costs;  and  the  net  costs  of operating facilities jointly used by the Company and other railroads.\n\nPurchased services and material expense increased by $63 million, or 3%, in 2023 when compared to 2022. The increase was mainly due to higher contracted services, higher material costs and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by lower freight forwarding expense.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense includes fuel consumed by assets, including locomotives, vessels, vehicles and other equipment as well as federal, provincial and state fuel taxes.\n\nFuel expense decreased by $421 million, or 17%, in 2023 when compared to 2022. The decrease was mainly due to lower fuel prices, lower volumes and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense includes the costs associated with the use of properties and intangible assets over their estimated service lives. Depreciation expense is affected by capital additions, railroad property retirements from disposal, sale and/or abandonment and other adjustments including asset impairments.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $88 million, or 5%, in 2023 when compared to 2022. The increase was mainly due to a higher depreciable asset base and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Equipment rents\n\nEquipment rents expense includes rental expense for the use of freight cars owned by other railroads (car hire) or private companies and for the lease of freight cars, locomotives and intermodal equipment, net of rental income from other railroads for the use of the Company's freight cars (car hire) and locomotives.\n\nEquipment rents expense increased by $21 million, or 6%, in 2023 when compared to 2022. The increase was mainly due to higher rail car lease costs and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Other\n\nOther expense includes operating taxes; software, support and cloud computing costs; insurance; environmental; freight and property damage; personal injury claims; travel expenses; advisory fees related to shareholder matters; bad debt; as well as other general expenses.\n\nOther expense remained flat in 2023 when compared to 2022 mainly due to lower incident costs and advisory fees related to shareholder matters of $22 million in 2022; offset by higher personal injury claim provisions, higher software and support costs and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Other income and expenses\n\n## Interest expense\n\nIn 2023, Interest expense was $722 million compared to $548 million in 2022. The increase was mainly due to the higher average level of debt, higher average interest rates and the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Other components of net periodic benefit income\n\nIn 2023, Other components of net periodic benefit income was $479 million compared to $498 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to higher  interest  cost;  partly  offset  by  lower  amortization  of  net  actuarial  loss  and  higher  expected  return  on  assets.  These  effects  primarily resulted from changes to discount rates, lower actual returns compared to expected returns, as well as an increase to the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption in 2023.\n\n## Other income (loss)\n\nIn 2023, Other income was $134 million compared to Other loss of $27 million in 2022. The favorable variance of $161 million was mainly due to a gain on disposal of property within the Bala Subdivision located in Markham and Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada of $129 million.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $863 million compared to an income tax expense of $1,645 million in 2022.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company received a ruling from taxation authorities in a non-U.S. foreign jurisdiction in connection with prior taxation  years.  Consistent  with  the  ruling,  and  effective  as  of  January  1,  2021,  the  Company  has  foregone  favorable  tax  deductions  of  a permanent  nature  on  certain  income  generated  from  intercompany  arrangements.  This  resulted  in  the  Company  generating  tax-deductible goodwill approximating the value of the foregone tax deductions, which is available to be amortized over a period of up to ten years.\n\nAs  a  result,  the  Company  recorded  a  net  deferred  income  tax  recovery  of  $682  million,  comprised  of  a  $767  million  deferred  income  tax recovery  related  to  the  tax-deductible  goodwill  initially  generated  as  of  January  1,  2021,  partly  offset  by  a $85  million  income  tax  expense related to the foregone tax deduction ($31 million for 2023 and $54 million for prior years) which was initially recorded in current taxes and was then reclassified to deferred taxes following the amortization of the tax-deductible goodwill for those years. As a result, the remaining deferred income tax asset as at December 31, 2023 was $682 million, representing the tax impact of unamortized tax-deductible goodwill of $5.8 billion.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2023 was 13.3% compared to 24.3% in 2022 and the adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 was 24.5%. (1)\n\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finalized its Pillar Two guidelines on some key components of  global  tax  reform  which  include  a  global  minimum  corporate  tax  rate  of  15%  and  the  application  of  a  top-up  tax.  These  guidelines  are effective in 2024 and have been or are expected to be enacted in a number of OECD member countries, which include the main jurisdictions in which CN operates (other than the U.S.), and as a result will affect the Company's effective tax rate for 2024 and thereafter.\n\nFor 2024, the Company anticipates the estimated annual effective tax rate to be approximately 25.0%, and reflects the impacts of the foregone tax deductions and the Pillar Two guidelines of approximately 0.5%.\n\nThe Company's net income tax payments for taxation years 2021 to 2023 were not affected and are not expected to be affected for 2024 and the next six years thereafter as a result of the tax-deductible goodwill available to be amortized in those years.\n\n- (1)      Adjusted  effective  tax  rate  is  a  non-GAAP  measure,  defined  as  Income  tax  expense,  net  of  tax  adjustments  as  presented  in  Adjusted  performance  measures  as  a percentage of Income before taxes, net of pre-tax adjustments as presented in Adjusted performance measures. This measure does not have any standard meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to a similar measure presented by other companies.\n\n|",

The increase of $2,630 million, or 18%, was mainly attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, higher Canadian export volumes of coal via west coast ports and higher volumes of U.S. grain; partly offset by lower international container traffic volumes via the port of Vancouver as a result of supply chain congestion and significantly lower export volumes of Canadian grain in the first half of 2022.\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $10,267 million compared to $8,861 million in 2021. The increase of $1,406 million, or 16%, was mainly as a result of higher fuel prices, the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar as well the recovery of the loss on assets held for sale of $137 million recorded in the first quarter of 2021 resulting from the Company entering into an agreement for the  sale  of  non-core  lines;  partly  offset  by  transaction-related  costs  of  $84  million  recorded  in  the  third  quarter  of  2021  resulting  from  the terminated CN Merger Agreement with KCS.\n\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $1,224 million, or 22%, to $6,840 million, when compared to the same period in 2021. The operating ratio was 60.0% in 2022, compared to 61.2% in 2021, a 1.2-point improvement.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $5,118 million, an increase of $219 million, or 4%, when compared to 2021, and diluted earnings per share increased by 8% to $7.44. The increase was mainly driven by higher operating income in 2022, partly offset by a merger termination fee of $886 million ($770 million after-tax) received from KCS in 2021.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, CN entered into an agreement with a short line operator, for the sale of non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario representing 850 miles that were classified as assets held for sale plus an additional 50 miles of track and roadway assets, resulting in a $137 million recovery ($102 million after-tax) of the $486 million loss ($363 million after-tax) recorded in the second quarter of 2020 to adjust the carrying amount of the track and roadway assets to their then estimated net selling price.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the STB approved the Company's agreement with the short line operator without condition and the transaction closed in the first quarter of 2022 for proceeds of $273 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Measures at constant currency are considered nonGAAP measures and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Financial results at constant currency are obtained by translating the current period results denominated in US dollars at the weighted average foreign exchange rates used to translate transactions denominated in US dollars of the comparable period of the prior year.\n\nThe average foreign exchange rates were $1.301 and $1.254 per US$1.00, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, the Company's Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 would have been lower by $90 million ($0.13 per diluted share).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the impact of constant currency and related percentage change at constant currency on the financial results, as reported for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n\n| In millions, except per share data              | Year ended December 31,   | 2022     | Constant  currency impact   | 2021     | % Change at  constant  currency  Fav (Unfav)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenues                                        |                           |          |                             |          |                                                |\n| Petroleum and chemicals                         |                           | $  3,229 | $  (74)                     | $  2,816 | 12%                                            |\n| Metals and minerals                             |                           | 1,911    | (57)                        | 1,548    | 20%                                            |\n| Forest products                                 |                           | 2,006    | (57)                        | 1,740    | 12%                                            |\n| Coal                                            |                           | 937      | (11)                        | 618      | 50%                                            |\n| Grain and fertilizers                           |                           | 2,783    | (56)                        | 2,475    | 10%                                            |\n| Intermodal                                      |                           | 4,906    | (58)                        | 4,115    | 18%                                            |\n| Automotive                                      |                           | 797      | (24)                        | 576      | 34%                                            |\n| Total freight revenues                          |                           | 16,569   | (337)                       | 13,888   | 17%                                            |\n| Other revenues                                  |                           | 538      | (15)                        | 589      | (11%)                                          |\n| Total revenues                                  |                           | 17,107   | (352)                       | 14,477   | 16%                                            |\n| Operating expenses                              |                           |          |                             |          |                                                |\n| Labor and fringe benefits                       |                           | 2,935    | (43)                        | 2,879    | -%                                             |\n| Purchased services and material                 |                           | 2,191    | (33)                        | 2,082    | (4%)                                           |\n| Fuel                                            |                           | 2,518    | (88)                        | 1,513    | (61%)                                          |\n| Depreciation and amortization                   |                           | 1,729    | (25)                        | 1,598    | (7%)                                           |\n| Equipment rents                                 |                           | 338      | (10)                        | 336      | 2%                                             |\n| Other                                           |                           | 556      | (15)                        | 506      | (7%)                                           |\n| Recovery of loss on assets held for sale        |                           | -

The increase of $2,630 million, or 18%, was mainly attributable to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar, higher Canadian export volumes of coal via west coast ports and higher volumes of U.S. grain; partly offset by lower international container traffic volumes via the port of Vancouver as a result of supply chain congestion and significantly lower export volumes of Canadian grain in the first half of 2022.\n\nFuel surcharge revenues increased by $1,592 million in 2022, mainly as a result of higher fuel prices.\n\nIn 2022, RTMs, measuring the weight and distance of freight transported by the Company, increased by 1% relative to 2021. Freight revenue per RTM increased by 18% in 2022 when compared to 2021, mainly driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, a decrease in the average length of haul and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Petroleum and chemicals\n\n|                       | 2022     | 2021     | % Change   | % Change at constant currency   |\n|-----------------------|----------|----------|------------|---------------------------------|\n| Revenues  (millions)  | $  3,229 | $  2,816 | 15%        | 12%                             |\n| RTMs  (millions)      | 46,273   | 42,436   | 9%         | 9%                              |\n| Revenue/RTM  (cents)  | 6.98     | 6.64     | 5%         | 3%                              |\n| Carloads  (thousands) | 636      | 596      | 7%         | 7%                              |\n| Revenue/carload  ($)  | 5,077    | 4,725    | 7%         | 5%                              |\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues for this commodity group increased by $413 million, or 15%, when compared to 2021, mainly due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, increased volumes of refined petroleum products, natural gas liquids and petroleum crude, freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\nRevenue per RTM increased by 5% in 2022 when compared to 2021, mainly due to higher fuel surcharge revenue, freight rate increases and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The increase was mainly due to higher cloud computing costs, travel costs and operating taxes as well as the negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar; partly offset by higher passenger train recoveries.\n\n## Recovery of loss on assets held for sale\n\nRecovery of loss on assets held for sale of $137 million in the first quarter of 2021 resulting from the Company entering into an agreement with a short line operator, for the sale of non-core lines in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario representing 850 miles that were classified as assets held  for  sale  plus  an  additional  50  miles  of  track  and  roadway  assets.  See Note  6  -  Assets  held  for  sale to  the  Company's  2022  Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Transaction-related costs\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred transaction costs related to the terminated CN Merger Agreement of $84 million, consisting of $125 million of transaction-related costs; US$700 million ($845 million) paid to KCS and reported as an advance to KCS in the second quarter and expensed in the third quarter; and the related refund received of US$700 million ($886 million) in the third quarter. See Note 4 - Acquisition to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income and expenses\n\n## Interest expense\n\nIn 2022, Interest expense was $548 million compared to $610 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly due to amortization of bridge financing and other fees of $97 million recorded in 2021 (see Note 4 - Acquisition to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information); partly offset by a higher average level of debt and a negative translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.\n\n## Other components of net periodic benefit income\n\nIn 2022, Other components of net periodic benefit income was $498 million compared to $407 million in 2021. The increase was mainly due to lower amortization of net actuarial loss and higher expected return on assets; partly offset by higher interest cost.\n\n## Merger termination fee\n\nIn 2021, the Company received a US$700 million ($886 million) termination fee resulting from KCS terminating the CN Merger Agreement and entering into a merger agreement with CP. See Note 4 - Acquisition to  the  Company's  2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n## Other income (loss)\n\nIn 2022, Other loss was $27 million compared to Other income of $43 million in 2021. The unfavorable variance was mainly due to fluctuations in the fair value of an equity investment in autonomous driving technology.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nIn 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,645 million compared to an income tax expense of $1,443 million in 2021.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2022 was 24.3% compared to 22.8% in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the merger termination fee, transaction-related costs, and bridge financing and other fees resulting from the KCS transaction recorded in the 2021 Consolidated Statements of Income, taxed at a lower inclusion rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Operating expenses reflect the impact of freight volumes, seasonal weather conditions, labor costs, fuel prices, and the Company's productivity initiatives. Fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar have also affected the conversion of the Company's US dollar-denominated revenues and expenses and resulted in fluctuations in Net income in the rolling eight quarters presented above.\n\n## 2023 Fourth quarter operating results\n\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $4,471 million compared to $4,542 million in 2022. The decrease of $71 million, or 2%, was mainly due to lower shipments of intermodal and grain, primarily as a result of weaker demand for freight services to move consumer goods, the lingering negative impact of the Canadian West Coast dock workers strike and increased global grain supply; as well as lower container storage fees and lower fuel surcharge revenues as a result of lower fuel prices; partly offset by freight rate increases and higher shipments of potash, natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products.\n\nFuel surcharge revenues decreased by $114 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to 2022, mainly due to lower fuel prices.\n\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $23 million, or 1%, to $2,653 million, when compared to the same period in 2022. The increase was mainly due to higher Labor and fringe benefits expense mainly driven by general wage increases and higher average headcount and higher personal injury and legal claim provisions; partly offset by lower fuel prices.\n\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $94 million, or 5%, to $1,818 million, when compared to the same period in 2022. The operating ratio was 59.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 57.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 1.4-point increase.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2,130 million, an increase of $710 million, or 50%, when compared to the same period in 2022, and diluted earnings per share increased by 57% to $3.29. The increase was mainly due to a net deferred income tax recovery of $713 million resulting from tax filings consistent with a ruling that the Company received in a non-U.S. foreign jurisdiction in connection with prior taxation years.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Liquidity and capital resources\n\nThe Company's principal source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, which is supplemented by borrowings in the money markets and capital markets. To meet its short-term liquidity needs, the Company has access to various financing sources, including unsecured revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and an accounts receivable securitization program. In addition to these sources, the Company can use equipment loans or issue debt securities to meet its longer-term liquidity needs. The strong focus on cash generation from all sources gives the Company increased flexibility in terms of meeting its financing requirements.\n\nThe Company's primary short-term and long-term cash requirements are discussed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term  cash  requirements: includes  working  capital  requirements,  such  as  labor  and  fringe  benefits,  fuel,  income  tax  instalments, pension  contributions,  and  contractual  obligations;  interest  and  principal  payments  on  current  debt  financing;  dividends;  and  share repurchases.\n- \u00b7 Long-term cash requirements: includes capital expenditures relating to track infrastructure and other, interest and principal repayments of long-term debt financing, operating and finance lease obligations; business acquisitions and long-term contractual obligations.\n\nThe Company sets priorities on its uses of available funds based on short-term operational requirements, expenditures to continue to operate a safe railway and pursue strategic initiatives, while also considering its long-term contractual obligations and returning value to its shareholders; and  as  part  of  its  financing  strategy,  the  Company  regularly  reviews  its  capital  structure,  cost  of  capital,  and  the  need  for  additional  debt financing. For a summary of short-term and long-term contractual obligations, including material cash requirements related to such obligations, refer to the table within this section entitled Contractual obligations .\n\nThe Company has a working capital deficit, which is common in the capital-intensive rail industry, and is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. The Company maintains adequate resources to meet daily cash requirements, and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and current obligations. As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $475 million and $328 million, respectively; Restricted cash and cash equivalents of $449 million and $506 million, respectively; and a working capital deficit of $1,946 million and $625 million, respectively. (1) The increase in the working capital deficit was mainly due to higher commercial paper. The cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for a minimum term of one month pursuant to the Company's bilateral letter of credit facilities are recorded as Restricted cash and cash equivalents. There are currently no specific requirements relating to working capital other than in the normal course of business as discussed herein.\n\nThe Company's U.S. and other foreign subsidiaries maintain sufficient cash to meet their respective operational requirements. If the Company should require more liquidity in Canada than is generated by its domestic operations, the Company could decide to repatriate funds associated with undistributed earnings of its foreign operations, including its U.S. and other foreign subsidiaries. The impact on liquidity resulting from the repatriation of funds held outside Canada would not be significant as such repatriation of funds would not cause significant tax implications to the Company under the tax laws of Canada and the U.S. and other foreign tax jurisdictions, and the tax treaties currently in effect between them.\n\nThe Company expects cash from operations and its various sources of financing to be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations. The Company is not aware of any trends or expected fluctuations in its liquidity that would impact its ongoing operations or financial condition as of the date of this MD&A.\n\n- (1) The Company defines working capital as current assets of $3,089 million (2022 - $3,217 million) less current liabilities of $5,035 million (2022 - $3,842 million).\n\n## Available financing sources\n\n## Shelf prospectus and registration statement\n\nOn May 4, 2022, the Company filed a shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators and a registration statement with the SEC, pursuant to which CN may issue up to $6.0 billion of debt securities in the Canadian and U.S. capital markets over a 25-month period following the filing date.  This  shelf  prospectus  and  registration  statement  replaced  CN's  previous  shelf  prospectus  and  registration  statement  that  expired  on March 11, 2022.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the remaining capacity of this shelf prospectus and registration statement was $1.5 billion. Access to the Canadian and U.S. capital markets under the shelf prospectus and registration statement is dependent on market conditions.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe Company's access to long-term funds in the capital markets depends on its credit ratings and market conditions. The Company believes that it continues to have access to the capital markets. If the Company were unable to borrow funds at acceptable rates in the capital markets, the Company could borrow under its credit facilities, draw down on its accounts receivable securitization program, access the pledged cash under its letter of credit facilities, raise cash by disposing of surplus properties or otherwise monetizing assets, reduce discretionary spending or take a combination of these measures to assure that it has adequate funding for its business.\n\n## Revolving credit facilities\n\nThe Company has unsecured revolving credit facilities with a consortium of lenders. The unsecured credit facility of $2.5 billion is available for general corporate purposes and backstopping the Company's commercial paper programs. The facility consists of two tranches of $1.25 billion and was amended on March 17, 2023 to extend its tenor by one year to March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2028. This revolving credit facility agreement  is  structured  as  a  sustainability  linked  loan  whereby  its  applicable  margins  are  adjusted  up  or  down  based  on  the  Company's performance under certain sustainability targets. The unsecured credit facility of $1.0 billion is available for general corporate purposes and was  amended  on  March  17,  2023  to  extend  its  tenor  by  one  year  to  March  17,  2025.  Both  credit  facilities  provide  borrowings  at  various benchmark interest rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), plus applicable margins,  based  on  CN's  credit  ratings.  The  facilities  were  also  amended  in  March  2023  to  include  fallback  language  that  addresses  the cessation of CDOR and adoption of the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) as the alternative benchmark.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under these revolving credit facilities.\n\n## Equipment loans\n\nThe  Company  has  various  secured  non-revolving  term  loan  credit  facilities  for  financing  or  refinancing  the  purchase  of  equipment.  The equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facilities have a tenor at inception varying from 15 to 20 years and are secured by rolling stock.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into new loan supplements to the existing agreement for an additional principal amount of US$304 million, which is available to be drawn, in Canadian or U.S. dollars, through March 31, 2024. On November 3, 2023, the Company entered into a new term loan facility for a principal amount of $366 million, which is available to be drawn through November 4, 2024. Borrowings under the non-revolving  term  loan  facilities  are  provided  at  SOFR  and/or  CDOR,  plus  applicable  margins.  On  March  31,  2023,  outstanding  loans referencing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), were transitioned to SOFR. The facilities also include fallback language that addressed the cessation of CDOR and adoption of CORRA as the alternative benchmark. The Company made no draws under these facilities in 2023.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $677 million (2022 - $734 million) and had $769 million (2022 - $nil) available to be drawn under this these facilities.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nThe Company has a commercial paper program in Canada and in the U.S. Both programs are backstopped by the Company's revolving credit facility.  The  maximum aggregate principal amount of commercial paper that can be issued is $2.5 billion, or the US dollar equivalent, on a combined basis. The commercial paper programs, which are subject to market rates in effect at the time of financing, provide the Company with  a  flexible  financing  alternative,  and  can  be  used  for  general  corporate  purposes.  The  cost  of  commercial  paper  and  access  to  the commercial paper market in Canada and the U.S. are dependent on credit ratings and market conditions. If the Company were to lose access to its commercial paper program for an extended period of time, the Company could rely on its revolving credit facilities to meet its short-term liquidity needs.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had total commercial paper borrowings of US$1,360 million ($1,801 million) and US$594 million ($805 million), respectively, presented in Current portion of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Accounts receivable securitization program\n\nThe Company has an agreement to sell an undivided co-ownership interest in a revolving pool of accounts receivable to unrelated trusts for maximum cash proceeds of $450 million. On January 19, 2023, the Company extended the term of its agreement by one year to February 1, 2025.  The  trusts  are  multi-seller  trusts  and  the  Company  is  not  the  primary  beneficiary.  Funding  for  the  acquisition  of  these  assets  is customarily through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper notes by the unrelated trusts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe Company has retained the responsibility for servicing, administering and collecting the receivables sold. The average servicing period is approximately  one  month  and  the  interest  on  borrowings  under  the  accounts  receivable  securitization  program  is  renewed  based  on commercial paper rates then in effect or SOFR or CDOR if the commercial paper market is inaccessible and includes fallback language that allows for the succession of CDOR to an alternative rate consistent with market convention. Subject to customary indemnifications, each trust's recourse is limited to the accounts receivable transferred.\n\nThe accounts receivable securitization program provides the Company with readily available short-term financing for general corporate use. In the event the program is terminated before its scheduled maturity, the Company expects to meet its future payment obligations through its various sources of financing including its revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, and/or access to capital markets.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, and 2022 the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program.\n\n## Bilateral letter of credit facilities\n\nThe  Company has a series  of  committed  and  uncommitted  bilateral  letter  of  credit  facility  agreements.  On  March  17,  2023,  the  Company extended the maturity date of its committed bilateral letter of credit facility agreements to April 28, 2026. The agreements are held with various banks  to  support  the  Company's  requirements  to  post  letters  of  credit  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Under  these  agreements,  the Company has the option from time to time to pledge collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents, for a minimum term of one month, equal to at least the face value of the letters of credit issued.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $337 million (2022 - $396 million) under the committed facilities from a total available amount of $361 million (2022 - $470 million) and $152 million (2022 - $100 million) under the uncommitted facilities.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, included in Restricted cash and cash equivalents was $339 million (2022 - $397 million) pledged as collateral under the committed bilateral letter of credit facilities, $100 million (2022 - $100 million) pledged as collateral under the uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities, and $10 million (2022 - $9 million) held in escrow.\n\nAdditional information relating to the Company's financing sources is provided in Note 16 - Debt to the Company's 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nThe Company's ability to access funding in the debt capital markets and the cost and amount of funding available depends in part on its credit ratings. Rating downgrades could limit the Company's access to the capital markets, or increase its borrowing costs.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023 the rating agencies took the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 DBRS maintained the outlook at stable and confirmed CN's long-term and short-term ratings at current levels at A and R-1 (low).\n- \u00b7 Moody's Investors Service changed their outlook from negative to stable and confirmed the long-term and short-term debt ratings at A2 and P-1 respectively.\n- \u00b7 S&P  Global  Ratings  changed  their  outlook  from  negative  to  stable  and  downgraded  the  long-term  debt  rating  from  A  to  A-  and  the commercial paper rating from A-1 to A-2.\n\nThe following table provides the Company's long-term debt and commercial paper credit ratings as of the date of this MD&A:\n\n|                           | Outlook   | Long-term debt rating  (1)   | Commercial paper rating  (1)   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| DBRS Morningstar          | Stable    | A                            | R-1 (low)                      |\n| Moody's Investors Service | Stable    | A2                           | P-1                            |\n| S&P Global Ratings        | Stable    | A-                           | A-2                            |\n\n|",

Free cash flow does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP, as reported for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, to the non-GAAP free cash flow presented herein:\n\n| In millions                                                                 | Year ended December 31,   | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Net cash provided by operating activities                                   |                           | $  6,965 | $  6,667 | $  6,971 |\n| Net cash used in investing activities                                       |                           | (3,468)  | (2,510)  | (2,873)  |\n| Net cash provided before financing activities                               |                           | 3,497    | 4,157    | 4,098    |\n| Adjustments:                                                                |                           |          |          |          |\n| Business acquisitions and combinations  (1)                                 |                           | 390      | -        | -        |\n| Cash income taxes for merger transaction-related payments and cash receipts | (2)                       | -        | 102      | -        |\n| Transaction-related costs  (3)                                              |                           | -        | -        | 125      |\n| Advance for acquisition  (4)                                                |                           | -        | -        | 845      |\n| Refund of advance for acquisition  (4)                                      |                           | -        | -        | (886)    |\n| Merger termination fee  (4)                                                 |                           | -        | -        | (886)    |\n| Total adjustments                                                           |                           | $  390   | $  102   | $  (802) |\n| Free cash flow                                                              |                           | $  3,887 | $  4,259 | $  3,296 |\n\n## Operating activities\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $298 million in 2023 when compared to 2022, mainly due to the reduction in accounts receivable and lower income tax payments; partly offset by lower cash earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Pension contributions\n\nThe Company's contributions to its various defined benefit pension plans are made in accordance with the applicable legislation in Canada and the U.S. and such contributions follow minimum and maximum thresholds as determined by actuarial valuations. Pension contributions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $51 million and $70 million, respectively. For 2022, given the fully funded status of the CN Pension Plan as determined by the latest actuarial valuation for funding purposes as at December 31, 2021, the Company was prohibited from making contributions once the actuarial valuation report was filed in April 2022. For 2023, based on the results of the December 31, 2022 funding valuations, the CN Pension Plan remained fully funded and at a level such that the Company continues to be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan.\n\nBased on the anticipated results of the Company's next actuarial valuations for funding purposes, the CN Pension Plan is expected to remain fully funded and at a level such that the Company would continue to be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan in 2024. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $70 million in 2024 for all other pension plans, and includes the impact of affected non-unionized members transferring from the Company's defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution pension plans effective April 1, 2024.\n\nSee the section of this MD&A entitled Critical  accounting  estimates  -  Pensions  and  other  postretirement  benefits for  additional  information pertaining to the funding of the Company's pension plans. Additional information relating to the pension plans is provided in Note 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to the Company's 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Income tax payments\n\nThe Company is required to make scheduled instalment payments as prescribed by the tax authorities. In Canada, the Company's domestic jurisdiction,  tax  instalments  in  a  given  year  are  generally  based  on  the  prior  year's  taxable  income  whereas  in  the  U.S.,  the  Company's predominant foreign jurisdiction, they are based on forecasted taxable income of the current year.\n\nIn  2023,  net  income  tax  payments  were  $1,197  million  (2022  -  $1,288  million).  The  decrease  was  mainly  due  to  lower  required  instalment payments in the U.S. mainly caused by lower pre-tax income.\n\nFor 2024, the Company's net income tax payments are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion. The increase is mostly due to higher required instalment payments mainly caused by higher expected pre-tax income.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $958 million in 2023 when compared to 2022, mainly due to the higher property additions as well  as  the  acquisition  of  IANR  and  the  business  combination  of  CBNS.  See  the  section  of  this  MD&A  entitled 2023 Highlights  -  Recent developments for additional information pertaining to the IANR and CBNS transactions.\n\n## Property additions\n\n| In millions              | Year ended December 31,   | 2023     | 2022     |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Track and roadway  (1)   |                           | $  1,963 | $  1,841 |\n| Rolling stock            |                           | 663      | 390      |\n| Buildings                |                           | 90       | 96       |\n| Information technology   |                           | 302      | 293      |\n| Other                    |                           | 199      | 137      |\n| Gross property additions |                           | 3,217    | 2,757    |\n| Less: Finance leases     |                           | 30       | 7        |\n| Property additions  (2)  |                           | $  3,187 | $  2,750 |\n\n|",

The IRA imposes a one percent excise tax on specified repurchases of stock by certain publicly traded corporations, effective for repurchases after December 31, 2022. The amount on which the tax is imposed is reduced by the value of any stock issued by such corporation during the tax year. This provision currently does not impact CN. Future regulations and interpretations are expected to be issued to clarify how the excise tax will be applied in practice and may alter the Company's initial assessment. Payments of this excise tax, if it became applicable, would increase the cost of making repurchases. It would not, however, affect the Company's results of operations as they would be accounted for as direct costs of common share repurchases and recorded within Total shareholders' equity.\n\nOn March 28, 2023, the Canadian government introduced draft legislation as part of the 2023 federal budget to implement a new two percent tax on repurchases of stock effective in 2024. If this proposed two percent tax on repurchases of stock is enacted, it is expected to affect the Company. Payments of this excise tax would increase the cost of making repurchases. It would not, however, affect the Company's results of operations as they would be accounted for as direct costs of common share repurchases and recorded within Total shareholders' equity. The Company continues to monitor the developments of this draft legislation.\n\nThe Company's NCIB notices may be found online on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov through EDGAR.

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple\n\nManagement believes that the adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple is a useful credit measure because it reflects the Company's ability to service  its  debt  and  other  long-term  obligations.  The  Company  calculates  the  adjusted  debt-to-adjusted  EBITDA  multiple  as  adjusted  debt divided by the last twelve months of adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted debt is defined as the sum of Long-term debt and Current portion of long-term debt as reported on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as Operating lease liabilities, including current portion and pension plans in deficiency recognized on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the debt-like nature of their contractual and financial obligations.  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  calculated  as  Net  income  excluding  Interest  expense,  Income  tax  expense,  Depreciation  and  amortization, operating lease cost, Other components of net periodic benefit income, Other income (loss), and other significant items that are not reflective of CN's  underlying  business  operations  and  which  could  distort  the  analysis  of  trends  in  business  performance.  Adjusted  debt  and  adjusted EBITDA  are  non-GAAP  measures  used  to  compute  the  Adjusted  debt-to-adjusted  EBITDA  multiple.  These  measures  do  not  have  any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe  following  table  provides  a  reconciliation  of  debt  and  Net  income  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  reported  as  at  and  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, to adjusted debt and adjusted EBITDA, which have been used to calculate the non-GAAP adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple:\n\n| In millions, unless otherwise indicated                     | As at and for the year ended December 31,                   | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt                                                        | Debt                                                        | $  18,473 | $  15,429 | $  12,485 |\n| Adjustments:                                                | Adjustments:                                                |           |           |           |\n| Operating lease liabilities, including current portion  (1) | Operating lease liabilities, including current portion  (1) | 415       | 466       | 430       |\n| Pension plans in deficiency  (2)                            | Pension plans in deficiency  (2)                            | 362       | 353       | 447       |\n| Adjusted debt $                                             | Adjusted debt $                                             | 19,250    | $  16,248 | $  13,362 |\n| Net income                                                  | Net income                                                  | $  5,625  | $  5,118  | $  4,899  |\n| Interest expense                                            | Interest expense                                            | 722       | 548       | 610       |\n| Income tax expense                                          | Income tax expense                                          | 863       | 1,645     | 1,443     |\n| Depreciation and amortization                               | Depreciation and amortization                               | 1,817     | 1,729     | 1,598     |\n| Operating lease cost  (3)                                   | Operating lease cost  (3)                                   | 149       | 142       | 131       |\n| Other components of net periodic benefit income             | Other components of net periodic benefit income             | (479)     | (498)     | (407)     |\n| Other loss (income)                                         | Other loss (income)                                         | (134)     | 27        | (43)      |\n| Adjustments:                                                | Adjustments:                                                |           |           |           |\n| Workforce reduction program  (4)                            | Workforce reduction program  (4)                            | -         | -         | 39        |\n| Advisory fees related to shareholder matters  (5)           | Advisory fees related to shareholder matters  (5)           | -         | 22        | 20        |\n| Recovery on assets held for sale  (6)                       | Recovery on assets held for sale  (6)                       | -         | -         | (137)     |\n| Transaction-related costs  (7)                              | Transaction-related costs  (7)                              | -         | -         | 84        |\n| Merger termination fee  (8)                                 | Merger termination fee  (8)                                 | -         | -         | (886)     |\n| Adjusted EBITDA $                                           | Adjusted EBITDA $                                           | 8,563     | $  8,733  | $  7,351  |\n| Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple  (times)          | Adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple  (times)          | 2.25      | 1.86      | 1.82      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Off balance sheet arrangements\n\n## Guarantees and indemnifications\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  enters  into  agreements  that  may  involve  providing  guarantees  or  indemnifications  to  third parties and others, which may extend beyond the term of the agreements. These include, but are not limited to, standby letters of credit, surety and other bonds, and indemnifications that are customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business. As at December 31, 2023, the Company  has  not  recorded  a  liability  with  respect  to  guarantees  and  indemnifications.  Additional  information  relating  to  guarantees  and indemnifications  is  provided  in Note  22  -  Major  commitments  and  contingencies to  the  Company's  2023  Annual  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Outstanding share data\n\nAs at January 31, 2024, the Company had 640.7 million common shares and 3.6 million stock options outstanding.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various risks from its use of financial instruments. To manage these risks, the Company  follows  a  financial  risk  management  framework,  which  is  monitored  and  approved  by  the  Company's  Audit,  Finance  and  Risk Committee, with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, optimizing earnings per share and free cash flow, financing its operations at an optimal  cost  of  capital  and  preserving  its  liquidity.  The  Company  has  limited  involvement  with  derivative  financial  instruments  in  the management of its risks and does not hold or issue them for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit  risk  arises  from  cash  and  temporary  investments,  accounts  receivable  and  derivative  financial  instruments.  To  manage  credit  risk associated with cash and temporary investments, the Company places these financial assets with governments, major financial institutions, or other creditworthy counterparties, and performs ongoing reviews of these entities. To manage credit risk associated with accounts receivable, the Company reviews the credit history of each new customer, monitors the financial condition and credit limits of its customers, and keeps the average daily sales outstanding within an acceptable range. The Company works with customers to ensure timely payments, and in certain cases, requires financial  security,  including  letters  of  credit.  CN  also  obtains  credit  insurance  for  certain  high  risk  customers.  Although  the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of customer credit risk, economic conditions can affect the Company's customers and can result in an increase to the Company's credit risk and exposure to business failures of its customers. A widespread deterioration of customer credit and business failures of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. The Company considers the risk due to the possible non-performance by its customers to be remote.\n\nThe Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments, however from time to time, it may enter into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. To manage the counterparty risk associated with the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company enters into contracts with major financial institutions that have been accorded investment grade  ratings.  Though  the  Company  is  exposed  to  potential  credit  losses  due  to  non-performance  of  these  counterparties,  the  Company considers this risk to be remote.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that sufficient funds will not be available to satisfy financial obligations as they come due. In addition to cash generated from operations, which represents its principal source of liquidity, the Company manages liquidity risk by aligning other external sources of funds which can be obtained upon short notice, such as revolving credit facilities, commercial paper programs, and an accounts receivable securitization program. As well, the Company can issue debt securities in the Canadian and U.S. capital markets under its shelf prospectus and registration  statement.  The  Company's  access  to  long-term  funds  in  the  debt  capital  markets  depends  on  its  credit  ratings  and  market conditions. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings contribute to reasonable access to capital markets. See the section of this MD&A entitled Liquidity and capital resources for  additional information relating to the Company's available financing sources and its credit ratings.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate  between  the  Canadian  dollar  and  the  US  dollar  affect  the  Company's  revenues  and  expenses.  To  manage  foreign  currency  risk,  the Company  designates  US  dollar-denominated  debt  of  the  parent  company  as  a  foreign  currency  hedge  of  its  net  investment  in  foreign operations.  As  a  result,  from  the  dates  of  designation,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  translation  of  the  Company's  US  dollardenominated debt are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which minimizes volatility of earnings resulting from the conversion of US dollar-denominated debt into the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase a notional value of US$1,496 million (2022 - US$1,311 million). These outstanding contracts are at a weighted-average exchange rate of $1.37 per US$1.00 (2022 - $1.33 per US$1.00) with exchange rates ranging from $1.34 to $1.39 per US$1.00 (2022 - $1.29 to $1.37 per US$1.00). The weighted-average term of the contracts is 77 days (2022 157 days) with terms ranging from 26 days to 178 days (2022 - 29 days to 300 days). Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, are recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a loss of $45 million (2022 - gain of $129 million; 2021 - loss of $18 million),  related  to  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts.  These  gains  and  losses  were  largely  offset  by  the  re-measurement  of  US  dollardenominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  recognized  in  Other  income.  As  at  December  31,  2023,  the  fair  value  of  outstanding  foreign exchange forward contracts included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other was $nil and $64 million, respectively (2022 - $33 million and $4 million, respectively).\n\nThe estimated annual impact on Net income of a one-cent change in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar is approximately $31 million.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. Such risk exists in relation to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability  in  interest  expense.  To  manage  interest  rate  risk,  the  Company  manages  its  borrowings  in  line  with  liquidity  needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profile. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may use derivative instruments such as forward rate agreements.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into treasury lock agreements to hedge US Treasury benchmark rates related to expected debt issuances in  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  The  treasury  locks  were  designated  as  cash  flow  hedging  instruments  with  cumulative  gains  or losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in derivative instruments. In conjunction with the November 1, 2023 debt issuance, the Company settled a notional US$450 million ($622 million) of treasury locks, resulting in a cumulative gain of $97 million. The cash proceeds were  included  in  operating  activities  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  and  the  gain  was  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In conjunction with the August 5, 2022 debt issuance, the Company settled a notional US$675 million ($868 million) of treasury locks, resulting in a cumulative loss of $2 million. This loss was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no treasury locks outstanding.\n\nThe estimated annual impact on Net income of a one-percent change in the interest rate on floating rate debt is approximately $21 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to commodity price risk related to purchases of fuel and the potential reduction in Net income due to increases in the price of diesel. Fuel prices are impacted by geopolitical events, changes in the economy or supply disruptions. Fuel shortages can occur due to refinery disruptions, production quota restrictions, climate, and labor and political instability.\n\nThe Company manages fuel price risk by offsetting the impact of rising fuel prices with the Company's fuel surcharge program. The surcharge applied to customers is determined in the second calendar month prior to the month in which it is applied, and is generally calculated using the average monthly price of On-Highway Diesel.\n\nWhile  the  Company's  fuel  surcharge  program  provides  effective  coverage,  residual  exposure  remains  given  that  fuel  price  risk  cannot  be completely  managed  due  to  timing  and  given  the  volatility  in  the  market.  As  such,  the  Company  may  enter  into  derivative  instruments  to manage such risk when considered appropriate.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  financial  instruments  that  the  Company  measures  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  in  periods  subsequent  to  initial  recognition  are categorized into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which inputs are observable:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Significant inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Significant inputs are unobservable\n\nThe  carrying  amounts  of  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  Restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents  approximate  fair  value.  These  financial instruments include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity, for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amounts of Accounts receivable, Other current assets and Accounts payable and other approximate fair value due to their short maturity, unless otherwise specified. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, included in Intangible assets, goodwill  and  other,  is  classified  as  Level  1  with  gains  and  losses  being  recorded  in  Other  income  within  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other is classified as Level 2 and is used to manage the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk. The fair value is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate derived from market data for financial instruments subject to similar risks and maturities.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Company's debt does not approximate fair value. The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments, as well as discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity. The Company classifies debt as Level 2. As at December 31, 2023, the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, had a carrying amount of $18,435 million (2022 - $15,419 million) and a fair value of $17,844 million (2022 - $14,137 million). The carrying amount of debt excluding finance leases exceeded the fair value due to an increase in market rates compared to the stated coupon rate.\n\n|",

The main amendments in the ASU require public entities, including those that  have  a  single  reportable  segment,  to  disclose  on  an  annual  and  interim  basis  the  significant  segment  expenses  provided  to  the  chief operating decision maker (CODM), disclose the title/position of the CODM and how the segment expenses information is used in the decision making process.\n\nThe ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted.\n\nThe adoption of the ASU will have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements disclosures. The Company will include the relevant disclosure within the 2024 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and 2025 Interim Financial Statements.\n\n## ASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to income tax disclosures\n\nThe  ASU  amends  the  rules  on  income  tax  disclosures  by  modifying  or  eliminating  certain  existing  income  tax  disclosure  requirements  in addition to establishing new requirements. The amendments address investor requests for more transparency about income taxes, including jurisdictional information, by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information. The ASU's two primary amendments relate to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid annual disclosures.\n\nReconciling  items  presented  in  the  rate  reconciliation  will  be  in  dollar  amounts  and  percentages,  and  will  be  disaggregated  into  specified categories  with  certain  reconciling  items  further  broken  out  by  nature  and/or  jurisdiction  using  a  5%  threshold  of  domestic  federal  taxes. Income taxes paid will be disaggregated between federal, provincial/territorial, and foreign taxing jurisdictions using a 5% threshold of total income taxes paid net of refunds received.\n\nThe ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The ASU should be applied prospectively. Retrospective application is permitted.\n\nThe  adoption  of  the  ASU  will  have  an  impact  on  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  disclosures.  The  required  disclosure changes will be reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements when the ASU is adopted.\n\nThe following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06 Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and related amendments\n\nUSD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) are benchmark interest rates referenced in a variety of agreements. The publication of certain LIBOR and CDOR rates were discontinued in January 2022 and May 2021, respectively. The remaining LIBOR  rates  were  discontinued  on  June  30,  2023  and  the  remaining  CDOR  rates  are  expected  to  be  discontinued  on  June  30,  2024.  The recommended alternative reference rates for LIBOR and CDOR are the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), respectively.\n\nThe  ASU  provides  optional  expedients  and  exceptions  for  applying  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to  transactions  affected  by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. The ASU was effective starting on March 12, 2020, and is available to be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2024, following the amendments of ASU 2022-06.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe Company was eligible and has elected to use the optional expedient provided by the ASU which allowed the amendment to be accounted for  as  a  non  substantial  modification  of  an  existing  debt.  As  a  result,  the  amendment  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  to  the  Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. See the section of this MD&A entitled Liquidity  and  capital  resources - Available financing sources for additional information on reference rate reform with respect to the non-revolving credit facility, revolving credit facilities, equipment loans and accounts receivable securitization program.\n\nOther recently issued ASUs required to be applied on or after December 31, 2023 have been evaluated by the Company and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based upon available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company's policies for income taxes, capital expenditures and depreciation and pensions and other postretirement benefits  require  management's  more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  in  the  preparation  of  the  Company's  consolidated  financial statements and, as such, are considered to be critical. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\n\nManagement discusses the development and selection of the Company's critical accounting policies, including the underlying estimates and assumptions, with the Audit, Finance and Risk Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The Audit, Finance and Risk Committee has reviewed the Company's related disclosures.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability is included in the computation of Net income or Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred income tax assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  using  enacted  income  tax  rates  expected  to  apply  to  taxable  income  in  the  years  in  which  temporary differences  are  expected  to  be  recovered  or  settled.  As  a  result,  a  projection  of  taxable  income  is  required  for  those  years,  as  well  as  an assumption  of  the  ultimate  recovery/settlement  period  for  temporary  differences.  The  projection  of  future  taxable  income  is  based  on management's best estimate and may vary from actual taxable income.\n\nOn an annual basis, the Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred income tax assets, and if it is deemed more likely  than  not  that  its  deferred  income  tax  assets  will  not  be  realized,  a  valuation  allowance  is  recorded.  The  ultimate  realization  of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, of the necessary character, during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, the available carryback and carryforward periods, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As at December 31, 2023, in order to fully realize all of the deferred income tax assets excluding the tax-deductible goodwill, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  $1.8  billion,  and,  based  upon  the  level  of  historical  taxable  income,  projections  of  future  taxable  income  of  the  necessary character  over  the  periods  in  which  the  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  deductible,  and  the  reversal  of  taxable  temporary  differences, management believes, following an assessment of the current economic environment, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the  benefits  of  these  deductible  differences.  Management  believes  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  CN  will  fully  realize  the  benefits  of  the remaining  $5.8  billion  unamortized  tax-deductible  goodwill  because  under  the  current  tax  laws  the  Company  has  the  ability  and  intent  to maintain the necessary intercompany arrangements that will generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character in the nonU.S. foreign jurisdiction, and to fully utilize the tax-deductible goodwill. As at December 31, 2023, the Company has not recognized a deferred income tax asset of $217 million (2022 - $196 million) on the unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to its net investment in U.S. subsidiaries, as the Company does not expect this temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nIn addition, Canadian, or domestic, tax rules and regulations, as well as those relating to foreign jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and require judgment by the Company that may be challenged by the taxation authorities upon audit of the filed income tax returns. Tax benefits are recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxation authorities. As at December 31, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $46 million, before considering tax treaties and other arrangements between taxation authorities. The amount of net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2023 was $32 million. If recognized, $18 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2023 would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $13 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2023 related to Canadian and U.S. federal, state, and provincial income tax matters, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized over the next twelve months as a result of settlements and a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations of which approximately half will affect the effective tax rate as the remaining amount relates to temporary differences.\n\nThe Company's deferred income tax assets are mainly composed of temporary differences related to tax-deductible goodwill, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, lease liabilities, the pension liability, accruals for personal injury and other claims, other postretirement benefits liability,  and  compensation reserves. The Company's deferred income tax liabilities are mainly composed of temporary differences related to properties, the pension asset and operating lease right-of-use assets. These deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the enacted tax rates of the periods in which the related temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result, fiscal budget changes and/ or changes in income tax laws that affect a change in the timing, the amount, and/or the income tax rate at which the temporary difference components will reverse, could materially affect deferred income tax expense as recorded in the Company's results of operations. The reversal of temporary differences is expected at future-enacted income tax rates which could change due to fiscal budget changes and/or changes in income tax laws. As a result, a change in the timing and/or the income tax rate at which the components will reverse, could materially affect deferred  income  tax  expense  as  recorded  in  the  Company's  results  of  operations.  From  time  to  time,  the  federal,  provincial,  and  state governments enact new corporate income tax rates  resulting  in  either  lower  or  higher  tax  liabilities. A  one-percentage-point  change  in  the Canadian, U.S., and non-U.S. statutory federal tax rate would have the effect of changing the deferred income tax expense by $223 million, $155 million, and $58 million, respectively, in 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $863 million, of which $288 million was a deferred income tax recovery. The deferred income tax recovery included a net recovery of $682 million resulting from tax filings consistent with a ruling that  the  Company  received  in  a  non-U.S.  foreign  jurisdiction  in  connection  with  prior  taxation  years,  comprised  of  a  $767  million  deferred income tax recovery related to the tax-deductible goodwill initially generated as of January 1, 2021, partly offset by a $85 million income tax expense related to the foregone tax deduction ($31 million for 2023 and $54 million for prior years) which was initially recorded in current taxes and was then reclassified to deferred taxes following the amortization of the tax-deductible goodwill for those years.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,645 million, of which $404 million was a deferred income tax expense.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1,443 million, of which $513 million was a deferred income tax expense.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company had deferred income tax assets of $682 million (2022 - $nil) and deferred income tax liabilities of $10,066  million  (2022  -  $9,796  million).  Additional  disclosures  are  provided  in Note  8  -  Income  taxes to  the  Company's  2023  Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Capital expenditures and depreciation\n\nProperties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation including asset impairment write-downs. The Company has a process in place to determine whether or not costs qualify for capitalization, which requires judgment. The cost of properties, including those under finance leases, net of asset impairment write-downs, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, measured in years, except for rail and ballast whose services lives are measured in millions of gross tons. The Company follows the group method of depreciation whereby a single composite depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a class of similar assets, despite small differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same asset class. The Company uses approximately 40 different depreciable asset classes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nFor all depreciable assets, the depreciation rate is based on the estimated service lives of the assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the estimated service lives of properties requires judgment and is based on currently available information, including periodic depreciation studies conducted by the Company. The Company's U.S. properties are subject to comprehensive depreciation studies as required by the STB and are conducted by external experts. Depreciation studies for Canadian properties are not required by regulation and are conducted internally. Studies are performed on specific asset groups on a periodic basis. Changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related composite depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\n\nThe  studies  consider,  among  other  factors,  the  analysis  of  historical  retirement  data  using  recognized  life  analysis  techniques,  and  the forecasting  of  asset  life  characteristics.  Changes  in  circumstances,  such  as  technological  advances,  changes  to  the  Company's  business strategy, changes in the Company's capital strategy or changes in regulations can result in the actual service lives differing from the Company's estimates.\n\nA  change  in  the  remaining  service  life  of  a  group  of  assets,  or  their  estimated  net  salvage  value,  will  affect  the  depreciation  rate  used  to amortize the group of assets and thus affect depreciation expense as reported in the Company's results of operations. A change of one year in the composite service life of the Company's fixed asset base would impact annual depreciation expense by approximately $74 million.\n\nDepreciation studies are a means of ensuring that the assumptions used to estimate the service lives of particular asset groups are still valid and where they are not, they serve as the basis to establish the new depreciation rates to be used on a prospective basis. In 2023, the Company completed depreciation studies for equipment properties and as a result, the Company changed the estimated service lives for various types of equipment  assets  and  their  related  composite  depreciation  rates.  The  results  of  these  depreciation  studies  did  not  materially  affect  the Company's annual depreciation expense.\n\nGiven the nature of the railroad and the composition of its network which is made up of homogeneous long-lived assets, it is impractical to maintain records of specific properties at their lowest unit of property.\n\nRetirements of assets occur through the replacement of an asset in the normal course of business, the sale of an asset or the abandonment of a section of track. For retirements in the normal course of business, generally the life of the retired asset is within a reasonable range of the expected useful life, as determined in the depreciation studies, and, as such, no gain or loss is recognized under the group method. The asset's cost is removed from the asset account and the difference between its cost and estimated related accumulated depreciation (net of salvage proceeds), if any, is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of the retired asset is estimated by using deflation factors or indices that closely correlate to the properties comprising the asset classes in combination with the estimated age of the retired asset using a first-in, first-out approach, and applying it to the replacement value of the asset.\n\nIn each depreciation study, an estimate is made of any excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation for all corresponding asset classes to ensure that the depreciation rates remain appropriate. The excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation is amortized over the remaining life of the asset class.\n\nFor retirements of depreciable properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, the historical cost, net of salvage proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in income. A retirement is considered not to be in the normal course of business if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is significant in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement pattern identified through depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in Other income for the sale of land or disposal of assets that are not part of railroad operations.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded total depreciation expense of $1,811 million (2022 - $1,723 million; 2021 - $1,593 million). As at December 31, 2023, the Company had Properties of $44,617 million, net of accumulated depreciation of $17,394 million (2022 $43,537  million,  net  of  accumulated  depreciation  of  $16,526  million).  Additional  disclosures  are  provided  in Note  12  -  Properties to  the Company's 2023 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nGAAP requires the use of historical cost as the basis of reporting in financial statements. As a result, the cumulative effect of inflation, which has  significantly  increased  asset  replacement  costs  for  capital-intensive  companies  such  as  CN,  is  not  reflected  in  operating  expenses. Depreciation  charges  on  an  inflation-adjusted  basis,  assuming  that  all  operating  assets  are  replaced  at  current  price  levels,  would  be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Pensions\n\nEffective  January  1,  2022,  CN  elected  to  change  its  accounting  methodology  for  determining  the  market-related  value  of  assets  for  the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The new accounting method changed the calculation of market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost but had no impact on the annual funded status of the plans. The Company's previous methodology calculated market-related value for pensions whereby realized and unrealized gains/losses and appreciation/depreciation in the value of the investments were recognized over a period of five years. The Company's new methodology applies a corridor approach so that the marketrelated value does not result in a value that deviates excessively from its fair value. Specifically, the market-related value will not exceed 110% or be less than 90% of the fair value. This change established a corridor approach whereby the amount causing the market-related value to be outside of the 10% corridor is recognized immediately in the market-related value of assets and will not be subject to the five-year period of recognition. There is no change in the recognition approach for investment income.\n\n## Pensions and other postretirement benefits\n\nThe Company's plans have a measurement date of December 31.\n\n| In millions                                  | As at December 31,   | 2023     | 2022     |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|\n| Pension asset                                |                      | $  3,140 | $  3,033 |\n| Pension liability                            |                      | $  362   | $  353   |\n| Other postretirement benefits liability  (1) |                      | $  145   | $  147   |\n\nThe descriptions in the following paragraphs pertaining to pensions relate generally to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Amendments to postretirement medical benefits plans in the U.S.\n\nIn  June  2022,  CN  approved  changes  affecting  members  participating  in  the  Company's  postretirement  medical  benefits  plans  in  the  U.S. Beginning in 2023, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. This change constituted a plan amendment event resulting in a $28 million reduction to the affected plans' Accumulated projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income, and is composed of a prior service credit of $21 million and an actuarial gain of $7 million, substantially all due to lower expected future benefit payments and to the approximate 130 basis point increase in the end of period discount rates between December 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n## Curtailment event\n\nOn October 31, 2021, the CN Board of Directors approved changes affecting non-unionized members participating in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Effective April 1, 2024, the affected defined benefit pension plans will be amended to cease benefits accruals for nonunionized members, generally known as a delayed hard freeze. Effective April 1, 2024, all non-unionized members will be transferred to the Company's defined contribution pension plans for their future service. This delayed hard freeze constitutes a plan curtailment event recognized on October 31, 2021 resulting in a $52 million reduction to the Projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income as an actuarial  gain,  mostly  due  to  reflecting  projected  future  salary  increases  and  service  only  up  to  April  1,  2024.  The  curtailment  event  also triggered  an  interim  re-measurement  of  the  funded  status  of  the  affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  resulting  in  an  actuarial  gain  of $1,915 million recorded in Other comprehensive income composed of i) an actuarial gain on the Projected benefit obligation of $1,808 million substantially all due to the 84 basis point increase in the end of period discount rate between December 31, 2020 of 2.55% and October 31, 2021 of 3.39%, and ii) an actuarial gain on the Plan assets of $107 million due to higher actual returns of $982 million compared to expected returns of $875 million over that same ten-month period. Due to the interim re-measurement, the resulting Net periodic benefit income recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $25 million composed of i) a decrease to Current service cost of $9 million, and ii) an increase to Other components of net periodic benefit income of $16 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Calculation of net periodic benefit cost (income)\n\nIn accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, assumptions are required for, among other things, the discount rate, the expected long-term  rate  of  return  on  plan  assets,  the  rate  of  compensation  increase,  health  care  cost  trend  rates,  mortality  rates,  employee  early retirements,  terminations  and  disability.  Changes  in  these  assumptions  result  in  actuarial  gains  or  losses,  which  are  recognized  in  Other comprehensive  income  (loss).  The  Company  generally  amortizes  these  gains  or  losses  into  net  periodic  benefit  cost  (income)  over  the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses are in excess of the corridor threshold, which is calculated as 10% of the greater of the beginning-of-year balances of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets. The Company's net periodic benefit cost (income) for future periods is dependent on demographic experience,  economic  conditions  and  investment  performance.  Recent  demographic  experience  has  revealed  no  material  net gains  or  losses  on  termination,  retirement,  disability  and  mortality.  Experience  with  respect  to  economic  conditions  and  investment performance is further discussed herein.\n\n## Net periodic benefit cost (income)\n\n| In millions                                                 | Year ended December 31,   | 2023   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Net periodic benefit income for pensions                    | $                         | (393)  | $  (340) | $  (210) |\n| Net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits | $                         | (2)    | $  1     | $  2     |\n\nProjected pension benefit obligation and accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation\n\n| In millions                                         | As at December 31,   | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Projected pension benefit obligation                |                      | $  14,755 | $  13,909 |\n| Accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation |                      | $  145    | $  147    |\n\n## Discount rate assumption\n\nThe Company's discount rate assumption, which is set annually at the end of each year, is determined by management with the aid of thirdparty actuaries. The discount rate is used to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with a rating of AA or better, would provide the necessary cash flows to pay for pension benefits as they become due. For the Canadian pension and other postretirement benefit plans, future expected benefit payments are discounted using spot rates based on a derived AA corporate bond yield curve for each maturity year. A year-end discount rate of 4.64% based on bond yields prevailing at December 31, 2023 (2022 - 5.26%) was considered appropriate by the Company.\n\nThe  Company  uses  the  spot  rate  approach  to  measure  current  service  cost  and  interest  cost  for  all  defined  benefit  pension  and  other postretirement benefit plans. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates along the same yield curve used in the determination of  the  projected  benefit  obligation  are  applied  to  the  relevant  projected  cash  flows  for  current  service  cost  at  the  relevant  maturity.  More specifically, current service cost is measured using the cash flows related to benefits expected to be accrued in the following year by active members of a plan and interest cost is measured using the projected cash flows making up the projected benefit obligation multiplied by the corresponding spot discount rate at each maturity. As at December 31, 2023, the rate to determine current service cost was 5.25% (2022 3.40%) and the rate to determine interest cost was 5.21% (2022 - 2.67%).\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, a 0.25% decrease in discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation, current service cost and interest cost would have resulted in a decrease of approximately $380 million to the funded status for pensions and would result in a decrease of approximately $18 million to the 2024 projected net periodic benefit income. A 0.25% increase in discount rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $360 million to the funded status for pensions and would result in an increase of approximately $17 million to the 2024 projected net periodic benefit income.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Expected long-term rate of return assumption\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return is determined based on expected future performance for each asset class and is weighted based on the investment policy. Consideration is taken of the historical performance, the premium return generated from an actively managed portfolio, as well  as  current  target  asset  allocations,  published  market  return  expectations,  economic  developments,  inflation  rates  and  administrative expenses. Based on these factors, the rate is determined by the Company. For 2023, the Company used a long-term rate of return assumption of 7.60% on the market-related value of plan assets to compute net periodic benefit cost (income). In 2024, the Company will decrease the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 30 basis points to 7.30% to reflect management's current view of long-term investment returns.\n\nThe assets of the Company's various plans are primarily held in separate trust funds (\"Trusts\") which are diversified by asset type, geography, sector and investment strategy. Each year, the CN Board of Directors reviews and confirms or amends the Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (SIPP) which includes the plans' long-term target asset allocation (\"Policy\") and related benchmark indices. This Policy is based on  the  long-term  expectations  of  the  economy  and  financial  market  returns  and  considers  the  dynamics  of  the  plans'  pension  benefit obligations.  In  2023,  the  Policy  was  amended  to  implement  a  target  asset  allocation  change  to  bonds  and  mortgages  and  equities.  These changes were taken into account in the determination of the Company's expected long-term rate of return assumption. In 2023, the Policy was: 2% cash and short-term investments, 41% bonds and mortgages, 2% emerging market debt, 3% private debt, 29% equities, 4% real estate, 5% resource  and  royalties,  4%  infrastructure,  2%  specialty  portfolio,  12%  absolute  return  investments  and  negative  4%  for  investment-related liabilities.\n\nAnnually, the CN Investment Division (\"Investment Manager\"), a division of the Company created to invest and administer the assets of the plans, can also implement an investment strategy (\"Strategy\") which can lead the Plan's actual asset allocation to deviate from the Policy due to changing market risks and opportunities. The Pension and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Committee\") regularly compares the actual plan asset allocation to the Policy and Strategy and compares the actual performance of the Company's pension plan assets to the performance of the benchmark indices.\n\nThe  Committee's  approval  is  required  for  all  major  investments  in  illiquid  securities.  The  SIPP  allows  for  the  use  of  derivative  financial instruments to implement strategies, to hedge and to adjust existing or anticipated exposures. The SIPP prohibits investments in securities of the Company or its subsidiaries.\n\n|                      | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Actual               | 11.9%  | (14.2%) | 8.7%   | 12.5%  | 12.2%  |\n| Market-related value | 5.0%   | 2.8%    | 8.0%   | 7.1%   | 6.1%   |\n| Expected             | 7.60%  | 7.00%   | 6.79%  | 7.00%  | 7.00%  |\n\nThe Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management's view of long-term investment returns and the effect of a  1%  variation  in  such  rate  of  return  would  result  in  a  change  to  the  net  periodic  benefit  cost  (income)  of  approximately  $110  million. Management's assumption of the expected long-term rate of return is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual rate of return to differ materially from management's assumption. There can be no assurance that the plan assets will be able to earn the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Net periodic benefit income for pensions for 2024\n\nIn  2024,  the  Company  expects  net  periodic  benefit  income  to  be  approximately  $350  million  for  all  its  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  as compared to actual net periodic benefit income of $393 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Plan asset allocation\n\nBased on the fair value of the assets held as at December 31, 2023, the assets of the Company's various plans are comprised of 2% in cash and short-term investments, 41% in bonds and mortgages, 2% in emerging market debt, 6% in private debt, 25% in equities, 3% in real estate, 7% in resource and royalties, 4% in infrastructure, 2% in specialty portfolio, 14% in absolute return investments and negative 6% in investment-related liabilities.  See Note 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits to  the  Company's  2023  Annual  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for additional information on the fair value measurements of such assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nA  significant  portion  of  the  plans'  assets  are  invested  in  publicly  traded  equity  securities  whose  return  is  primarily  driven  by  stock  market performance. Debt securities also account for a significant portion of the plans' investments and provide a partial offset to the variation in the pension benefit obligation that is driven by changes in the discount rate. The funded status of the plan fluctuates with market conditions and impacts  funding  requirements.  The  Company  will  continue  to  make  contributions  to  the  pension  plans  that  as  a  minimum  meet  pension legislative requirements.\n\n## Rate of compensation increase\n\nThe rate of compensation increase is determined by the Company based upon its long-term plans for such increases. For 2023, a basic rate of compensation increase of 2.75% was used to determine the projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost (income).\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe  Canadian  Institute  of  Actuaries  (CIA)  published  in  2014  a  report  on  Canadian  Pensioners'  Mortality  (\"Report\").  The  Report  contained Canadian pensioners' mortality tables and improvement scales based on experience studies conducted by the CIA. The CIA's conclusions were taken  into  account  in  selecting  management's  best  estimate  mortality  assumption  used  to  calculate  the  projected  benefit  obligation  as  at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Funding of pension plans\n\nThe Company's main Canadian defined benefit pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, accounts for 93% of the Company's pension obligation and can produce significant volatility in pension funding requirements, given the pension fund's size, the many factors that drive the plan's funded status, and Canadian statutory pension funding requirements. Adverse changes to the assumptions used to calculate the plan's funding status, particularly the discount rate used for funding purposes, as well as changes to existing federal pension legislation, regulation and guidance could significantly impact the Company's future contributions.\n\nFor accounting purposes, the funded status is calculated under generally accepted accounting principles for all pension plans. For funding purposes, the funded status is also calculated under going concern and solvency scenarios as prescribed under pension legislation and subject to guidance issued by the CIA and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) for all registered Canadian defined benefit pension plans. The Company's funding requirements are determined upon completion of actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations are generally required on an annual basis for all Canadian defined benefit pension plans, or when deemed appropriate by the OSFI. Actuarial valuations are also required annually for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\nThe Company's most recently filed actuarial valuations for funding purposes for its Canadian registered defined pension plans conducted as at December 31, 2022 indicated a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.4 billion and a funding excess on a solvency basis of approximately $1.6 billion, calculated using the three-year average of the plans' hypothetical wind-up ratio in accordance with the Pension Benefit  Standards  Regulations,  1985 .  The  federal  pension  legislation  requires  funding  deficits,  if  any,  to  be  paid  over  a  number  of  years,  as calculated under current pension regulations. Alternatively, a letter of credit can be subscribed to fulfill required solvency deficit payments.\n\nThe  Company's  next  actuarial  valuations  for  funding  purposes  for  its  Canadian  registered  defined  benefit  pension  plans  required  as  at December 31, 2023 will be performed in 2024. These actuarial valuations are expected to identify a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.9 billion, while on a solvency basis a funding excess of approximately $2.6 billion is expected.\n\nBased on the anticipated results  of  these  valuations,  the  CN  Pension  Plan  is  expected  to  remain  fully  funded  and  at  a  level  such  that  the Company would continue to be prohibited from making contributions to the CN Pension Plan in 2024. As such, the Company expects to make total cash contributions of approximately $70 million in 2024 for all other pension plans, and includes the impact of affected non-unionized members transferring from the Company's defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution pension plans effective April 1, 2024. The Company expects cash from operations and its other sources of financing to be sufficient to meet its 2024 funding obligations.\n\n|",

While some exposures may be reduced by the Company's risk management strategies, many risks are driven by external factors beyond the Company's control or are of a nature which cannot be eliminated. The key areas of  business  risks  and  uncertainties  described  in  this  section  are  not  the  only  ones  that  can  affect  the  Company.  Additional  risks  and uncertainties not currently known to management or that may currently not be considered material by management, could nevertheless also have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe  Company  faces  significant  competition,  including  from  rail  carriers  and  other  modes  of  transportation,  and  is  also  affected  by  its customers' flexibility  to  select  among  various  origins  and  destinations,  including  ports,  in  getting  their  products  to  market.  Specifically,  the Company faces competition from Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (CPKC), which operates the other major rail system in Canada and services  most  of  the  same  industrial  areas,  commodity  resources  and  population  centers  as  the  Company;  major  U.S.  railroads  and  other Canadian and U.S. railroads; long-distance trucking companies, transportation via the St. Lawrence-Great Lakes Seaway and the Mississippi River  and  transportation  via  pipelines.  In  addition,  while  railroads  must  build  or  acquire  and  maintain  their  rail  systems,  motor  carriers  and barges are able to use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by public entities without paying fees covering the entire costs of their usage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nCompetition is generally based on the quality and the reliability of the service provided, access to markets, as well as price. Factors affecting the  competitive  position  of  customers,  including  exchange  rates  and  energy  cost,  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  demand  for  goods supplied by the sources served by the Company and, therefore, the Company's volumes, revenues and profit margins. Factors affecting the general market conditions for the Company's customers can result in an imbalance of transportation capacity relative to demand. An extended period  of  supply/demand  imbalance  could  negatively  impact  market  rate  levels  for  all  transportation  services,  and  more  specifically  the Company's  ability  to  maintain  or  increase  rates.  This,  in  turn,  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  results  of operations or financial position.\n\nPrevious consolidation of rail systems in the U.S. have resulted in larger rail systems that are in a position to compete effectively with the Company in numerous markets.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete effectively against current or future competitors in the transportation industry, or that further consolidation within the transportation industry and legislation allowing for more leniency in size and weight for motor carriers will not adversely affect the Company's competitive position. No assurance can be given that competitive pressures in transportation markets will not lead to reduced revenues, profit margins or both.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada and the U.S. concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment  and  disposal  of  waste,  hazardous  substances  and  other  materials;  decommissioning  of  underground  and  aboveground  storage tanks; and soil and groundwater contamination. A risk of environmental liability is inherent in railroad and related transportation operations; real estate ownership, operation or control; and other commercial activities of the Company with respect to both current and past operations. As a result, the Company incurs significant operating and capital costs, on an ongoing basis, associated with environmental regulatory compliance and clean-up requirements in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property.\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters in the next several years based on known information, the discovery of new facts, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental liabilities that may be associated with its properties may result in the identification of additional environmental liabilities and related costs.\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. In addition, the Company is also exposed to potential catastrophic liability risk, faced by the railroad industry in general, in connection with the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials such as chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, or other dangerous commodities such as crude oil and propane that the Company may be required to transport as a result of its common carrier obligations. Therefore, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address  any  such  harm,  compliance  with  laws  or  other  risks,  including  costs  relating  to  the  performance  of  clean-ups,  payment  of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\nThe environmental liability for any given contaminated site varies depending on the nature and extent of the contamination; the available cleanup  techniques;  evolving  regulatory  standards  governing  environmental  liability;  and  the  number  of  potentially  responsible  parties  and  their financial  viability.  As  such,  the  ultimate  cost  of  addressing  known  contaminated  sites  cannot  be  definitively  established.  Also,  additional contaminated sites yet unknown may be discovered or future operations may result in accidental releases.\n\nWhile some exposures may be reduced by the Company's risk mitigation strategies (including periodic audits, employee training programs, emergency plans and procedures, and insurance), many environmental risks are driven by external factors beyond the Company's control or are of a nature which cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, there can be no assurance, notwithstanding the Company's mitigation strategies, that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future or that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity, or reputation.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn  the  normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages,  including  actions  brought  on  behalf  of  various  purported  classes  of  claimants  and  claims  relating  to  employee  and  third-party personal injuries, occupational disease, and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to,  derailments  or  other  accidents.  The  Company  maintains  provisions  for  such  items,  which  it  considers  to  be  adequate  for  all  of  its outstanding or pending claims and benefits from insurance coverage for occurrences in excess of certain amounts. The final outcome with respect  to  actions  outstanding  or  pending  at  December  31,  2023,  or  with  respect  to  future  claims,  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty,  and therefore  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  their  resolution  will  not  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations, financial position or liquidity, in a particular quarter or fiscal year.\n\n## Labor negotiations\n\nThe working conditions of the Company's unionized workforce are governed by collective agreements which are negotiated from time to time. Disputes  relating  to  the  renewal  of  collective  agreements  have  previously  resulted  in  and  could  in  the  future  potentially  result  in  strikes, lockouts, slowdown of the business and ultimately loss of business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to renew and have its collective agreements ratified without a strike or lockout or that the resolution of these negotiations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results or financial position. Future labor agreements could increase labor and fringe benefits and related expenses.\n\n## Economic conditions\n\nThe Company is susceptible to changes in the economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas that produce and consume the freight it transports or the supplies it requires to operate. In addition, many of the goods and commodities carried by the Company experience cyclical demand. For example, the volatility in domestic and global energy markets could impact the demand for transportation services as well as impact the Company's fuel costs and surcharges, and such price increases could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. In addition, the volatility in other commodity markets such as coal and iron ore could have an impact on volumes. Many of the bulk commodities  the  Company  transports  move  offshore  and  are  affected  more  by  global  rather  than  North  American  economic  conditions. Adverse North American and global economic conditions, or economic or industrial restructuring, that affect the producers and consumers of the commodities carried by the Company, including customer insolvency, may have a material adverse effect on the volume of rail shipments and/or  revenues  from  commodities  carried  by  the  Company,  and  thus  materially  and  negatively  affect  its  results  of  operations,  financial position,  or  liquidity.  Moreover,  supply  chain  disruptions  in  North  America  and  internationally,  including  labor  shortages  or  other  services disruptions  affecting  trucking,  ports,  handling  facilities,  customer  facilities  or  other  railroads,  may  adversely  affect  volumes  of  goods  and timelines, and therefore adversely affect CN's operations and financial results.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Company is subject to regulatory and legislative initiatives in the operation of its business.\n\n## Economic regulation - Canada\n\nThe  Company's  rail  operations  in  Canada  are  subject  to  economic  regulation  by  the  Canadian  Transportation  Agency  under  the Canada Transportation Act ,  which  provides  rate  and  service  remedies,  including  final  offer  arbitration,  long-haul  interswitching  rates  and  mandatory interswitching. It also regulates the maximum revenue entitlement for the movement of regulated grain, charges for railway ancillary services and noise-related disputes. In addition, various Company business transactions must gain prior regulatory approval, with attendant risks and uncertainties, and the Company is subject to government oversight with respect to rate, service and business practice issues.\n\n## Economic regulation - U.S.\n\nThe Company's U.S. rail operations are subject to economic regulation by the STB. The STB serves as both an adjudicatory and regulatory body and has jurisdiction over certain railroad rate and service issues and rail restructuring transactions such as mergers, line sales, line construction and line abandonments. As such, various Company business transactions must gain prior regulatory approval and aspects of its pricing and service practices may be subject to challenge, with attendant risks and uncertainties. Recent proposals in proceedings undertaken by the STB in a number of significant matters remain pending.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Safety regulation - Canada\n\nThe Company's rail operations in Canada are subject to safety regulation by the Minister under the Railway Safety Act as well as the rail portions of  other  safety-related  statutes,  which  are  administered  by  Transport  Canada.  The  Company  may  be  required  to  transport  toxic  inhalation hazard materials as a result of its common carrier obligations and, as such, is also subject to additional regulatory oversight in Canada. The Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act , also administered by Transport Canada, establishes the safety requirements for the transportation of goods classified as dangerous and enables the adoption of regulations for security training and screening of personnel working with dangerous goods, as well as the development of a program to require a transportation security clearance for dangerous goods, the tracking of dangerous goods during transport and the development of an emergency response plan.\n\n## Safety regulation - U.S.\n\nThe Company's U.S. rail operations are subject to safety regulation by the FRA under the Federal Railroad Safety Act as well as rail portions of other safety statutes, with the transportation of certain hazardous commodities also governed by regulations promulgated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA requires carriers operating in the U.S. to report annually the volume and routespecific data for cars containing these commodities; conduct a safety and security risk analysis for each used route; identify a commercially practicable alternative route for each used route; and select for use the practical route posing the least safety and security risk. In addition, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires rail carriers to provide upon request, within five minutes for a single car and 30 minutes for  multiple  cars,  location  and  shipping  information  on  cars  on  their  networks  containing  toxic  inhalation  hazard  materials  and  certain radioactive or explosive materials; and ensure the secure, attended transfer of all such cars to and from shippers, receivers and other carriers that will move from, to, or through designated high-threat urban areas.\n\n## Regulation - Vessels\n\nThe  Company's  vessel  operations  are  subject  to  regulation  by  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  the  Department  of  Transportation,  Maritime Administration, which regulate the ownership and operation of vessels operating on the Great Lakes and in U.S. coastal waters. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to regulate air emissions from these vessels.\n\n## Security\n\nThe Company is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in the U.S. addressing homeland security concerns. In the U.S., safety matters related to security are overseen by the TSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and PHMSA, which, like the FRA, is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Border security falls under the jurisdiction of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which is  part  of  the  DHS.  In  Canada,  the  Company  is  subject  to  regulation  by  the  Canada  Border  Services  Agency  (CBSA).  Matters  related  to agriculture-related shipments crossing the Canada/U.S. border also fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in Canada. More specifically, the Company is subject to:\n\n- \u00b7 border security arrangements, pursuant to an agreement the Company and CPKC entered into with the CBP and the CBSA;\n- \u00b7 the CBP's Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program and designation as a low-risk carrier under CBSA's Customs Self-Assessment (CSA) program;\n- \u00b7 regulations imposed by the CBP requiring advance notification by all modes of transportation for all shipments into the U.S. The CBSA is also working on similar requirements for Canada-bound traffic;\n- \u00b7 inspection for imported fruits and vegetables grown in Canada and the agricultural quarantine and inspection (AQI) user fee for all traffic entering the U.S. from Canada; and\n- \u00b7 gamma ray screening  of  cargo  entering  the  U.S.  from  Canada,  and  potential  security  and  agricultural  inspections  at  the  Canada/U.S. border.\n\nThe Company has worked with the AAR to develop and put in place an extensive industry-wide security plan to address terrorism and securitydriven efforts by state and local governments seeking to restrict the routings of certain hazardous materials. If such state and local routing restrictions  were  to  go  into  force,  they  would  be  likely  to  add  to  security  concerns  by  foreclosing  the  Company's  most  optimal  and  secure transportation routes, leading to increased yard handling, longer hauls, and the transfer of traffic to lines less suitable for moving hazardous materials, while also infringing upon the exclusive and uniform federal oversight over railroad security matters.\n\nWhile the Company will continue to work closely with the CBSA, CBP, and other Canadian and U.S. agencies, as described above, no assurance can  be  given  that  these  and  future  decisions  by  the  U.S.,  Canadian,  provincial,  state,  or  local  governments  on  homeland  security  matters, legislation on security matters enacted by the U.S. Congress or Parliament, or joint decisions by the industry in response to threats to the North American rail network, will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, or its competitive and financial position.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Transportation of hazardous materials\n\nAs a result of its common carrier obligations, the Company is legally required to transport dangerous goods and hazardous materials, including toxic inhalation hazard materials regardless of risk or potential exposure or loss. A train accident involving the transport of these commodities could  result  in  significant  costs  and  claims  for  personal  injury,  property  damage,  environmental  penalties  and  remediation  in  excess  of insurance coverage for these risks, which may materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, or its competitive and financial position.\n\nNo  assurance  can  be  given  that  these  and  any  other  current  or  future  regulatory  or  legislative  initiatives  by  the  Canadian  or  U.S.  federal government and agencies will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its competitive and financial position.\n\n## Pandemic risk\n\nSevere disruptions in regional economies and the world economy can be caused by the outbreak of a contagious illness, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such pandemics and efforts to contain them could result  in  international,  national  and  local  border  closings,  travel  restrictions, significant  disruptions  to  business  operations,  supply  chains,  customer  activity  and  demand,  service  cancellations,  reductions  and  other changes, significant challenges in healthcare service preparation and delivery, and quarantines, as well as considerable general concern and uncertainty, all of which could negatively affect the economic environment and may in the future have further impacts, as was the case for the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not possible to predict what measures and restrictions may be imposed by governmental authorities and the period of time during which those measures and restrictions may apply. Economic and supply chain disruptions, including temporary staff shortages resulting from a pandemic, could further materially affect the Company's financial results and operations. A pandemic could also further and significantly impact freight demand and commodity prices in connection with ensuing economic disruption, supply shortages, trade disruption, temporary staff shortages and temporary closures of facilities in geographic locations more importantly impacted by the outbreak. The scope and severity of such disruptions and their impact on the Company's financial results and operations could be material.\n\n## Pension funding volatility\n\nThe Company's funding requirements for its defined benefit pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations. See the section of this MD&A  entitled Critical  accounting  estimates  -  Pensions  and  other  postretirement  benefits for  information  relating  to  the  funding  of  the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Adverse changes with respect to pension plan returns and the level of interest  rates  as  well  as changes  to  existing  federal  pension  legislation  and  regulation  may  significantly  impact  future  pension  contributions  and  have  a  material adverse effect on the funding status of the plans and the Company's results of operations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company's pension expense and funding of its defined benefit pension plans will not increase in the future and thereby negatively impact earnings and/or cash flow.\n\n## Reliance on technology and related cybersecurity risk\n\nThe Company relies on information technology operated by it or under the control of third parties in all aspects of its business. The Company's and its key third-party vendors' information technology systems are critical to its ability to safely and effectively meet customer expectations, track, maintain, and operate trains and related vehicles, manage employees, and interface with customers, suppliers, vendors, and other third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe  Company  and  its  third-party  vendors  and  service  providers  have  been  subject  to,  and  are  likely  to  continue  to  be  the  target  of,  data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, human error, fraud, or  other  modes  of  attack  or  disruption.  Security  threats  continue  to  grow,  are  increasing  in  frequency,  levels  of  persistence,  intensity  and sophistication, and can come from nation states, organized criminals, hacktivists and others. The Company and its third-party vendors and service providers are at heightened risk due to the Company's position as a critical component of both the Canadian and U.S. infrastructure and may  be  impacted  by  cyber-attacks  or  security  incidents,  whether  accidental  or  malicious.  While  the  Company  has  security  and  mitigation programs, including business continuity and disaster recovery plans, in place to protect its operations, as well as information and technology assets, a cyber-attack, significant disruption or failure of its information technology and communications systems or those of its third-party vendors or service providers,  including  system  failure,  security  breach,  disruption  by  malware  or  other  damage  could  interrupt  or  delay  the Company's operations, result in service interruptions,  safety  failures,  security  violations,  regulatory  compliance  failures  or  other  operational difficulties,  damage  its  reputation,  cause  a  loss  of  customers,  vendors,  suppliers,  agents,  or  third-party  capacity  providers  and  lead  to misappropriation of assets, misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, and unauthorized system and data access or disclosures.  The  Company  may  experience  security  breaches  that  could  remain  undetected  for  an  extended  period  and,  therefore,  have  a greater impact on the services provided. A cyber incident or interruption of information technology systems, even for short periods of time, could expose the Company to a risk of loss, litigation, regulatory oversight, enforcement actions, damage to its reputation or cause it to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its operational and financial position.\n\nCybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and Canada, which adds compliance complexity  and  may  increase  the  Company's  costs  of  compliance  and  expose  it  to  reputational  damage  or  litigation,  monetary  damages, regulatory  enforcement  actions,  or  fines.  The  Company  has  invested  and  continues  to  invest  in  technology  security  initiatives,  information technology risk management, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and other security and mitigation programs to meet evolving network and cybersecurity expectations and regulations. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more frequent, intense, and sophisticated. Despite the Company's efforts, however, it remains subject to the risk of cyber-attacks that could have a material adverse impact on its operational and financial position.\n\nIn addition, if the Company is unable to acquire or implement new technology, the Company may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could also have an adverse effect on its operational and financial position.\n\n## Trade restrictions\n\nGlobal as well as North American trade conditions, including trade barriers on certain commodities, may interfere with the free circulation of goods across Canada and the U.S. or the cost associated therewith.\n\nThere  can  be  no  assurance  that  trade  actions  will  not  materially  adversely  affect  the  volume  of  rail  shipments  and/or  revenues  from commodities carried by the Company, and thus materially and negatively impact earnings and/or cash flow.\n\n## Terrorism and international conflicts\n\nPotential  terrorist  actions  can  have  a  direct  or  indirect  impact  on  the  transportation  infrastructure,  including  railway  infrastructure  in  North America,  and  can  interfere  with  the  free  flow  of  goods.  Rail  lines,  facilities  and  equipment  could  be  directly  targeted  or  become  indirect casualties, which could interfere with the free flow of goods. International conflicts, including war, can also have an impact on the Company's markets.  Government  response  to  such  events  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  operations.  Insurance  premiums  could  also  increase significantly or coverage could become unavailable.\n\n## Customer credit risk\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company monitors the financial condition and credit limits of its customers and reviews the credit history of each new customer. Although the Company believes there are no significant concentrations of credit risk, economic conditions can affect the Company's customers and can result in an increase to the Company's credit risk and exposure to the business failures of its customers. A widespread deterioration of customer credit and/or business failures of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Liquidity\n\nDisruptions in financial markets or deterioration of the Company's credit ratings could hinder the Company's access to external sources of funding to meet its liquidity needs. There can be no assurance that changes in the financial markets will not have a negative effect on the Company's liquidity and its access to capital at acceptable terms and rates.\n\n## Supplier concentration\n\nThe Company operates in a capital-intensive industry where the complexity of rail equipment (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail  and  ties)  limits  the  number  of  suppliers  available.  The  Company  also  competes  with  other  industries  for  available  capacity  and  raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain rail and rolling stock equipment. The supply market could be disrupted if changes in the economy caused any of the Company's suppliers to cease production or to experience capacity or supply shortages. The supply market could become further concentrated and could result in changes to the product or service offerings by suppliers. This could also result in cost increases to the Company and difficulty in obtaining and maintaining the Company's rail equipment and materials. Since the Company also has foreign  suppliers,  international  relations,  trade  restrictions  and  global  economic  and  other  conditions  may  potentially  interfere  with  the Company's ability to procure necessary equipment and materials. Widespread business failures of, or restrictions on suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial position.\n\n## Availability of qualified personnel\n\nThe Company may experience demographic challenges in the employment levels of its workforce. Changes in employee demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly locomotive engineers and conductors and information technologists, could negatively impact the Company's ability to meet demand for rail service. The Company monitors employment levels and seeks to ensure that there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  personnel  to  meet  rail  service  requirements.  However,  the  Company's  efforts  to  attract  and  retain  qualified personnel may be hindered by specific conditions in the job market. No assurance can be given that demographic or other challenges will not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or its financial position.\n\n## Fuel costs and supply disruptions\n\nThe Company is susceptible to the volatility of fuel prices due to changes in the economy or supply disruptions. Rapid fluctuations in fuel prices or fuel supply disruptions can occur due to refinery disruptions, production quota restrictions, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, climate, international politics, labor and political instability, as well as war. Increases in fuel prices or supply disruptions may materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and other currencies (including the US dollar) make the goods transported by the Company more or less competitive in the world marketplace and thereby may adversely affect the Company's revenues and expenses.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk relating to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability  in  interest  expense.  Adverse  changes  to  market  interest  rates  may  significantly  impact  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  the Company's financial instruments. There can be no assurance that changes in the market interest rates will not have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations or liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Transportation network disruptions\n\nDue to the integrated nature of the North American freight transportation infrastructure, the Company's operations may be negatively affected by service disruptions of its own network, including illegal blockades, as well as of other transportation links such as ports and other railroads which interchange with the Company. A significant prolonged service disruption of CN's network or one or more of these entities could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Furthermore, deterioration in the cooperative relationships with the Company's connecting carriers could directly affect the Company's operations.\n\n## Severe weather\n\nThe Company's success is dependent on its ability to operate its railroad efficiently. Severe weather and natural disasters, such as extreme cold or  heat,  flooding,  droughts,  fires,  hurricanes,  landslides  and  earthquakes,  can  disrupt  operations  and  service  for  the  railroad,  affect  the performance of locomotives and rolling stock, disrupt operations for both the Company and its customers as well as damage the Company's infrastructure or properties. Changes in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of  certain  adverse  weather  conditions.  Business  interruptions  resulting  from  severe  weather  could  result  in  increased  costs,  including modifications  to  existing  infrastructure  or  implementation  of  new  infrastructure  to  prevent  or  reduce  severity  of  future  impacts  to  the Company's business, and increased liabilities and lower revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. If any natural occurrence leads to catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption in operations.\n\nInsurance  maintained  by  the  Company  to  protect  against  loss  of  business  and  other  related  consequences  resulting  from  these  natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Market changes\n\nThe Company's business is based on transporting a wide variety of commodities from suppliers to the marketplace. The Company regularly transports  energy  commodities  that  serve  refineries,  processing  locations,  and  end-users  across  North  America  and  global  markets.  The Company's business lines include thermal and metallurgical coal, crude oil and petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas, fuel oil, asphalt, gasoline, condensate (diluent), and lubricant oils. Shifting consumer demand to lower-carbon products and increased climate-focused regulations, such as carbon pricing and fuel regulations, may bring about a broad transition in the energy sector. Programs that place a price on carbon emissions or other government restrictions on certain market sectors may further impact current and potential freight rail customers in the energy sector. A comprehensive transition in the energy sector could significantly impact the markets of the Company's energy customers or lead to market differentiation through geographic variation in policies and demand trends. A portion of the Company's business could be materially affected by potential future changes and instability of such a transition. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of the Company's customers and the markets for certain of the commodities it carries in a manner that could alter our traffic patterns. Climate change could affect the markets for, or the volume of, the goods the Company carries or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial positions or liquidity.\n\n## Government actions\n\nGovernment action or inaction to address climate change could also affect CN. The Company is currently subject to climate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations that have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, at the federal, provincial and state levels. While CN is continually focused on efficiency improvements and reducing its carbon footprint, cap and trade systems, carbon taxes, or other controls on  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  imposed  by  various  government  bodies  could  increase  the  Company's  capital  and  operating  costs.  An escalating  price  on  carbon  emissions  could  materially  increase  direct  costs  related  to  fuel  purchases  and  indirect  expenses  related  to purchased goods, materials, and electricity required to operate our business. The Company may not be able to offset such impacts through, for example, higher freight rates. Climate change legislation and regulation could also affect CN's customers; make it difficult for CN's customers to produce products in a cost-competitive manner due to increased energy costs; and increase legal costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change.\n\n|",

Failure  to  maintain quality,  ethical  and  socially  responsible  operations  across  the  Company's  supply  chain  could  materially  adversely  affect  its  brand  and reputation. Public concerns about the environmental impact of the Company's operations could also negatively impact consumers' perceptions of the Company's brand and reputation.

Also,  the  pervasiveness  and  viral  nature  of  social  media  could  exacerbate  any  negative  publicity  with  respect  to  the Company's business practices.\n\nMoreover, increasing governmental and public awareness and concern about ESG matters, notably climate change, sustainability, diversity and Indigenous relations, could result in enhanced legal requirements or public expectations, in each case, that aim or require to expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that  the  Company  is  required  to  control,  assess,  comply  with  or  report. The  Company's  inability  to  meet evolving requirements and/or expectations could materially adversely affect the Company's brand and reputation, which could in turn materially adversely  affect  the  Company's  results  of  operations  or  its  financial  position.  The  Company's  access  to  capital  could  also  be  negatively affected if financial institutions, rating agencies and/or lenders adopt more restrictive ESG policies that the Company may not be able to meet.\n\nAdditionally, CN has set a number of specific climate targets, which are subject to ongoing disclosure by the Company. Achieving these targets is  subject  to  several  risks  and  uncertainties,  and  there  can  be  no  certainty  that  the  Company  will  achieve  these  targets  within  the  stated timeframe, or that achieving any of these targets will meet all of the expectations of its stakeholders or applicable legal requirements. Risks associated with achieving the Company's climate targets include but are not limited to future investments in and the availability of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reduction tools and technologies, significant changes in the Company's GHG emissions profile as a result of changes to its railway asset base, the Company's ability to work with governments and third parties to mitigate the impacts of climate change, domestic and  international  economic  conditions,  including  exchange  rates,  the  effects  of  competition  and  regulation,  uncertainties  in  the  financial markets, capital spending, actions of vendors, the willingness of customers to acquire our services, cost of network expansion, maintenance and retrofits, and physical impact of climate change on our business. Also, the implementation of these objectives may expose it to certain additional heightened financial and operational risks, and is expected to require additional costs, which may be higher than anticipated. If the Company is unable to achieve its climate targets or satisfy the expectations of its stakeholders, its brand and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of December 31, 2023, have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\nDuring  the  fourth  quarter  ended  December  31,  2023,  there  were  no  changes  in  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  (as defined in Exchange Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and 15d-15(f)) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange  Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and  15d-15(f))  using  the  criteria  set  forth  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company's internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2023,  and  issued  Management's  Report  on  Internal  Control  over Financial Reporting dated January 31, 2024 to that effect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Company's internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2023,  based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  -  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated January 31, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to  error  or  fraud,  and  performing  procedures  that  respond  to  those  risks.  Such  procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical audit matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Evaluation of income taxes\n\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the deferred income tax assets were $682 million and the deferred income tax liabilities were $10,066 million as of December 31, 2023, and income tax expense was $863 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company operates in different tax jurisdictions which requires the Company to make significant judgments and estimates in relation to its tax positions.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the deferred income tax assets, the deferred income tax liabilities, and income tax expense as a critical audit matter  due  to  the  magnitude  of  these  tax  balances  and  complexities  in  the  evaluation  of  the  application  of  the  relevant  tax  regulations applicable to the Company. A high degree of auditor judgment was required in assessing certain of the Company's tax positions and balances.\n\n\u00a9 2023 KPMG LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's reconciliation and analysis of its deferred income tax balances. We involved income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in: (1) assessing the Company's interpretation of the relevant tax regulations; (2) evaluating the reasonability of the Company's tax positions; and (3) analyzing the Company's deferred income tax balances by comparing prior year tax estimates to actual tax returns filed, and evaluating the Company's reconciliation of the deferred income tax balances to the underlying temporary differences.\n\n## Evaluation of capitalization of costs relating to track and railway infrastructure\n\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, capital additions, net of finance leases, were $3,187 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $1,529 million related to track and railway infrastructure maintenance, including the replacement of rail, ties, bridge improvements, and other general track maintenance. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, expenditures related to self-constructed properties include direct material, labor, and contracted services, as well as other allocated costs.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of capitalization of costs relating to track and railway infrastructure as a critical audit matter. The magnitude and complexities in self-constructed properties, as well as the judgments involved in determining whether the expenditure met the Company's predetermined capitalization criteria required subjective auditor judgment.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's capital additions process, including controls related to the monitoring of budget versus actual costs on capital projects and the Company's assessment that the expenditures charged to projects meet the Company's pre-determined capitalization  criteria.  For  a  sample  of  capital  expenditure  additions,  we  examined  underlying  documentation  and  assessed whether the expenditure met the Company's pre-determined capitalization criteria. The testing was performed at a disaggregated level by type of cost (including direct material, labor, and contracted services), and for rail, included comparisons to prior period per unit measures by region. In  addition,  we  examined  the  Company's  budget  versus  actual  analysis  on  capital  projects  and  assessed  the  Company's  explanations  of differences exceeding pre-determined testing thresholds.\n\n(s) KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditors since 1992.\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Canada\n\nJanuary\u00a031, 2024\n\n|",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated  balance  sheets  of  the  Company  as  of  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively the \"consolidated financial statements'), and our report dated January 31, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n(s) KPMG LLP\n\nMontr\u00e9al, Canada January\u00a031, 2024\n\n\u00a9 2023 KPMG LLP, an Ontario limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nCanadian National Railway Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively \"CN\" or the \"Company\", is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. CN spans Canada and the United States of America (U.S.), connecting Canada's Eastern and Western coasts with the U.S. South. CN's freight revenues are derived from the movement of a diversified and balanced portfolio of goods, including petroleum and chemicals, grain and fertilizers, coal, metals and minerals, forest products, intermodal and automotive.\n\n## 1 - Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThese  consolidated  financial  statements  are  expressed  in  Canadian  dollars,  except  where  otherwise  indicated,  and  have  been  prepared  in accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP)  as  codified  in  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the Employee Benefit Plan Trusts (\"Share Trusts\") as the Company has the direct ability to make decisions regarding the Share Trusts' principal activities. The Company's investments in which it has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method and all other investments for which fair value is not readily determinable are accounted for at cost minus impairment, plus or minus observable price changes.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates, including those related to goodwill, intangible assets, identified assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, income taxes, depreciation, pensions and other postretirement benefits, personal injury and other claims, and environmental matters, based upon available information. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Nature of services\n\nThe Company's revenues consist of freight revenues and other revenues. Freight revenues include revenue from the movement of freight over rail and are derived from the following seven commodity groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Petroleum and chemicals, which includes chemicals and plastics, refined petroleum products, crude and condensate, and sulfur;\n- \u00b7 Metals and minerals, which includes energy materials, metals, minerals, and iron ore;\n- \u00b7 Forest products, which includes lumber, pulp, paper, and panels;\n- \u00b7 Coal, which includes coal and petroleum coke;\n- \u00b7 Grain and fertilizers, which includes Canadian regulated grain, Canadian commercial grain, U.S. grain, potash and other fertilizers;\n- \u00b7 Intermodal, which includes rail and trucking services for domestic and international traffic; and\n- \u00b7 Automotive, which includes finished vehicles and auto parts.\n\nFreight revenues also comprise revenues for optional services beyond the basic movement of freight including asset use, switching, storage, and other services.\n\nOther revenues are derived from non-rail logistics services that support the Company's rail business including vessels and docks, transloading and distribution, automotive logistics, and freight forwarding and transportation management.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenues  are  recognized  when  control  of  promised  services  is  transferred  to  customers  in  an  amount  that  reflects  the  consideration  the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those services.\n\nThe Company accounts for contracts with customers when it has approval and commitment from both parties, each party's rights have been identified, payment terms are defined, the contract has commercial substance and collection is probable. For contracts that involve multiple performance  obligations,  the  Company  allocates  the  transaction  price  to  each  performance  obligation  in  the  contract  based  on  relative standalone selling prices and recognizes revenue when, or as, performance obligations in the contract are satisfied.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nRevenues are presented net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Freight revenues\n\nFreight services are arranged through publicly-available tariffs or customer-specific agreements that establish the pricing, terms and conditions for freight services offered by the Company. For revenue recognition purposes, a contract for the movement of freight over rail exists when shipping  instructions  are  sent  by  a  customer  and  have  been  accepted  by  the  Company  in  connection  with  the  relevant  tariff  or  customerspecific agreement.\n\nRevenues for the movement of freight over rail are recognized over time due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer as freight moves from origin to destination. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation is measured based on the transit time of freight from  origin  to  destination.  The  allocation  of  revenues  between  periods  is  based  on  the  relative  transit  time  in  each  period  with  expenses recorded as incurred. Revenues related to freight contracts that require the involvement of another rail carrier to move freight from origin to destination are reported on a net basis. Freight movements are completed over a short period of time and are generally completed before payment is due. Freight receivables are included in Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company has no material contract assets associated with freight revenues.\n\nContract  liabilities  represent  consideration  received  from  customers  for  which  the  related  performance  obligation  has  not  been  satisfied. Contract liabilities are recognized into revenues when or as the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Company includes contract liabilities within Accounts payable and other and Other liabilities and deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nRevenues for optional services are recognized at a point in time or over time as performance obligations are satisfied, depending on the nature of the service.\n\nFreight contracts may be subject to variable consideration in the form of volume-based incentives, rebates, or other items, which affect the transaction price. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Variable consideration is accrued on the basis of management's best estimate of the expected amount, which is based on available historical, current and forecasted information.\n\n## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues are recognized at a point in time or over time as performance obligations are satisfied, depending on the nature of the service.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability is included in the computation of Net income or Other comprehensive income (loss). Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding during the period. The weighted-average number of basic shares outstanding excludes shares held in the Share Trusts and includes vested equity settled stock-based compensation awards other than stock options. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding during the period, applying the treasury stock method. The weighted-average number of diluted shares outstanding includes the dilutive effects of common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and nonvested equity settled awards.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nAll  of  the  Company's  foreign  subsidiaries  use  the  US  dollar  as  their  functional  currency.  Accordingly,  the  foreign  subsidiaries'  assets  and liabilities  are  translated  into  Canadian  dollars  at  the  exchange  rate  in  effect  at  the  balance  sheet  date  and  the  revenues  and  expenses  are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. All adjustments resulting from the translation of the foreign operations are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe Company designates the US dollar-denominated debt of the parent company as a foreign currency hedge of its net investment in foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign exchange gains and losses, from the dates of designation, on the translation of the US dollar-denominated debt are included in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Restricted cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company has the option, under its bilateral letter of credit facility agreements with various banks, to pledge collateral in the form of cash and cash equivalents for a minimum term of one month, equal to at least the face value of the letters of credit issued. Restricted cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\nAccounts receivable are recorded at cost net of billing adjustments and an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect  the  collectibility  of  the  reported  amount.  When  a  receivable  is  deemed  uncollectible,  it  is  written  off  against  the  allowance  for  credit losses.  Subsequent  recoveries  of  amounts  previously  written  off  are  credited  to  bad  debt  expense  in  Other  expense  in  the  Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Material and supplies\n\nMaterial and supplies, which consist mainly of rail, ties, and other items for construction and maintenance of property and equipment, as well as diesel fuel, are measured at weighted-average cost.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nAssets  that  are  classified  as  held  for  sale  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  their  carrying  amount  or  fair  value  less  expected  selling  costs ('estimated selling price') with a loss recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated selling price. The classification is applicable at the date upon which the sale of assets is probable, and the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition. The  transfer  of  the  assets  must  also  be  expected  to  qualify  for  recognition  as  a  completed  sale  within  the  year  following  the  date  of classification.\n\nAssets once classified as held for sale, are not subject to depreciation or amortization and both the assets and any liabilities directly associated with the assets held for sale are classified as current in the Balance Sheets.\n\nSubsequent changes to the estimated selling price of assets held for sale are recorded as recoveries or losses to the Consolidated Statements of Income wherein the recognition of subsequent gains is limited to the cumulative loss previously recognized.\n\n## Properties\n\n## Capitalization of costs\n\nThe Company's railroad operations are highly capital intensive.  The  Company's properties  mainly  consist  of  homogeneous  or  network-type assets  such  as  rail,  ties,  ballast  and  other  structures,  which  form  the  Company's  Track  and  roadway  properties,  and  Rolling  stock.  The Company's capital expenditures are for the replacement of existing assets and for the purchase or construction of new assets to enhance operations  or  provide  new  service  offerings  to  customers.  A  large  portion  of  the  Company's  capital  expenditures  are  for  self-constructed properties,  including  the  replacement  of  existing  track  and  roadway  assets  and  track  line  expansion,  as  well  as  major  overhauls  and  large refurbishments of rolling stock.\n\nExpenditures  are  capitalized  if  they  extend  the  life  of  the  asset  or  provide  future  benefits  such  as  increased  revenue-generating  capacity, functionality  or  service  capacity.  The  Company  has  a  process  in  place  to  determine  whether  or  not  costs  qualify  for  capitalization,  which requires  judgment.  For  Track  and  roadway  properties,  the  Company  establishes  basic  capital  programs  to  replace  or  upgrade  the  track infrastructure assets which are capitalized if they meet the capitalization criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn  addition,  for  Track  and  roadway  properties,  expenditures  that  meet  the  minimum  level  of  activity  as  defined  by  the  Company  are  also capitalized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 grading : installation of road bed, retaining walls, and drainage structures;\n- \u00b7 rail and related track material : installation of 39 or more continuous feet of rail;\n- \u00b7 ties : installation of five or more ties per 39 feet; and\n- \u00b7 ballast : installation of 171 cubic yards of ballast per mile.\n\nFor  purchased  assets,  the  Company  capitalizes  all  costs  necessary  to  make  the  assets  ready  for  their  intended  use.  For  self-constructed properties, expenditures include direct material, labor, and contracted services, as well as other allocated costs. These allocated costs include, but are not limited to, project supervision, fringe benefits, maintenance on equipment used on projects as well as the cost of small tools and supplies. The Company reviews and adjusts its allocations, as required, to reflect the actual costs incurred each year.\n\nFor the rail asset, the Company capitalizes the costs of rail grinding which consists of restoring and improving the rail profile and removing irregularities from worn rail to extend the service life. The service life of the rail asset is increased incrementally as rail grinding is performed thereon, and as such, the costs incurred are capitalized given that the activity extends the service life of the rail asset beyond its original or current condition as additional gross tons can be carried over the rail for its remaining service life.\n\nFor the ballast asset, the Company engages in shoulder ballast undercutting that consists of removing some or all of the ballast, which has deteriorated over its service life, and replacing it with new ballast. When ballast is installed as part of a shoulder ballast undercutting project, it represents the addition of a new asset and not the repair or maintenance of an existing asset. As such, the Company capitalizes expenditures related  to  shoulder  ballast  undercutting  given  that  an  existing  asset  is  retired  and  replaced  with  a  new  asset.  Under  the  group  method  of accounting for properties, the deteriorated ballast is retired at its historical cost.\n\nCosts of deconstruction and removal of replaced assets, referred to herein as dismantling costs, are distinguished from installation costs for self-constructed  properties  based  on  the  nature  of  the  related  activity.  For  Track  and  roadway  properties,  employees  concurrently  perform dismantling and installation of new track and roadway assets and, as such, the Company estimates the amount of labor and other costs that are related to dismantling. The Company determines dismantling costs based on an analysis of the track and roadway installation process.\n\nExpenditures relating to the Company's properties that do not meet the Company's capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred. For Track and roadway properties, such expenditures include but are not limited to spot tie replacement, spot or broken rail replacement, physical track inspection for detection of rail defects and minor track corrections, and other general maintenance of track infrastructure.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation including asset impairment write-downs. The cost of properties, including those under finance leases, net of asset impairment write-downs, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, measured in years,  except  for  rail  and  ballast  whose  service  lives  are  measured  in  millions  of  gross  tons.  The  Company  follows  the  group  method  of depreciation  whereby  a  single  composite  depreciation  rate  is  applied  to  the  gross  investment  in  a  class  of  similar  assets,  despite  small differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same asset class. The Company uses approximately 40 different depreciable asset classes.\n\nFor all depreciable asset classes, the depreciation rate is based on the estimated service lives of the assets. Assessing the reasonableness of the  estimated  service  lives  of  properties  requires  judgment  and  is  based  on  currently  available  information,  including  periodic  depreciation studies  conducted  by  the  Company.  The  Company's  U.S.  properties  are  subject  to  comprehensive  depreciation  studies  as  required  by  the Surface Transportation Board (STB) and are conducted by external experts. Depreciation studies for Canadian properties are not required by regulation and are conducted internally. Studies are performed on specific asset groups on a periodic basis. Changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related composite depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\n\nThe  service  life  of  the  rail  asset  is  based  on  expected  future  usage  of  the  rail  in  its  existing  condition,  determined  using  railroad  industry research and testing (based on rail characteristics such as weight, curvature and metallurgy), factoring in the rail asset's usage to date. The annual composite depreciation rate for the rail asset is determined by dividing the estimated annual number of gross tons carried over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in millions of gross tons. The Company amortizes the cost of rail grinding over the remaining life of the rail asset, which includes the incremental life extension generated by rail grinding.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nGiven the nature of the railroad and the composition of its network which is made up of homogeneous long-lived assets, it is impractical to maintain records of specific properties at their lowest unit of property.\n\nRetirements of assets occur through the replacement of an asset in the normal course of business, the sale of an asset or the abandonment of a section of track. For retirements in the normal course of business, generally the life of the retired asset is within a reasonable range of the expected useful life, as determined in the depreciation studies, and, as such, no gain or loss is recognized under the group method. The asset's cost  is  removed  from  the  asset  account  and  the  difference  between  its  estimated  historical  cost  and  estimated  related  accumulated depreciation (net of salvage proceeds and dismantling costs), if any, is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized. The estimated historical cost of the retired asset is estimated by using deflation factors or indices that closely correlate to the properties comprising the asset classes in combination with the estimated age of the retired asset using a first-in, first-out approach, and applying it to the replacement value of the asset.\n\nIn each depreciation study, an estimate is made of any excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation for all corresponding asset classes to ensure that the depreciation rates remain appropriate. The excess or deficiency in accumulated depreciation is amortized over the remaining life of the asset class.\n\nFor retirements of depreciable properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, the historical cost, net of salvage proceeds, is recorded as a gain or loss in income. A retirement is considered not to be in the normal course of business if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it is significant in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement pattern identified through depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in Other income for the sale of land or disposal of assets that are not part of railroad operations.\n\n## Government assistance\n\nBy  analogy  to  the  grant  model  of  accounting  within  International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS)  20,  Accounting  for  Government  Grants  and Disclosure of Government Assistance, the Company records government assistance from various levels of Canadian and U.S. governments and government agencies when the conditions of their receipt are complied with and there is reasonable assurance that the assistance will be received.\n\nThe Company receives government assistance typically in the form of cash primarily for the purpose of track infrastructure assets and public safety improvements to track and roadway properties. The government assistance related to properties has conditions of how the assistance is to be spent; such as the Company purchasing or self-constructing assets to improve CN assets and under limited transactions would require the Company to reimburse the assistance if certain conditions are not adhered to. The period for which the assistance is received coincides with the timing to complete the purchase or self-construction.\n\nThe Company accounts for government assistance received or receivable related to CN's property assets as a reduction from the cost of the assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Properties and depreciated over the same service life of the related assets in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Company engages in short and long-term leases for rolling stock including locomotives and freight cars, equipment, real estate and service contracts that contain embedded leases. The Company determines whether or not a contract contains a lease at inception. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded by the Company on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFinance and operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease  term  at  the  commencement  date.  Where  the  implicit  interest  rate  is  not  determinable  from  the  lease,  the  Company  uses  internal incremental borrowing rates by tenor and currency to initially measure leases in excess of twelve months on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe  Company's  lease  contracts  may  contain  termination,  renewal,  and/or  purchase  options,  residual  value  guarantees,  or  a  combination thereof, all of which are evaluated by the Company on a quarterly basis. The majority of renewal options available extend the lease term from one to five years. The Company accounts for such contract options when the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise one of these options.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLease contracts may contain lease and non-lease components that the Company generally accounts for separately, with the exception of the freight car asset category for which the Company has elected to not separate the lease and non-lease components.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  consist  mainly  of  customer  contracts  and  relationships  acquired  through  business  acquisitions.  Intangible  assets  are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, ranging from 20 to 50 years. If a change in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is determined, amortization is adjusted prospectively.\n\nWith  respect  to  impairment,  the  Company  tests  the  recoverability  of  its  intangible  assets  held  and  used  whenever  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, based on future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  goodwill  as  the  excess  of  the  purchase  price  over  the  fair  value  of  identifiable  net  assets  acquired  in  business combinations. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is assessed for impairment annually as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount.\n\nWith respect to impairment, the Company may first assess certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, or proceed directly to a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors include but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and events such as changes in management or customers. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test must be performed. The quantitative impairment test  is  performed  by  comparing  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  with  its  carrying  amount,  including  goodwill,  and  an  impairment  loss  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, up to the value of goodwill. The Company defines  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  as  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  the  reporting  unit  as  a  whole  in  an  orderly  transaction between market participants as of the impairment date. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Company uses the discounted cash flow method using the pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or group of assets.\n\n## Accounts receivable securitization\n\nBased  on  the  structure  of  its  accounts  receivable  securitization  program,  the  Company  accounts  for  the  proceeds  received  as  secured borrowings.\n\n## Pensions\n\nPension costs are determined using actuarial methods. Net periodic benefit cost (income) includes the current service cost of pension benefits provided  in  exchange  for  employee  service  rendered  during  the  year,  which  is  recorded  in  Labor  and  fringe  benefits  expense.  Net  periodic benefit cost (income) also includes the following, which are recorded in Other components of net periodic benefit income (cost):\n\n- \u00b7 the interest cost of pension obligations;\n- \u00b7 the expected long-term return on pension fund assets;\n- \u00b7 the amortization of prior service costs and amendments over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans;\n- \u00b7 the Company uses a market related value to calculate net periodic benefit cost (income) (see Note 2 -Change in accounting policy for additional information) and\n- \u00b7 the amortization of cumulative net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the beginning of year balances of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets, over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plans.\n\nThe pension plans are funded through contributions determined in accordance with the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Postretirement benefits other than pensions\n\nThe Company accrues the cost of postretirement benefits other than pensions using actuarial methods. These benefits, which are funded as they become due, include life insurance programs, medical benefits and, for a closed group of employees, free rail travel benefits.\n\nThe Company amortizes the cumulative net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year, over the expected average remaining service life of the employee group covered by the plan.\n\n## Additional paid-in capital\n\nAdditional paid-in capital includes the stock-based compensation expense on equity settled awards and other items relating to equity settled awards. Upon the exercise of stock options, the stock-based compensation expense related to those awards is reclassified from Additional paid-in capital to Common shares. Upon settlement of all other equity settled awards, the Company reclassifies from Additional paid-in capital to  Retained  Earnings  the  stock-based  compensation  expense  and  other  items  related  to  equity  settled  awards,  up  to  the  amount  of  the settlement cost. The excess, if any, of the settlement cost over the stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Retained Earnings.\n\n## Stock-based compensation\n\nFor equity settled awards, stock-based compensation costs are accrued over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date. The grant date fair value of performance share unit (PSU) awards is dependent on the type of PSU award. The grant date fair value of PSU-ROIC awards is determined using a lattice-based model incorporating a minimum share price condition and the grant date fair value of PSU-TSR awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The grant date fair value of restricted share unit (RSU) awards and of equity settled deferred share unit (DSU) awards is determined using the stock price at the grant date. The grant date fair value of stock option  awards  is  determined  using  the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model.  For  cash  settled  awards,  stock-based  compensation  costs  are accrued over the requisite service period based on the fair value determined at each period-end. The fair value of cash settled DSU awards is determined using their intrinsic value.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims\n\nIn Canada, the Company accounts for costs related to employee work-related injuries based on actuarially developed estimates on a discounted basis of the ultimate cost associated with such injuries, including compensation, health care and third-party administration costs. In the U.S., the Company accrues the expected cost for personal injury, property damage and occupational disease claims, based on actuarial estimates of their ultimate cost on an undiscounted basis. For all other legal actions in Canada and the U.S., the Company maintains, and regularly updates on  a  case-by-case  basis,  provisions  for  such  items  when  the  expected  loss  is  both  probable  and  can  be  reasonably  estimated  based  on currently available information.\n\n## Environmental expenditures\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations, or to an existing condition caused by past operations, are expensed as incurred. Environmental  expenditures  that  provide  a  future  benefit  are  capitalized.  Environmental  liabilities  are  recorded  when  environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the Company's alleged responsibility, the number of potentially responsible parties and their ability to pay their respective shares of the liability. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments from time to time in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures. Derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated or not qualified as a hedge are recorded in Net income in the current period.\n\n## 2 - Change in accounting policy\n\n## Change in accounting policy for determining net periodic pension cost (income)\n\nEffective  January  1,  2022,  CN  elected  to  change  its  accounting  methodology  for  determining  the  market-related  value  of  assets  for  the Company's defined benefit pension plans. The new accounting method changed the calculation of market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost but had no impact on the annual funded status of the plans. The Company's previous methodology calculated market-related value for pensions whereby realized and unrealized gains/losses and appreciation/depreciation in the value of the investments were recognized over a period of five years. The Company's new methodology applies a corridor approach so that the market-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Specifically, the market-related value will not exceed 110% or be less than 90% of the fair value. This change established a corridor approach whereby the amount causing the market-related value to be outside of the 10% corridor is recognized immediately in the market-related value of assets and will not be subject to the five-year period of recognition. There is no change in the recognition approach for investment income.\n\nCN considers the use of a calculated value with a corridor approach preferable to the previous calculated value approach as it results in a more current reflection of impacts of changes in value of these plan assets in the determination of net periodic benefit cost. The new accounting method to calculate the market-related value for pensions also aligns with the prevailing guidance issued by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) for the preparation of actuarial valuations for funding purposes for all registered Canadian defined benefit pension plans, whereby the Company adopted and applied the updated OSFI guidance starting with the December 31, 2021 funding valuations that were filed during the second quarter of 2022.\n\nThe change in accounting method was applied retrospectively to all periods presented within CN's financial statements. The change did not impact Operating income or Net cash provided by operating activities but did impact the previously reported portion of Other components of net periodic  benefit  cost  (income)  for  defined  benefit  pension  plans  along  with  related  consolidated  income  items  such  as  Net  income  and Earnings per share. Other impacts included related changes to previously reported consolidated Other comprehensive income (loss), Retained earnings, Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and associated line items within the determination of Net cash provided (used) by operating activities. Note 2 - Change in accounting policy to the Company's 2022 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements details the impact of this change on previously reported amounts.\n\n## 3 - Recent accounting pronouncements\n\nThe following recent Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has an effective date after December 31, 2023 and has not been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2023-07 Segment reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to reportable segment disclosures\n\nThe ASU will improve financial disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional and more detailed information regarding reportable segment expenses. The main amendments in the ASU require public entities, including those that  have  a  single  reportable  segment,  to  disclose  on  an  annual  and  interim  basis  the  significant  segment  expenses  provided  to  the  chief operating decision maker (CODM), disclose the title/position of the CODM and how the segment expenses information is used in the decision making process.\n\nThe ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted.\n\nThe adoption of the ASU will have an impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements disclosures. The Company will include the relevant disclosure within the 2024 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and 2025 Interim Financial Statements.\n\n## ASU 2023-09 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to income tax disclosures\n\nThe  ASU  amends  the  rules  on  income  tax  disclosures  by  modifying  or  eliminating  certain  existing  income  tax  disclosure  requirements  in addition to establishing new requirements. The amendments address investor requests for more transparency about income taxes, including jurisdictional information, by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information. The ASU's two primary amendments relate to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid annual disclosures.\n\nReconciling  items  presented  in  the  rate  reconciliation  will  be  in  dollar  amounts  and  percentages,  and  will  be  disaggregated  into  specified categories  with  certain  reconciling  items  further  broken  out  by  nature  and/or  jurisdiction  using  a  5%  threshold  of  domestic  federal  taxes. Income taxes paid will be disaggregated between federal, provincial/territorial, and foreign taxing jurisdictions using a 5% threshold of total income taxes paid net of refunds received.\n\nThe ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The ASU should be applied prospectively. Retrospective application is permitted.\n\n|",

The  required  disclosure changes will be reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements when the ASU is adopted.\n\nThe following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have been adopted by the Company:\n\n## ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2022-06 Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting and related amendments\n\nUSD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) are benchmark interest rates referenced in a variety of agreements. The publication of certain LIBOR and CDOR rates were discontinued in January 2022 and May 2021, respectively. The remaining LIBOR  rates  were  discontinued  on  June  30,  2023  and  the  remaining  CDOR  rates  are  expected  to  be  discontinued  on  June  30,  2024.  The recommended alternative reference rates for LIBOR and CDOR are the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA), respectively.\n\nThe  ASU  provides  optional  expedients  and  exceptions  for  applying  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to  transactions  affected  by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. The ASU was effective starting on March 12, 2020, and is available to be adopted on a prospective basis no later than December 31, 2024, following the amendments of ASU 2022-06.\n\nThe Company was eligible and has elected to use the optional expedient provided by the ASU which allowed the amendment to be accounted for  as  a  non  substantial  modification  of  an  existing  debt.  As  a  result,  the  amendment  did  not  have  a  significant  impact  to  the  Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. See Note 16 - Debt for additional information on reference rate reform with respect to the non-revolving credit facility, revolving credit facilities, equipment loans and accounts receivable securitization program.\n\nOther recently issued ASUs required to be applied on or after December 31, 2023 have been evaluated by the Company and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 4 - Business acquisitions and combinations\n\n## 2023\n\n## Iowa Northern Railway Company\n\nOn December 6, 2023, the Company acquired the shares of the Iowa Northern Railway Company (IANR), a Class III short-line railroad that owns and leases approximately 175 route miles in northeast Iowa that are connected to CN's U.S. rail network. CN paid US$230 million ($312 million), including transaction costs to date. IANR serves upper Midwest agricultural and industrial markets covering many goods, including biofuels and grain.  This  transaction  represents a meaningful opportunity to support the growth of local business by creating single-line service to North American destinations, while preserving access to existing carrier options.\n\nThe shares of IANR were deposited into an independent voting trust while the U.S Surface Transportation Board (STB) considers the Company's application  to  acquire  control  of  IANR.  During  the  trust  period,  IANR  will  continue  to  be  operated  under  its  current  management  and  the Company cannot exercise day-to-day control. As a result, the Company recorded its investment in IANR at its acquisition cost under the equity method of accounting. Subject to final approval by the STB, the Company would obtain control of IANR and would account for the acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nOn the acquisition date of December 6, 2023, immediately prior to the acquisition, there was a basis difference of $236 million between the consideration paid to acquire IANR and the underlying carrying value of the net assets of IANR. The basis difference related to depreciable properties and if any, intangible assets with definite lives will be amortized over the related assets' remaining useful lives. The remainder of the basis difference, relating to land, intangible assets with indefinite lives if any, and equity method goodwill, would not be amortized and would be carried at cost subject to an assessment for impairment. The estimated fair value of IANR's underlying net assets is preliminary based on information available to the Company to date and subject to change over the measurement period, which may be up to twelve months from the acquisition date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

CN paid $78 million in cash, net of cash acquired and including working capital adjustments. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. As a result, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the net assets of CBNS as of November 1, 2023, which were comprised of $101 million in fair value of properties mostly track and roadway assets, partly offset by $18 million in deferred tax liabilities. The remaining net assets were comprised of current assets and liabilities which were individually insignificant and there were no identifiable intangible assets. No goodwill was recognized. The fair value of CBNS's underlying net assets has been estimated on a preliminary basis and may be subject to change as additional information becomes available over the next twelve months. The Company has not provided pro forma information related to prior periods as it was not material.\n\n## 2021\n\n## Terminated CN Kansas City Southern (KCS) merger agreement\n\nOn September 15, 2021, KCS notified  CN  that  it  terminated  the  previously  announced  May  21,  2021  definitive  merger  agreement  (the  'CN Merger Agreement\") under which CN would have acquired KCS.\n\nOn August 31, 2021, the STB rejected the joint motion by CN and KCS to approve a proposed voting trust agreement. On September 15, 2021, KCS and its Board of Directors announced that the revised acquisition proposal of September 12, 2021 from Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP)  constituted  a  \"Company  Superior  Proposal\"  as  defined  in  the  CN  Merger  Agreement.  Consequently,  KCS  entered  into  a  waiver  letter agreement with CN under which KCS agreed to terminate the CN Merger Agreement in order to enter into a merger agreement with CP. As a result,  CN  received  from  KCS  a  merger  termination  fee  of  US$700  million  ($886  million),  recorded  in  Merger  termination  fee  within  the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and reflected in Operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, KCS also refunded Brooklyn US Holdings, Inc. (\"Holdco\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, US$700 million ($886 million) that CN had previously paid as an advance to KCS of US$700 million ($845 million) in connection with KCS's payment of the termination fee to CP under KCS's original merger agreement with CP that was terminated on May 21, 2021. The refund received in the third quarter of 2021 was recorded  in  Transaction-related  costs  within  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  and  reflected  in  Investing  activities  within  the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows. The US$700 million ($845 million) advance was recorded in Advance to KCS and other transaction costs  within  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021  and  was  expensed  to  Transaction-related  costs  within  the Consolidated Statements of Income in the third quarter of 2021. This advance, along with $63 million of transaction-related costs paid in the second quarter of 2021, was reflected in Investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash flows.\n\nThe Company incurred $84 million of transaction-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 recorded in Transaction-related costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income. This included $125 million of transaction-related costs, consisting of a $76 million expense for costs previously capitalized to Advance to KCS and other transaction costs within the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the second quarter of 2021 in accordance with the expected application of equity method accounting and $49 million of additional transaction-related costs incurred in the third quarter of 2021; partially offset by $41 million of income generated as a result of the applicable foreign exchange rates prevailing at the time of payment of the US dollar denominated advance to KCS and receipt of the related refund.\n\nThe  Company  also  paid  $97  million  of  bridge  financing  and  other  fees  which  were  recorded  in  Interest  expense  within  the  Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, after accounting for all direct and incremental expenses as well as income generated from the merger termination fee, CN recorded additional income of $705 million ($616 million after-tax), as a result of its strategic decision to bid for KCS.\n\n|",

The effective tax rate is affected by recurring items in provincial, U.S. federal, state and other foreign jurisdictions, such as tax rates and the proportion of income earned in those jurisdictions. The effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items such as income tax rate enactments, and lower corporate income tax rates on capital dispositions and other transactions that may occur in any given year.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company received a ruling from taxation authorities in a non-U.S. foreign jurisdiction in connection with prior taxation  years.  Consistent  with  the  ruling,  and  effective  as  of  January  1,  2021,  the  Company  has  foregone  favorable  tax  deductions  of  a permanent  nature  on  certain  income  generated  from  intercompany  arrangements.  This  resulted  in  the  Company  generating  tax-deductible goodwill approximating the value of the foregone tax deductions, which is available to be amortized over a period of up to ten years.\n\nAs  a  result,  the  Company  recorded  a  net  deferred  income  tax  recovery  of  $682  million,  comprised  of  a  $767  million  deferred  income  tax recovery  related  to  the  tax-deductible  goodwill  initially  generated  as  of  January  1,  2021,  partly  offset  by  a $85  million  income  tax  expense related to the foregone tax deduction ($31 million for 2023 and $54 million for prior years) which was initially recorded in current taxes and was then reclassified to deferred taxes following the amortization of the tax-deductible goodwill for those years. As a result, the remaining deferred income tax asset as at December 31, 2023 was $682 million, representing the tax impact of unamortized tax-deductible goodwill of $5.8 billion.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\n| In millions                                                   | Year ended December 31,   | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Canadian statutory federal tax rate                           |                           | 15%      | 15%      | 15%      |\n| Income tax expense at the Canadian statutory federal tax rate |                           | $  973   | $  1,014 | $  951   |\n| Income tax expense resulting from:                            |                           |          |          |          |\n| Provincial and foreign income taxes  (1)                      |                           | 633      | 657      | 617      |\n| Tax-deductible goodwill and related impacts  (2)              |                           | (713)    | -        | -        |\n| Non-taxable portion of merger termination fee  (3)            |                           | -        | -        | (116)    |\n| Other  (4)                                                    |                           | (30)     | (26)     | (9)      |\n| Income tax expense                                            |                           | $  863   | $  1,645 | $  1,443 |\n| Net cash payments for income taxes                            |                           | $  1,197 | $  1,288 | $  759   |\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOn an annual basis, the Company assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance for its deferred income tax assets, and if it is deemed more likely  than  not  that  its  deferred  income  tax  assets  will  not  be  realized,  a  valuation  allowance  is  recorded.  The  ultimate  realization  of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, of the necessary character, during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, the available carryback and carryforward periods, and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. As at December 31, 2023, in order to fully realize all of the deferred income tax assets excluding the tax-deductible goodwill, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  $1.8  billion,  and,  based  upon  the  level  of  historical  taxable  income,  projections  of  future  taxable  income  of  the  necessary character  over  the  periods  in  which  the  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  deductible,  and  the  reversal  of  taxable  temporary  differences, management believes, following an assessment of the current economic environment, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the  benefits  of  these  deductible  differences.  Management  believes  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  CN  will  fully  realize  the  benefits  of  the remaining  $5.8  billion  unamortized  tax-deductible  goodwill  because  under  the  current  tax  laws  the  Company  has  the  ability  and  intent  to maintain the necessary intercompany arrangements that will generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character in the nonU.S. foreign jurisdiction, and to fully utilize the tax-deductible goodwill. As at December 31, 2023, the Company has not recognized a deferred income tax asset of $217 million (2022 - $196 million) on the unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss relating to its net investment in U.S. subsidiaries, as the Company does not expect this temporary difference to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Unrecognized tax benefits\n\n| In millions                                                | Year ended December 31,   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year       |                           | $  52  | $  64  | $  92  |\n| Increases for:                                             |                           |        |        |        |\n| Tax positions related to the current year                  |                           | 4      | 3      | 4      |\n| Decrease for:                                              |                           |        |        |        |\n| Tax positions related to prior years                       |                           | (8)    | (10)   | (32)   |\n| Settlements                                                |                           | (2)    | (5)    | -      |\n| Gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of year             |                           | 46     | 52     | 64     |\n| Adjustments to reflect tax treaties and other arrangements |                           | (14)   | (14)   | (17)   |\n| Net unrecognized tax benefits at end of year               | $                         | 32     | $  38  | $  47  |\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  the  total  amount  of  gross  unrecognized  tax  benefits  was  $46  million,  before  considering  tax  treaties  and  other arrangements  between  taxation  authorities.  The  amount  of  net  unrecognized  tax  benefits  as  at  December  31,  2023  was  $32  million.  If recognized, $18 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2023 would affect the effective tax rate.\n\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $13 million of the net unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2023 related to Canadian and U.S. federal, state, and provincial income tax matters, each of which are individually insignificant, may be recognized over the next twelve months as a result of settlements and a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations of which approximately half will affect the effective tax rate as the remaining amount relates to temporary differences.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense in the Statements of Income. The Company recorded a net tax expense of $1 million related to net interest and penalties expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 and net tax recoveries of $12 million and $2 million related to net reversals of interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $14 million (2022 -$13 million).\n\nIn  Canada, the Company's federal and provincial income tax returns filed for the years 2018 to 2022 remain subject to examination by the taxation authorities. An examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the year 2018 and 2019 is currently in progress and is expected to be completed during 2024. In 2020, the tax authorities proposed certain audit adjustments and, as a result, the Company recorded a $25 million deferred tax expense which is comprised of net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expenses. During 2021 and 2022, the tax authorities finalized their audit adjustments related to certain tax positions and as a result, the Company re-evaluated the relevant tax positions for all open years and recorded deferred tax recoveries of $8 million and $13 million, respectively, reducing net unrecognized tax benefits and related interest expenses. In the U.S., the federal income tax returns filed for the years 2020 to 2022 and the state income tax returns  filed  for  the  years  2018  to  2022  remain  subject  to  examination  by  the  taxation  authorities.  The  Company  does  not  anticipate  any significant impacts to its results of operations or financial position as a result of the final resolutions of such matters.\n\n|",

The unsecured credit facility of $2.5 billion is available for general corporate purposes and backstopping the Company's commercial paper programs. The facility consists of two tranches of $1.25 billion and was amended on March 17, 2023 to extend its tenor by one year to March 31, 2026 and March 31, 2028. This revolving credit facility agreement  is  structured  as  a  sustainability  linked  loan  whereby  its  applicable  margins  are  adjusted  up  or  down  based  on  the  Company's performance under certain sustainability targets. The unsecured credit facility of $1.0 billion is available for general corporate purposes and was  amended  on  March  17,  2023  to  extend  its  tenor  by  one  year  to  March  17,  2025.  Both  credit  facilities  provide  borrowings  at  various benchmark interest rates, such as SOFR and CDOR, plus applicable margins, based on CN's credit ratings. The facilities were also amended in March 2023 to include fallback language that addresses the cessation of CDOR and adoption of CORRA as the alternative benchmark.\n\nSubject to the consent of the individual lenders, the Company has the option to increase the revolving credit facilities by an additional $500 million each during its term and to request an extension of the $2.5 billion credit facility once a year to maintain the tenors of three year and five year of the respective tranches.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under these revolving credit facilities and there were no draws in 2023 and 2022.\n\nBoth revolving credit facility agreements have one financial covenant, which limits debt as a percentage of total capitalization. The Company was in compliance as at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Equipment loans\n\nThe  Company  has  various  secured  non-revolving  term  loan  credit  facilities  for  financing  or  refinancing  the  purchase  of  equipment.  The equipment loans made under the non-revolving credit facilities have a tenor at inception varying from 15 to 20 years and are secured by rolling stock.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into new loan supplements to the existing agreement for an additional principal amount of US$304 million, which is available to be drawn, in Canadian or U.S. dollars, through March 31, 2024. On November 3, 2023, the Company entered into a new term loan facility for a principal amount of $366 million, which is available to be drawn through November 4, 2024. Borrowings under the non-revolving  term  loan  facilities  are  provided  at  SOFR  and/or  CDOR,  plus  applicable  margins.  On  March  31,  2023,  outstanding  loans referencing LIBOR, were transitioned to SOFR. The facilities also include fallback language that addressed the cessation of CDOR and adoption of CORRA as the alternative benchmark. The Company made no draws under these facilities in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the Company repaid $41 million (2022 - $40 million) of its equipment loans. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $677 million (2022 - $734 million), at a weighted-average interest rate of 6.09% (2022 - 5.22%), and had $769 million (2022 - $nil) available to be drawn under these facilities.\n\n|",

The Company has retained the responsibility for servicing, administering and collecting the receivables sold. The average servicing period is  approximately  one  month  and  the  interest  on  borrowings  under  the  accounts  receivable  securitization  program  is  renewed  based  on commercial paper rates then in effect or SOFR or CDOR if the commercial paper market is inaccessible and includes fallback language that allows for the succession of CDOR to an alternative rate consistent with market convention.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 18 - Pensions and other postretirement benefits\n\nThe Company has various retirement benefit plans under which substantially all of its employees are entitled to benefits at retirement age, generally based on compensation and length of service and/or contributions. Senior and executive management employees, subject to certain minimum  service  and  age  requirements,  are  also  eligible  for  an  additional  retirement  benefit  under  their  Special  Retirement  Stipend Agreements, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan or the Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.\n\nThe Company also offers postretirement benefits to certain employees providing life insurance, medical benefits and, for a closed group of employees, free rail travel benefits during retirement. These postretirement benefits are funded as they become due. The information in the tables that follow pertains to all of the Company's defined benefit plans. However, the following descriptions relate solely to the Company's main pension plan, the CN Pension Plan, unless otherwise specified.\n\n## Amendments to postretirement medical benefits plans in the U.S.\n\nIn  June  2022,  CN  approved  changes  affecting  members  participating  in  the  Company's  postretirement  medical  benefits  plans  in  the  U.S. Beginning in 2023, Medicare-eligible retirees are covered by a health reimbursement arrangement, which is an employer-funded account that can be used for reimbursement of eligible medical expenses. Non-Medicare eligible retirees continue to be covered by the existing self-insured program. This change constituted a plan amendment event resulting in a $28 million reduction to the affected plans' Accumulated projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income, and is composed of a prior service credit of $21 million and an actuarial gain of $7 million, substantially all due to lower expected future benefit payments and to the approximate 130 basis point increase in the end of period discount rates between December 31, 2021 and May 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n## Curtailment event\n\nOn October 31, 2021, the CN Board of Directors approved changes affecting non-unionized members participating in the Company's defined benefit pension plans. Effective April 1, 2024, the affected defined benefit pension plans will be amended to cease benefits accruals for nonunionized members, generally known as a delayed hard freeze. Effective April 1, 2024, all non-unionized members will be transferred to the Company's defined contribution pension plans for their future service. This delayed hard freeze constitutes a plan curtailment event recognized on October 31, 2021 resulting in a $52 million reduction to the Projected benefit obligation, recorded in Other comprehensive income as an actuarial  gain,  mostly  due  to  reflecting  projected  future  salary  increases  and  service  only  up  to  April  1,  2024.  The  curtailment  event  also triggered  an  interim  re-measurement  of  the  funded  status  of  the  affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  resulting  in  an  actuarial  gain  of $1,915 million recorded in Other comprehensive income composed of i) an actuarial gain on the Projected benefit obligation of $1,808 million substantially all due to the 84 basis point increase in the end of period discount rate between December 31, 2020 of 2.55% and October 31, 2021 of 3.39%, and ii) an actuarial gain on the Plan assets of $107 million due to higher actual returns of $982 million compared to expected returns of $875 million over that same ten-month period. Due to the interim re-measurement, the resulting Net periodic benefit income recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by $25 million composed of i) a decrease to Current service cost of $9 million, and ii) an increase to Other components of net periodic benefit income of $16 million.\n\n## Description of the CN Pension Plan\n\nThe CN Pension Plan is a contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers the majority of CN employees. It provides for pensions based mainly on years of service and final average pensionable earnings and is generally applicable from the first day of employment. Indexation of pensions is provided after retirement through a gain/loss sharing mechanism, subject to guaranteed minimum increases. An independent trust company is the Trustee of the Company's pension trust funds (which includes the CN Pension Trust Fund). As Trustee, the trust company performs  certain  duties,  which  include  holding  legal  title  to  the  assets  of  the  CN  Pension  Trust  Fund  and  ensuring  that  the  Company,  as Administrator, complies with the provisions of the CN Pension Plan and the related legislation. The Company utilizes a measurement date of December 31 for the CN Pension Plan.\n\n## Funding policy\n\nEmployee  contributions  to  the  CN  Pension  Plan  are  determined  by  the  plan  rules.  Company  contributions  are  in  accordance  with  the requirements  of  the  Government  of  Canada  legislation,  the Pension  Benefits  Standards  Act,  1985 ,  including  amendments  and  regulations thereto,  and  such  contributions  follow  minimum  and  maximum  thresholds  as  determined  by  actuarial  valuations.  Actuarial  valuations  are generally  required  on  an  annual  basis  for  all  Canadian  defined  benefit  pension  plans,  or  when  deemed  appropriate  by  the  Office  of  the Superintendent  of  Financial  Institutions.  These  actuarial  valuations  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  legislative  requirements  and  with  the recommendations of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries for the valuation of pension plans. Actuarial valuations are also required annually for the Company's U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe  Company's  most  recently  filed  actuarial  valuations  for  funding  purposes  for  its  Canadian  registered  defined  benefit  pension  plans conducted as at December 31, 2022 indicated a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.4 billion and a funding excess on a solvency basis of approximately $1.6 billion, calculated using the three-year average of the plans' hypothetical wind-up ratio in accordance with the Pension Benefit Standards Regulations, 1985 . The federal pension legislation requires funding deficits, if any, to be paid over a number of years, as calculated under current pension regulations. Alternatively, a letter of credit can be subscribed to fulfill required solvency deficit payments.\n\nThe  Company's  next  actuarial  valuations  for  funding  purposes  for  its  Canadian  registered  defined  benefit  pension  plans  required  as  at December 31, 2023 will be performed in 2024. These actuarial valuations are expected to identify a funding excess on a going concern basis of approximately $4.9 billion,  while  on  a  solvency  basis  a  funding  excess  of  approximately $2.6  billion  is  expected.  Based  on  the  anticipated results of these valuations, the CN Pension Plan is expected to remain fully funded and at a level such that the Company would continue to be prohibited  from  making  contributions  to  the  CN  Pension  Plan  in 2024.  As  such,  the  Company  expects  to  make  total  cash  contributions  of approximately $70 million in 2024 for all other pension plans, and includes the impact of affected non-unionized members transferring from the Company's defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution pension plans effective April 1, 2024. As at January 31, 2024 the Company had contributed $2 million to its defined benefit pension plans for 2024.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the Company's various Canadian defined benefit pension plans are primarily held in separate trust funds (\"Trusts\") which are diversified by asset type, geography, sector and investment strategy. Each year, the CN Board of Directors reviews and confirms or amends the Statement  of  Investment  Policies  and  Procedures  (SIPP)  which  includes  the  plans'  long-term  target  asset  allocation  (\"Policy\")  and  related benchmark  indices.  This  Policy  is  based  on  the  long-term  expectations  of  the  economy  and  financial  market  returns  and  considers  the dynamics of the plans' pension benefit obligations. In 2023, the Policy was amended to implement a target asset allocation change to bonds and mortgages and equities.\n\nThe CN Investment Division (\"Investment Manager\"), a division of the Company created to invest and administer the assets of the plan, can also implement an investment strategy (\"Strategy\") which can lead the plan's actual asset allocation to deviate from the Policy due to changing market risks and opportunities. The Pension and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (\"Committee\") regularly compares the actual plan  asset  allocation  to  the  Policy  and  Strategy  and  compares  the  actual  performance  of  the  Company's  pension  plan  assets  to  the performance of the benchmark indices.\n\n## Actual asset allocation\n\n|                                 |        | Actual plan asset allocation   | Actual plan asset allocation   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                 | Policy | 2023                           | 2022                           |\n| Cash and short-term investments | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Bonds and mortgages             | 41 %   | 41 %                           | 35 %                           |\n| Emerging market debt            | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Private debt                    | 3 %    | 6 %                            | 6 %                            |\n| Equities                        | 29 %   | 25 %                           | 30 %                           |\n| Real estate                     | 4 %    | 3 %                            | 3 %                            |\n| Resource and royalties          | 5 %    | 7 %                            | 7 %                            |\n| Infrastructure                  | 4 %    | 4 %                            | 4 %                            |\n| Specialty portfolio             | 2 %    | 2 %                            | 2 %                            |\n| Absolute return                 | 12 %   | 14 %                           | 15 %                           |\n| Alternative risk premia         | - %    | - %                            | 1 %                            |\n| Investment-related liabilities  | (4 %)  | (6 %)                          | (8 %)                          |\n| Total                           | 100 %  | 100 %                          | 100 %                          |\n\n|",

The  SIPP  allows  for  the  use  of  derivative  financial instruments to implement strategies, hedge and adjust existing or anticipated exposures. The SIPP prohibits investments in securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. Investments held in the Company's pension plans consist mainly of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and short-term investments consist of highly liquid securities which ensure adequate cash flows are available to cover near-term benefit  payments  as  well  as  anticipated  cash  requirements  needed  to  support  derivative  instruments  or  any  other  contractual commitment. Short-term investments are mainly obligations issued by Canadian chartered banks and by Canadian governments.\n- \u00b7 Bonds  include  bond  instruments,  issued  or  guaranteed  by  governments  and  non-government  entities.  As  at  December  31,  2023,  73% (2022 - 76%) of bonds were issued or guaranteed by Canadian, U.S. or other governments. Mortgages consist of mortgage bonds, interest in  mortgages or in funds making loans, all of which are secured by real estate. On an exposure basis, the Plan's Policy for bonds and mortgages is 46%. This comprises a 41% allocation mainly to government and corporate bonds and a 5% allocation to derivative financial instruments related to bond exposure.\n- \u00b7 Emerging market debt consists of units of co-mingled funds or in separate accounts managed by external managers whose mandate is to invest in debt instruments of emerging market countries.\n- \u00b7 Private debt includes participations in private debt securities and funds focused on generating steady yields.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments include publicly traded securities diversified by industry sector, geography and issuer and investments in private equity funds.

On an exposure basis, the Plan's Policy for equities is 34%. This comprises a 29% allocation to equities and a 5% allocation to derivative financial instruments related to equity exposure.\n- \u00b7 Real estate is a diversified portfolio of Canadian land and commercial properties and investments in global real estate private equity funds.\n- \u00b7 Resource  and  royalties  investments  include  petroleum  and  natural  gas  and  mineral  properties  and  listed  and  non-listed  securities  of resource and energy transition companies.\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure investments include participations in private infrastructure funds, term loans and notes of infrastructure companies.\n- \u00b7 Specialty  portfolio  consists  of  mainly  private  equities  in  addition  to  private  debt,  resource  and  royalties  investments,  absolute  return investments and public equities. Exposure to public assets may be included to manage the risk-return profile and tactical allocation relative to the Policy portfolio weight.\n- \u00b7 Absolute return investments are primarily a portfolio of units of externally managed hedge funds, which are invested in various long/short and derivatives strategies within multi-strategy, fixed income, commodity, equity, global macro funds and downside protection. Managers are monitored on a continuous basis through investment and operational due diligence.\n- \u00b7 For 2022, alternative risk premia investments are a portfolio of units of externally managed funds and internally managed strategies on a risk-adjusted basis.\n- \u00b7 Investment-related liabilities reflect a certain level of financing associated with securities sold under repurchase agreements and other assets.\n\nThe plans' Investment Manager monitors market events and risk exposures to foreign currencies, interest rates, market risks, credit risks and liquidity risks daily. When investing in foreign securities, the plans are exposed to foreign currency risk that may be adjusted or hedged; the effect of which is included in the valuation of the foreign securities. Net of the adjusted or hedged amount, the plans were 58% exposed to the Canadian dollar, 29% to the US dollar, 7% to European currencies, 1% to the Japanese Yen and 5% to various other currencies as at December 31,  2023.  Interest  rate  risk  represents  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  of  the  investments  will  fluctuate  due  to  changes  in  market  interest  rates. Sensitivity  to  interest  rates  is  a  function  of  the  timing  and  amount  of  cash  flows  of  the  interest-bearing  assets  and  liabilities  of  the  plans. Derivatives are contractual agreements whose value is derived from interest rates, foreign currencies, commodities, or equities, among other fluctuating inputs and factors. They may include forwards, futures, options and swaps. Derivatives are included in the investment asset classes based on their underlying exposure and are used from time to time to synthetically replace any investment activity that would otherwise be accomplished through a direct investment in any investment asset class. When derivatives are used for hedging purposes, the gains or losses on the derivatives are offset by a corresponding change in the value of the hedged assets. To manage counterparty credit risk, established policies require dealing with counterparties considered to be of high credit quality. Adequate liquidity is maintained to cover cash flows by monitoring factors such as fair value, collateral pledged and received, repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements.\n\nOverall return in the capital markets and the level of interest rates affect the funded status of the Company's pension plans, particularly the Company's main Canadian pension plan. Adverse changes with respect to pension plan returns and the level of interest rates from the date of the last actuarial valuations may have a material adverse effect on the funded status of the plans and on the Company's results of operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Under the Share Units Plan, the Company grants performance share unit (PSU) awards and restricted share unit (RSU) awards.\n\nPSU-ROIC awards settle depending on the level of attainment of a target return on invested capital (ROIC) performance condition, as defined by the award agreement, over the plan period of three years. The level of attainment of the performance condition results in a performance factor that ranges from 0% to 200%. Settlement is also conditional upon the attainment of a minimum share price market condition, calculated using the average of the last three months of the plan period.\n\nPSU-TSR awards settle depending on the level of attainment of a target total shareholder return (TSR) market condition, as defined by the award agreement, over the plan period of three years. The level of attainment of the market condition results in a performance factor that ranges from 0% to 200% depending on the Company's TSR relative to a Class I Railways peer group and the S&P/TSX 60 companies.\n\nRSU awards settle depending on continued employment throughout the plan period, and are not subject to market or performance conditions.\n\nPSUs and RSUs are settled in common shares of the Company by way of disbursement from the Share Trusts (see Note 19 - Share capital ). The number  of  shares  remitted  to  the  participant  upon  settlement  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  number  of  PSUs  awarded  multiplied  by  the performance factor and the number of RSUs awarded, less shares withheld to satisfy the participant's withholding tax requirement.\n\n## Performance share units\n\nFor the 2021 grant, the level of ROIC attained resulted in a performance factor of 190%, and the level of TSR attained resulted in a performance factor of 119% for the plan period ended December 31, 2023. The total fair value of the equity settled PSU awards that vested in 2023 was $44 million  (2022  -  $40  million;  2021  -  $30  million).  As  the  respective  performance  and  market  conditions  under  each  award  were  met  as  at December 31, 2023, a settlement of approximately 0.3 million shares, net of withholding taxes, is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## PSU awards\n\n|                                  | PSU-ROIC  (1)   | PSU-ROIC  (1)                          | PSU-TSR  (2)   | PSU-TSR  (2)                           |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Units           | Weighted-average grant date fair value | Units          | Weighted-average grant date fair value |\n|                                  | In millions     |                                        | In millions    |                                        |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022 | 0.7             | $  73.21                               | 0.4            | $  160.40                              |\n| Granted                          | 0.2             | $  89.37                               | 0.1            | $  174.04                              |\n| Settled  (3)                     | (0.2)           | $  74.02                               | (0.1)          | $  153.22                              |\n| Forfeited                        | -               | $  91.23                               | -              | $  188.58                              |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 0.7             | $  78.29                               | 0.4            | $  166.89                              |\n| Nonvested at December 31, 2022   | 0.5             | $  72.78                               | 0.2            | $  164.20                              |\n| Granted                          | 0.2             | $  89.37                               | 0.1            | $  174.04                              |\n| Vested  (4)                      | (0.2)           | $  64.50                               | (0.1)          | $  148.02                              |\n| Forfeited                        | -               | $  91.23                               | -              | $  188.58                              |\n| Nonvested at December 31, 2023   | 0.5             | $  78.29                               | 0.2            | $  166.89                              |\n\n|",

The total fair value of RSU awards vested, the number of units outstanding that  were  nonvested,  unrecognized  compensation  cost  and  the  remaining  recognition  period  have  not  been  quantified  as  they relate to a minimal number of units.\n\n## Voluntary Incentive Deferral Plan\n\nThe Company's Voluntary Incentive Deferral Plan (VIDP) provides eligible senior management employees the opportunity to elect to receive their annual incentive bonus payment in deferred share units (DSU) up to specific deferral limits. A DSU is equivalent to a common share of the Company and also earns dividends when normal cash dividends are paid on common shares. The number of DSUs received by each participant is established at the time of deferral. For each participant, the Company will grant a further 25% of the amount elected in DSUs, which will vest over a period of four years. The election to receive eligible incentive payments in DSUs is no longer available to a participant when the value of the participant's vested DSUs is sufficient to meet the Company's stock ownership guidelines.\n\n## Equity settled awards\n\nDSUs are settled  in  common  shares  of  the  Company  at  the  time  of  cessation  of  employment  by  way  of  an  open  market  purchase  by  the Company.  The  number  of  shares  remitted  to  the  participant  is  equal  to  the  number  of  DSUs  awarded  less  shares  withheld  to  satisfy  the participant's withholding tax requirement.\n\n|                                       | Equity settled DSUs  (1) Weighted-average   | Equity settled DSUs  (1) Weighted-average   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                       | Units                                       | grant date fair value                       |\n|                                       | In millions                                 |                                             |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022      | 0.3                                         | $  106.60                                   |\n| Granted                               | -                                           | $  157.22                                   |\n| Settled  (2)                          | -                                           | $  122.29                                   |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2023  (3) | 0.3                                         | $  112.66                                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The  Company  does  not  currently  hold  any  derivative  financial instruments to manage this exposure.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the liability for cash settled DSUs was $5 million based on closing stock price of $166.55 (2022 - $7 million based on closing stock price of $160.84).\n\n## Stock option awards\n\nThe Company's stock option plan allows for eligible employees to acquire common shares of the Company upon vesting at a price equal to the market value of the common shares at the grant date. The options issued by the Company are conventional options that vest over a period of time. The right to exercise options generally accrues over a period of four years of continuous employment for options granted prior to 2020, and five years for options granted in 2020 and onwards. Options are not generally exercisable during the first 12 months after the date of grant and expire after 10 years. As at December 31, 2023, 12.8 million common shares remained authorized for future issuances under these plans.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted 0.6 million (2022 - 0.6 million; 2021 - 0.7 million) stock options.\n\n|                                       | Options outstanding            | Options outstanding              | Nonvested options              | Nonvested options                       |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                       | Number of  options In millions | Weighted-average  exercise price | Number of  options In millions | Weighted-average  grant date fair value |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2022  (1) | 3.3                            | $  119.08                        | 1.5                            | $  21.96                                |\n| Granted  (2)                          | 0.6                            | $  157.89                        | 0.6                            | $  32.96                                |\n| Forfeited/Cancelled                   | (0.1)                          | $  145.10                        | (0.1)                          | $  25.22                                |\n| Exercised  (3)                        | (0.5)                          | $  94.60                         | N/A                            | N/A                                     |\n| Vested  (4)                           | N/A                            | N/A                              | (0.5)                          | $  20.18                                |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2023  (1) | 3.3                            | $  127.64                        | 1.5                            | $  26.65                                |\n| Exercisable at December 31, 2023  (1) | 1.8                            | $  110.61                        | N/A                            | N/A                                     |\n\nThe following table provides the number of stock options outstanding and exercisable as at December 31, 2023 by range of exercise price and their  related  intrinsic  value,  and  for  options  outstanding,  the  weighted-average  years  to  expiration.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 22 - Major commitments and contingencies\n\n## Purchase commitments\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  the  Company  had  fixed  and  variable  commitments  to  purchase  locomotives,  engineering  services,  information technology services and licenses, railroad cars, rail, rail ties, wheels as well as other equipment and services with a total estimated cost of $2,222 million. Costs of variable commitments were estimated using forecasted prices and volumes.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nIn  the  normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in various legal actions seeking compensatory and occasionally punitive damages,  including  actions  brought  on  behalf  of  various  purported  classes  of  claimants  and  claims  relating  to  employee  and  third-party personal injuries, occupational disease and property damage, arising out of harm to individuals or property allegedly caused by, but not limited to, derailments or other accidents.\n\n## Personal injury and other claims provisions - Canada\n\nEmployee injuries are governed by the workers' compensation legislation in each province whereby employees may be awarded either a lump sum or a future stream of payments depending on the nature and severity of the injury. As such, the provision for employee injury claims is discounted. In the provinces where the Company is self-insured, costs related to employee work-related injuries are accounted for based on actuarially  developed  estimates  of  the  ultimate  cost  associated  with  such  injuries,  including  compensation,  health  care  and  third-party administration costs. An actuarial study is generally performed at least on a triennial basis. For all other legal actions, the Company maintains, and regularly  updates  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  provisions  for  such  items  when  the  expected  loss  is  both  probable  and  can  be  reasonably estimated based on currently available information.\n\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021 the Company recorded a increase of $11 million, and a decrease of $11 million and $11 million, respectively, to its provision for personal injuries in Canada as a result of actuarial valuations for employee injury claims.\n\n| In millions                   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  168 | $  182 | $  206 |\n| Accruals and other            | 44     | 16     | 12     |\n| Payments                      | (32)   | (30)   | (36)   |\n| End of year                   | $  180 | $  168 | $  182 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  24  | $  27  | $  50  |\n\n## Personal injury and other claims provisions - United States\n\nPersonal injury claims by the Company's employees, including claims alleging occupational disease and work-related injuries, are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA). Employees are compensated under FELA for damages assessed based on a finding of fault  through  the  U.S.  jury  system  or  through  individual  settlements.  As  such,  the  provision  is  undiscounted.  With  limited  exceptions  where claims are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, the Company follows an actuarial-based approach and accrues the expected cost for personal injury,  including  asserted  and  unasserted  occupational  disease  claims,  and  property  damage  claims,  based  on  actuarial  estimates  of  their ultimate cost. An actuarial study is performed annually.\n\nFor employee work-related injuries, including asserted non-occupational disease claims, third-party claims, including grade crossing, trespasser and property damage claims, and occupational disease claims, the actuarial valuation considers, among other factors, the Company's historical patterns of claims filings  and  payments. For unasserted occupational disease claims, the actuarial valuation includes the projection of the Company's  experience  into  the  future  considering  the  potentially  exposed  population.  The  Company  adjusts  its  liability  based  upon management's assessment and the results of the study. On an ongoing basis, management reviews and compares the assumptions inherent in the latest actuarial valuation with the current claim experience and, if required, adjustments to the liability are recorded.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events, including events related to occupational diseases, which include but are not limited to, the timing and number of actual claims, the average cost per claim and the legislative and judicial environment, the Company's future payments may differ from current amounts recorded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded a increase of $2 million to its provision for U.S. personal injury and other claims attributable to non-occupational disease  claims,  third-party  claims  and  occupational  disease  claims  pursuant  to  the  2023  actuarial  valuation.  In  2022  and  2021,  actuarial valuations resulted in a decrease of $9 million and a decrease of $20 million, respectively. The prior years' adjustments from the actuarial valuations were mainly attributable to non-occupational disease claims, third -party claims and occupational disease claims, reflecting changes in the Company's estimates of unasserted claims and costs related to asserted claims. The Company has an ongoing risk mitigation strategy focused  on  reducing  the  frequency  and  severity  of  claims  through  injury  prevention  and  containment;  mitigation  of  claims;  and  lower settlements of existing claims.\n\n| In millions                   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning of year             | $  128 | $  125 | $  141 |\n| Accruals and other            | 34     | 33     | 30     |\n| Payments                      | (28)   | (39)   | (45)   |\n| Foreign exchange              | (3)    | 9      | (1)    |\n| End of year                   | $  131 | $  128 | $  125 |\n| Current portion - End of year | $  27  | $  18  | $  25  |\n\nAlthough the Company considers such provisions to be adequate for all its outstanding and pending claims, the final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2023, or with respect to future claims, cannot be reasonably determined. When establishing provisions for contingent liabilities the Company considers, where a probable loss estimate cannot be made with reasonable certainty, a range of  potential  probable  losses  for  each  such  matter,  and  records  the  amount  it  considers  the  most  reasonable  estimate  within  the  range. However, when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. For matters where a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, a range of potential losses cannot be estimated due to various factors which may include the limited availability of facts, the lack of demand for specific damages and the fact that proceedings were at an early stage. Based on information currently available, the Company believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against the Company will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, due to the inherent inability to predict with certainty unforeseeable future developments, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, municipal and local environmental laws and regulations in Canada and the U.S. concerning, among other things, emissions into the air; discharges into waters; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment  and  disposal  of  waste,  hazardous  substances,  and  other  materials;  decommissioning  of  underground  and  aboveground  storage tanks; and soil and groundwater contamination. A risk of environmental liability is inherent in railroad and related transportation operations; real estate ownership, operation or control; and other commercial activities of the Company with respect to both current and past operations.\n\n## Known existing environmental concerns\n\nThe  Company is  or  may  be  liable  for  remediation  costs  at  individual  sites,  in  some  cases  along  with  other  potentially  responsible  parties, associated  with  actual  or  alleged  contamination.  The  ultimate  cost  of  addressing  these  known  contaminated  sites  cannot  be  definitively established  given  that  the  estimated  environmental  liability  for  any  given  site  may  vary  depending  on  the  nature  and  extent  of  the contamination; the nature of anticipated response actions, taking into account the available clean-up techniques; evolving regulatory standards governing  environmental  liability;  and  the  number  of  potentially  responsible  parties  and  their  financial  viability.  As  a  result,  liabilities  are recorded based on the results of a four-phase assessment conducted on a site-by-site basis. A liability is initially recorded when environmental assessments occur, remedial efforts are probable, and when the costs, based on a specific plan of action in terms of the technology to be used and the extent of the corrective action required, can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the costs related to a particular site using cost scenarios established by external consultants based on the extent of contamination and expected costs for remedial efforts. In the case  of  multiple  parties,  the  Company  accrues  its  allocable  share  of  liability  taking  into  account  the  Company's  alleged  responsibility,  the number of potentially  responsible  parties  and  their  ability  to  pay  their  respective  share  of  the  liability.  Adjustments  to  initial  estimates  are recorded as additional information becomes available.\n\nThe Company's provision for specific environmental sites is undiscounted and includes costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as  monitoring  costs.  Environmental  expenses,  which  are  classified  as  Other  expense  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income,  include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants as well as adjustments to initial estimates. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.",

Based  on  the information currently available, the Company considers its provisions to be adequate.\n\n## Unknown existing environmental concerns\n\nWhile the Company believes that it has identified the costs likely to be incurred for environmental matters based on known information, the discovery of new facts, future changes in laws, the possibility of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and the Company's ongoing  efforts  to  identify  potential  environmental  liabilities  that  may  be  associated  with  its  properties  may  result  in  the  identification  of additional  environmental  liabilities  and  related  costs.  The  magnitude  of  such  additional  liabilities  and  the  costs  of  complying  with  future environmental laws and containing or remediating contamination cannot be reasonably estimated due to many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the lack of specific technical information available with respect to many sites;\n- \u00b7 the absence of any government authority, third-party orders, or claims with respect to particular sites;\n- \u00b7 the potential for new or changed laws and regulations and for development of new remediation technologies and uncertainty regarding the timing of the work with respect to particular sites; and\n- \u00b7 the determination of the Company's liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the ability to recover costs from any third parties with respect to particular sites.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of any such costs being incurred or whether such costs would be material to the Company cannot be determined at this time. There can thus be no assurance that liabilities or costs related to environmental matters will not be incurred in the future, or will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year, or that the Company's liquidity will not be adversely impacted by such liabilities or costs, although management believes, based on current information, that the costs to address environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity. Costs related to any unknown existing or future contamination will be accrued in the period in which they become probable and reasonably estimable.\n\n## Future occurrences\n\nIn railroad and related transportation operations, it is possible that derailments or other accidents, including spills and releases of hazardous materials, may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. As a result, the Company may incur costs in the future, which may be material, to address any such harm, compliance with laws and other risks, including costs relating to the performance of cleanups, payment of environmental penalties and remediation obligations, and damages relating to harm to individuals or property.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nThe  Company  may  incur  significant  capital  and  operating  costs  associated  with  environmental  regulatory  compliance  and  clean-up requirements, in its railroad operations and relating to its past and present ownership, operation or control of real property. Operating expenses related to regulatory compliance activities for environmental matters for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $32 million (2022 $31 million; 2021 - $27 million). In addition, based on the results of its operations and maintenance programs, as well as ongoing environmental audits and other factors, the Company plans for specific capital improvements on an annual basis. Certain of these improvements help ensure facilities,  such  as  fueling  stations,  waste  water  and storm water treatment systems, comply with environmental standards and include new construction and the updating of existing systems and/or processes. Other capital expenditures relate to assessing and remediating certain impaired properties. The Company's environmental capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $13 million (2022 $19 million; 2021 - $18 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Guarantees and indemnifications\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  enters  into  agreements  that  may  involve  providing  guarantees  or  indemnifications  to  third parties and others, which may extend beyond the term of the agreements. These include, but are not limited to, standby letters of credit, surety and other bonds, and indemnifications that are customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $337 million (2022 - $396 million) under the committed bilateral letter of credit facilities and $152 million (2022 - $100 million) under the uncommitted bilateral letter of credit facilities, and surety and other bonds of $157 million (2022 - $171 million), all issued by financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings to third parties to indemnify them in the event the Company does not perform its contractual obligations.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the maximum potential liability under these guarantee instruments was $646 million (2022 - $667 million), of which $603 million (2022 - $625 million) related to other employee benefit liabilities and workers' compensation and $43 million (2022 - $42 million) related to other liabilities. The guarantee instruments expire at various dates between 2024 and 2025.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Company had not recorded a liability with respect to guarantees as the Company did not expect to make any payments under its guarantees.\n\n## General indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications, customary for the type of transaction or for the railway business, in various agreements with third parties, including indemnification provisions where the Company would be required to indemnify third parties and others. During the year, the Company entered into various contracts with third parties for which an indemnification was provided. Due to the nature  of  the  indemnification  clauses,  the  maximum  exposure  for  future  payments  cannot  be  reasonably  determined.  To  the  extent  of  any actual claims under these agreements, the Company maintains provisions for such items, which it considers to be adequate. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had not recorded a liability with respect to any indemnifications.\n\n## 23 - Financial instruments\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to various risks from its use of financial instruments. To manage these risks, the Company  follows  a  financial  risk  management  framework,  which  is  monitored  and  approved  by  the  Company's  Audit,  Finance  and  Risk Committee, with a goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, optimizing earnings per share and free cash flow, financing its operations at an optimal  cost  of  capital  and  preserving  its  liquidity.  The  Company  has  limited  involvement  with  derivative  financial  instruments  in  the management of its risks and does not hold or issue them for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Company conducts its business in both Canada and the U.S. and as a result, is affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in the exchange rate  between  the  Canadian  dollar  and  the  US  dollar  affect  the  Company's  revenues  and  expenses.  To  manage  foreign  currency  risk,  the Company  designates  US  dollar-denominated  debt  of  the  parent  company  as  a  foreign  currency  hedge  of  its  net  investment  in  foreign operations.  As  a  result,  from  the  dates  of  designation,  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  translation  of  the  Company's  US  dollardenominated debt are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which minimizes volatility of earnings resulting from the conversion of US dollar-denominated debt into the Canadian dollar.\n\nThe Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk. As at December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase a notional value of US$1,496 million (2022 - US$1,311 million). These outstanding contracts are at a weighted-average exchange rate of $1.37 per US$1.00 (2022 - $1.33 per US$1.00) with exchange rates ranging from $1.34 to $1.39 per US$1.00 (2022 - $1.29 to $1.37 per US$1.00). The weighted-average term of the contracts is 77 days (2022 157 days) with terms ranging from 26 days to 178 days (2022 - 29 days to 300 days). Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates, are recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a loss of $45 million (2022 - gain of $129 million; 2021 - loss of $18 million)  related  to  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts.  These  gains  and  losses  were  largely  offset  by  the  re-measurement  of  US  dollardenominated  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  recognized  in  Other  income.  As  at  December  31,  2023,  the  fair  value  of  outstanding  foreign exchange forward contracts included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other was $nil and $64 million, respectively (2022 - $33 million and $4 million, respectively).\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk, which is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will vary as a result of changes in market interest rates. Such risk exists in relation to the Company's debt. The Company mainly issues fixed-rate debt, which exposes the Company to variability in the fair value of the debt. The Company also issues debt with variable interest rates, which exposes the Company to variability  in  interest  expense.  To  manage  interest  rate  risk,  the  Company  manages  its  borrowings  in  line  with  liquidity  needs, maturity schedule, and currency and interest rate profile. In anticipation of future debt issuances, the Company may use derivative instruments such as forward rate agreements.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Company entered into treasury lock agreements to hedge US Treasury benchmark rates related to expected debt issuances in  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  The  treasury  locks  were  designated  as  cash  flow  hedging  instruments  with  cumulative  gains  or losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in derivative instruments. In conjunction with the November 1, 2023 debt issuance, the Company settled a notional US$450 million ($622 million) of treasury locks, resulting in a cumulative gain of $97 million. The cash proceeds were  included  in  operating  activities  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Cash  Flows,  and  the  gain  was  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In conjunction with the August 5, 2022 debt issuance, the Company settled a notional US$675 million ($868 million) of treasury locks, resulting in a cumulative loss of $2 million. This loss was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding debt and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As at December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no treasury locks outstanding.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  financial  instruments  that  the  Company  measures  at  fair  value  on  a  recurring  basis  in  periods  subsequent  to  initial  recognition  are categorized into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which inputs are observable:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Significant inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level 1) are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Significant inputs are unobservable\n\nThe  carrying  amounts  of  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  Restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents  approximate  fair  value.  These  financial instruments include highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity, for which the fair value is determined by reference to quoted prices in active markets.\n\nThe carrying amounts of Accounts receivable, Other current assets and Accounts payable and other approximate fair value due to their short maturity, unless otherwise specified. The fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values, included in Intangible assets, goodwill  and  other,  is  classified  as  Level  1  with  gains  and  losses  being  recorded  in  Other  income  within  the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, included in Other current assets and Accounts payable and other is classified as Level 2 and is used to manage the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk. The fair value is measured by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate derived from market data for financial instruments subject to similar risks and maturities.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Company's debt does not approximate fair value. The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt instruments, as well as discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity. The Company classifies debt as Level 2. As at December 31, 2023, the Company's debt, excluding finance leases, had a carrying amount of $18,435 million (2022 - $15,419 million) and a fair value of $17,844 million (2022 - $14,137 million). The carrying amount of debt excluding finance leases exceeded the fair value due to an increase in market rates compared to the stated coupon rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

The  Company's  management  is responsible  for,  among  others,  CN's  marketing  strategy,  the  management  of  large  customer  accounts,  overall  planning  and  control  of infrastructure and rolling stock, the allocation of resources, and other functions such as financial planning, accounting and treasury.\n\nThe role of each region is to manage the day-to-day service requirements within their respective territories and control direct costs incurred locally. Such cost control is required to ensure that pre-established efficiency standards set at the corporate level are met. The regions execute the overall corporate strategy and operating plan established by the Company's management, as the regions' management of throughput and control of direct costs does not serve as the platform for the Company's decision-making process. Approximately 85% of the Company's freight revenues are from national accounts for which freight traffic spans North America and touches various commodity groups. As a result, the Company does not manage revenues on a regional basis since a large number of the movements originate in one region and pass through and/ or terminate in another region.\n\nThe regions also demonstrate common characteristics in each of the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 each region's sole business activity is the transportation of freight over the Company's extensive rail network;\n- \u00b7 the regions service national accounts that extend over the Company's various commodity groups and across its rail network;\n- \u00b7 the  services  offered  by  the  Company  stem  predominantly  from  the  transportation  of  freight  by  rail  with  the  goal  of  optimizing  the  rail network as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the Company and its subsidiaries, not its regions, are subject to regulatory regimes in both Canada and the U.S.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, no major customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues and the largest freight customer represented less than 3%, 4% and 4%, respectively, of total annual freight revenues.\n\n## Geographic information\n\n| In millions    | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenues       |           |           |           |\n| Canada         | $  11,570 | $  11,583 | $  9,955  |\n| U.S.           | 5,258     | 5,524     | 4,522     |\n| Total revenues | $  16,828 | $  17,107 | $  14,477 |\n\n| In millions                  | As at December 31,   | 2023      | 2022      |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Long-lived assets            |                      |           |           |\n| Canada                       | $                    | 25,530    | $  24,396 |\n| U.S.                         |                      | 19,511    | 19,611    |\n| Total long-lived assets  (1) |                      | $  45,041 | $  44,007 |\n\n## 25 - Subsequent event\n\n## Normal course issuer bid\n\nOn January 23, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new NCIB, which allows for the repurchase of up to 32.0 million common shares between February 1, 2024 and January 31, 2025.\n\n|",
