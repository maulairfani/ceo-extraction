Comparative figures have been prepared in accordance with the same principles as 2023. For more information, see 'Accounting policies'\n\n## New accounting regulations\n\nImplementation of the new accounting standard IFRS17 entails a uniform method for recognising and presenting the pension liabilities. IFRS17 introduces a number of mandatory accounting items that result in a significant change to how the income statement is presented.\n\nAs a consequence of the new accounting regulation, ATP has a result of 0, as ATP has generates no profit from providing services.\n\n- \u00b7 At ATP, all funds are owned by ATP's members and are paid out to ATP's members. The return is added directly to the bonus potential, which means that the income statement for ATP will always show a 0 result.\n- \u00b7 Under insurance service, the contribution revenue is only recognised in the income statement when the insurance is used, i.e. as pensions are paid out and expenses are incurred. Without profit, the result is 0.\n\nChanges to provisions due to life expectancy updates or the allocation of bonuses will impact future payments, and will therefore not appear in the income statement, but will instead be transfers between the bonus potential and the pension liabilities.\n\n## Summary of key figures\n\nAs the new standard means that all returns and financial income and expenses are shown under one item and there is no opportunity to present the individual business areas, ATP has instead in the summary of key figures reported the result divided by business areas, thereby illustrating the individual returns and correlation for the transfers to the members' assets.\n\nThe Management's review comments on the results for the year based on the summary of key figures and ratios.\n\nThe relationship between the statement of comprehensive income and the summary of key figures is shown in note 1 'Business area financial state -ments' in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Ratios\n\n| Return ratios                                                                  | 2023    | 2022   | 2021     | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----------|--------|--------|\n| Return on investment before tax relative to the bonus potential in per  cent 1 | 5.5     | (40.9) | 35.0     | 23.3   | 44.2   |\n| Return on market return portfolio before tax in per cent 2                     | 9.1     | (15.7) | -        | -      | -      |\n| Value creation ratios                                                          |         |        |          |        |        |\n| Value creation from pensions in per cent                                       | 3.1     | 3.1    | 3.3      | 3.4    | 3.4    |\n| Value creation from undistributed funds in per cent                            | 4.7     | (38.7) | 24.5     | 13.3   | 30.3   |\n| Total value creation in per cent                                               | 3.4     | (7.2)  | 8.5      | 5.5    | 8.0    |\n| Expense ratios in per cent                                                     |         |        |          |        |        |\n| Administration activity expenses relative to assets                            | 0.03    | 0.03   | 0.02     | 0.02   | 0.02   |\n| Investment expenses relative to assets                                         | 0.18    | 0.20   | 0.16     | 0.16   | 0.17   |\n| Performance fees, external managers relative to assets                         | 0.09    | 0.12   | 0.36     | 0.12   | 0.13   |\n| Total expenses relative to assets (APR)                                        | 0.30    | 0.35   | 0.54     | 0.30   | 0.32   |\n| Administration activity expenses in DKK per member                             | 38      | 39     | 40       | 40     | 38     |\n| Other ratios                                                                   |         |        |          |        |        |\n| Bonus capacity                                                                 | 17.1    | 17.2   | 20.3     | 18.0   | 16.6   |\n| Members (in thousands)                                                         | 5,600   | 5,521  | 5,424    | 5,347  | 5,264  |\n| Contribution revenues in DKK million                                           | 12,624  | 11,951 | 11,497   | 10,744 | 10,061 |\n| Life expectancy updates in DKK million                                         | 1,881   | 3,887  | 4,796    | 1,130  | 3,231  |\n| Bonus additions in DKK million                                                 | (5,811) | -      | (30,391) | -      | -      |\n\n1 Return on Investment is calculated as a daily time-weighted return on the bonus potential.

In this way, ATP must help to maintain, develop and, along the way, preferably streamline the payment of welfare benefits.\n\nThe cornerstone of our business is ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension). Today, the ATP pension covers almost the entire Danish labour market because all wage earners and almost everyone on transfer income pay compulsory contributions into the scheme until retirement. ATP's ongoing investment of the funds creates a return which ultimately helps to ensure that the members' total ATP pension that is paid out can be several times greater than the money they have paid in themselves. In the guaranteed pension, an interest on the payments is included in advance so that everyone can also expect that their payment will exceed the amount they themselves have contributed.\n\nIn 2023, the average ATP pension amounted to DKK 16,600. For approximately 400,000 pensioners in Denmark - around 35 per cent - the ATP pension is a noticeable financial supplement to their daily finances because the payment from ATP is their only pension income other than their public pensions.\n\nTogether, the state pension and the ATP pension accounted for three out of four pension kroner received by Danes in 2023, and this number will only slowly decrease over the next several decades. This emphasises that the basic pension, which comprises the state pension and ATP, is important both now and in the future to fulfil the original ambi -\n\ntion for introduction of the ATP contributions: that no Danish pensioners should be poor.\n\nATP differs from other pension savings by being a collective guaranteed scheme with one product. We promise all members a fixed pension, regardless of how long they live. As part of a collective, you as an individual do not have to worry about whether the pension is enough, because in ATP the pension is guaranteed and all risks are covered by the community.\n\nThe past two years have been turbulent for global markets. In particular, ATP's returns were periodically challenged by large, rapid interest rate movements in 2023 - as also happened in 2022 - which resulted in a historically poor investment result for ATP. 2023 ended with a return of DKK 5.7bn in the Investment portfolio.\n\nAs an investor, ATP aims to deliver as strong returns as possible. We fully understand that questions arise when our results do not live up to our ambitions. However, all investors experience good and bad years, and as a long-term investor it is important to consider the long-term perspective. Over the past ten years, ATP has generated an investment return of DKK 122.3bn.\n\nATP's business model includes built-in interest hedging, which protects in the long term against fluctuations in the financial markets. This business model works, and we can therefore always pay out the pensions we have promised to members.\n\nThis stability and protection against interest rate fluctuations can also be seen in ATP's bonus capacity. The bonus capacity shows how many additional funds ATP has in relation to our obligations to members. Although the market value of ATP's\n\nIn ATP, the community ensures that we all have a little more to live for on the day we retire. The many contributions together provide a strong foundation that ensures collectively stable lifelong pensions.\n\npension obligations has fluctuated significantly in recent years, our bonus capacity has been stable. In 2023, this once again benefited Danish pensioners, as ATP had the resilience to raise pensions again, this time by 3 per cent, despite large fluctuations in the financial markets. It takes effect from 2024 and includes all pensioners in ATP's membership, currently over 1 million seniors in Denmark.\n\nATP's second primary function is to act as a payment processor for DKK 320bn in welfare benefits. For example, in 2023 ATP paid out state pensions of DKK 154bn, rent subsidies of DKK 17bn and maternity/paternity benefits of DKK 12bn. Our ambition is to simplify and streamline payment of these large amounts of money and, as a processing business, ensure correct and equal access to welfare services as well as on-time payment of the correct amounts with excellent customer service.\n\nThis is where digitalisation plays an important role. Denmark is a trailblazer in digitalisation, and with the ongoing digital transformation comes more complex sharing data requirements, considerations regarding use of artificial intelligence, and higher expectations from the outside world for digital solutions.\n\nATP must carry out a socially critical task of providing administrative solutions that affect the everyday lives and finances of millions of people in Denmark. For this reason, we are not only committed to keeping up with digital developments, but also aim to be one of the leading technology and digitalisation companies - because this benefits the people\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof Denmark. Intelligent use of data and technology means that we can both save public money and make it easy to contact ATP. We test, develop and use new technology. In this way, we can also assist political decision-makers with knowledge, so that the best framework for the use of technology in Denmark can be created in a safe and responsible manner.\n\nSustainability also features strongly in ATP's approach to business. ATP is focused on delivering real sustainable development in the breadth of roles that ATP plays. We aim to strengthen the way in which sustainability is incorporated and coordinated across the Group.\n\nAs a workplace, ATP works continuously to develop in a more sustainable direction - financially, socially and environmentally. The desire is to create an employee culture that can endure for a long time and an everyday working life where employees thrive in the long term. At the same time, we have an ambition to strongly reduce the carbon footprint from ATP's energy and resource consumption - a continuous commitment that results in new initiatives every year. As an investor, we use active ownership to push companies in a more sustainable direction. In this context, ATP takes an active approach to how companies develop, seeks knowledge and insight and exerts its influence with the aim of creating real change in a sustainable direction.\n\nMartin Pr\u00e6stegaard, CEO, ATP",

On the foundation of the many individual contributions, the broad collective can ensure stable pensions even when there are fluctuations in life expectancy and varying rates of return on our investments.\n\nIn this way, the community provides financial security for the individual.\n\nToday, around 400,000 people in Denmark only have public pensions and ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) as pension income. For the many people who have little or no labour market pension or individual pension savings, the ATP pension is a particularly important contribution to their daily finances.\n\nBut regardless of income, public pensions and ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) are the foundation of all pensioners' income in Denmark. In 2023, the basic pension will account for 76 per cent of the income of Danish pensioners on average across the country.\n\nThe importance of the ATP pension and public pensions will continue to be significant in the future. Looking ahead to 2080, in more than 50 years, the basic pension will account for just over 50 per cent of all Danish pensioners' retirement income, even though by then most pensioners will have had a whole working life to save for retirement via employer-paid schemes (occupational pensions).\n\nThe ATP pension is a life annuity. It is paid from the time you retire and until your death, no matter how old you get.\n\nThe ATP pension is guaranteed. This means that all recipients are guaranteed a fixed amount every month for the entire disbursement period.\n\nATP endeavours to increase pensions to the extent that returns and the life expectancy of Danes provide the financial scope to do so. Most recently, the ATP pension was increased by 3 per cent from 1 January 2024 for pensioners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nper year was what ATP paid out on average to pensioners in 2023\n\n15\n\n## ATP's role in the Danish pension system\n\nIndividual pension\n\nLabour market pensions\n\nATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) Public pensions\n\nThe Danish pension system consists of three layers. They each play their own role, and together they ensure that the Danish pension system has been recognised as among the best in the world for many years.\n\nTogether with public pensions, ATP forms the fundamental layer of the system, the basic pension. The role of the two pensions is to ensure a foundation of financial security for all pensioners in Denmark, and they are characterised by being lifelong pensions of a fixed (guaranteed) amount.\n\nIn addition to the basic pension, there are labour market pensions and private pension savings.\n\nThe three layers are intended to work as a unified system that both relieves public spending and prevents poverty among pensioners. The more you save yourself, the less you will receive in pension payments from the government. In this way, private pensions help to ensure the social and economic sustainability of the pension system. Conversely, public pensions\n\ncompensate in the event that private pensions shrink and provide smaller payments to the individual pensioners.\n\nThe basic pension can be seen as a collective insurance scheme, and it means that in Denmark you are guaranteed a stable basic pension regardless of how your working life and any other pension savings may turn out.\n\n## Facts about ATP\n\n- \u00b7 90 per cent of 18-65 year-olds make contributions to ATP. The figure for labour market pen -sions is 65 per cent, and 17 per cent for private pensions in a given year.\n- \u00b7 ATP was established in 1964 by a majority of members of the Danish Parliament.\n- \u00b7 ATP's Supervisory Board is composed of an independent chairman and equal numbers of representatives from the social partners (employers and trade unions).",

        "page_content": "## Better pensions\n\nTogether with public pensions, the ATP pension is the basic pension that almost all Danish pensioners receive - and they need to be able to rely on it. The predictability of ATP's pension is of great value to many pensioners. Everyone should be able to feel confident about their ATP pension, which is why ensuring this level of security is what guides our investment strategy. Our investment strategy allows us to pay out the promised amount to all our members, regardless of life expectancy - and at the same time, we seek to generate a return that can increase pensions on an ongoing basis.\n\nEvery year, ATP determines how much guaranteed pension members can receive from the year's interest contribution. This is where the current interest rate matters. High interest rate = high pension. Low interest rates = lower pension. When interest rates in society rise as they have done in recent years, members benefit by receiving a higher ATP pension for the year's contributions. Typically, the interest rate we use will exceed the expected inflation rate. This means that an increase in the real value is recognised in future payments from the outset.\n\nATP makes every effort to increase the ATP pension over time. This is why we have adapted our business model in recent years. We take a slightly higher investment risk with a portion of the funds paid in by our members, in the expectation that this will increase the total return over time. The increased risk only applies to members with a long time to retirement, while still enabling ATP to honour the payments we have guaranteed.\n\n## ATP payments are expected to be many times greater than the contributions:\n\n## DKK 112,000\n\nis what a 67-year-old has paid in total ATP contributions together with their employer if they have made contributions since the age of 18\n\n## DKK 546,000\n\nis what ATP pays in total to a 67-yearold with full ATP contributions who will live 20 years as a pensioner\n\n19\n\n## After just four years as a pensioner, you will already have been paid out more than you have paid in\n\n- \u00b7  On average, a person in Denmark is retired for 20 years.\n- \u00b7  After four years, you will have received the money you paid into ATP.\n- \u00b7  The remaining 16 years of payments are due to the common pool and the returns ATP has realised by investing along the way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP works because so many people in Denmark pay into a common pool which we grow through investments. Every month, 3.6 million people in Denmark pay a small amount of money to ATP - employees, private individuals and employers - and ATP's task is to make that money grow and thus ensure that all our members receive the best possible pensions.\n\nAs a new pensioner in 2023, you will have contributed DKK 112,000 to ATP with full contributions during your working life. Your employer has paid part of the contributions.\n\nBut the amount you receive may be many times greater. Why? Because ATP invests your - and all other members' - money and thus generates returns. On average, people are retired for 20 years. After four years, you will have received the money you paid into ATP. The remaining 16 years of payments are due to the common pool and the returns ATP has achieved by investing along the way.",

This means that ATP invests a large proportion of its total funds in assets that are very secure in relation to the future pension payments. This portfolio is called the Interest Hedging portfolio and comprises bonds and interest rate swaps.\n\nThe Interest Hedging portfolio ensures that ATP can deliver the guaranteed pensions. This enables ATP's unallocated funds in the bonus potential - ATP's free reserves - to be invested in the higher risk Investment portfolio to achieve an appropriate balance between return and risk.\n\n## Risk diversification\n\nAll investors are familiar with the basic principle of risk management: Do not put all of your eggs in one basket. This also applies to ATP. In order to have a robust investment portfolio with a high rate of expected return, the Investment portfolio is managed based on a strategy of risk diversification.\n\nATP believes that the best returns are achieved in a portfolio that is balanced across different types of risks, markets and geographies.\n\n## Bonus potential\n\nThe bonus potential consists of funds that are not initially set aside to cover known future payments. The bonus potential thus functions as ATP's risk capital, which is not tied up from the outset. The money in the bonus potential is invested with a higher risk profile, and the return from investment must be able to cover unforeseen circumstances over time, such as unexpected increases in life expectancy, as well as contribute to increasing the real value of the pensions. ATP invests in such a way as to achieve an appropriate balance between aiming to raise pensions through strong returns and limiting the risk of losing the bonus potential as a result of negative returns. This trade-off between the expected return and the risk of loss is a core part of ATP's business model.\n\n## Bonus capacity\n\n## Into the engine room\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP's investment approach and our special role in the Danish pension system are connected. Below is a brief explanation of the concepts that are both unique and crucial to ATP as a pension company.\n\n## Investment process\n\nATP is an investor with many different types of assets and investments - from bonds and listed equities to infrastructure, real estate and natural resources. But ATP does not invest in just anything. All potential investment cases must undergo a thorough review before it is decided whether ATP will invest members' money in them.\n\nThe review is carried out by the Risk and Investment Committee, among others. Here, the management of the Pension and Investment Business, in collaboration with ATP's own professionals in various areas (e.g. valuation, risk management, legal, tax, operational implementation and sustainability), discuss the most important characteristics and risk factors of the investment case in question. For particularly large or special cases, ATP's Supervisory Board is also involved in the process.\n\nThe process must ensure that ATP invests on the best possible basis: Does the investment fit in with ATP's strategy? Does it seem to offer attractive returns? Are the other conditions in order? A thorough process ensures that ATP fulfils current requirements for a well-documented investment process.\n\nATP's bonus capacity provides a good picture of the health of ATP. The bonus capacity expresses the ratio between ATP's bonus potential and ATP's total liabilities - and thus how many extra funds ATP has in relation to its liabilities to its members. A robust bonus capacity means that there is a high degree of available funds to withstand economic pressure, either in the form of negative investment returns or unforeseen increases in the life expectancy of people in Denmark.\n\nThe bonus capacity is important for the Supervisory Board's annual assessment of  whether  ATP  has  sufficient  financial  strength  to  increase members' pensions in the form of bonuses.\n\nDespite changing interest rate levels and both positive and negative investment returns, ATP's bonus capacity has remained very stable, averaging 16.8 per cent over the past 10 years.\n\n20\n\n21\n\n## Value creation\n\nATP provides lifelong pensions with a high degree of security. For the contributions paid to ATP, you receive a pension from the state pension age and for as long as you live. A return is calculated into the pension so that you can expect the pension payments to exceed the contributions.\n\nA portion of the contributions paid in go to the bonus potential, where they are invested with a higher risk profile. The aim is to achieve a higher return, which can be used to increase pen -sions. ATP not only provides a return on contributions, but also endeavours to keep up with the developments in Danish inflation rate so that the pension maintains its purchasing power.\n\nFor members, there is also value in being part of a collective scheme where you are guaranteed a predictable lifelong pension no matter how long you live. **Being part of a collective means that you do not have to worry as an individual, because your pension is guaranteed and lifelong and the risks are covered by the collective rather than by you personally.",

This is done, e.g., through notifications with a precise indication of a desired action from the person in question, the possibility to add reminders or response deadlines to the person's personal calendar, and supplementing the letters' content with direct links to self-service solutions or further reading.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nATP has actively contributed to a proposed act of parliament which, as of 2024, will ensure a simpler collection process for ATP contributions via Samlet Betaling and more cost-effective interaction between companies and the Danish public sector. In concrete terms, this will be achieved by the ATP contribution being collected together with the schemes in Samlet Betaling, which means that in future, employers will only have to pay four times a year instead of eight times as previously. This will also reduce ATP Livslang's expenses since separate payment orders will no longer be needed.\n\n## Employees' Guarantee Fund (LG)\n\nATP has developed a new, easier self-service solution for the Employee's Guarantee Fund (LG) which makes it easier for employees to apply for compensation in the event of unpaid wages, e.g. if their employer goes bankrupt. The new solution guides employees and authorised representatives through the application process in a more detailed manner, so that they can be confident that they have applied with all the relevant requirements and sent the necessary documentation. After the new solution was implemented, customer satisfaction regarding parameters related to the self-service solution increased by 4-13 per cent. The solution also allows users to submit the requested documentation digitally after completing and submitting the application form. Simultaneously, a greater degree of digitalisation and use of machine learning also provides a better basis for systematic checks and thus a higher quality of case processing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has created an expectation to contribute to sustainable solutions across countries and stakeholders. At the same time, there is a growing focus on creating a responsible society that is diverse, equal and inclusive.\n\nAt ATP, we want to strengthen the way in which sustainability efforts are implemented and coordinated across the Group. ATP works with sustainability from a broad perspective that encompasses matters related to environmental, social and human resources as well as respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and bribery.\n\nATP's sustainability efforts are realised in two strategic focus areas: 'Climate & Environment' and 'Diversity & Inclusion'. In both these focus areas, we aim to contribute to finding solu -tions via interactions with the surrounding world - as a workplace, administrator and investor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate and environment\n\nATP works in a targeted manner to reduce its climate footprint. We aim to reduce our own CO 2 emissions as a company and push the companies we are invested in towards improved sustainability through our active ownership. ATP also focuses on biodiversity. Both as a company and as an active owner, we will map and take responsibility for how we safeguard biodiversity. Finally, ATP invests in the technological solutions that can really accelerate the green transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity & inclusion\n\nThere is more to sustainability than green initiatives. For ATP, it is also about contributing to a responsible society in a broader sense. A society where all talents are utilised. That is why we are dedicated to promoting diversity so that all talent can thrive regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity and physical/ mental ability. This commitment enriches both our business and society as a whole.\n\n32\n\n## Climate and environment\n\n## A responsible investor\n\nFor ATP, being an active owner and simultaneously spotting good business opportunities in the green transition is a priority. On this basis, ATP has defined a number of climate ambitions 1 intended to serve as guidelines in our investments and our work with the companies in our portfolio in the years ahead.\n\nIn 2023, ATP made green investments totalling DKK 12bn, primarily in green bonds. In the same period, ATP sold off green investments worth DKK 7bn, primarily listen equities and real estate. The portfolio of green investments increased by DKK 9bn this year, DKK 4bn of which is attributable to a positive price development in the bond and equity markets. At the end of 2023, ATP's green investments were valued at DKK 75bn.\n\nOne of ATP's climate ambitions is that the companies that ATP invests in should report on their CO 2 emissions by the end of 2025 at the latest. This is to ensure that we have the best possible overview of climate risks in our portfolio. Moreover, as an active owner we want to know which companies have done the most - and which have done the least - to mitigate climate change. We are monitoring this work by means of a points system in which we rate companies based on the quality of their CO 2 reporting.\n\n2023 saw positive development, mainly among the listed companies. The positive development from 2022 has continued, and we see more and more companies improving the quality of their CO 2 reporting. Data is mainly lacking from companies that ATP is a co-owner of via funds and listed companies in countries with a limited climate focus.\n\nBiodiversity is a topic that is closely linked to climate-related issues. We still need to get better at recognising the direct connection between companies' business activities and biodiversity. Biodiversity issues are still new, difficult and often geographically specific challenges, and it is difficult for organisations to account for how, for example, their supply chains impact biodiversity.\n\nNevertheless, we believe it is crucial that businesses make an effort to understand how they impact biodiversity and how they depend on it.\n\n## ATP works hard to reduce its own carbon footprint\n\nATP has an ambition to reduce the carbon footprint from energy consumption at its own office locations and travel activities by 30 per cent in 2025 and 70 per cent in 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050 as compared to 2018. ATP's calculated carbon footprint was reduced by 46 per cent in 2023 compared to 2018, and we have thus fulfilled our 2025 ambition.\n\nThe reduction in CO 2 emissions was driven by a number of initiatives, including optimised operation in ATP's offices. This included replacing heat exchang -ers and hot water tanks and optimising our technical facilities.",

This includes setting up more charging stations for electric cars and launching DSB's 'K\u00f8rmit' bicycle scheme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Solar panels provide power to all ATP's locations\n\nBy 2023, solar panels have been installed at several of ATP's locations. This year in Hiller\u00f8d alone, a saving of 48 tonnes of CO 2 has been achieved due to solar panels.\n\n## Meat consumption reduced by 25 per cent in 2023\n\nMeat is the largest climate impact for ATP's canteens. By 2023, consumption has therefore been reduced by 25 per cent and the target for 2025 is a reduction of 30 per cent (baseline 2018).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable remodelling of ATP's head office\n\nATP is expanding its head office in Hiller\u00f8d by up to 2500 m 2 . In the tender, ATP emphasised that the turnkey contractor's solution must focus on sustainability in a broad sense. The new building will also be DNGB gold certified, which is a stamp of quality for sustainability in construction.\n\n34\n\n## Collaborations result in actions\n\nBased on the basic premise that 'together we can achieve more', ATP participates in a number of collaborations and partnerships related to sustainability.\n\nOne of the newer collaborations is under the auspices of the Danish Agency for Digital Government. Here, ATP participates in the steering group for Digital Innovation and Green Transition ('Digital Innovation og Gr\u00f8n Omstilling' / DIGO) and in the working group for Green Data Processing and Storage ('Gr\u00f8n databehandling og opbevaring'). The initiative is part of the Joint Public Digitisation Strategy ('F\u00e6llesoffentlige Digitaliseringsstrategi' / FODS) 2022-2025 and is implemented in a joint public sector collaboration. Through a number of initiatives, this collaboration will identify, develop and disseminate best practices for energy efficiency and sustainability for data processing and storage, e.g. with regard to procurement, use and operation of physical infrastructure and software. Energy consumption in data centres today is estimated to account for 2-3 per cent of the world's total energy consumption, equivalent to the energy consumption of the entire aviation industry. At the same time, data centre power consumption is expected to account for 7-13 per cent of Denmark's total power consumption in 2030.\n\nInitially, a joint public sector coordinated trial of the EU Green Procurement Criteria (GPP criteria) for data centres, server rooms and cloud services will be launched. ATP is involved in the first pilot tests and will test the criteria in connection with larger tenders involving data centres.\n\nATP participates in the following collaborations, partnerships and certifications related to sustainability:\n\n- \u25a0 The United Nations Global Compact\n- \u25a0 The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard\n- \u25a0 Butterfly partner - Danish Society for Nature Con -servation\n- \u25a0 Network for Eco-labelled Purchases ('Netv\u00e6rk for Milj\u00f8m\u00e6rketIndk\u00f8b')\n- \u25a0 The Diversity Pledge (Confederation of Danish Industry)\n- \u25a0 The Organic Cuisine Label: Bronze, 30-60 per cent organic products\n- \u25a0 Foreningen Lige Adgang ('The Association for Equal Access')\n- \u25a0 POGI / Partnerskab for Offentlige Gr\u00f8nne Indk\u00f8b ('The Partnership for Green Public Sector Purchases')\n- \u25a0 DIGO / Digital innovation og gr\u00f8n omstilling ('Digital Innovation and Green Transition')\n- \u25a0 Partnerskab for Milj\u00f8m\u00e6rkede indk\u00f8b ('Partnership for Ecolabelled Procurement')\n\n<!-- image -->",

Diversity is a prerequisite in order to utilise all talents. After all, the larger the talent pool, the more resources we have to ensure a strong knowledge base on which to build our society.\n\nInclusion is a critical factor in the success of diversity. This means that ATP must have a respectful and inclusive culture free from discrimination. We continuously collect data in this area so that ATP can take meaningful action based on our specific challenges.\n\nWe actively work to ensure inclusive structures and processes in the organisation, and to offer training opportunities that support a culture of inclusion in the workplace and prevent unconscious bias.\n\nATP has a strong foundation when it comes to gender diversity, with a 60/40 gender distribution at all management levels and graduate teams. However, diversity is about more than gender, which is why ATP also focuses on listening and creating space for a diversity of voices from within the organisation.\n\n## ATP needs an LGBT+ network\n\nThe LGBT+ network at ATP is a forum for mutual support, advice, learning and sparring among LGBT+ employees and allies. The network also offers learning and sparring opportunities with HR, CSR and other employees.\n\n'An LGBT+ network is needed at ATP to highlight our differences and break down some of the more or less conscious prejudices about the LGBT+ community. It's not just during Pride Week but throughout the year that we need to be aware that we have colleagues who are different to us, both visibly and invisibly. We need to see this as a value, and more than that: We need to actively make changes and address our unconscious assumptions to ensure that everyone feels safe and included. Personally, I have a dream that people I meet will not automatically assume I am heterosexual and ask about my wife, for example.'\n\nMikael Boe Larsen, Organiser for ATP's LGBT+ network\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n37\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kasr Meho\n\nFor colleagues at ATP who come from a different culture, it is especially important to get to know the language and the Danish work culture. One of them is Kasr Meho, who joined ATP in FASE in 2019 and is now a permanent employee at FASE as a service assistant.\n\n'Being in contact with the Danish labour market is important to me, and I enjoy working with others. My tasks at ATP are very diverse. They include practical as well as administrative work, and that suits me very well. My colleagues mean a lot to me, as does the social aspect and the help and support I get at FASE. And the Danish lan-\n\nguage is the gateway to everything, so FASE opens many new doors for me.'\n\n'ATP is close to Aller\u00f8d, where I still live with my husband and our youngest son, and I ride my scooter to and from work. The two older sons are students and have already left home, so we've all settled in well in Denmark. I'm happy about that.'\n\nKasr Meho comes from Syria, where she trained as a school teacher. She worked for five years at a school in Al-Qamishli in north-eastern Syria before her family had to flee in 2016, after which she came to Denmark with her husband and two youngest sons. They were reunited shortly after this with their third son, who was already in Denmark. In addition to Danish, Kasr speaks Arabic, Turkish, English and Kurdish.\n\n## FACTS about FASE\n\nFASE is a function in ATP for particularly vulnerable groups in the labour market. The scheme was established in 2010 and has since recruited over 300 employees. More than 60 per cent of them have now been helped into jobs or study programmes. The FASE programme currently comprises 23 employees, while 19 former FASE colleagues are employed by ATP.",

We work for the benefit of the individual and society - and this places obligations on us. That is why we need to be an attractive workplace capable of bringing together some of the country's best people to solve the tasks across our 10 locations in Denmark and Greenland.\n\nWhen we ask employees, 82 per cent say they feel engaged and motivated in their work and 89 per cent find their work tasks to be meaningful. When we look at our own results in the latest employee satisfaction survey and benchmarks for other companies, we are pleased that ATP is perceived as an attractive workplace.\n\nAt ATP, we are finding, like many other companies, that in the current job market with a high employment rate we need to be on our toes to attract the right talent. That is why we are curious about how candidates experience their encounter with ATP in the recruitment process. Evaluation of the candidate experience shows that 86 per cent of our applicants in 2023 will recommend others to apply for a job at ATP and 88 per cent of applicants have the impression of ATP being an inclusive workplace. We are proud of this.\n\nWe are looking for people who are passionate about solving our core tasks. And we recognise that both for our current employees and applicants for our vacant positions, work-life balance is of great importance. Like many other organisations, we are in the process of finding a balance between individual flexibility and a close-knit workplace community.\n\nAs one of ATP's approximately 3,000 employees, you are part of a large community. This is reflected in strong colleague relationships and the sense of\n\ncommunity that arises when everyone, from customer advisors to economists, works together to develop new digital solutions and ensure efficient and timely payment of welfare benefits. Examples of this include our development of an internal chatbot to help customer advisors and case managers, and a desktop robot that eliminates manual tasks in our finance function.\n\nAnother example of community is when we meet across the board during ATP's first Health Week.\n\nOur many associations bring together all types of employees in activities ranging from cultural experiences to sports and board games. In addition, there are a number of professional networks such as our legal network, communication network and management network which strengthen professional competencies and promote a sense of community across departments.\n\nIn 2023 - as every year - we conducted a number of successful initiatives to attract and retain talented employees. This year, 25 new graduates chose ATP's graduate programme as their first job and 15 new of -fice trainees had their first working day at one of our locations. 24 employees across departments and job titles advanced their personal development as part of our talent team, and our development programmes for both new and experienced leaders are bearing fruit, as we can see in our employee satisfaction survey, where we got high scores for both supportive and goal-oriented leadership.\n\nWe have high ambitions for ATP as a workplace, now and in the future. Skilled and happy employees are essential for ATP to remain relevant and value-creating and to enjoy the trust of our customers, stakeholders and employees.\n\n39\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SPECIALIST\n\nBelal optimises the systems processing DKK 15bn for families with children\n\nEvery year, ATP is in contact with nearly half of the Danish population in connection with the payment of state pensions, industrial injuries or holiday allowance. This places great demands on our systems. Belal is one of the people behind the systems. He is a business specialist and is responsible for securing the system that pays DKK 15bn to Danish families with children every year.\n\n'Together with my colleagues, I ensure safe and efficient oper -ation of the system. I maintain an ongoing dialogue with stakeholders on all sides to make sure the system runs smoothly and the money is paid to the right people on time. But we also focus on constantly optimising the system and the processes around it.'\n\nFor Belal, it is about more than the disbursement of money.\n\n'It's a big responsibility because our systems deliver welfare to an entire country - and in my case, security to Danish families with children - so this is a meaningful job for me.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TALENT PROGRAMME\n\n## Line is one of ATP's many talents\n\nAt ATP we cultivate talent. That is why every year we have a talent team where several talents are offered accelerated personal development programmes. The Talent Programme is a key element in retaining and developing our most talented employees, and in 2023, an additional 24 employees participated in this programme.\n\n'I have gained greater insight into my strengths and challenges and how I bring the former into play as a customer advisor, instructor and colleague,' says Line. 'It has been a huge personal boost to be selected for the talent team and to know that someone has recognised my development potential.'\n\nThe talent programme is designed so that talents across programmes and job roles gain a cross-disciplinary network and a greater understanding of how their role contributes to the bigger picture.\n\n'There was a focus on personal development, which has encouraged me to aim high in terms of my personal development and future career at ATP. I also gained useful tools to help me continue working on my own development after the programme ends.'",

The objective of the overall changes to the business model for ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is to achieve both higher pensions in absolute terms and ensure better opportunities for increasing and preserving their real value.\n\nThe changes in the business model are comprised of two parts. Life annuity with market exposure was introduced in 2022 (see the Annual Report for 2022) and a new hedging strategy was introduced in 2023.\n\nThe changes to the hedging strategy are based on ATP's existing interest hedging, with the addition of a long-term market risk for hedging in the form of riskier assets to provide better opportunities to increase the real value of the pensions.\n\nThe changed hedging strategy is based on two special features regarding the ATP scheme: The payments stretch far into the future and the funds are only paid to members as they begin to retire. This means that the part of the assets that is to provide the guaranteed pensions is invested with a long-term focus where ATP assumes a higher investment risk than with pure interest hedging. The objective is to achieve higher returns over time as a supplement to the current interest hedging, while continuing to ensure that ATP is extremely likely to be able to honour the guaranteed benefit payments.\n\nAs a consequence of the illiquidity in the liabilities, ATP must - in accordance with international accounting standards (implementation of new standard IFRS17) - from 2023 calculate the value of the pension liabilities taking into account the illiquidity therein. For this reason, ATP adds an illiquidity spread to the discount curve for the purpose of calculating the value of the guaranteed pensions,\n\n## Implementation of Life annuity with market exposure in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n42\n\n43\n\nwhich will thus be reduced by DKK 37bn at the beginning of 2023. ATP has chosen to allocate the funds that are released in this way to Long-term Supplementary Provision (LSP), while establishing a Supplementary Hedging Portfolio with long-term risk taking as part of the overall hedging. Over time, the returns from the Supplementary Hedging portfolio are expected to be able to be transferred to the bonus potential and thus contribute to increasing the real value of the lifelong pensions. ATP must also calculate a surcharge - risk adjustment for non-financial risks - to pension liabilities as a consequence of the implementation of the new international accounting standard IFRS17. This supplement amounts to DKK 1.0bn and is an expression of the funds that ATP needs to reserve to assume non-financial risks.\n\nTwo new items have thus been introduced under pension provisions: Long-term supplementary provision and risk adjustment.\n\nATP's pension provisions will then consist of pension liabilities and undistributed funds. Pension liabilities are distributed to members either as a guaranteed pension or a life annuity with market exposure subject to a risk adjustment for non-financial risks.\n\nATP's undistributed funds form the remaining part of the pension provisions and consist of the bonus potential and the long-term supplementary provision.\n\nThe new balance sheet items will generally not change the value of the members' total assets. All of ATP's assets belong to its members, either as distributed or non-distributed funds.\n\nThe implementation of a new accounting standard also means, in addition to the changes to the balance sheet, that ATP's result will be 0 as ATP has no profit. For more information, see accounting practices.\n\n## Pension provisions before and after changes, start of 2023\n\nMembers' assets, DKKbn: 678\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMembers' assets, DKKbn: 678",

During the first half of the year there were growing concerns about a banking crisis after multiple banks in the United States were declared bankrupt and the monetary policy authorities in Europe had to offer liquidity to the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. These concerns caused fluctuations in the financial markets. During the spring and summer, both the US and European central banks continued to raise interest rates, which was clearly reflected in market interest rates. In October, a reduction in inflation began to raise hopes of a soft landing in the economy, after which yields on bonds with long remaining maturities began to fall while equities rose.\n\nGeopolitics and security policy events continue to create uncertainty, and in addition to the war in Ukraine and tensions between the United States and\n\nEquity price developments in 2023\n\nIndex\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChina, uncertainty was greatly increased as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nGlobal equity returns were high in 2023, but were unevenly distributed. The US S&P Index posted a total return of around 25 per cent in 2023, driven by seven major technology and IT stocks contributing returns of over 100 per cent. In comparison, the equilibrium index, where price developments are not dominated by the largest companies, had a return of 14 per cent. The Danish equity market rose significantly less than US equities, with the KAX Cap index rising by 6.4 per cent in 2023.\n\nIn the markets for illiquid investments, such as real estate, infrastructure and private equities, trading activity was low in 2023. This reflects, among other things, the higher level of interest rates and consequently higher financing costs for investors who borrow money to finance assets. However, invest -ment commitments from investors remain at record levels, helping to support the market.\n\nInterest rate developments in 2023Note: Calculated as a five-day rolling average.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result, the return on illiquid assets remained stable or slightly declining in 2023 and thus could not keep up with the increase in liquid markets - both equities and bonds - observed in the latter part of the year.\n\n## Follow-up on 2023\n\nThe result of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is composed of the result of Hedging, Investment and insurance service.\n\nIn order to ensure the best possible returns while at the same time enabling ATP to honour the guarantees it has made to its members, the Supervisory Board has specified a long-term profit expectation of 11 per cent of the bonus potential. The profit expectation can be seen as a benchmark for how ATP is expected to perform in an average year. The result for ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) in 2023 was DKK 6.9bn, corresponding to the sum of the results for Hedging of DKK 2.3bn and Investment of DKK 4.6bn. This corresponds to 7.0 per cent of the bonus potential at the beginning of 2023.\n\nThe profit expectation was thus not achieved for 2023, seen separately. However, the result is considered acceptable as the deviation from the profit expectation reflects, among other things, ATP's long-term investment strategy and certain choices in implementing it. It is natural that investment results vary in the short term, and the profit expectation does not necessarily have to be achieved every year.\n\nATP's ability to increase guaranteed pensions is measured by the bonus capacity, which is the ratio between the bonus potential and ATP's total liabilities to its members. The bonus capacity was stable\n\nduring the year, and ATP thus had the financial strength to increase pensions by 3 per cent for all pensioners. This bonus distribution was announced at the end of November 2023 and will take effect from 1 January 2024. After the year's bonus allocation, the bonus capacity stood at 17.1 per cent at year end, which demonstrates that ATP's finances are robust. The bonus potential was DKK 104bn at the end of 2023, and together with the pension liabilities of DKK 569bn and supplementary provision of DKK 39bn, the members' assets totalled DKK 712bn.\n\n## Perspective on the return\n\nATP's investment strategy is adapted to ATP's role and product. The strategy is long-term and is based on hedging the interest rate risk on the liabilities to the members, an investment portfolio based on a high degree of risk diversification as well as a market interest rate, and a supplementary hedging portfolio being developed with long-term risk-taking. The risk-bearing portfolios mean that ATP invests across liquid and illiquid investments, across assets, companies and geographies and with dynamic and disciplined risk management.\n\nATP's investment strategy differs from market rate products by operating with a higher level of risk in the Investment portfolio and through a different allocation of risk. For example, ATP has a far more equal distribution between equity and interest rate risk than a traditional market-rate product in Danish pension funds. Overall, this means that ATP performs relatively well when bonds have positive price movements, while ATP performs relatively poorly when equities do very well - precisely because ATP has 'more bonds and fewer equities in comparison. Another difference in comparison with market rate products is that ATP has greater exposure to",

The strategic choices reflect ATP's role in the Danish pension system and ATP's pension product, which differs from the labour market pensions primarily because ATP has fixed liabilities in the form of the guaranteed pensions.\n\nATP's return from the Investment portfolio in 2023 was DKK 5.7bn, and the most positive contributions came from investments in bonds and equities in the liquid portfolio and, to a lesser extent, from the illiquid portfolio. The differences in returns are due to market development where illiquid or unlisted assets had a somewhat more difficult environment than liquid markets in 2023. ATP's balanced investment approach includes a large share of illiquid assets, which was not optimal in 2023. ATP also has some exposure to inflation-related instruments, which impacted negatively on returns.\n\nATP owns many Danish equities and is also seeking to diversify its exposure to global equities, including US equities. Both these factors have contributed to reducing the return on the Liquid Equity portfolio. This is because Danish equities did not perform as well as global equities in 2023. In addition, a few large companies in the US technology and IT sector drove the return on global equities. Due to the risk diversification, ATP's equity portfolio did not have large exposure to these specific companies. In 2023, ATP's Danish equity portfolio delivered a return in line with the KAX Cap index.\n\nUnlisted returns were generally sluggish in 2023, but generated positive returns from an overall perspective. In particular, write-downs on real estate and infrastructure investments dragged down returns, while private equity - which has otherwise been a strong asset class in recent years - delivered only a slightly positive return.\n\n## DKK 38\n\nin administration activity expense per member.\n\nWhen considering ATP's returns, it is also important to note that ATP invests on the basis of risk capacity and how the individual investment portfolios interact with each other in order to utilise the available capacity. Many years of low interest rates have made it advantageous to borrow available liquidity internally to increase risk in the Investment portfolio, but with the current higher interest rates it has become less advantageous, which affected the result for 2023. Return expectations and financing costs are continuously included in the trade-offs when determining the strategic and tactical risk level in the Investment portfolio.\n\nIt is also an important factor for the return that ATP has accumulated a significant tax asset in the form of deferred pension yield tax after the large negative result in 2022. In the years with positive returns up to 2022, ATP paid significant amounts of pension yield tax to the Danish state, while in the case of negative returns, it is not the practice to pay a tax receivable to investors. The receivable thus appears as a deferred asset on ATP's balance sheet, amounting to almost DKK 50bn at the start of 2023. At the end of 2023, ATP had an asset of DKK 41bn that is tied up and thus does not contribute a return.\n\n## Result for ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension)\n\nThe result of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is composed of the result of Hedging, Investment and insurance service.\n\n## Hedging\n\nHedging includes three portfolios: Interest Hedging, Supplementary Hedging and Life Annuity with Market Exposure.\n\n## The return on investment in the Investment portfolio in 2023 was DKK 5.7bn:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Government and mortgage bonds DKK +4.9bn   | Private equity DKK +2.7bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Listed Danish equities  DKK +1.1bn         | Credit  DKK +2.8bn          |\n| Listed international equities  DKK +3.4bn  | Infrastructure DKK +0.4bn   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details of the return on investment in the Investment portfolio, see note 1 on page 64.\n\n## Interest hedging\n\nThe purpose of interest hedging is to safeguard the guaranteed lifelong pensions in such a way that the market value of the Interest Hedging portfolio after tax is expected to fluctuate at the same rate and to the same extent as the guaranteed pensions when interest rates change. The value of the guaranteed pensions increased by DKK 33.3bn during the year as a result of interest rate changes and maturity shortening. Conversely, the Interest Hedging portfolio generated a return after tax of DKK 35.6bn. The total result of interest hedging thus amounted to DKK 2.3bn, representing less than one per cent of the value of the guaranteed pensions, and the interest hedging thus worked as intended.\n\nThe result of the interest hedging does not typically amount to zero, which is due to the fact that ATP's liabilities cannot be hedged exactly in the financial markets. For example, ATP has some very long liabilities which must be covered with shorter maturity bonds as there are no bonds with such a long maturity. This is why the hedging cannot be completely accurate. This effect, together with the portfolio of green bonds, is the primary reason why the result from interest hedging was DKK 2.3bn. Conversely, the tied-up funds in ATP's tax asset impacted negatively on the result.\n\n## Supplementary hedging\n\nDuring the last quarter of 2023, the phasing in of\n\nmarket risk in the Supplementary Hedging portfolio began as part of the overall hedging strategy. During this short period, the portfolio generated a return of DKK 0.7bn. Over time, the return from the Supplementary Hedging portfolio is expected to form the basis for transfers to the bonus potential and thus, in the long term, contribute to increasing the real value of lifelong pensions. The portfolio is still being developed and will need to take on long-term risk. Therefore, the Supplementary Hedging portfolio has a relatively higher degree of exposure to illiquid assets.\n\nLife annuity with market exposure For members with more than 15 years to go until reaching retirement age, 20 per cent of contributions will be allocated to Life annuity with market exposure. These life annuities are not guaranteed a return, but receive the return obtained in the associated market return portfolio. The return on these life annuities is not guaranteed, but on the other hand, there is the opportunity to take more risk than in the Interest Hedging portfolio. Over time, the portfolio is expected to contribute a higher return and thus generate higher pensions for members. In 2023, the market return portfolio generated a positive return of DKK 0.2bn, corresponding to a time-weighted return of 9.1 per cent compared to the provision for Life annuity with market exposure.\n\nThe provision for Life annuity with market exposure amounted to DKK 3.2bn at the end of 2023.",

        "page_content": "/\n\nAccumulated return in the Investment Portfolio and annual percentage return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment\n\nATP paid out DKK 18.4bn in pension benefits for the year.\n\nIn the Investment portfolio, the return for the year was characterised by changes in interest rates, rising equity prices and high inflation. Overall, this meant that the Investment portfolio yielded a positive return of DKK 5.7bn, which, after expenses, corresponds to 5.5 per cent in relation to the bonus potential. Over the year, the largest positive returns came from investments in government and mortgage bonds and secondarily from equities, both listed and unlisted. The largest negative returns came from the portfolio of inflation-related instruments and real estate investments.\n\nATP has delivered solid returns over a number of years. Over the past ten years, ATP has generated an average annual return on investment of DKK 12.2bn.\n\n## Result of insurance service\n\nATP's members are entitled to a lifelong pension by paying contributions. There is a clear correlation between the individual contributions made and the entitlement to payments. Historically, the average recognised interest rate in the guaranteed pensions is 3.1 per cent.\n\nATP's members contributed DKK 12.6bn in 2023. Contributions are recognised as income as pensions are paid and expenses are incurred.\n\nThe result of insurance service will always be 0 at ATP, since ATP derives no profit from managing members' funds.\n\n## Low expenses\n\nIn order to create a sustainable balance between quality, risk and expenses, ATP applies a balanced approach to cost efficiency. The level of expenses has a direct impact on future pensions, and over time even small differences can have a significant impact over a long period of savings. ATP's administration activity expenses in 2023 were DKK 214 million, equal to DKK 38 per member. This is at a similar level to last year.\n\nATP's total expenses for investment and hedging amounted to DKK 1,940 million, including indirect expenses. The total investment expenses amount to DKK 349 per member, which is similar to last year. Total annual administrative and investment expenses as a percentage of assets (APR) for 2023 were 0.30 per cent. This is a low expense level in both a Danish and an international context.\n\n## Events after the reporting date\n\nFrom the reporting date until the date of the presentation of this Annual Report, no events have occurred that would materially affect the assessment of the Annual Report.\n\n49\n\n## Value creation, total\n\n## 3.4%\n\nValue creation from pensions 3.1%\n\n## Value creation from undistributed funds 4.7%\n\nGuaranteed pensions 3.1%\n\nLife annuity with market exposure 9.2%\n\nThe bonus potential 5.8%\n\nLong-term supplementary provision 1.7%\n\nBesides the value that the interest on the contributed funds creates for individual members, the lifelong pension guarantee is valuable in itself for the individual members, who can take comfort in the fact that they are guaranteed some kind of income throughout their retirement.\n\n## Total value creation\n\nThe total value creation in ATP's pension product was 3.4 per cent in 2023. This is composed of value creation in pensions and in undistributed funds, where pensions are by far the largest part of the assets.\n\nOver time, the composition of ATP's total value creation will illustrate the interest rate level over time and how much risk is taken and managed in the individual portfolios in order to achieve the best possible value in the overall product for members. The interest rate level is of great importance in generating returns for the guaranteed pensions, and the utilisation of risk capacity has an impact on the possibility of increasing pensions in the long term. This balancing of expected returns against the risk of losses is central to ATP's business model, so the risk in the overall pension product is still low.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn order to ensure the assumed interest on pensions, ATP invests a large proportion of its total funds in assets that are very reliable in terms of the future benefit payments - the Interest Hedging portfolio. The pension includes a return on contributions and hedging, so the pension payments can be expected to exceed the contributions. The value creation from the pensions illustrates the average interest on all\n\nmembers' pensions. For the guaranteed pensions, value creation was 3.1 per cent in 2023, which reflects the return that ATP has promised members on average over time.\n\nFor life annuity with market exposure, the value creation was 9.2 per cent, which is an expression of the realised returns for the period.\n\n## Undistributed funds\n\nATP's undistributed funds comprise the bonus potential and the long-term supplementary provision. To increase the real value of the guaranteed pensions, ATP invests the bonus potential in a riskier portfolio, the Investment portfolio. The funds belonging to the bonus potential are invested so that an appropriate balance is maintained between having the opportunity to add bonuses to the pensions and limiting the risk of the bonus potential being lost due to negative returns. Value creation in the bonus potential was 5.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nAs little risk has yet been taken in the Supplementary Hedging portfolio still under development, value creation in the long-term supplementary provision was 1.7 per cent in 2023.",

        "page_content": "/\n\n## Outlook for 2024\n\n## Expected results\n\nThe basic principle for ATP's investment approach is that members must have a very high degree of security for lifelong pensions and there must be the opportunity to increase the real value of the retirement benefits over time.\n\nThe long-term profit expectation, which represents 11 per cent of the bonus potential, also applies to 2024. The expectation can be viewed as a guideline for how ATP expects to perform in an average year and is calculated based on expectations for returns relative to the risk profile that has been chosen. There is still a great deal of uncertainty in the finan -cial markets and about the direction of the world economy, and it is therefore difficult to predict the return in any individual year. If, for example, interest rates rise and equity markets fall in 2024, it cannot be ruled out that ATP will realise losses.\n\nOptimising ATP's business model ensures that we can balance risk in the short and long term. As the Investment portfolio has an interest rate element,\n\nlarge interest rate changes will not significantly affect the bonus capacity. It is important for ATP's finances to remain robust, as ATP delivers a collective product with guaranteed lifelong pensions.\n\nIn 2024, ATP will therefore continue to maintain its disciplined approach to risk management in order to generate the best possible returns, while ensuring that ATP is always capable of meeting its guarantees to its members.\n\nWhen performing the annual calculation of how much guaranteed pension members get for their ATP contributions, the current nominal bond interest rate is recognised. Members will receive more in pension from their contributions when the interest rate is high and less when the interest rate is low. The rising interest rates in recent years thus benefit members by providing them with a higher ATP pension from their contributions. For members' contributions for 2024, the recognised interest rate will be 3.2 per cent. The interest rate will typically exceed the expected inflation rate so that members' contribu -tions are already increased in terms of real value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assets and a robust bonus capacity\n\nHow ATP's bonus capacity has developed The bonus capacity remains similar to the past few years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt the end of 2023, the bonus potential - which is ATP's reserves - was DKK 104.0bn, the total pension liabilities amounted to DKK 569.0bn, and the supplementary provision was 39.2bn. Total assets amounted to DKK 712.2bn and ATP's finances remain robust. Our business model is designed to ensure that we can withstand losses, and our investment strategy has meant that we have achieved significant returns up to 2022. The robustness can also be seen in our bonus capacity 1 , which expresses ATP's ability to give bonuses to members. The bonus ability shows the relationship between the bonus potential - ATP's reserves - and the value of ATP's liabilities to its members.\n\n1 The bonus capacity is the relationship between ATP's bonus potential and ATP's pension liabilities calculated without illiquidity spreads, where the illiquidity spread is a supplement to the yield curve that expresses the illiquidity of the guarantees.\n\nAfter a bonus attribution of 3 per cent to pensioners at the end of 2023, the bonus capacity will remain at 17.1 per cent at the end of 2023, which is in line with the average over the past 10 years. The bonus capacity provides a good illustration of how healthy ATP is as it expresses how many additional funds ATP has in relation to ATP's liabilities towards its members. The bonus potential funds will - besides having to cover ATP's risk taking and unforeseen expenses - be able to be used in the long term to increase ATP pensions. Even though the value of ATP's pension liabilities has fluctuated steeply over the past year, ATP's bonus capacity has remained quite stable. ATP's ability to increase pensions in the future - the bonus capacity - is thus not notably impacted by the major fluctuations in interest rates seen over the past year. Bonds are heavily weighted in ATP's balanced investment portfolio, and ATP's returns were therefore hit especially hard by the steep interest rate hikes. The advantage of this strategy is that, in addition to the expected long-term yield, it also stabilises the bonus capacity.\n\n51",

All returns, financial income and expenses are shown under one item and this does not allow for the presentation of individual business areas. In the summary of key figures, ATP has broken down the results by business area and shown how the individual returns are transferred to the relevant provision under the members' assets.\n\nThe relationship between the statement of comprehensive income in the financial statements and the business areas in the summary of key figures is illustrated above.\n\nThe following pages elaborate on the performance of the individual business areas in 2023.\n\n## 2022\n\nLife annuity\n\n|                                                            | with market   | Interest   | Supplementary  Hedging activi-   | Supplementary  Hedging activi-   |             | Transfer to bo-   | ATP Group,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| DKK million                                                | exposure      | hedging    | Hedging portfolio                | ties, total                      | Investment  | nus potential     | total        |\n| Insurance income                                           | 1             | 18,464     | 49                               | 18,514                           | 714         | -                 | 19,227       |\n| Expenses for insurance ser- vice                           | (1)           | (18,464)   | (49)                             | (18,514)                         | (714)       | -                 | (19,227)     |\n| Result of insurance service                                | -             | -          | -                                | -                                | -           | -                 | -            |\n| Investment return                                          | (87)          | (244,827)  | -                                | (244,914)                        | ( 6 4, 511) | -                 | (309,425)    |\n| Change to calculation interest                             | -             | 222,190    | -                                | 222,190                          | -           | -                 | 222,190      |\n| Maturity reduction                                         | -             | (9,892)    | -                                | (9,892)                          | -           | -                 | (9,892)      |\n| Interest on life annuity with  market exposure             | 73            | -          | -                                | 73                               | -           | -                 | 73           |\n| Interest on undistributed funds                            | -             | -          | -                                | -                                | -           | 50,175            | 50,175       |\n| Financial items, net                                       | (14)          | (32,529)   | -                                | (32,543)                         | (64,511)    | 50,175            | (46,878)     |\n| Tax on pension savings re- turns and corporate income  tax | 13            | 37,459     | -                                | 37,472                           | 9,406       | -                 | 46,878       |",

The guarantee contribution is used to accrue pension entitlements. The remaining 20 per cent are funds that are invested to increase members' pensions with bonuses and protect against unforeseen expenses. The guarantee contribution is guaranteed for the expected lifetime. From 2022, the guarantee contribution is split into two parts for members who have more than 15 years to go before reaching retirement age. 75 per cent of the guarantee contribution (corresponding to 60 per cent of the total deposit) is invested with low risk (the interest contribution) and 25 per cent (the market contribution, corresponding to 20 per cent of the total deposit) is invested with a higher risk to achieve a higher return. From when the member has 15 years to go until reaching the retirement age, the pension earned with market contributions is gradually invested at low risk until retirement age is reached, and the remaining 20 per cent is invested with the goal of generating returns to increase pensions.\n\nATP's investments reflect the design of the pension product and are divided into Hedging and Investment, respectively.\n\n## Hedging\n\nHedging includes three portfolios: Interest Hedging, Supplementary Hedging and Life Annuity with Market Exposure.\n\n## Interest hedging\n\nThe purpose of interest hedging is to hedge the guaranteed lifelong pensions, meaning that the market value of the Interest Hedging portfolio after tax is expected to fluctuate at the same rate and to the same extent as the guaranteed benefits when interest rates change. The value of the guaranteed pensions increased by DKK 33.3bn during the year as a result of interest rate changes and maturity shortening. Correspondingly, the Interest Hedging portfolio generated a return after tax of DKK 35.6bn. The total result from interest hedging was thus DKK 2.3bn, which represented less than one per cent of the value of the guaranteed benefits and the interest hedging thus worked as intended.\n\nThe result of the interest hedging does not typically amount to zero, which is due to the fact that ATP's liabilities cannot be hedged exactly in the financial markets. For example, ATP has some very long liabilities which must be covered with shorter maturity bonds as there are no bonds with such a long maturity. This is why the hedging cannot be completely accurate. This effect, together with the portfolio of green bonds, has been the primary reason for the profit from interest hedging of\n\n## Hedging of the guaranteed benefits 2019-2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Return on the Interest hedging portfolio (left axis)\n- Change due to interest and maturity reduction (right axis)\n\nGuaranteed benefits are recognised as the sum of the expected future cash flows plus the discount rate effect and a risk adjustment to account for non-fi -nancial risks. The change in the guaranteed benefits attributable to the change in the discount rate and maturity shortening is recognised in the result of hedging. Other changes in guaranteed benefits are\n\nDKK 2.3bn. Conversely, the tied-up funds in ATP's tax assets, among other things, negatively impacted the result.\n\n## Supplementary hedging\n\nDuring the last quarter of 2023, the phasing in of market risk in the Supplementary Hedging portfolio began as part of the overall hedging strategy. During this short period, the portfolio generated a return of DKK 0.7bn. Over time, the return from the Supplementary Hedging portfolio is expected to form the basis for transfers to the bonus potential and thus, in the long term, contribute to increasing the real value of lifelong pensions. The portfolio is still being developed and will need to take on long-term risk. Therefore, the Supplementary Hedging portfolio has a relatively higher degree of exposure to illiquid assets.\n\nrecognised directly in the balance sheet.\n\nFinancial assets in the Hedging portfolio are also recognised and measured at fair value and value adjustments are recognised under 'Result from interest hedging'.\n\n## Life annuity with market exposure\n\nFor members with more than 15 years to go until reaching retirement age, 20 per cent of the contributions are allocated to Life annuity with market exposure. These life annuities are managed in the associated market return portfolio. The return on these life annuities is not guaranteed, but on the other hand, there is the opportunity to take more risk than in the Interest Hedging portfolio. Over time, the portfolio is expected to contribute a higher return and thus generate higher pensions for members. In 2023, the market return portfolio generated a positive return of DKK 0.2bn, corresponding to a time-weighted return of 9.1 per cent compared to the provision for Life annuity with market exposure.\n\nThe provision for Life annuity with market exposure amounted to DKK 3.2bn at the end of 2023.\n\n## Return on investment 2023 for the Investment portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Note 1: Business area financial statements, continued\n\n## Investment\n\nIn the Investment portfolio, the return for the year was characterised by changes in interest rates, rising equity prices and high inflation. Overall, this meant that the Investment portfolio yielded a positive return of DKK 5.7bn, which, after expenses, corresponds to 5.5 per cent in relation to the bonus potential. Over the year, the largest positive returns came from investments in government and mortgage bonds and secondarily from equities, both listed and unlisted. The largest negative returns came from the portfolio of inflation-related instruments and real estate investments.\n\nThe portfolio of government and mortgage bonds, which also includes exposure via derivatives, generated a return of DKK 4.9bn, which is due to falling interest rates on European and US bonds, mainly in the last part of the year.\n\nListed international equities generated returns of DKK 3.4bn, spread broadly across the portfolio.\n\nThe private equity portfolio comprises, among other things, ATP Private Equity Partners which mainly invests in capital funds abroad and other private equity investments. The total private equity portfolio generated returns of DKK 2.7bn.\n\nInvestments in credit generated positive returns of DKK 2.8bn. These investments consist partly of bonds issued by companies with low credit ratings or developing countries and partly of financial instruments. Additionally, there are loans to credit institutions and funds that, among other things, invest in bank loans and corporate loans.\n\nInflation-related instruments, consisting of commodi -ties-related financial contracts, index-linked bonds and inflation swaps generated a return of DKK (2.3)bn.\n\nInvestments in real estate generated returns of DKK (-2.2)bn. The negative return is mainly due to the recognition of higher return requirements for properties.\n\nThe return from other items was DKK (5.1)bn. This item primarily comprises interest payments from the Investment portfolio to the Interest Hedging portfolio for borrowing liquidity - called funding. As the Interest Hedging portfolio includes interest rate swaps in addition to bonds, which do not tie up liquidity, the funds that are not tied up can be lent to the Investment portfolio in return for the payment of interest. Interest rates have been low for many years, but in 2023 they made up a significant part of the return on the Investment portfolio.\n\nListed Danish equities generated returns of DKK 1.1bn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## in investment returns in relation to the bonus potential\n\nATP and the ATP Group recognise and measure all investment assets at fair value with value adjustment in the income statement. ATP manages on the basis of asset properties rather than the legal structure of the asset. A division of the investment return based on accounts category and measuring method can be seen in Note 19.\n\nThe Investment portfolio invests based on the bonus potential. In addition, funds not tied up in the Hedging portfolio as a result of the use of derivative financial instruments are available for investment in the Investment portfolio on market terms.

Distribution of expenses is intended to ensure that there is no cross-subsidisation between the different areas.\n\nInvestment expenses for the Group totalled DKK 703 million. This is a decrease on last year of DKK 119 million, corresponding to 14 per cent. This decrease is primarily due to lower trading costs as a result of a smaller investment portfolio that needs to be rebalanced.\n\nTo this is added the indirect investment expenses and indirect performance fees which are deducted from ATP's investment return in private equity investments. In the calculation of annual expenses in per cent, which is disclosed in the chapter 'Result for the year and expectations for 2024' in the Management's review, indirect investment expenses and performance fees are included.\n\nPension expenses, which include administration activity expenses for the management of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) amounted to DKK 214 million in 2023, which is in line with 2022. Expenses related to Pensions represent 0.03 per cent relative to the total assets. The ability to keep pension expenses low is due to a high degree of automation and digitalisation when contacting members and a stable IT support system.\n\nThe Group's administration activity expenses for external parties are incurred in connection with tasks for the social partners, the state and the municipalities and are distributed among the following clients:\n\n| DKK million                          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Udbetaling Danmark - Public Benefits | 1,560  | 1,621  |\n| Administration                       |        |        |\n| Pension and Labour Market            | 864    | 870    |\n| Senior pension                       | 58     | 57     |\n| Other                                | 2      | 21     |\n| Total                                | 2,485  | 2,569  |\n\nThese tasks are assigned to ATP on a cost-recovery basis - i.e. without profit to ATP or without any risk of expense. In 2023, expenses of DKK 2.5bn were incurred in relation to business processing for external parties, and these expenses are off-set by similar income.\n\nThe decrease in administration activity expenses from 2022 to 2023 reflects, among other things, lower expenses for the implementation of customer agreements, the realisation of efficiency improvements through automation and the use of new technology and the fact that in 2022 an immediate write-off was made related to the development of a new student debt solution under 'Statslige Finansielle Ordninger' in Udbetaling Danmark.\n\nIn 2023, ATP was once again able to keep its administration activity expenses low, as ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is a collective scheme and a relatively simple product.\n\n|                                                              | Group   | Group   | ATP   | ATP   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|\n| DKK million                                                  | 2023    | 2022    | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Investment activity expenses and hedging                     | 703     | 822     | 504   | 621   |\n| Pension activity expenses                                    | 214     | 215     | 214   | 215   |\n| Business processing expenses, external parties               | 2,485   | 2,569   | 2,492 | 2,576 |\n| Total expenses                                               | 3,401   | 3,606   | 3,210 | 3,411 |\n| The aforementioned expenses include staff expenses totalling |         |         |       |       |\n| Remuneration                                                 | 1,623   | 1,611   | 1,520 | 1,504 |\n| Pension contributions                                        | 275     | 271     | 257   | 253   |\n| Other social security expenses                               | 25      | 25      | 24    | 24    |\n| Total staff expenses                                         | 1,923   | 1,907   | 1,801 | 1,781 |\n| Average number of full-time staff                            | 2,860   | 2,901   | 2,736 | 2,769 |\n\nManagement remuneration details can be seen in Note 24.\n\nIn 2023, ATP and the ATP Group's employees in Denmark were distributed across locations in Vordingborg, Holstebro, Haderslev, Aller\u00f8d, Frederikshavn, Aarhus, Copenhagen and the head office in Hiller\u00f8d.

        "page_content": "ATP pays Danish tax on pension savings returns, no matter where in the world the returns are generated. The Danish tax on pension savings returns was DKK 7.6bn in 2023. Tax on pension savings returns for the year is offset against negative pension yield taxes carried forward from previous years. Tax on pension savings returns for 2023 therefore does not result in a payable Danish tax, but rather in a reduction of ATP's tax asset. For the same reason, the amount is not shown in the figure below, which only shows the actual taxes paid/ payable for 2023.\n\nAfter offsetting the year's pension yield taxes against negative pension yield taxes from previous years, the negative pension yield tax carried forward amounts to DKK 41bn. ATP is taxed in Denmark according to the rules of the Danish Pension Returns Tax Act. The tax on pension savings returns is calculated on the basis of ATP's total return on assets. The tax rate is 15.3 per cent. The taxation basis is calculated on the accrual basis, and therefore includes both realised and non-realised returns, but exclusive of deductible interest and asset management expenses.\n\nThe calculated tax on pension savings returns is partially reduced by an amount equal to ATP's inter-\n\nnational tax payments, such that double taxation of ATP's returns is minimised. International tax primarily comprises pay-as-you-earn taxes on dividends and interest and tax on American commercial income, and is generated by ATP's investments in international listed equities and unlisted investments in, e.g., properties, infrastructure and capital funds.\n\nATP is tax exempt relative to the Danish Income Tax Act, but has subsidiaries which are independently liable for tax and which submit returns pursuant to the Corporation Tax Act. Moreover, as a result of its investment activities, ATP has tax return liabilities in Germany and the USA, and in accordance with legislation, ATP is also subject to tax in other countries.\n\nIn addition to tax on pension savings returns, payments to the Danish state also include corporation tax, VAT and labour market contributions paid on behalf of members of their ATP contribution payments and personal taxes withheld and paid on behalf of own employees. As a global investor, ATP also pays taxes in several places abroad.\n\nExcluding the year's tax on pension savings returns, ATP's tax contribution totalled DKK 9.2bn for 2023.\n\n## Tax contribution - incurred and withheld taxes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe overview above only includes tax on ATP's and the ATP Group's own activities and investments. Tax paid locally by Danish and international companies in which ATP and the ATP Group has invested is therefore not included.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                  | Group   | Group        | ATP    | ATP           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------|---------------|\n| DKK million                                                                                                                                                      | 2023    | 2022         | 2023   | 2022          |\n| Financial returns                                                                                                                                                | 48,769  | (309,425)    | 48,430 | (310,099)     |\n| Investment activity expenses and hedging                                                                                                                         | (703)   | (822)        | (504)  | (621)         |\n| Total returns subject to pension yield taxes                                                                                                                     | 48,065  | (310,247)    | 47,925 | (310,720)     |\n| Of which 15.3 per cent                                                                                                                                           | 7,354   | ( 47, 4 4 2) | 7,333  | ( 47, 5 4 0 ) |\n| Tax effect of different methods of calculating accounting and tax returns on trans- parent entities etc.                                                         | 249     | 119          | 136    | (123)         |\n| Tax effect of reduction under section 10 of the Danish Pension Savings Returns Tax  Act (reduction regarding life and pension insurance policies, year-end 1982) | (58)    | 402          | (58)   | 402           |\n| Tax on pension savings returns for the year                                                                                                                      | 7,545   | (46,921)     | 7,411  | ( 47, 2 6 2)  |\n| Prior year adjustments                                                                                                                                           | 101     | (89)         | 101    | (89)          |\n| Total tax on pension savings returns                                                                                                                             | 7,646   | (47,010)     | 7,512  | (47,351)      |\n| Tax on pension savings returns                                                                                                                                   | 7,646   | (47,010)     | 7, 512 | (47,351)      |\n| Corporate income tax related to other financial income                                                                                                           | 0       | (14)         | 0      | 0             |\n| Corporate income tax                                                                                                                                             | 6       | 145          | 0      | 0             |\n| Total pension yield and corporation tax                                                                                                                          | 7,652   | (46,878)     | 7,512  | (47,351)      |",

In addition to equities and bonds, the market value of the investment portfolio also includes financial instru -ments such as interest rate swaps and equity futures that do not tie up liquidity. For financial instruments, the market value is typically low, zero or even negative. Thus, the risk in the portfolio can increase and the return on the portfolio can be positive, while the market value decreases if more financial instruments are included in the portfolio.\n\nSecondly, for management reasons, ATP has divided the majority of assets into the hedging and investment portfolios. As a general rule, the investment portfolio comprises funds from the bonus potential. In the hedging portfolio, pension liabilities are hedged partly by purchasing bonds and partly by using financial instruments. The hedging provided by financial instruments does not tie up liquidity, and the available liquidity will be available to the investment portfolio at market conditions. In practice, this means that by borrowing available liquidity - leverage the investment portfolio can operate with more funds than the bonus potential.\n\nThe investment portfolio thus invests on behalf of the bonus potential. The ongoing return of the investment portfolio is embedded in the bonus potential, i.e. a positive return will, all other things being equal, mean that the portfolio has more funds to invest. In addition to the bonus potential, the portfolio also invests funds borrowed by hedging, which ensures, for example, that the portfolio can achieve the desired risk level. Thus, the market value of the portfolio's total assets comprises: bonus potential, accumulated results and internal loans.\n\nThis means that the size of the market value depends on the size of these components and the changes to them. Changes in market value therefore cannot be explained by portfolio returns alone, and the size of the portfolio varies greatly depending on the desired level of risk and its implementation.\n\n## Risk allocation in the investment portfolio in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo maintain a robust investment portfolio with a stable return and the greatest possible independence from cyclical variations, investment decisions are informed by a strategy of risk diversification. ATP splits the risk of each individual investment into four risk factors which can be combined in various ways to achieve an investment portfolio with the desired risk profile. The four risk factors are: 'Equity factor', 'Interest rate factor', 'Inflation factor' and 'Other factors'.\n\n## Note 9: Listed equities\n\n| ATP Group

Investments in associates and joint ventures are often structured as a combination of share equity investment and loans. Where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where the company has no significant debt financing, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical to the risk of the equity investment. Such loans are presented as an integral\n\nIn 2023, ATP acquired 50 per cent of Danske Bank's new headquarters in Postbyen, Copenhagen, in a partnership with Danica Ejendomme.\n\npart of the investment in the associate or joint venture - both in internal management reporting and in external reporting.

If the reporting date is different from the Group's statement of financial position date, adjustment is made for significant changes in the market's observ -able inputs and the quoted prices of underlying assets.\n\nThe calculation above shows sensitivities in case of changes to significant input parameters for the Group. The parent company ATP has in -vested in equity in group subsidiaries, which consists primarily of investment entities that measure all material assets and liabilities at fair value using the methods described in notes 9-12 and note 14. Since all material assets and liabilities in the Group subsidiaries are recognised at fair value, the fair value of group subsidiaries is equivalent to ATP's share of the reported Net Asset Value.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nSignificant accounting estimates are associated primarily with the measurement of private equity invest -ments when the valuation is based on unobservable inputs.\n\nEstimates are applied when selecting the valuation model and assessment of the most important unobservable input parameters, including multiples and discounting factors.\n\nThe majority of the Group's private equity investments have been valued on the basis of reported fair value. In case of reported fair value, the management assesses whether the valuation methods and inputs applied by the external managers are relevant, but also whether adjustments are to be made to the reported fair value due to events after the reporting period.",

Green bonds are characterised by the issuer of the bond using the loan to finance climate-friendly investments. A climate-friendly investment might be an investment in e.g. increased energy efficiency, hydropower and wind turbines.\n\nLoans consist of loans to credit institutions and funds which invest in bank loans, property related loans and corporate loans, and are included in the investment portfolio.\n\nThe loans issued at the end of 2023 decreased by DKK 0.8bn compared to the start of the year. This decrease is mainly attributable to corporate lending activities.\n\n## Green bonds\n\nATP has ESG requirements for green bonds, and we have therefore developed our own standards and requirements for issuers which exceed the 'Green Bond Principles' recommendations.

The ATP Group uses external estate agents and their valuation of the\n\nmarket level to determine the required rate of return and the market rent. The determination of operating income is affected by estimates to a lesser extent, the determination of vacancy rent being the most significant one.",

Together with the investments in forests, which are classified as shares in unlisted companies, cf. note 10, ATP has invested in forest areas totalling 263 thousand hectares - which is the size of almost 40 per cent of Denmark's total forested areas.\n\nThe forestry operations are handled by external managers specialising in forestry and the returns mainly consist of value adjustments due to growth and, to a lesser extent, income from harvesting lumber. In some forest areas, ATP has certified CO 2 quotas that are sold off on an ongoing basis. At the end of 2023, the remaining CO 2 quotas were included with a market value of DKK 32 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                              | Group   | Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| DKK million                                                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Income from forestry investment properties                   | 396     | 414     |\n| Annual value adjustments for forestry investment properties  | 460     | 379     |\n| Operating expenses concerning forestry investment properties | (313)   | (326)   |\n| Total income from forestry investment properties             | 543     | 467     |\n\nThe Group's forestry investment properties are valued mainly on the basis of discounting future cash flow.

The contributions allocated to Life annuity with market exposure are invested with a higher risk profile than the interest contribution, and the pension that is accrued depends on the returns that can be achieved. When there are less than 15 years to go until retirement, the\n\nsavings are gradually converted to a fully guaranteed lifelong pension.\n\nAssets and liabilities associated with life annuity with market exposure are placed in a separate market portfolio. The investment assets in the market return portfolio are presented as one on the statement of financial position while other items are not separated.\n\n|                                                                     | ATP Group   | ATP Group   | ATP   | ATP    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|\n| DKK million                                                         | 2023        | 2022        | 2023  | 2022   |\n| Investment assets                                                   |             |             |       |        |\n| Cash and on-demand deposits                                         | 40          | 61          | 21    | 61     |\n| Bonds                                                               | 1,067       | 549         | 1,015 | 538    |\n| Listed equities                                                     | 923         | 165         | 882   | 153    |\n| Unlisted equity investments                                         | 695         | 614         | 462   | 424    |\n| Financial derivatives                                               | 423         | 878         | 414   | 861    |\n| Loans                                                               | 22          | 41          | 16    | 14     |\n| Investments in group subsidiaries                                   | -           | -           | 498   | 401    |\n| Investment properties                                               | 150         | 144         | -     |        |\n| Investment assets associated with life annuity with market exposure | 3,321       | 2,452       | 3,307 | 2,452  |\n| Other items                                                         |             |             |       |        |\n| Other assets                                                        | 264         | 115         | 260   | 115    |\n| Deferred tax on pension savings returns                             | (18)        | 13          | (18)  | 13     |\n| Financial derivatives                                               | (333)       | (687)       | (329) | (687)  |\n| Other debts                                                         | (36)        | ( 511)      | (23)  | ( 511) |\n| Provisions for Life annuity with market exposure                    | 3,198       | 1,382       | 3,198 | 1,382  |\n\n-",

various financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps, stock index futures, inflation swaps and forward exchange contracts as part of its risk management and hedging and investment strategy. Using financial derivatives makes it possible to increase or reduce the exposure to market risks, currency and interest risks.\n\nThe most commonly used financial derivatives are interest rate swaps in DKK and EUR, which are primarily used to hedge interest rate sensitivity related to guaranteed benefits, while forward contracts are used to hedge currency risks related to foreign currency investments. The Investment portfolio uses stock index\n\nfutures and equity-indexed options to achieve exposure to various stock indices, while sold Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are used to obtain credit exposure.\n\nA characteristic of financial derivatives is that their value depends on developments in the value of an underlying instrument, index, etc. As the values change, security is provided to or from the counterparties. An increasing proportion of interest rate swaps, inflation swaps and CDSs are settled via central clearing houses.\n\n## Interest rate swaps help to hedge the pension liabilities.\n\n## ATP Group\n\n|

The market price may be in the form of a quoted price or price quotation.\n\nLevel 2 - observable inputs: If a financial instrument is listed on a non-active market, the valuation is based on the most recent transaction price. Adjustments are made for subsequent changes in market conditions. For some financial assets and liabilities, no actual market exists. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is made using an estimated value based on recent transactions in similar instruments. For financial derivatives, valuation techniques based on market conditions, e.g. yield curves and exchange rates, are widely used.\n\nFor assets and liabilities measured at fair value using unobservable input data (level 3), the movements for the year are as follows:\n\n| ATP Group                                                                   | Bonds        | Bonds   | Unlisted equity  investments   | Unlisted equity  investments   | Financial  derivatives   | Financial  derivatives   | Loans       | Loans       | Investment  properties   | Investment  properties   | Total                  | Total                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| DKK million                                                                 | 2023         | 2022    | 2023                           | 2022                           | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023        | 2022        | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023                   | 2022                     |\n| Statement of financial position as  of 1 January                            | 15,865       | 17,263  | 107,838                        | 115,465                        | 39                       | -

Unobservable inputs: The valuation of certain financial assets and liabilities is based substantially on unobservable inputs. For a significant portion of the Group's equity investments and a small portion of the Group's bond portfolio, the valuation is based on unobservable inputs. Note 29 describes the individual valuation methods used to determine the fair value of these financial assets.\n\nThere were no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 in 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe move out of level 3 in 2023 mainly consists of an investment that during 2023 was merged with a listed company. Transfers to level 3 consist of shares that were previously valued at the 'purchase price for new transactions' (level 2) and which during 2023 are valued using a valuation method using unobservable inputs.\n\nLosses and gains related to level 3 are recognised in the income statement under the item 'Financial return'.",

The guaranteed benefits are the pensions that have been promised to ATP's members while the life annuity with market exposure is the pension that is invested with a higher risk profile and which is adjusted by the achieved returns. The Long-term supplementary provision is the difference between the guaranteed benefits calculated with and without il -liquidity spread, minus the risk adjustment and plus the return from the Supplementary Hedging portfolio. Risk adjustment for non-financial risks is a provision that takes into account the uncertainty in the calculation of future cash flows. The bonus potential is the reserve that can be used, for example, to cover improvements in life expectancy and for allocation of bonuses.\n\n| 2023                                                                                                      | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover   | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover   | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover   | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover   | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover   | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover        | Net liabilities concerning remaining cover   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| DKK million                                                                                               | Guaranteed  benefits 1                       | Life annuity  with market  exposure          | Long-term  supplementary  provision          | Bonus  potential                             | Risk  adjustment for  non-financial  risks   | Liabilities  concerning  the payment  of benefits | Total                                        |\n| Pension provisions, start of year                                                                         | 538,341                                      | 1,382                                        | 37,265                                       | 99,572                                       | 954                                          |                                                   | 293  677,806                                 |\n| Expected payments of pensions at  start of year                                                           | (18,562)                                     | -

The capital value is calculated with an interest rate of 0 per cent, as the pension entitlements are written up or down with the realised returns up to the balance sheet date. Contributions to life annuity with market exposure, called the market contribution, amounts to 20 per cent of members' contributions up until they have 15 years to go until retirement. After that, the accrued pension entitlements in life annuity with market exposure will gradually be converted to an ordinary life annuity and be part of ATP's guaranteed benefits.",

Interest is used for Danish and German government bonds and interest swaps in DKK and EUR. ATP's discount curve is specified with consideration for ATP's opportunities to hedge interest rate risks on the pension liabilities after pension yield tax appropriately. When calculating the book value of the guaranteed benefits, an illiquidity range is added to the curve. When calculating ATP's bonus capacity, the discount curve is used without an illiquidity range.\n\nWhen calculating the guaranteed benefits with EIOPA's discount rates, the yield curve as of the end of December 2023 is used, including the volatility adjustment published on EIOPA's homepage. The figure above shows ATP's discount curve with and without the illiquidity range as compared to EIOPA's discount curve including volatility adjustment.\n\nThe differences in the discount rate curves cause the differences in the calculated values of the guaranteed benefits. Thus, the value of the guaranteed benefits calculated with EIOPA's discount rates are lower than those calculated with ATP's discount curve without the range, but higher than when ATP uses the illiquidity range.\n\n## Bonus capacity\n\nThe bonus potential in relation to the value of ATP's total liabilities to its members is called the bonus capacity. Developing and maintaining the bonus capacity is very important for ATP's future ability to generate returns and thus deliver future bonuses. The bonus potential has increased by DKK 8.2bn in the last 10 years, corresponding to 8.6 per cent. In the same period, the bonus capacity has only increased from 15.7 per cent to 17.1 per cent, which is due to the pension liabilities being at the same level as 10 years ago.\n\n## Development in bonus capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe bonus potential and the Long-term supplementary provision constitute the reserves that have not been distributed to ATP's members. The bonus potential is calculated as the amount corresponding to the carrying amount of the total assets associated with ATP minus the guaranteed benefits, life annuity with market exposure, Long-term supplementary provision, risk adjustment for non-financial risks and the sum of the carrying amount of ATP's other liabilities. The Supervisory Board can decide on the distribution of bonuses from the reserves. The bonus allocation is transferred to the guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure as a direct balance sheet entry.\n\n## Bonus policy\n\nThe framework for ATP's bonus policy is defined in section 18(3) of the Danish Executive Order on ATP ('Bekendtg\u00f8relse af lov om Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension'), which stipulates that the aim is to pursue a long-term bonus policy to ensure that the real value of pensions is preserved. The annual\n\nbonus decision is made on the basis of an overall assessment of a number of factors based on the bonus capacity. The bonus capacity is defined as the bonus potential in relation to the sum of the guaranteed benefits calculated without illiquidity spread plus life annuity with market exposure.\n\nBased on an overall assessment of the robustness of ATP's finances, the Supervisory Board has decided to increase pensions by 3 per cent for all pensioners. This will take effect from 1 January 2024.\n\nRead more about ATP's pension product:\n\nwww.atp.dk/en/results-and-reports/annualand-interim-reports-atp-group/further-information-full-year-2023\n\n(see the section 'Facts about ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension)')\n\nFacts about ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) is not subject to audit\n\n| DKK million                                                                                              | 2023    | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Bonus potential that could be used to increase guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure | 0       | 18,278 |\n| Bonus potential that must be retained as unallocated bonus                                               | 104,030 | 81,294 |\n| Total                                                                                                    | 104,030 | 99,572 |",

The hedging of pensions is also described in the financial statements, while the interest accrued on the pensions is not highlighted directly. With a view to improving the description of the total value creation, ATP calculates some supplementary ratios.\n\nValue creation from pensions illustrates the average interest on the pensions ATP has promised its members over time across all age groups. The ratio is calculated on the basis of historical contributions and the associated pensions. For the guaranteed benefits, the value creation is 3.1 per cent for 2023. For life annuity with market exposure, the value creation of 9.2 per cent is an expression of an achieved return for the period and not an actual rate of interest. The value creation from pensions of 3.1 per cent is a weighted calculation of the value creation from, respectively, the guaranteed benefits and life annuity with market exposure.\n\nThe value creation for undistributed funds illustrates the interest on ATP's so-called undistributed funds, i.e. the bonus potential and the Long-term supplementary provision. The value creation in the bonus potential of 5.8 per cent is mainly driven by the investment return, but for example, it is also impacted by the result for hedging and expenses. As no risks have yet been taken in the Supplementary Hedging portfolio, the value\n\n|   2023 | 2022    | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n|    3.1 | 3.1     | 3.3    | 3.4    | 3.4    |\n|    9.2 | -       | -      | -      | -      |\n|    3.1 | 3.1     | 3.3    | 3.4    | 3.4    |\n|    5.8 | (38.7)  | 24.5   | 13.3   | 30.3   |\n|    1.7 | -       | -      | -      | -      |\n|    4.7 | (38.7)  | 24.5   | 13.3   | 30.3   |\n|    3.4 | ( 7. 2) | 8.5    | 5.5    | 8.0    |\n\ncreation of the Long-term supplemental provision is 1.7 per cent. The value creation from undistributed funds of 4.7 per cent is a weighted calculation of the value creation in, respectively, the bonus potential and the long-term supplementary provision.\n\nTotal value creation indicates ATP's ability to generate overall value creation. The ratio is a weighted calculation of value creation in, respectively, pensions and the undistributed funds.\n\nFor additional information on the definition of ATP's ratios for value creation, see supplementary information at www.atp.dk/resultater-rapporter/aars-og-kvartalsrapporter/atp-koncernen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note 18: Risk management\n\n## ATP's risk profile\n\nATP's risk profile is aligned with the purpose of securing the guaranteed lifelong payments, covering any unforeseen life expectancy increases for the pensions and other unforeseen expenses and enabling an increase in the real value of the pensions. This means that safe investments are prioritised in order to provide the promised lifelong guarantees, while also weighing the opportunities to generate reasonable returns against the risk of losing ATP's reserves. The overarching principle is that the total risk must be balanced in relation to ATP's reserves, bonus potential and Long-term supplementary provision. The risk profile for ATP is generally expressed based on a measure of the total risk with an ATP-developed risk model supplemented by several risk calculations and analyses. The purpose of these risk calculations is to provide a varied and detailed overview of the specific risks to which ATP is exposed. ATP's financial robustness is assessed by comparing the calculated risks with the bonus potential.\n\nIn order to protect ATP's bonus potential and financial capacity to take action, ATP's Supervisory Board has specified a risk budget that is an upper limit of how large the total risk consumption is permitted to be. The risk budget reflects the Supervisory Board's overall risk tolerance and is specified at 50 per cent of the bonus potential. Hence, the risk budget changes dynamically in line with the bonus potential.\n\nAt the end of 2023, ATP's bonus potential was DKK 104.0bn and thus the risk budget was DKK 52.0bn. ATP calculates a risk consumption daily. The risk consumption is measured using an ATP-developed risk model that calculates a total risk consumption based on the risks associated with ATP's business model.\n\nThe risk target for risk consumption is expected shortfall (ES) with a confidence level of 99 per cent and a three-month time horizon. Risk consumption is a here-and-now stress without risk adjustment and expresses the average of the 1 per cent biggest loss of bonus potential if a three-month stress event happens immediately.\n\n## Pension-related risks\n\nATP disburses a monthly pension for as long as the members are alive. Accordingly, increasing life expectancy (longevity risk) is the greatest pension risk facing ATP. When life expectancy increases more than predicted, the bonus potential is reduced, since ATP has to reserve a greater amount to cover the pension liabilities, as pensions have to be paid out for longer. ATP has elected not to hedge its life expectancy risk, and must therefore cover losses in case of increased life expectancy. ATP follows life expectancy statistics closely, based on an in-house developed life expectancy model.\n\nProvisions for longer than projected life expectancies reduce the bonus potential. However, contrary to, for instance, investment loss, it has not reduced the total asset value of the members. On the contrary, additional provisions as a result of longer life expectancy reflect that ATP's members are expected to live longer, and the provisions will therefore benefit ATP's members.\n\nOther Danish pension companies apply a model based on life expectancy assumptions developed by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority for the use of those insured via the life insurance and pension companies. The figure below shows life expectancy for 67-year-old men and women using ATP's and the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's model, respectively, for life expectancy presumptions, with the latter adjusted to the life expectancies observed by\n\n## Expected future increases in life expectancy\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "ATP. It can be seen that ATP's life expectancy model projects higher increases in life expectancy than those envisaged by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's model.\n\nThe Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's life expectancy projections are a benchmark for current observed life expectancy, based on information from a number of Danish life insurance companies and broad-spectrum pension funds with a total of 3.6 million customers as well as a benchmark for life expectancy improvements based on population data from all of Denmark. ATP's model is based partly on information concerning its 5.6 million members and partly on information concerning approximately 350 million inhabitants in 18 OECD countries. This means that different data are used when modelling life expectancy assumptions, just as the models themselves differ.\n\nThe model developed by ATP is based on the assumption that life expectancy in Denmark follows the same pattern as the 18 selected OECD nations and that the lag in Denmark relative to the selected countries will be caught up with over time. Data from the past 50 years show that the countries have generally undergone the same development in terms of longevity, although it differs between countries when and how quickly the improvements take place. ATP includes international data in order to provide a stable prognosis for future life expectancy improvements.\n\n## Market risks\n\nMarket risks reflect risks associated with investments in the financial markets and the interest rate risk on pension liabilities. Market risks are managed based on structured risk models with close risk monitoring and detailed risk frameworks.\n\nMarket risks in the Interest Hedging portfolio and the guaranteed benefits mainly comprise interest rate risks. The Hedging portfolio generally has the same interest rate sensitivity as the guaranteed benefits. A general interest rate change has a large impact on ATP's statement of financial position, but the bonus potential will be virtually unaffected as changes in the Interest Hedging portfolio and the value of the guaranteed benefits will largely offset each other. Market risks related to interest hedging are therefore limited.\n\nThe long-term market risk added via the Supplementary Hedging portfolio (SHP) in hedging has its own dedicated loss-absorbing buffer in the form of the Long-term supplementary provision (LSP). As long as the LSP is large enough to cover the market risk in the Supplementary Hedging portfolio, this added risk will not affect the risk consumption. In the event of major losses in the Supplementary Hedging portfolio, the LSP may at some point affect the bonus potential, as the bonus potential will have to transfer funds to the LSP. This risk is referred to as transfer risk and is recognised in the risk consumption. The contribution that goes to annuity with market exposure is invested in the market return portfolio in hedging. By investing this contribution with a higher risk, a higher return and thus a higher pension is expected over time. The risk in the market return portfolio is adjusted to the provisions for annuity with market exposure.\n\nATP's market risks in relation to the bonus potential are mainly market risks related to the Investment portfolio. The long-term objective of the Investment portfolio is to generate a return that will allow, in part, for the building of reserves for, e.g., financing increased life expectancy so that ATP secures pensions for a whole lifetime, and to increase the guaranteed pensions, thereby striving to preserve the real value of the lifelong pensions. In order to have a robust investment portfolio with a high rate of expected return, the investment portfolio is managed based on a strategy of risk diversification. ATP splits the risk of each individual investment into four risk factors which can be combined in appropriate ways to achieve a portfolio with the desired risk profile. The four fundamental factors are: The equity factor, interest rate factor, inflation factor, and other factors. The risk associated with each investment is allocated to the four factors based on the types of risk to which the investment is exposed.\n\n## Counterparty risks\n\nCounterparty risks are risks associated with financial counterparties' potential breach of agreements entered into in connection with contracts on derivatives, repo and reverse transactions and bank deposits.\n\nThe use of derivatives, especially for interest rate hedging, represents a particular risk for ATP. Changes in the value of these instruments will generate a liability\n\nor a receivable between ATP and its counterparties. ATP may therefore incur a loss if - for example because of a bankruptcy or liquidation - a counterparty is in breach of a concluded agreement. In order to reduce counterparty risk, both ATP and its counterparties require that collateral be provided for mutual receivables. Collateral is typically provided so that the market value of the collateral exceeds the market value of the related contract by a certain margin.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nLiquidity risks are risks associated with potential non-payment of payment demands or securities. ATP has developed a liquidity risk management model intended to ensure that ATP remains able at all times to comply with its contractual obligations in terms of providing either liquidity or security. This must be done by ensuring that sufficient liquidity can be obtained to meet liquidity requirements in the short term and the long term.\n\n## Currency risks\n\nATP's investments are, as a general rule, hedged against currency fluctuations in DKK and EUR. Thus, the exposure to currencies other than DKK and EUR is limited. In light of the high degree of confidence in Denmark's fixed price policy, ATP tolerates a significant exposure to the euro.\n\n## Concentration risks\n\nConcentration risks are risks resulting from a disproportionate reliance on a particular type of exposure, such as a particular asset class, investment market or single investment. The Supervisory Board has established concentration risk guidelines and frameworks to ensure that unnecessary concentration risks are avoided.\n\n## Sustainability risks\n\nATP views sustainability-risks similarly to other investment-related risks, including market risks. ATP's work with sustainability risks indicates that the measurement methods, data, etc. used to assess the impact on the value of investments are not as developed as they are for traditional risk factors.\n\nIt is therefore neither possible to identify nor make a nuanced and specific assessment of how various sustainability risks materialise across investment types in the same way as can be done for traditional financial risks. For this reason, the work involves a more general and holistic approach to the assessment of sustainability risks. As is the case with other investment risks, ATP strives to identify ESG related risk sources and assess to which degree ATP is compensated. ATP is continually working on improving its opportunities for integrating sustainability risks by developing and testing new methods such as, for example, when working with climate data which ATP assesses is the area that has seen the most progress.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nThe operational risks associated with the management of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) cover all potential financial, reputational or compliance-related impacts associated with, in particular, trading activities, risk measurements, contributions and payments to ATP's members and the operation of systems and information security. The operational risks most frequently manifest as financial losses and are part of the measurement of risk consumption. The Supervisory Board has specified detailed principles for the management of operational risks to ensure that the impact of such operational risks are limited in terms of financial, reputational and compliance-related impacts.",

        "page_content": "## Market risks associated with the investment portfolio\n\nATP's market risk primarily comprises market risks associated with the Investment portfolio. The Investment portfolio is managed to generate stable returns that are as independent of business cycle developments as possible. Therefore, the Investment portfolio is put together based on a strategy of risk diversification based on four fundamental factors: The equity factor, interest rate factor, inflation factor, and other factors. The risk associated with each investment is allocated to the four factors based on the types of risk to which the investment is exposed.\n\nATP's risk management provides a framework for the allocation of risk across the four risk factors with a view to ensuring appropriate diversification of ATP's investments. Risk allocation has been determined as each risk factor's share of the sum of risk for the four risk factors. ATP's Supervisory Board has set a long-term guideline and upper and lower limits for each risk factor's share of the risk in the Investment portfolio.\n\n## Investment portfolio risk broken down by factors\n\nEquity factor\n\nInterest rate factor\n\nInflation factor\n\nOther factors\n\n| Expected Shortfall in DKK  million   | Expected Shortfall in DKK  million   | Relative risk allocation (per  cent)   | Relative risk allocation (per  cent)   |                        |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 31.12.2023                           | 31.12.2022                           | 31.12.2023                             | 31.12.2022                             | Long-term  guideline 1 |\n| 35,328                               | 31,429                               | 50.5                                   | 53.1                                   | 42.8                   |\n| 20,084                               | 14,672                               | 28.7                                   | 24.8                                   | 31.5                   |\n| 8,953                                | 7,476                                | 12.8                                   | 12.6                                   | 14.5                   |\n| 5,647                                | 5,635                                | 8.1                                    | 9.5                                    | 11.3                   |\n\nAt the end of 2023, the distribution in equity factor was over the long-term guideline, and the distribution in the other factors was below the guideline. However, the distributions are within the upper and lower bounds that the Supervisory Board has specified for the risk distribution.\n\n## Market risks associated with the Hedging portfolio and the guaranteed benefits\n\nMarket risks in the Hedging portfolio and the guaranteed pensions mainly comprise interest rate risks. The hedging ratio 2 indicates the ability of the Hedging portfolio to hedge the interest rate sensitivity of the guaranteed benefits. ATP aims to ensure that the hedging ratio, measured by DKK duration after tax, remains in a narrow range of about 100 per cent. Accordingly, market risks associated with the hedging portfolio are limited.\n\n| DKK duration and hedging ratio                            |            |            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                           | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n| Guaranteed benefits' DKK duration  after tax, DKK million | (78,268)   | (71,313)   |\n| Hedging portfolio's DKK duration  after tax, DKK million  | 78,279     | 75,398     |\n| Hedging ratio in per cent                                 | 100        | 106        |\n\nNote: The DKK duration indicates the market value impact of a marginal change in interest rates, scaled to take into account a 1 per cent decline in interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe hedging ratio is calculated to be 100 per cent at the end of 2023. As the figure above shows, the hedging ratio was close to 100 per cent for most of the year.\n\n## Currency risks\n\nATP's currency risks are, as a general rule, hedged in DKK and euros. However, a limit applies for the currency exposure to other currencies, as it may be inexpedient to hedge some currencies. As a general rule, emerging market currency exposure is not hedged.\n\n| ATP's currency exposure as of 31.12.2023   | Currency exposure  in DKKbn   | Currency hedging   in DKKbn   | Currency exposure  incl. currency  hedging in DKKbn   | Per cent of financial  instruments measured  at fair value   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Currency                                   |                               |                               |                                                       |                                                              |\n| USD                                        | 59.7                          | (63.0)                        | (3.3)                                                 | (0.5)                                                        |\n| SEK                                        | 19.9                          | (19.7)                        | 0.1                                                   | 0.0                                                          |\n| Total other currencies 1                   | 27.4                          | (23.4)                        | 3.9                                                   | 0.6                                                          |\n\n| ATP's currency exposure as of 31.12.2022   | Currency exposure  in DKKbn   | Currency hedging   in DKKbn   | Currency exposure  incl. currency  hedging in DKKbn   | Per cent of financial  instruments measured  at fair value   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Currency                                   |                               |                               |                                                       |                                                              |\n| USD                                        | 57.7                          | (59.6)                        | (1.9)                                                 | (0.3)                                                        |\n| SEK                                        | 17.2                          | ( 17. 8 )                     | (0.6)                                                 | ( 0 .1)                                                      |\n| Total other currencies 1                   | 26.1                          | (23.9)                        | 2.2                                                   | 0.3                                                          |",

The Group's credit risks relate primarily to actual credit investments. Credit investments comprise investments in corporate bonds, emerging market government bonds, credit funds, loans, etc.\n\nIn addition, the Group has a number of business-related credit risks (counterparty risks), including receivables, cash and cash equivalents and unlisted financial derivatives with a positive fair value.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe ATP Group provides and receives assets as collateral from clearing centres and other counterparties when entering into financial transactions. The ATP Group is entitled to sell or relend assets received. ATP's counter -parties are also entitled to sell or relend the assets received when the ATP Group provides assets as collateral. Bonds and loans provided as collateral continue to be recognised in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\n## Assets provided and received as collateral are specified in the table below:\n\n|                                     | Group   | Group   | ATP    | ATP     |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|\n| DKK million                         | 2023    | 2022    | 2023   | 2022    |\n| Assets provided as collateral:      |         |         |        |         |\n| Bonds                               | 81,909  | 113,472 | 81,909 | 113,472 |\n| Loans                               | 0       | 95      | 0      | 95      |\n| Liquid assets                       | 586     | 412     | 567    | 412     |\n| Total assets provided as collateral | 82,495  | 113,979 | 82,475 | 113,979 |\n| Assets received as collateral:      |         |         |        |         |\n| Bonds                               | 48,589  | 33,010  | 48,589 | 33,010  |\n| Liquid assets                       | 51      | 28      | -      | -       |\n| Total assets received as collateral | 48,641  | 33,037  | 48,589 | 33,010  |\n\nFinally, ATP's other portfolios of bonds involve a credit risk. As regards government bonds, excluding emerging markets, the credit risk is assessed as being close to zero, as 100 per cent of this portfolio consisted of German and Danish government bonds at year-end 2023. As regards mortgage bonds, bonds issued by international organisations (supranationals) and bonds issued by publicly guaranteed authorities (agencies), the credit risk is assessed as being moderate.\n\n## Market value as of 31 December\n\n| DKKbn                                                                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Credit investments                                                   | 26     | 34     |\n| Mortgage bonds                                                       | 90     | 86     |\n| Government bonds excluding emerging markets                          | 336    | 335    |\n| Bonds issued by supranationals or agencies                           | 46     | 38     |\n| Unlisted financial derivatives, net (before provision of collateral) | (23)   | (83)   |\n| Unlisted financial derivatives, net (after provision of collateral)  | (3)    | 10     |\n| Cash                                                                 | 7      | 7      |\n| Other receivables, receivable contributions and margin collateral    | 16     | 21     |\n\n## Note 18c: Liquidity risks\n\nLiquidity risks are risks associated with potential non-payment of payment demands or securities. ATP has developed a liquidity risk management model intended to ensure that ATP remains able at all times to comply with its contractual obligations in terms of providing either liquidity or security.\n\nThis is done by ensuring that liquidity and liquidity requirements both in the short term (5 banking days) and the longer term (1 year) are mutually aligned. Liquidity can be obtained via the sale of assets, but also via the repo market. The net liquidity effect on contribution payments and pension benefits over the year is stable.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nIn the table below, the Group's financial liabilities are broken down by

Assumptions of interest rates, risk premiums, volatility, default and prepayments and other information are included in the use of\n\nthese methods. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including financial derivatives for which no quoted market prices exist, is based on the best information available under the circumstances.\n\nFinancial assets where the valuation is based on unobservable inputs include parts of the Group's bonds, unlisted equity investments, derivatives, investment properties and loans.\n\n## ATP Group\n\n| DKK million                                                                     | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Financial assets:                                                               |         |         |\n| Receivables from reverse transactions                                           | 38,613  | 25,669  |\n| Bonds                                                                           | 489,698 | 483,903 |\n| Listed equities                                                                 | 54,048  | 51,020  |\n| Unlisted equity investments                                                     | 111,243 | 115,044 |\n| Financial derivatives                                                           | 77,348  | 83,148  |\n| Loans                                                                           | 3,574   | 4,369   |\n| Financial assets measured at fair value over the income statement               | 774,523 | 763,152 |\n| Receivables contributions                                                       | 3,310   | 3,150   |\n| Collateral regarding financial derivatives                                      | 6,267   | 13,380  |\n| Other receivables                                                               | 6,823   | 4,763   |\n| Financial assets measured at amortised cost                                     | 16,399  | 21,294  |\n| Financial liabilities:                                                          |         |         |\n| Financial derivatives                                                           | 136,926 | 172,840 |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value over the income statement          | 136,926 | 172,840 |\n| Debt from reverse transactions                                                  | 1,099   | 10,709  |\n| Financial liabilities measured at fair value over the income statement (chosen) | 1,099   | 10,709  |\n| Other debts                                                                     | 16,533  | 6,521   |\n| Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost                                | 16,533  | 6,521   |\n\nBreakdown of the Group's financial assets an investment properties measured under level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nBonds\n\nUnlisted equity investments\n\nFinancial derivatives\n\nLoans\n\nInvestment properties\n\n| 2023        | 2023     | 2022        |          |\n|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|\n| DKK million | Per cent | DKK million | Per cent |\n| 9,227       | 6%       | 15,865      | 10%      |\n| 108,879     | 75%      | 107,838     | 70%      |\n| 0           | 0%       | 39          | 0%       |\n| 3,574       | 2%       | 4,369       | 3%       |\n| 24,418      | 17%      | 25,002      | 16%      |\n| 146,098     | 100%     | 153,113     | 100%     |",

These subsidiaries are jointly and severally liable for the payment of VAT and payroll tax included in the joint registration for VAT.\n\nOwing to its size and business volume, the ATP Group is continually a party to various lawsuits and disputes. Cases are assessed on an ongoing basis, and pending lawsuits and disputes are not believed to have any significant impact on the financial position of the ATP Group.\n\n1 As of 2001 and under certain conditions, the ATP Group is not subject to income tax on the activities of its subsidiary ATP Ejendomme A/S. If the conditions for tax exemption are not met, provisions are made for both current and deferred tax in the company. In 2023, ATP Ejendomme A/S met the conditions for tax exemption.\n\nThe accounting treatment of contingent assets and liabilities is based on an assessment of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. If it is almost certain that a future economic benefit will flow to the ATP Group, the asset and the related income are recognised. If, on the other hand, it is probable that a future economic benefit will flow from the ATP Group when discharging the liability, the\n\ncontingency is recognised as a liability. Where it is not possible to estimate an amount with sufficient certainty, or it is not possible to es -timate the outcome of a given matter, information to this effect will be provided. Decisions relating to such matters may generate realised profits or losses in future accounting periods that exceed the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to the guaranteed benefits, pension provisions consist of provisions for Life annuity with market exposure, Long-term supplementary provisions, risk adjustment and the bonus potential. Comparative figures have been adjusted.\n\nPlease refer to the description of ratios in Appendix 3 of ATP's executive order on accounting issued by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP, Executive Order no. 1600 of 14 December 2023).\n\nATP does not apply the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's return ratio. The return ratio tends to\n\nover-reflect market value changes in ATP's Hedging portfolio, which will not notably affect the pensions promised. As the ratio does not allow for variance in the value creation of the guaranteed products, the ratio does not provide a complete picture of the value creation for ATP's members for the individual year. In the very long term, however, the ratio better reflects the value creation.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation of changes to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP'\n\nAs of 1 January 2024, the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP' was changed and updated in a number of areas. It is possible to apply the executive order already from 2023, which is what ATP has chosen. The most significant change affecting the Annual Report is related to the implementation of IFRS 17 and the update of ATP's business model. See below for more information.\n\n## Implementation of new or changed accounting standards\n\nThe ATP Group and ATP have effectively, as of 1 January 2023, implemented the following new or changed standards and interpretation contributions:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS17, Insurance Contracts\n- \u00b7 Amended IAS1, Information about accounting policies\n- \u00b7 Amended IAS8, Definition of accounting estimates\n- \u00b7 Amended IAS12, Deferred tax concerning assets and liabilities stemming from a single transaction\n\nBesides IFRS 17, all standards and interpretation contributions are implemented with no impact on the Annual Report for the ATP Group and ATP.\n\n## IFRS17, Insurance Contracts\n\nPursuant to IFRS 17, an insurance contract is 'A contract under which one party (the issuer) accepts significant insurance risk from another party (the policy -holder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder.'\n\nATP does not enter into contracts with its members, as the 'contract' between ATP and its members is defined in legislation. The 'contract' between ATP and its members is implicitly an insurance contract which is covered by IFRS 17.\n\nMethod for measuring pension liabilities\n\nIFRS 17 introduces a uniform method for recognising,\n\nmeasuring and presenting pension liabilities. The value of pension liabilities is measured as the sum of projected future cash flows plus profit margins, the discount effect and a risk adjustment to take into account non-financial risks.\n\nAs ATP's bonus potential is shared by all members, ATP's contracts are characterised by being contracts with elements of direct participation. Therefore, the pension liabilities are measured based on the variable margin method.\n\nATP's contracts must be divided into annual cohorts based on whether they 'loss making', 'potentially loss making' or 'other'. All of ATP's contracts are in the 'other' cohort, as at the time of contributions being made they are neither loss making or potentially loss making. ATP has chosen to group contracts into annual cohorts on the basis of the tariff year which the ATP contributions concern.\n\n## Profit margin\n\nAll funds are paid to ATP's members, and ATP has no profit in delivering the services, which is why ATP's profit margin will be 0.\n\n## Expected future cash flows\n\nWhen measuring the expected future cash flows, cash flows in the collective reserves consisting of the bonus potential and the Long-term supplementary provision are included, cf. below, regardless of whether they are expected to be paid out to current or future members.\n\n## Discounting\n\nThe discounting factors used to measure the value of the guaranteed benefits are calculated based on an underlying yield curve, cf. note 16, page 95. The interest curve is adjusted by taking into account the illiquidity of the liabilities and by an adjustment of how the yield curve is specified in the long term.\n\nThe adjustment of the yield curve partly results in liabilities with a maturity beyond 30 years using a forward-interest of 3 per cent to calculate the risk-free yield curve and partly in the risk-free yield curve having added an illiquidity range that reflects the illiquidity of the liabilities. The adjustment of the yield curve only\n\nhas an impact on the book value of ATP's guaranteed benefits, and therefore does not impact the pensions for ATP's members.\n\nAll in all, the adjusted yield curve means that the book value of the guaranteed benefits as of 1 January 2023 are reduced by DKK 35.2bn, of which DKK 3.0bn impact the bonus potential while DKK 37.3bn are included in a separate reserve called the Long-term supplementary provision and DKK 1.0bn is a risk adjustment for non-fi -nancial risks. The Long-term supplementary provision will initially be calculated as the difference between the guaranteed benefits excluding the illiquidity range and guaranteed benefits including the illiquidity range. In addition, the risk adjustment is deducted and returns from the Supplementary Hedging portfolio (after tax) are transferred to the Long-term supplementary provision.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nIFRS 17 introduces a risk adjustment that amounts to a reservation that ATP makes to take into account the uncertainty associated with non-financial risks in the measurement of future cash flows. For ATP, the non-financial risks mainly relate to life expectancy risks. As the bonus potential can cover unforeseen expenses associated with, for example, unforeseen life expectancy improvements, the risk adjustment is calculated as the non-financial risks' impact on the investment-re -lated risk taking in the bonus potential and not using the confidence level method.\n\n## Changed presentation\n\nIFRS 17 introduces a number of mandatory accounting items that result in a significant change to how the income statement is presented and the pension provisions on the statement of financial position being sub-divided with new items.\n\n## Income statement\n\nInsurance income comprises expected pension benefits and expected expenses that were included in the pension provisions at the beginning of the reporting period. Insurance service expenses comprise pension benefit payments as well as administrative and investment expenses. Financial insurance income or expenses comprise shorter maturity periods and\n\ninterest changes, and will also include the interest on the Long-term supplementary provision and the bonus potential, cf. below.\n\n## Result of insurance and investment activities\n\nUnder IFRS 4, the bonus potential is presented and treated as a type of equity to which the profit for the year is transferred via the disposition of the result. Under IFRS 17, the bonus potential is part of the pension provisions and not treated as a kind of equity, which is why the bonus potential accrues interest matching the returns that have not been allocated to the guaranteed benefits, Life annuity with market exposure and Long-term supplementary provision. The interest accrued to the bonus potential means that the income statement for ATP will show a result of 0.\n\nContributions are not recognised in the income statement, but they increase the size of the provisions on the statement of financial position. Changes to provi -sions due to life expectancy updates or the allocation of bonuses do not impact expected or actual payments within the accounting year. These changes are therefore not included in the income statement, but are instead made as reclassifications within the pension provisions.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\nATP's pension provisions are comprised of pension liabilities which are distributed to members either as a guaranteed benefit or as a Life annuity with market exposure with an added risk adjustment for non-fi -nancial risks. Guaranteed benefits, Life annuity with market exposure and risk adjustment are presented as separate lines on ATP's statement of financial position and collectively represent the pension liabilities.\n\nATP's undistributed funds form the remaining part of the pension provisions and consist of the bonus potential and the Long-term supplementary provision. The bonus potential and Long-term supplementary provision are thus presented as separate items on ATP's statement of financial position.\n\nDue to the implementation of IFRS 17 and a retrospective change in accounting policies, comparative figures for the balance sheet at the end of 2021 are presented in accordance with IAS 1.",

        "page_content": "## Note 28: New accounting regulation, continued\n\nEffect on the pension provisions from the implementation of IFRS 17 and the new business model\n\nWhen implementing IFRS 17, ATP has applied the retrospective method and measured the pension provisions retrospectively.\n\nIFRS 17 specifies two new requirements for the measurement of the pension provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 A reflection of the illiquidity of the guaranteed benefits. By using an illiquidity supplement to the yield curve, this releases funds that ATP choses to manage with a more long-term approach in the Long-term supplementary provision.\n- \u00b7 A risk adjustment which reflects the reservation that ATP must set aside to compensate for assuming non-financial risks.\n\nThe pension provisions as of 1 January 2023 have been adjusted and the impact on the individual items can be seen on the table in the right column. In the table and in the notes for the Annual Report, the start of year effect will cover both direct changes due to IFRS 17 and how ATP chooses to implement the changes in combination with a changed hedging strategy with the establishment of the Long-term supplementary provision.\n\nThe comparative figures for 2022 have been adjusted to the same principles as for 2023. This means that the result for 2022 changes, with the most significant differ -ences being as follows:\n\nThe result from investment and hedging is transferred directly to the bonus potential.\n\nThe result from hedging is changed as the provisions are discounted based on the yield curve resulting from the implementation of IFRS 17. The yield curve is more sensitive to interest rate changes than the previously used curve, and this has a positive impact on the result of DKK 13.2bn.\n\nThe result of pension and life expectancy updates changes by a total of DKK (7.3)bn as the contribution payments and life expectancy updates pursuant to IFRS 17 should not appear on the income statement as they impact future payments.\n\n| Financial statement item (DKKbn)   | IFRS4   |   IFRS17 |\n|------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Guaranteed benefits                | 573.8   |    538.6 |\n| Life annuity with market exposure  | 1.4     |      1.4 |\n| Risk adjustment                    | -       |      1   |\n| Long-term supplementary provision  | -       |     37.3 |\n| Bonus potential                    | 102.6   |     99.6 |\n| Total pension provisions           | 677.8   |    677.8 |\n\nStandards and interpretations that have not yet taken effect\n\nA number of changed standards have been issued that are expected to be implemented in 2024 or later. None of these are expected to have a significant impact on the submission of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The consolidated financial statements and ATP's Annual Report for 2023 have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP' (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension).\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial state -ments and the parent company financial statements, Management assumes a number of estimates and preconditions that affect the accounting value of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses. Note 30 details the accounting assessments performed by Management in connection with the application of accounting policies and estimates which are considered material for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and parent com -pany financial statements. Accounting estimates for specific items are set out in the individual notes.\n\nIn addition to the implementation of new and amended accounting standards as described in note 28, the accounting policies for domicile properties have been changed for 2023. As of 2023, domicile properties are recognised in the same way as investment properties with fair value adjustments through the income statement.\n\nAll figures are presented in DKK million unless other -wise stated. The totals stated are calculated on the basis of actual figures, and the rounding off to nearest DKK million may result in minor differences between the sum of individual figures and totals stated.\n\n## Materiality in presentation\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial state -ments and the parent company financial statements, Management performs an assessment about their presentation. In this context, it is taken into account that the content of the Group and parent company financial statements is significant to the reader. In the presentation of the Group's and ATP's assets, liabilities, financial position and performance, it is assessed whether it would be beneficial to aggregate less signif -icant amounts.\n\nThe assessment of materiality and relevance in the presentation has resulted in changes to the presentation of some notes relative to the Annual Report for 2022.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of ATP, the Parent Company, and entities controlled by ATP. ATP controls an entity when ATP is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nA Group overview is available on page 58.\n\n## Foreign currency translation: Functional currency and presentation currency\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), the functional currency and presentation currency of the Parent Company. The functional currency is the currency used in the primary financial environment in which the reporting entity operates. A functional currency is determined for each of the Group's reporting entities. All of the Group's entities use Danish kroner (DKK) as their functional currency.\n\n## Conversion of transactions and amounts\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are foreign currency transactions. Foreign currency transactions are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Investment assets, receivables and payables in foreign currencies are converted into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the statement of financial position date. Realised and unrealised exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement under 'Financial returns'.\n\n## Income statement\n\n## Insurance income\n\nInsurance income comprises expected retirement benefits, projected expenses and the expected run-off of risk adjustment for non-financial risks included in the pension provisions at the beginning of the financial year. The year's contributions, which are comprised of reported and collected contributions minus labour market contributions, are recognised as a balance sheet item under pension provisions. Contributions are recognised as insurance income as insurance services are provided in the form of payments and as expenses are incurred for administration and investment management.\n\n## Expenses for insurance service\n\nInsurance service expenses consist of the year's\n\npension benefit payments as well as administrative and investment expenses.\n\nPaid out retirement benefits comprise personal pensions, spouse pensions and capitalised benefits for the year. Benefits prepaid are accrued on the statement of financial position and presented under the item 'Other prepayments and accrued income'.\n\nExpenses are allocated between the individual business units either as direct expenses or as an expense allocation based on ATP's internal model for allocation of other expenses.\n\nInvestment activity expenses and Hedging comprise expenses incurred to achieve the investment and hedging return for the year. These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to pay and remuneration, custody expenses and transaction costs related to the purchase and sale of investment assets. Expenses incurred in investment subsidiaries are also included in these expenses for the Group.\n\nExpenses incurred in connection with the administration of ATP Livslang Pension (Lifelong Pension) cover administration expenses related to the management of the pension scheme, including SUPP (Supplementary Labour Market Pension Scheme for Disability Pensioners). These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to pay and remunerations, IT operations, amortisation of internal development projects and depreciation on property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Financial returns\n\nFinancial return includes interest income, interest expenses, dividends and value adjustments on the financial assets and liabilities included in the Investment and Hedging portfolios, respectively. Returns on investment also include income from investment properties. Income from investment properties is comprised of the rental income from investment properties for the year and sale of timber from forestry properties less property management and operating expenses for forestry properties.\n\n## Financial insurance income or expenses\n\nIncludes changes in the discount rate and maturity reduction for the guaranteed benefits and Long-term supplementary provision. In addition, the item includes the transfer of interest allocated to Life annuity\n\nwith market exposure, the bonus potential and the Long-term supplementary provision.\n\n## Tax on pension savings returns and corporate income tax\n\nTax on pension savings returns comprises current tax on pension savings returns for the year, changes in deferred tax on pension savings returns, and prior year adjustments, if any.\n\nCurrent tax liabilities in respect of pension savings returns and current tax receivable in respect of pension savings returns are recognised in the statement of financial position as calculated tax on pension savings returns adjusted for interim payment of tax on pension savings returns.\n\nDeferred tax assets in respect of pension savings returns, including the tax value of tax loss carryforwards, are included at the value at which the asset is expected to be realisable - either by elimination in pension savings returns tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax on pension savings returns is measured in accordance with current tax rules and at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences reverse.\n\nCorporate income tax is recognised according to the same principles as tax on pension savings returns.\n\n## Other income/expenses\n\nOther income/expenses include minority interests' share of returns, expenses and income tax.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income includes income for the year from the sale of administration services to external clients as well as related parties. In addition, other customary income for the year that cannot be attributed to the result of insurance and investment activities is recognised.\n\n## Other expenses\n\nOther expenses include expenses incurred in connection with the administration of a number of major schemes. These expenses include direct and indirect expenses related, for example, to wages and remuneration, IT operations and amortisation of internal development projects.",

        "page_content": "## Statement of financial position\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe buying and selling of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the transaction date if the conditions for an ordinary purchase or sale have been met. If the conditions are not met, the financial assets and liabil -ities are recognised on the settlement date. A change in the fair value between the trading date and the settlement date is recognised in the income statement for financial assets measured as the fair value above the income statement.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are measured at the fair value at the first recognition and subsequently measured at either fair value or amortised cost.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe following financial assets are measured after the initial recognition at fair value as a result of ATP's business model:\n\n- \u00b7 Bonds\n- \u00b7 Loans, including loans to group subsidiaries\n- \u00b7 Receivables from reverse transactions\n\nThe assets and liabilities specified above are managed and assessed based on fair value in accordance with the Group's risk management strategy, and are therefore measured at fair value with value adjustment via the income statement.\n\nThe financial assets below are not based on cash flows consisting of payment of principal and interest, and are therefore measured at fair value after initial recognition:\n\n- \u00b7 Listed equity investments and unlisted capital shares, including investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures\n- \u00b7 Financial derivatives\n\nOther financial assets are measured after initial recog -nition at amortised cost price.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial derivatives with a negative market value must be recognised at fair value, while it has been decided to recognise payables resulting from repo transactions at fair\n\nvalue with value adjustment through the income statement as they are managed and assessed based on fair value in accordance with the Group's risk management strategy.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nAdjustments to the fair value of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement under 'Financial returns'. With regard to debt from repo transactions, the portion of the fair value changes that is attributable to changes in ATP's own credit risk is recognised in 'Other comprehensive income.' Due to ATP's strong financial position and the short maturity of the repo transactions, the impact of ATP's credit risk is assessed as being insignificant.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities that are traded in a market, the official market price is used. Measuring listed equities and financial assets and liabilities is based on closing prices from relevant stock exchanges while bid prices are used for listed bonds. If, in respect of bonds, there have been no updated external prices within the previous two trading days prior to the balance sheet date, a theoretical price is calculated and the bonds are registered as 'observable input' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor other financial assets and liabilities, the fair value determination represents ATP's most objective estimate of the current fair value of financial assets and liabil -ities, based on the most unambiguous and uniform guidelines possible and, to some extent, supported by management estimates. When determining these estimates, the following methods are applied:\n\nBonds, interest-based investment assets and liabilities For investments in bonds for which no active market exists, yield curves with the addition of yield curves and investment-specific premiums are used.\n\nUnlisted equity investments, including investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures Private equity investments consist of investments in portfolio funds, direct equity investments, direct equity investments in portfolio companies and real estate funds.\n\n## Portfolio funds\n\nFor a significant portion of the investments in portfolio funds, the valuation is based on reporting received from\n\nportfolio funds. Equity investments in portfolio funds are generally measured using the IPEV Valuation Guidelines under which equity investments are measured at fair value on the reporting date. Listed equity investments in portfolio funds are measured at the closing rate of the relevant stock exchange. For unlisted equity investments for which no quoted price exists, the equity investments are measured on the basis of the latest market price, either in connection with a round of capital increases resulting in a change in ownership or in connection with a partial sale, based on the value of comparable companies.\n\n## Direct equity investments\n\nDirect private equity investments are measured using one of the following methods: a) multiple analysis where the ratio of the value of comparable listed companies to relevant key figures for these companies is used in the valuation of the company in question; b) if sufficient comparable companies cannot be found, a 'sum-ofthe-parts' valuation is performed where each business unit of the company in question is measured separately; c) for new investments, the acquisition cost is used.\n\nDirect equity investments in portfolio companies Direct equity investments in portfolio companies consist of co-investments together with portfolio funds and are valued using traditional valuation methods and as described above for portfolio funds. The following factors are included in the determination of fair value:\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation and other significant conditions related to the latest round of financing\n- \u00b7 Significant events related to the company's business, product launches, new clients, changes to the management team\n- \u00b7 Compliance or non-compliance with significant predefined milestones and other conditions assessed to be capable of impacting the fair value, including general changes in market and competition conditions and new technology.\n\n## Real estate funds\n\nPrivate equity investments in real estate funds are measured primarily on the basis of the valuations performed by the real estate funds. The measurement is based on a valuation model that measures the fair value of the equity where the fair value of the underlying properties is reflected on an ongoing basis. The\n\nfair value of the real estate is usually determined on the basis of valuations performed by external estate agents and market assessors. In addition, the managers of the funds regularly perform an internal valuation based on changes in market conditions, which is typically reflected in an adjustment of the required rate of return. Other factors such as the stability of the real estate cash flow, market rent level, location and tenant quality are included in the valuation.\n\n## Loans\n\nValuation of loans is based on discounting of expected future cash flows to net present value using relevant yield curves and investment-specific credit spread premiums.\n\nReceivables and debt from repo/reverse transactions Includes repo and reverse transactions, i.e. the purchase/sale of securities where, as part of the agreement, an agreement is concluded regarding selling back/buying back at a later time. In reverse transactions, the securities purchased are not included in the statement of financial position, and the amount paid is recognised as a receivable. In repo transactions, securities sold are still included in the statement of financial position and the amount received is recognised as a liability. On initial recognition, receivables from and debts from repo and reverse transactions are recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value. Interest received and paid is recognised across the duration of contracts. Valuation of repo activities is based on discounting of expected future cash flows using relevant yield curves.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost\n\nOther receivables\n\nOther receivables, which primarily comprise incomplete transactions, contributions receivable and rent receivable, are measured at amortised cost. Amortised cost is usually equivalent to nominal value.\n\nProvisions are made for expected losses on ATP contributions receivable and rent receivable based on a simplified provision matrix, using a fixed provi -sions percentage depending on how many days the receivable remains overdue. The provision rate is based on historical data.\n\nProvisions for expected losses are deducted directly from the asset items to which the provisions relate,",

        "page_content": "while period changes are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nIncludes 'Payables to group subsidiaries' and 'Other payables', measured at amortised cost, essentially equivalent to nominal value.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\nOn initial recognition, i.e. the trade date, financial derivatives are recognised at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial derivatives are also measured at fair value. For financial derivatives that are traded in a market, the official market price is used. For financial derivatives that are not traded in a market, various generally accepted valuation methods are used, depending on the type of instrument involved. For interest rate instruments, valuation is based on the market rate expressed as the zero coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial derivatives are recognised in the income statement as they occur. Financial derivatives with a positive fair value are recognised in the statement of financial position as assets, while financial derivatives with a negative fair value are recognised in the statement of financial position as liabilities. Listed futures for which the margin is calculated on a daily basis are considered to be settled for which reason the market value is recognised at DKK 0.\n\nOther cash and cash equivalents received as part of a margin settlement are recognised in the statement of financial position, given that ATP has the right of disposal of margin account balances. Securities which, as part of collateral security, have only been formally assigned to ATP's ownership are not recognised in the statement of financial position, given that ATP neither bears the risk nor benefits from the return on these securities. Similarly, securities which ATP has only assigned formally to counterparties as part of collateral security are still recognised in ATP's statement of financial position. ATP enters into foreign exchange contracts with external counterparties on behalf of several of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\n## Investments in group subsidiaries\n\nEquity investments in group subsidiaries are managed and assessed based on fair value in accordance with ATP's risk management and investment strategies.\n\nReporting to the ATP Group Management is also based on this, for which reason ATP has selected the option in IAS 27 to recognise and measure equity investments in group subsidiaries in accordance with the regulations of IFRS 9. Cash flows from equity investments in group subsidiaries do not consist of payment of principal and interest, meaning that equity investments in group subsidiaries are recognised and measured at fair value with value adjustment via the income statement.\n\nNo minority interests are deemed to own a significant share of the group subsidiaries.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities in which the Group has a significant but not controlling interest. Significant interest is typically achieved through direct or indirect ownership or disposal of more than 20 per cent of the voting rights, but less than 50 per cent. In the assessment of whether the Group has a significant interest, potential voting rights that may be exercised at the statement of financial position date are taken into account. Joint ventures include entities whose activities are jointly controlled by the Group, which is generally the case if the Group holds 50 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 28, ATP and the ATP Group have decided to recognise and measure investments in associates and joint ventures under the provisions of IFRS 9. Cash flows from equity capital shares in associates and joint ventures do not consist of payment of principal and interest, and investments in associates and joint ventures are therefore recognised and measured at fair value with value adjustment through the income statement.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are often structured as a combination of share equity investment and loans. Where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where the company has no significant debt financing, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical to the risk of the equity investment. Such loans are presented as an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture - both in internal management reporting and in external reporting. Loans that are an integral part of the investment in the associate or joint venture are recognised and measured at fair value.\n\nEquity investments in associated companies and joint ventures are presented under the 'Unlisted equity investments' item in the financial statements.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are properties held by the ATP Group to earn rental income and/or capital gains. Investment properties are properties which the ATP Group does not use for administration etc. as such properties are classified as owner-occupied properties. Properties with elements of owner-occupied properties and investment properties are allocated proportionately between the two asset types.\n\nOn initial recognition, investment properties are recognised at cost including transaction expenses. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. A return-based model is used to determine the fair value of the Danish properties.  These valuations are segmented in terms of the locations and qualities of the properties. The valuation of the Group's international properties is made by external valuers, since local knowledge abroad requires external input. Determining the return in the return-based model for individual properties is based on the expected rental income at full occupancy of the properties. Expected operating, administration and maintenance expenses are deducted. The value subsequently calculated is adjusted for recognised vacancy rent loss for a suitable period and expected expenses related to major maintenance work; deposits and prepaid rent are also added. An external assessment has been obtained for the valuation of market rent, and required rates of return are determined based on external estate agents' assessment of the market level.\n\nThe periodisation of rental discounts in the form of rent-free periods, gradual phasing in of market rate rents and other incentive agreements are an integral part of the value of investment properties. The periodisation is adjusted each year via rental income by an amount that is the difference between the year's invoiced rental income and the calculated period-adjusted rental income.\n\nExpenses incurred in the form of new or improved qualities which result in an increase in the fair value determined immediately prior to the incurrence of the expenses, are added to the acquisition price as improvements.\n\n## Forestry investment properties\n\nForestry investment properties include land planted with woodlands that are held for the purpose of generating income from the sale of timber and capital gains.\n\nOn initial recognition, investment properties are recognised at cost including transaction expenses, and subsequently at fair value. The measuring of forestry investment property fairly is based on a weighted average of fair values of a variety of models. The most commonly applied models include recent sales of comparable forestry investment properties adjusted for size, location and types of timber and DCF models discounting expected future income from the sales of timber and land.\n\nThe fair value is determined by external valuing experts specialising in forestry investment properties.\n\n## Owner-occupied properties\n\nOwner-occupied properties are properties used by the Group for administration purposes. Residential properties includes both rented and owned properties. Properties with elements of both owner-occupied properties and investment properties are allocated proportionately between the two asset types by square metre.\n\nOwner-occupied properties are recognised at cost and subsequently measured at fair value using a revaluation model. Revaluation is performed at the end of each quarter. The fair value of owner-occupied properties is assessed using the principles applied to the Group's investment properties.\n\nRevaluations and write-downs of a property from cost price to fair value are recognised in the income statement.\n\nOn initial recognition, leasing assets are measured at cost, corresponding to the discounted value of the expected rent payments. The leasing period, which forms the basis for calculating the rent liability, corresponds to the period for which ATP, as the lessee, is entitled and expects to make use of the underlying assets.\n\nSubsequently, the leasing asset is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and depreciation. The leasing asset is amortised across the shorter period of",

        "page_content": "the leasing period and the working life of the leasing asset and amortisations are calculated as straight-line in the income statement.\n\nOn initial recognition, leasing liabilities are measured at amortised cost and a calculated interest cost is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets only include internal development projects.\n\n## Internal development projects\n\nClearly defined and identifiable development projects, for which the technical rate of utilisation, sufficient resources and a potential future market or application in the company can be demonstrated, and where the intention is to produce, market or use the project, are recognised as intangible assets, provided that the cost of these assets can be measured reliably and there is a sufficient degree of certainty of the future value in use. Other development expenses are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Development expenses include expenses, remuneration and amortisation attributable to the Group's development activities.\n\nInternal development projects are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the assets, typically from three to ten years. The useful economic lives of the assets are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.\n\n## Write-down test\n\nIntangible assets are evaluated yearly for indications of value impairment.\n\nIn case of indications of depreciation, impairment test is performed for each asset or group of assets. A write-down is then made to the recoverable amount if this is lower than the accounting value. The recoverable value is the highest value of the capital value and the sale value minus expected sale costs. The capital value is measured as the current value of expected net cashflows from the use of the asset or group of assets and expected net cashflows from the sale of the asset or group of assets after use.\n\n## Guaranteed benefits\n\nGuaranteed benefits are calculated as the sum of the fulfilment cash flows, which consist of the expected future cash flows discounted using the relevant yield curve and a risk adjustment for non-financial risks, cf. below. Guaranteed benefits include unpaid pension benefits due in respect of events having occurred during the financial year or earlier (provisions for claims outstanding).\n\nThe discount rate is calculated in accordance with the provision basis reported to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, based on the zero coupon yield curve at the statement of financial position date, reflecting the term of the guaranteed benefits. In 2023, the yield curve is adjusted to add an illiquidity spread and a forward rate of 3 per cent is used for liabilities over 30 years, cf. note 28, page 124. The rate thus calculated has been reduced by the tax rate under the Danish Pension Savings Returns Act (Pensionsafkastbeskatningsloven), currently accounting for 15.3 per cent.\n\nChanges related to changes in market interest rates and changes in the shortening of maturities are recognised in Financial insurance income or expenses. Changes related to the year's paid contributions, life expectancy updates and bonuses are not recognised in the income statement but as a direct balance sheet entry.\n\n## Life annuity with market exposure\n\nThe provisions for Life annuity with market exposure are measured at the capital value of ATP's pension liabilities for life annuity with market exposure. The capital value is calculated with an interest rate of 0 per cent, as the pension entitlements are written up or down with the realised returns up to the balance sheet date.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nThe provision for risk adjustment reflects the com -pensation that ATP makes to take into account the uncertainty associated with non-financial risks in the calculation of future cash flows. For ATP, the non-financial risks mainly relate to life expectancy risks. As the bonus potential can cover unforeseen expenses associated with, for example, unforeseen life expectancy improvements, the risk adjustment is calculated as the non-financial risks' impact on the investment-related risk taking in the bonus potential and not using the confidence level method. The risk adjustment is calculated by rec-\n\nognising the value of the reduced investment capacity due to the existence of non-financial risks.\n\nThe guaranteed benefits, Life annuity with mar -ket exposure and risk adjustment together make up the total pension liabilities.\n\nThe undistributed funds are recognised at the amount corresponding to the carrying amount of the total assets minus the pension liabilities and the sum of the carrying amount of other liabilities.\n\nThe undistributed funds contain the items:\n\n## Long-term supplementary provision\n\nThe long-term provision is undistributed funds that ATP has chosen to manage more long-term than the bonus potential. The provision is calculated in accordance with the provision basis notified by ATP to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. The Long-term supplementary provision is given by the guaranteed benefits calculated with the market yield curve without illiquidity spread minus the guaranteed benefits calculated with the market yield curve with illiquidity spread. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 the risk adjustment is deducted,\n- \u00b7 the accumulated return in the Supplementary Hedging Portfolio is added and\n- \u00b7 the accumulated transfers to the bonus potential are deducted.\n\n## Bonus potential\n\nThe bonus potential represents reserves which, apart from the Long-term supplementary provision, have not been distributed to ATP's members. The bonus potential is equivalent to the carrying amount of total assets related to ATP minus guaranteed benefits, Life annuity with market exposure, risk adjustment, Long-term supplementary provision and the sum of the carrying amount of ATP's other liabilities.\n\nThe reserves can be distributed as bonus. The bonus accrual is transferred to the guaranteed benefits and Life annuity with market exposure as a balance sheet item and does not affect the income statement and statement of comprehensive income. The financial return for the year after tax minus changes in the calculation interest rate and maturity reduction as well as the return attributed to Life annuity with market exposure and Long-term supplementary provision constitute the return on the bonus potential for the year. The return\n\non the bonus potential, which is recognised in the income statement item 'Financial insurance income or expenses', means that the income statement for ATP will show a 0 result. A proportion of the year's contributions, the discharge of expected payments and expenses and life expectancy updates are transferred to the bonus potential. The bonus potential thus increases and decreases in line with the size of the annual return on the bonus potential, payments, discharges, life expectancy updates and bonus accrual.\n\n## Cash flow statement\n\nThe Group's cash flow statement shows the cash flows for the year, broken down by operating, investment and financing activities; changes for the year in cash and cash equivalents; and the Group's cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year.\n\nCash flows from operating activities are presented directly and measured as pension contributions received less pension benefit benefits. Also included are management fees received, payments related to administration activities, payments to suppliers and staff, and direct and indirect taxes.\n\nCash flows from investment activities include purchases and sales for the financial year of bonds, equity invest -ments, financial derivatives, loans, repo and reverse transactions, investment properties, as well as intangible assets and operating equipment.\n\nCash flows from financing activities include minority interest transactions for the financial year.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and demand deposits, as well as time deposits with an original term to maturity of less than three months.",

        "page_content": "In  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  state -ments  and  parent  company  financial  statements,  the Management  make  estimates,  set  assumptions  and make assessments that affect the reported accounting elements.\n\n## Accounting assessments\n\nManagement has conducted a range of assessments in connection with the application of the Group's accounting policies. The primary accounting assessments relate to the following areas:\n\n## Measurement of forestry investment properties\n\nForestry investment properties consist of biological assets (trees), land and CO 2 quotas. ATP considers forestry investment properties as an aggregate and integrated investment  asset,  due  to  the  fact  that  realisation  of forestry investment properties usually happens via the sale of the total property including land and CO 2 quotas and only to a small degree takes the form of harvesting and selling of the biological assets. Forestry investment properties are therefore considered an aggregate unit which is recognised at fair value with value adjustments via the income statement and is presented as a part of 'Investment properties'.\n\n## DKK is the functional currency of all subsidiaries\n\nThe ATP Group makes investments across the globe and therefore also holds foreign subsidiaries. It is a characteristic of foreign subsidiaries that they act as investment companies  with  no  independent  operating  activities, since  the  purpose  of  these  investments,  and  other Group investments generally, is to invest the members' contributions and to obtain a return that will safeguard stable  pension  benefits  to  the  members  in  DKK.  It  is the assessment of the Management that the relevant currency for measuring and valuing these investments should also be DKK.\n\n## ATP's business model\n\nATP's business model is to manage and value assets and  liabilities  based  on  changes  to  the  fair  value  in keeping with ATP's risk management strategy. For this reason, guaranteed benefits and associated investment assets are measured at fair value with recognising of value adjustment via the income statement, regardless of the fact that some investment assets in essence satisfy the conditions for measuring at amortised cost price, including bonds, loans and receivables from banks.\n\n## Capital assets held for sale\n\nThe ATP Group makes continuous adjustments to the invested  capital,  in  which  connection  management decisions are continuously made regarding the sale of assets. This also includes illiquid assets with a longer sale process. The Management may decide, for example, to sell one property rather than investing in other properties which  are  at  a  different  developmental  stage  or  in another location. ATP considers this to be continuous portfolio management and does not consider the assets as 'assets held for sale' in accordance with IFRS 5.\n\nMeasuring  associated  companies,  joint  ventures  and group subsidiaries at fair value\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are measured in the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 with reference to the special provisions of IAS  28,  associated  companies,  applicable  to  certain investment  companies,  including  pension  companies. Capital shares in group subsidiaries are also measured at fair value in ATP's annual accounts. The management justifies this policy by these investments being considered equal to other investments in ATP's business model, in which assets and liabilities are managed and assessed on the basis of changes to the fair value in accordance with  ATP's  risk  management  strategy  cf.  the  above description of ATP's business model.\n\n## Capitalisation of pension yield tax losses to be carried forward\n\nATP's  taxable  income  can  be  strongly  impacted  by changes to interest rates where interest rates will lead to price declines on the holdings of bonds and swaps. This mainly originates from the Hedging activities, where fluctuations  have  no  impact  on  the  ability  to  generate future profits.\n\nATP is taxed on the notional gains of price changes, which is why price gains in one year can result in a large taxable income while subsequent price declines can result in tax-related losses for deferral. The tax value of a loss for deferral is activated as the management deems that the losses will be used at a future date. ATP has - when disregarding the impact of interest rate changes - an underlying positive taxable income consisting of interest income from bonds, loans and swaps and income from investment properties and forest investments that can be offset in the taxable losses for deferral.\n\n## Presentation of loans forming an integral part of investments in equities\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures and equity investments in other companies are often structured as a combination of equity investment and loans to the companies in question. In such instances where all investors hold proportionally identical shares of both loans and equity investment and where there is no significant external financing in the company generally, the risk of the loan is considered to be identical with the risk of the equity investment. ATP considers such loans as an integral part of the equity investment and therefore presents both the loan and the equity investment as equity investments which are both measured at fair value with value adjustments via the income statement.\n\n## Accounting estimates\n\nMeasuring  the  accounting  value  of  certain  assets and  liabilities  requires  estimations  and  assumptions regarding  future  events.  The  management  base  their estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable and relevant\n\nunder the circumstances. ATP's management considers the following estimations to be central to the preparation of the consolidated financial statement:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to determining fair value of equity investments, bonds and loans are described in notes 10 and 11.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to the valuation of the Group's investment properties are described in note 12.\n- \u00b7 Estimates related to the valuation of the Group's derivatives are described in note 14.\n- \u00b7 Estimates  related  to  valuing  guaranteed  benefits are primarily concerned with discounting factor and future life expectancy for ATP's members. For Life annuity with market exposure, the estimates only concern expectations about future life expectancies. Note 16 states the primary assumptions applied in connection with valuing guaranteed benefits.",

The consolidated financial statements and parent com -pany financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP' (available in Danish only).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2023 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the Parent Com -pany for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP' (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension -available in Danish only).\n\n## Basis of opinion\n\nWe have conducted our audit in accordance with the Financial Supervisory Authority's executive order on auditing of the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Scheme, AES - the Labour Market Occupational Diseases Fund, LD - the Employees' Capital Pension Fund and in accordance with international auditing standards and any additional requirements applicable in Denmark. This requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform our audit with a view to obtaining reasonable assurance that the consolidated finan -cial statements and parent company financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nThe audit is planned and executed in such a way that we have assessed the business processes and internal control procedures, including the risk management planned by the management that is directed towards the rendering of accounts and essential business risks.\n\ndit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in consolidated financial statements and parent company financial state -ments. The audit procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and parent company financial statements, whether due to fraud or errors. In making these risk assessments, the auditors consider internal controls relevant to the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund's preparation of consolidated finan -cial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view. The aim is to develop auditing actions that are appropriate for the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies applied by Management and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial statements and parent company financial statements. Our au -dit has covered the significant aspects and areas of risk, and we believe that the auditory evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Statement on the management's review\n\nThe management is responsible for the management's review.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements does not include the man -agement's review, and we do not express any kind of opinion on the management's review.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial state -ments and the parent company financial statements, it is our responsibility to read the management's review and in this connection consider whether it is significantly inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, the Parent Company's financial statements or the knowledge we gained during the au -dit or if there is otherwise found to be significant misinformation.\n\nIt is furthermore our responsibility to consider whether the management's review contains the information required pursuant to the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'.\n\nBased on the work performed, we believe that the management's review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP)'. We have not found any material misstatement in the Management's review.\n\nAn audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain au-\n\n## To the Board of Representatives\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and parent  company  financial  statements  of  the  Danish  Labour Market  Supplementary  Pension  Fund  (ATP)  for  the  financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023, comprising the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, cash flow statement and notes, including the accounting policies for the Group as well as the Parent Company. The consolidated financial statements and parent com -pany financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP' (available in Danish only).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2023 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the Parent Com -pany for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with additional Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP' ('Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension').\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our audit statement to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with international auditing standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibility according to these standards and requirements is described in detail in the section 'Auditors' responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial state -ments and parent company financial statements' in the audi -tors' report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountant's international guidelines for accountant ethics (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements that apply in Denmark, and we have also fulfilled our other ethical obligations pursuant to these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to pro -vide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no prohibited auditing services have been provided pursuant to Article 5(1) of EU Directive 537/2014.\n\nWe were initially selected as auditors for the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund on 4 February 2009, and have been re-elected annually by representative vote for a total period of 15 years up to and including fiscal year 2023.We were re-elected on 9 February 2019 following a tender procedure.\n\n## Key audit elements\n\nKey audit elements are those elements which, in our professional opinion, were most important to our audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements for the fiscal year 1 January - 31 December 2023. These elements were processed as a part of our audit of the consolidated statements and parent company financial state -ments as a whole and the preparing of our opinion regarding this. We do not provide any separate opinion about these elements.\n\nImplementation of the new executive order on financial reporting, including the international accounting standard IFRS 17 on Insurance Contracts\n\nWith effect from financial year 2023, ATP has implemented the Executive Order on Financial Reports for ATP of 12 December 2023, including implementation of the international accounting standard IFRS 17 on Insurance Contracts.\n\nThis has resulted in significant impact on the presentation of the income statement, the subdivision of the pension provisions and notes, and a change in the discount rate used to calculate the pension provisions.\n\nWe refer to accounting policies, note 28, for a further description and quantification of the amount-related effect. In summary, the changes have resulted in the bonus potential being reduced by DKK 3bn as of 1 January 2023\n\nIFRS 17 is a complex accounting standard that requires significant interpretations and assumptions in connection with its implementation.\n\nWe have therefore determined that the implementation of IFRS17 is a key audit matter, in particular in relation to interpretations and assumptions in connection with the restatement of items and notes as well as the method for discounting provisions.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we have reviewed the interpretations and assumptions made by management in connection with the restatement of accounting items and notes as well as the method for discounting provisions.\n\nOur audit procedures, which involved our own national and international IFRS 17 specialists and qualified actuaries, included the following elements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Assessing the reasonableness of management's interpretations and assumptions made in connection with the implementation of IFRS 17 and whether they are consistent with the standard.\n- Assessment of the method used to determine the discount rate, including illiquidity premiums.\n- Assessing whether the presentation and content of the items in the income statement, including changes in comparative figures, are in accordance with the requirements of the standard.\n- \u00b7 Assessing whether the changes and content of the notes to the financial statements are in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Executive Order on Accounting and the standard.\n\n## K e y e l em en t\n\n## A u d i t i n g t h e k e y e l e m e n t",

Measuring unlisted investments is considered a key element for the audit, as such measurement is affected by management estimates and assumptions regarding future events and particularly for 2023, the macro-economic uncertainties.\n\nIt is our assessment that the primary risks relate to changes to assumptions and the methods and models applied. Changes to assumptions and the methods and models applied can significantly affect the measuring of unlisted investments.\n\nAssumptions with the greatest degree of management estimation include:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment of future cash flows\n- \u00b7 Determination of return requirement\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation multiples\n- \u00b7 Determination of yield curve and credit spread supplement\n\nManagement has provided details of measurement of unlisted investments in Note 19, Financial assets and liabilities and returns and in Note 15, Fair value disclosure.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we have reviewed the valuation of unlisted investment undertaken by the management and assessed the determined assumptions and the methods and models applied.\n\nOur review included the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment  of  controls  for  valuation  of  unlisted  investments, including procedures for determining assumptions.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Assessment of the preconditions with the most management estimates, including the macro-economic uncertainties and their impact on these.\n- Assessment of the applied methods and models by applying our industry insight and experience focusing on such issues as changes compared with the previous year.\n\n## Measuring guaranteed benefits\n\nFor the Group, guaranteed benefits represent DKK 565.0bn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: DKK 538.6bn\n\n## K e y e l em en t\n\n## A u d i t i n g t h e k e y e l e m e n t\n\nMeasuring guaranteed benefits is considered a key element of the audit, as the calculation of guaranteed benefits is a complex issue which is to a large extent subject to accounting estimations based on management assessments and assumptions regarding future events. It is our assessment that the primary risks relate to changes to assumptions and applied methods and models. Changes to assumptions and applied methods and models can have significant impact on the measurement of guaranteed benefits.\n\n- Areas involving the greatest degree of management estimates include:\n- \u00b7 Models for valuing guaranteed benefits\n- \u00b7 Calculating future life expectancy (the life expectancy model SAINT).\n- \u00b7 Determining the discount rate.\n\nThe management has provided a description of the measuring of guaranteed benefits in Note 16, pension provisions.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we have reviewed the valuation of guaranteed benefits performed by Management and assessed the model applied and the determined assumptions.\n\nOur auditing activities, in which we have included our own, internationally qualified actuaries, have included the following elements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Assessment of controls in actuary models, data collection and analysis and procedures for determining assumptions. Independent actuary assessment of applied data, methods, models  and  assumptions  relative  to  accepted  actuarial standards, the historic development and trends.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of changes to applied assumptions and applied methods and models relative to last year and developments in industry standards and practices.\n- \u00b7 Independent recalculation of Guaranteed Benefits in an inhouse developed model based on ATP's data.\n\n## K e y e l em en t\n\n## A u d i t i n g t h e k e y e l e m e n t\n\n## Management's  responsibility  for  the  consolidated  financial statements and the parent company financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial state -ments that provide a true and fair representation in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  as adopted by the EU and with Danish disclosure requirements as set out in the 'Executive Order on Financial Reporting by ATP (Bekendtg\u00f8relse om finansielle rapporter for Arbejdsmarkedets Till\u00e6gspension). Management is also responsible for the internal controls considered necessary by Management  to  prepare  consolidated  financial  statements and parent company financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements and parent company financial statements, Management is re -sponsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue their operations; for providing informa -tion on matters relating to the continued operations, where relevant; and for preparing consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements based on the go -ing concern basis of accounting, unless Management intends to either liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or cease operations or has no other realistic alternative than doing this.\n\n## Auditors' responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements\n\nOur goal is to obtain a high degree of assurance that the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report with an opinion. A high degree of assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards and in accordance with additional Danish requirements will always identify material misstatement where such exists. Misstatements may arise as a result of fraud or error and may be deemed to be material if it could reasonably be expected that they, separately or collectively, affect the financial decisions made by the users on the basis of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we make professional judgements and maintain professional scepticism during our audit. Moreover:\n\n- \u00b7 We identify and assess the risk of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and parent com -\n\nny financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, we design and perform audit procedures in response to these risks and we obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not identifying material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than in connection with material misstatement resulting from error as fraud may comprise conspiracy, forgery, deliberate omission, misrepresentation or override of internal controls.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 We determine whether the accounting policies applied by Management are appropriate and whether the accounting estimates and related information prepared by Management are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 We express an opinion on whether Management's preparation of the consolidated financial statements and par -ent  company  financial  statements  based  on  the  go -ing concern basis of accounting is appropriate and on whether, based on the audit evidence obtained, material uncertainty is attached to events or conditions that may give rise to significant doubt about the Group's and the company's ability to continue their operations. If we express the opinion that there is material uncertainty, we must in our auditors' report draw attention to information thereon in the consolidated financial statements and par -ent company financial statements or, if such information is insufficient, we must modify our opinion. Our opinions are based on the audit evidence obtained until the date of our auditors' report. Future events or conditions may, however, result in the Group and the company becoming unable to continue operations.\n- \u00b7 We consider the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements and parent company financial  statements,  including  disclosures  in the notes, and whether the consolidated financial state -ments and parent company financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events in such a way that they provide a true and fair view thereof.\n- \u00b7 We  obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence about the financial information regarding the entities or business activities in the Group for use for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial statements. We are responsible for directing, supervising and conducting the consolidated financial statements audit. We are solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the senior management on, among",
