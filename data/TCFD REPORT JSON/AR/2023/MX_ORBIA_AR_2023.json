Revenues  were  higher  in  Fluor  &  Energy Materials,  particularly  in  refrigerants,  but  decreased  across  other  businesses.  Primary  drivers  of  the  year-over-year decrease included lower PVC and caustic soda pricing and volumes for Polymer Solutions, weaker demand in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ('EMEA') for Building & Infrastructure and deferrals of customer projects due primarily to high interest rates in Connectivity Solutions.\n\nEBITDA  decreased  24%  in  2023  to  $1,460  million  due  to  lower  prices  and  softer  demand  across  most  markets, particularly in Polymer Solutions, Building & Infrastructure and Connectivity Solutions. The decrease was partially offset by higher profitability in Fluor & Energy Materials. EBITDA margin decreased approximately 200 basis points to 18%.\n\nIn 2022, Orbia's net revenues increased 10% to $9,648 million and EBITDA decreased 7% to $1,909 million as compared to 2021. Revenues increased across all businesses, except for Precision Agriculture. Primary drivers of the year-overyear increase included strong PVC pricing in the Polymer Solutions businesses, particularly during the first half of the year,  strong  demand  in  Connectivity  Solutions  and  improved  pricing  across  the  Fluor  &  Energy  Materials  product portfolio. EBITDA decreased due to softening demand across certain markets in the second half of the year, coupled with higher input costs. EBITDA margin decreased approximately 350 basis points to 19.8%.\n\nIn  2021,  Orbia's  net  revenues  increased  37%  to  $8,783  million  and  EBITDA  increased  55%  to  $2,047  million  as compared to 2020. Primary drivers of the year-over-year increase included high PVC prices in Polymer Solutions and higher demand in Building and Infrastructure contributing to a 280 basis point increase of EBITDA to 23.3%.\n\nThe following graph shows the breakdown of total sales by business group after inter-company eliminations within Orbia.",

The Company has manufacturing operations related to its Precision Agriculture business in Israel. This conflict has not had a material impact on the Company's financial condition nor results of operations. Continued conflict involving Israel or more broadly in the Middle East could disrupt the Company's production or ability to make and supply certain Precision Agriculture products.\n\n## 2022:\n\n- \uf0b7 In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine resulting in the United States, Canada, the European Union and other countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia.

As a result of the invasion, the Company discontinued all operations and sales in Russia.

        "page_content": "- \uf0b7 Unfavorable economic changes in business and the general economy may cause demand for the Company's products  to  fall;  particularly  those  in  the  residential,  commercial  or  industrial  construction  industry  being strongly tied to the stability or instability that prevails in each country;\n- \uf0b7 Considering the competitive environment in which Orbia operates, lower demand can put pressure on the prices of its products;\n- \uf0b7 The market dynamics of supply and demand for both its products and its raw materials, and the other raw materials that affect  them, may result in fluctuations in  the prices of some  or all of its products or its raw materials, which could affect its sales or margins.\n\nDue to the cyclical nature of the global chemical industry, historically the international chemical market has  experienced changing periods of limited supply, which has caused prices and profit margins to increase, followed by an expansion of production capacity, resulting in oversupply causing lower prices and profit margins. Orbia sets prices for the products the Company sells based on international market prices. The chemical industries in Europe and Latin America have become increasingly integrated with the global chemical industry for a variety of reasons, including increased demand and consumption of chemicals in these regions, as well as the continued integration of regional and global product markets. The Issuer's net sales and gross margins are tied to global industry conditions that it cannot control. The Company is particularly sensitive to the economic cycles that affect the construction, infrastructure, agricultural and automotive industries.\n\nThroughout the years, demand has been exposed to such circumstances. These cycles can lead to significant changes in the Issuer's quarterly operating or annual results, limiting its ability to forecast its operating performance, cash flows and financial position.\n\n## The Company's operations are dependent on industries that can be cyclical.\n\nSome of Orbia's suppliers and customers participate in, or are influenced by, industries that can exhibit significant cyclicality. This includes industries such as energy that have historically undergone periods of slowdown and sometimes recession. The demand for some of Orbia's products and services, as well as the supply of some of its raw materials depend on the level of investment by companies in such industries, which in turn partially depend on the overall price levels of oil, natural gas and other energy sources. Oil prices have been highly volatile in recent years. A continued decline in investments in these industries, whether due to a decrease in prices, higher costs or overall less attractive economic conditions, could cause delays in the Company's customers' projects, and thus demand for some of its products and services or a lack of supply of some of the raw materials can cause pressure on the expected prices of its products or costs of its raw materials, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Orbia's operating results, cash flows and financial position.\n\nSome of Orbia's customers or suppliers also depend on oil and natural gas production levels. Interruptions or decreases in  the production of such supplies, due to various circumstances beyond the Company's control, including adverse weather conditions, accidents, decreased access to the financial system, labor contingencies, work stoppages, strikes, or others, may cause delays in customers' investments or increases in the production costs of the Company's raw materials which may impact the Company's results from operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\nOrbia is committed to invest in materials and solutions that enable the world's rapid transition to sustainable energy. Future demand for these products could be lower than the projected outlook, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial position.\n\nThe  Company's  inability  to  meet  market  needs  due  to  lack  of  development  of  new  products,  production technologies, access to new technologies, or development of substitutes could adversely affect its competitive position.\n\nThe  markets  for  many  of  the  products  made  by  the  Company  require  continuous  improvements  in  quality  and performance. To remain competitive, the Company must develop and market products that meet market needs in a timely manner. Additionally, rapid changes in the marketplace may shorten the life cycle of the Company's existing products,  thus  impairing  the  Company's ability  to  recover  investments made  to  manufacture  those products.  If  the Company is  unable  to  keep  pace  with  technological  improvements  and  market  demand,  its  operating  results  and financial position could be adversely and significantly affected.\n\nIn addition, development of new technologies could result in the creation of new products or raw materials that could replace those currently produced or used by the Company. If the Company is unable to compete with such new products or access newly required raw materials, its results of operations could be adversely and materially affected.",

        "page_content": "The Company's business is subject to risks generally associated with international commercial operations and its net earnings and sales could be adversely affected by the economic conditions and outlook in the countries where it operates\n\nOrbia  markets  its  products  in  more  than  100  countries.  The  Company  participates  in  manufacturing  and  other commercial activities on six continents. As a result, the Company is, and will continue to be, subject to the risks generally associated with international manufacturing and distribution, the adverse economic conditions and other political, social and regulatory conditions in the countries where it conducts business that may impact the demand for its products and, ultimately, its net earnings and sales, including:\n\n- \uf0b7 Government regulations on manufacturing and/or foreign investment activities;\n- \uf0b7 Modifications to policies on taxes or trade tariffs on import or export from and to those countries;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in social, political and economic conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Freight delays;\n- \uf0b7 Blackouts or shortages of electricity and other public services;\n- \uf0b7 Restrictions on currency conversion and volatility in foreign exchange markets;\n- \uf0b7 Restrictions on skilled labor and changes in local working conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Restrictions  related  to  the  sale  of  products,  including  trademarks,  in  connection  with  third  party  intellectual property rights;\n- \uf0b7 Difficulties in complying with contractual obligations in jurisdictions outside of Mexico, as well as in collecting payments abroad;\n- \uf0b7 Environmental regulations;\n- \uf0b7 Tax reforms and other laws and regulations;\n- \uf0b7 Recessionary conditions or negative or slowing economic growth rates;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in local or international interest rates that affect the exchange rate; and\n- \uf0b7 Austerity  measures  and  reduction  or  elimination  of  subsidies  and  incentives  to  the  industries  in  which  the Company operates.\n\nSome  of  the  countries  where  Orbia  operates  have  experienced  political  and  social  instability  in  the  past,  and interruptions of operations may occur at any of the production facilities or to the distribution networks in those countries. Additionally,  other  potential  economic  risks  include:  inflationary  conditions  and  the  associated  monetary  policies  to control it, high energy and raw material prices, supply disruptions, global economic deceleration and potential recession, economic deceleration ahead of expectations in some markets, volatility in financial markets, political uncertainty and geopolitical risks around the world.\n\nThe foregoing factors, as well as government regulations applicable to foreign investment and/or the import, export or sale of products and protectionist measures could adversely affect sales and operating results, and in the past have caused distributors, intermediaries and customers to reduce their spending and to delay or stop purchasing products, which could have an adverse effect on Orbia's net sales, operating results and cash flows.\n\n## Orbia faces intense competition from other suppliers of similar products\n\nThe markets for  Orbia  products  are  highly  competitive.  The  Company  generally  has  no  or  limited  control  over  the prevailing pricing on  international markets of the  products it  sells, such  as chlorine, caustic soda, resin and  fluorite compounds and fluorite. The competitiveness of these products is based on price, performance, product quality, product delivery and customer service, among others. It is difficult to protect the Company's market position for many of its basic products by differentiating them due to standardized quality measures, and the Company may not be able to pass on higher raw material costs through price increases associated with those products to customers. In many cases, the competitive environments for its various products may vary significantly at any time, and its ability to adjust the product mix based on market conditions may be limited due to inherent restrictions on production processes.\n\nOrbia's competitors include larger companies or those well positioned within international chemical markets, including those in Europe, Asia and Latin America, or companies that have greater competitive advantages due to a combination of several factors, such as greater access to financial resources, benefits derived from integration and economies of scale, availability of raw materials at lower costs, diversification and risk management. Orbia's main competitors have made significant capital investments, which have enabled them to obtain and maintain a significant market share. Such situations, as well as increased competition, may have adverse effects on the Company's operating results, cash flow or financial condition.\n\nFluctuations in the prices of the Company's main raw materials, including natural gas, electric power, sulfur, ethane, ethylene, resins, among others, may adversely affect the Company's business and operating results.\n\nIn recent years, the prices of electricity, natural gas, sulfur, ethane, ethylene, resins, among other raw materials and supplies,  have  experienced  significant  price  and  volume  fluctuations  in  local  and  international  markets.  These",

        "page_content": "fluctuations cause variations in production and sales costs, which in turn are reflected in the margins of the products the Company manufactures and markets. In addition, prices of oil and oil products have been volatile, affecting the selling price of products such as ethylene, VCM and PVC, as well as their production and sales costs.\n\nAlthough Orbia generally transfers any price increase in raw materials to its customers, it is not always possible to do so. Future fluctuations in the prices of electric power, natural gas, ethane, ethylene and sulfur, resins, among others, which it uses in manufacturing processes and which have recently experienced volatility, could result in variations in the cost of the supplies the Company uses to manufacture its products. Similarly, oil price volatility can impact the prices of some of the Company's products, which in turn negatively affects the Company's operating results and financial position.\n\n## Any interruption in the supply of raw materials could affect Orbia's operations.\n\nOrbia's ability to achieve its strategic objectives continues to depend, in a large part, on the successful, timely and costeffective acquisition of electric power and raw materials such as natural gas, ethane, ethylene, electricity, VCM, PVC, Polyethylene and other plastic resins. Currently, the Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for the production and delivery of these supplies. Management cannot ensure the stability of the gas supply, nor the availability of supplies at reasonable prices or that suppliers will continue to supply them.\n\nTherefore, any interruption, discontinuance or other disruption in the markets or the supply of raw materials or electric power, including a substantial increase in the costs thereof, could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and operating results. Similarly, a decrease in the supply of certain raw materials, or in the number of raw material suppliers, may result in an increase in the prices paid for the supply of these raw materials, in which case Orbia's operating results and financial position could also be adversely affected.\n\n## Production capacity improvements, maintenance and investment in acquired companies, generally require significant  expenditures  and  the  Company  cannot  guarantee  it  will  achieve  the  expected  return  on  these actions.\n\nOrbia continuously engages in significant capital investments related to the maintenance of its production capacities, environmental protection and safety, worker and facility safety, efficiency and modernization of its plants. In addition, the Company has made several acquisitions in recent years to support the growth of its businesses.\n\nOrbia may not be able to obtain the expected return on its investments if unfavorable conditions arise in the markets where it commercializes its products. Decisions regarding the timing or manner in which such investments are executed are based on projections of future market demand and other factors that may be inaccurate. Current projects may not be  completed  on  time  or  at  all  due  to  factors  such  as  the  inability  to  obtain  financing,  regulatory  changes,  lack  of compliance or availability of contractors and subcontractors and logistical problems. Such factors could have a material adverse effect on Orbia's operating results, including impairments charges of assets related to such investments.\n\n## Orbia is exposed to the risk of possible expropriation or nationalization of its assets in some of the countries where it operates.\n\nSome of the countries in which Orbia operates have been subject to volatile political conditions in the recent past and the Company cannot guarantee that local governments will not impose retroactive changes that could affect its business or eventually force it to renegotiate existing contracts with such governments. These events could materially affect the Company's financial position and operating results.\n\n## Inability to effectively manage growth could adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and financial position.\n\nAs a result of organic and inorganic growth projects, the Issuer's EBITDA has grown significantly. In addition, Orbia's operating  income  and  cash  flows  have  increased  substantially,  which  provides  the  Company's  management  with flexibility  to  continue  to  grow.  This  growth  has  resulted,  and  will  continue  to  result,  in  significant  demands  on  the Company's administrative, operational and financial resources. Orbia's capability to continue achieving its long-term growth objectives will depend on its leadership's ability to effectively manage these factors while continuing to focus on commercial and product development initiatives.\n\n## Orbia is subject to certain restrictive covenants which could limit its future business activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Issuer had cost bearing debt totaling $4,886 million, with a series of lines of credit and issuances of securities in local and international markets. Pursuant to the agreements governing its long-term credit facilities, the Company is obligated to comply with certain covenants that limit its operations and financial decisions. Compliance with its obligations under the credit agreements could limit the Company's ability to pursue future organic and inorganic growth projects or future financing or refinancing of debt, which could have a negative impact on the",

See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, annex to this Annual Report for further details regarding the Company's covenants.\n\n## Orbia has recently made, and may make, important acquisitions that, if not properly integrated, could adversely affect its operating results.\n\nOrbia has recently made significant acquisitions, and may consider making additional relevant acquisitions, to continue pursuing its growth objectives. For more information regarding these acquisitions, see section \"Investments made in the last three fiscal years', in Chapter 2, section v, 'General Business Strategy'.\n\n## Acquisitions themselves involve risks, including the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 Acquired businesses may not achieve the expected results;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in the economic conditions affecting expected growth within the markets where the acquired companies are present;\n- \uf0b7 Failure to achieve expected synergies;\n- \uf0b7 Increases in costs, supplies and energy;\n- \uf0b7 Difficulties encountered in the integration of operations, technologies and control systems;\n- \uf0b7 Possible inability to hire or retain key personnel for acquired operations;\n- \uf0b7 Possible inability to achieve the expected economies of scale;\n- \uf0b7 Unforeseen liabilities; and\n\n\uf0b7\n\n- \uf0b7 Unforeseen economic competition and regulatory considerations.\n\nThe Company may face difficulties in the integration of operations, accounting systems and internet technology systems of  some  of  its  acquired  companies.  If  the  Company  is  unable  to  successfully  integrate  or  manage  the  acquired operations, it may not achieve the expected cost savings, increased revenues and levels of integration necessary to offset the significant expenses associated with the acquisition of the companies. This could result in lower profitability or impairment charges.\n\n## Orbia is exposed to product risks that could cause harm to third parties.\n\nThe Company may be exposed to risks or damages derived from civil liability before third parties, resulting from the use of its products, as well as litigation of the resulting judicial process, regardless of whether said products are used in a manner contrary to what is indicated. The Company may also be exposed to damages related to the use of its products in medical-grade applications and for the food and beverage industries.\n\nOrbia has tailored market standard insurance coverage for this type of product risk. However, the safety measures taken to prevent product risks and insurance coverage may not be adequate to mitigate the risk of all damages that may occur, in which case the Company's operating results or its financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Impacts related to climate change could result in additional regulatory or legal requirements or unforeseen required investments.\n\nThe Company has carried out different analyses to determine the degree of vulnerability of its operations to the possible effects of climate change.\n\nClimate change impacts identified where Orbia operates or has market share include: desertification and drought, rising sea levels, changes in rainfall patterns, decreased water availability, deforestation and disease.  All are phenomena that could affect Orbia's operating results and financial position due to the need for additional investments to adapt operations to new conditions, the increase in the price of supplies and energy, the closure of affected operations and relocation of suppliers, protection measures as a result of natural phenomena (i.e. the construction of dikes in marine installations, flood or fire protection, etc.) and the relocation of facilities to sites with more favorable conditions and higher environmental regulatory requirements, among over potential impacts.\n\n## Natural disasters, production hazards, extreme weather and other events could adversely affect the Company's operations.\n\nNatural disasters,  such as  storms,  hurricanes and  earthquakes, could disrupt  operations, damage  infrastructure or adversely affect the Company's production plants. In addition, Orbia is vulnerable to acts of vandalism or revolts that could affect its infrastructure and/or its distribution network. Any of these events could increase Orbia's expenses or investments and/or result in a force majeure event under some of its contracts consequently affecting its operating results and financial position.\n\nOrbia's operations are also subject to hazards such as fires, explosions and other accidents related to the manufacture, storage and transportation of chemicals. These hazards can range from personal injury to loss of life, property damage",

A material incident at one of its plants or storage facilities could result in the temporary suspension of operations and could result in significant compensation costs and loss of net sales revenue.\n\n## Labor disputes could affect Orbia's operating results.\n\nAt the end of fiscal year 2023, approximately 52% of the Company's employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. Over the past three years, Orbia has had no major labor disputes at its plants and has been  able  to  maintain  a  positive  relationship  with  the  unions.  However,  it  cannot  guarantee  that  there  will  be  no temporary suspension, nor that a strike will not take place, before, during the term of, or upon expiration of collective bargaining agreements as a result of political or economic conditions, or for any other reason. In addition, Orbia is unable to estimate the adverse effects, if any, that such temporary suspensions or strikes would have on the Issuer's sales, operating results or financial position. Any temporary suspension, strike or other labor event could have a material adverse effect on its activities, operating results or financial position.\n\n## Armed conflicts and or terrorist attacks may adversely impact Orbia's businesses.\n\nArmed  conflicts  and  terrorist  attacks  may  adversely  impact  Orbia's  businesses.  The  Company  operates  global businesses  with  manufacturing  and  commercial  operations  throughout  the  world.   Conflicts  or  terrorist  attacks,  for example those in Israel and in Ukraine, could harm the Company's employees, directly damage its facilities and assets, disrupt its supply chains and logistics and create broader geopolitical instability, negatively affecting the Company's profitability. The Company's Precision Agriculture business has manufacturing operations in Israel, therefore, continued conflict there could disrupt Orbia's ability to produce and supply certain Precision Agriculture products. Although Orbia does not have manufacturing operations in Russia or Ukraine, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is negatively impacting economic conditions in Europe.  This could reduce demand for Orbia products in the EMEA region, and negatively impact  the  Company  and  its customers'  ability  to  operate  in  Europe,  harm its  suppliers and increase  its  operating costs.  Other countries and regions in which Orbia operates may also experience armed conflict or Terrorist attacks.\n\n## Orbia is a holding company and does not have significant assets other than the shares in its subsidiaries; as a result, it may not be able to meet its obligations.\n\nOrbia is a holding company with no independent operations or substantial assets other than the net worth of its operating companies. It is therefore dependent on the operating results of its subsidiaries. The ability of Orbia to meet its debt and other obligations depends on the generation of cash flow from its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available in the form of interest payments, debt payments, dividends or otherwise. Each of its subsidiaries is a separate legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit its ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. In addition, under Mexican law, Mexican subsidiaries may only pay dividends from retained earnings after  a  legal  reserve  has  been  created  and  all  losses  from  prior  tax  years  have  been  absorbed.  In  addition,  the distribution of dividends may be taxable unless they are made from a profit and loss account that has already been subject to tax. If it does not receive distributions from its subsidiaries, the Company may be unable to make the required principal and interest payments on its debt or to pay other obligations. Any adverse change in the financial position or operating results of its subsidiaries could affect the Company's financial position.\n\n## Inability to raise enough capital to finance organic and inorganic growth projects that could delay or impede the implementation of the Company's business strategy.\n\nThe Issuer expects that the expansion and continued development of its operations may require significant amounts of capital  to  finance  investments  and  operating  expenses,  including  working  capital  requirements,  which  may  not  be obtained in full or at least not on acceptable terms.\n\nIn addition, its operations may not generate enough cash flow to meet its cash needs, or capital requirements may vary significantly from those planned. In such cases, additional funding may be required ahead of schedule, or some of the new development and expansion plans may be delayed, or the Company may miss market opportunities. Future lending instruments, such as credit lines, may contain restrictive clauses and may require the Company to pledge assets to secure payments on such credit lines. The inability to obtain additional capital and/or to obtain it on satisfactory terms may delay or prevent Orbia's growth projects and adversely affect its operating results, cash flow and financial position.\n\n## Orbia uses financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and/or foreign exchange rates.\n\nOrbia is exposed to interest rate risk because a portion of its debt is at a variable interest rate, as well as foreign exchange risk, because it has debt and investments in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's exposure to  interest  rate  changes  is  primarily  concentrated  in  Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate  (SOFR),  LIBOR,  and  the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (TIIE), which are reference rates used for financial liabilities, whereas the Company's exchange rate exposure is primarily due to debt and investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.",

Hedging transactions are regularly evaluated to ensure that they are aligned with interest rates and related risks thereby guaranteeing the most effective hedging strategy is in place, however the Company cannot guarantee the effectiveness of its hedging strategies.\n\n## The Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights and may unknowingly infringe on the rights of others.\n\nThe Company may not be able to prevent third parties from using its patents and trademarks without its authorization or from otherwise infringing on its intellectual property rights. The intellectual property laws of the various jurisdictions where Orbia operates and the enforcement of such laws by the authorities in such jurisdictions may not be efficient, which may affect the Company's ability to protect its rights over its intellectual property. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful if it tries to enforce its intellectual property rights. Because the Company believes that its patents and trademarks are one of its competitive advantages, if management is unable to enforce these intellectual property rights, the business could be adversely and substantially affected. In addition, any legal proceedings to enforce Orbia's intellectual property rights could be expensive and accordingly could adversely affect the Company's operating results.\n\nAlthough the Company takes measures to ensure that it does not infringe upon third party intellectual property rights, management cannot guarantee that Orbia's processes and products do not infringe, or have not infringed at any time, on the intellectual property rights of third parties. Additionally, the Company cannot guarantee that third parties will not take any legal action for possible infringement on their intellectual property rights which may be successful.\n\n## The Company is subject to legal and administrative proceedings in certain countries where it operates, the results of which could adversely affect its business\n\nOrbia is the plaintiff or defendant in multiple judicial or administrative proceedings regarding its ordinary operations in various foreign jurisdictions. The Company is fully committed to complying with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where it operates.\n\nHowever, in the event that such proceedings are initiated and/or the outcome thereof is not in the Company's interests, and the Company is unable to protect its interests, Orbia's operations, operating results or financial position may be adversely affected.\n\n## The costs of breach of environmental, health and safety laws, as well as any contingencies arising in relation to such laws, may increase, adversely affecting Orbia's operations, operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\nOrbia produces, distributes and transports hazardous materials as part of its operations, which involves risks of leaks and spills that could potentially affect both people and the environment. The Company also produces, distributes and sells products that are dangerous or have certain levels of global warming potential that may be restricted in the future. As a result, the Company is subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, health and safety, among other factors, that govern the generation, storage, handling, use, repair, disposal, transport, emission and discharge of hazardous materials on land, in the air or in water, as well as the health and safety of its employees. In addition, chemical producers are sometimes subject to unfavorable trade perceptions by third parties as a result of the potential environmental impact of their businesses, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results, cash flow and financial position.\n\nGiven  the  nature  of  Orbia's  commercial  operations,  the  Company  is  required  to  obtain  permits  from  government authorities to manufacture certain products. The Company cannot guarantee that it has complied, or will always fully comply, with such laws, regulations and permits. If the Company violates or breaches these laws, regulations or permits, regulators may fine or otherwise sanction the company. The Company could also be responsible for any consequences arising from human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.\n\nEnvironmental protection laws are complex, change frequently, and tend to become stricter over time. Although the Company has budgeted for the capital requirements and operating expenses necessary to continue to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, management cannot guarantee that the latter will not change or become stricter in the future, or that regulations applied in certain countries or regions will also be applied and/or adjusted in other countries or regions due to the adoption of international treaties. Subsequent changes in or additions to existing laws or  regulations,  or  the  enforcement  or  application  of  such  laws  or  regulations,  could  cause  the  Company  to  incur significant  unforeseen  capital  expenditures  or  expenses,  which  could  affect  future  profitability  or  financial  position. Therefore, the Company cannot guarantee that the expense of complying with, or the expenses arising from, stricter or different  interpretations  of  applicable  and  future  safety,  health  and  environmental  laws,  as  well  as  the  Company's responsibilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances, will not adversely affect Orbia's business, operating results, cash flow or financial position.",

        "page_content": "## The use of social networks could adversely affect and impact the Company's reputation.\n\nThe use of social networking platforms and similar media, including blogs, social networking sites and other forms of online communication, which allow individual access to a wide audience and interested persons and their influence as agents of perception and opinion, has grown at a phenomenal rate worldwide. Inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of  certain  social  media  platforms  may  result  in  trademark  damage  or  leakage  of  information  that  could  have  legal implications, including the improper dissemination and/or disclosure of personal data. In addition, negative or inaccurate comments or information involving the Company sent through social networks could damage Orbia's reputation, brand image and goodwill.\n\nConsumers value readily available information about retailers, manufacturers and their assets and services, and often act on that information without further research, verification or considering its veracity. Easy access to information on social networking platforms and mobile devices is virtually immediate, as is its impact. Social networking platforms and mobile devices immediately publish the content that their subscribers and participants input, often without filtering or reviewing the accuracy of content. The opportunities to spread information, including false or inaccurate information, are virtually unlimited. Information that concerns Orbia, or that could seriously affect Orbia, may be transmitted through such platforms and devices at any time. This information could be inaccurate and harmful to the Company and could damage the business. This damage could be immediate and the Company may not have the opportunity to alter it or even correct it. These platforms may also be used to disclose trade secrets or put other valuable assets at risk, and in both cases, damage or affect the Company's business, operating results and financial position.\n\n## Orbia's operations could be affected by a failure, interruption or collapse of its IT (Information technology) system.\n\nThe efficient execution of Orbia's operations is based on the implementation of IT-related processes and systems, which are  used  to  effectively  manage  data,  communications,  network  connectivity  and  other  operational  and  business processes. Although the Company constantly improves its IT systems and protects its data with advanced security measures, system errors, interruptions or security breaches, such as computer viruses or theft of information or data, may occur. These failures, interruptions or collapses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results or financial position.\n\nSecurity failures in  Orbia's information  system and technological systems and processes could materially affect its subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers and customers, as well as restrict or adversely affect access to the Company's networks and operating systems, or expose the Company to significant legal, financial, operational and reputational consequences.\n\nThe  execution  of  Orbia's  business  requires  the  use  and  storage  of  personally  identifiable  information  (PII)  from customers,  employees  and  business  partners.  This  information  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  data,  names, addresses,  telephone  numbers,  e-mail  addresses,  contact  preferences,  tax  identification  numbers,  and  account payment information. Because of Orbia's profile, the amount of PII Orbia handles in its operations, and the amount of strategic industrial and technological information stored in the Company's different internal systems, the Company is vulnerable to cyber-attacks and database infiltration.\n\nOrbia invests a significant amount of resources on network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute protection.  For example, e-mails with executable attachments containing malicious software that, due to their complexity, are difficult to block and modify the delivery pattern, could lead to database infiltration. If the Company's internal systems are infiltrated, and it is unable to protect sensitive or strategic data, such infiltration could cause a material adverse change in the Company's business, relationships with business partners and customers, and its operating results and financial position, and could expose the Company to the risk of claims of violation of current General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).\n\n## Cyber-attacks or other disruptions to Orbia's network or information systems could have an adverse effect on the business.\n\nCyber-attacks and disruptions to networks and systems, including the introduction of computer viruses, malicious code, denial of service, faulty software and other disruptions or unauthorized access to company systems, have increased in frequency, range and impact in recent years. The preventive actions Orbia takes to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and to protect its network and information may not be enough to stop a massive cyber-attack in the future. The costs associated  with  a  potential  massive  cyber-attack  on  Orbia's  systems  include  increased  expenses  associated  with strengthening  cyber security measures  and  potential losses associated  with  disruption  to  the  Company's services, lawsuits against the Company, and reputational damage.\n\nCyber-attacks or other disruptions to the Company's security network or information systems could cause equipment failure or disrupt operations. Such failures, even when they occur over a short period of time, could cause significant losses or declines in the market price of Orbia's shares. In addition, potential losses from cyber-attack events and",

        "page_content": "disruptions to Orbia's network could exceed the Company's insurance coverage. Furthermore, cyber-attacks may lead to the distribution, without the Company's consent, of valuable and confidential business financial information and data, including customer data, which in turn could adversely affect operating results, reputation or financial position.\n\n## Orbia's  contracting  model  for  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  products  involves  certain  risks  related  to customer  retention,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  and  business situation.\n\nOrbia sells a substantial amount of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) products under short-term contractual orders. In addition, the Company has long-term contracts, particularly with agreements for voice and data telecommunications products in the U.S., Europe and India, among others. Most of the Company's agreements contain terms and conditions relating to pricing, including any type of resin transfer provision, and in general Orbia's customers are not required to purchase a minimum volume, and contracts can generally be terminated without cause and at short notice. As a result, customers have the ability to discontinue or substantially reduce the purchase of Orbia's products at any time. The loss of customers representing a significant volume of sales, as well as a significant decrease in customer orders for any reason, including changes in customer manufacturing practices, transfer of part of the business to competitors, an economic recession, or the inability to adapt services to the needs of Orbia's customers, can have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position.\n\n## The operations of the Precision Agriculture, Connectivity Solutions and Building and Infrastructure business groups depend on the agriculture, telecommunications and construction industries, respectively.\n\nOrbia's Building and Infrastructure, Connectivity Solutions and Precision Agriculture business groups largely depend on  the  viability  of  the  construction,  infrastructure,  telecommunications  and  agricultural  industries,  respectively.  A slowdown in  the  growth  of  these  industries  in  the  countries  in  which  Orbia  operates,  or  a  negative  change  in  the economic  and  demographic  factors  that  influence  these  industries,  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\n## Changes in investment levels in the voice and data telecommunications industry could affect the production and sales of products in Connectivity Solutions.\n\nThe different investments required by telecommunications industry participants to implement fiber optic and broadband communication systems greatly influence this industry, including the markets in which Orbia's Connectivity Solutions Business competes. Investment in this industry depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\n- \uf0b7 Local and federal regulation on foreign investment in telecommunications;\n- \uf0b7 Consumer demand for fiber optics, broadband and wireless networks for products and services;\n- \uf0b7 Regulatory decisions that limit the installation of new networks and improvements to the existing network;\n- \uf0b7 The rights of way, and permits from local and state governments, in the countries where the business operates, required to access the construction of new networks;\n- \uf0b7 The evolution and acceptance of new standards in the industry;\n- \uf0b7 Pressures related to competition in the sector, including prices;\n- \uf0b7 Annual budget cycles;\n- \uf0b7 Investments in private company projects and their investment cycles;\n- \uf0b7 The impact on industry consolidation;\n- \uf0b7 Access to financing and the general economic conditions of the market;\n- \uf0b7 Price levels;\n- \uf0b7 Existence, creation or improvement of alternative products, new technologies, etc., and;\n- \uf0b7 Political stability.\n\nThe lack of investment in voice and data telecommunications, due to any of these or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on the Connectivity Solutions business group's sales, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Precision  Agriculture's  sales  are  highly  dependent  on  the  strength  of  the  agricultural  industry,  including government support to this sector.\n\nRevenues in Orbia's Precision Agriculture business are cyclical and depend largely on the need for agricultural production of irrigated crops which, in turn, depends on many factors, including total global crop production, profitability of agricultural production, including return on investment for the end users of products, agricultural product prices, farm incomes, availability of financing for farmers, government subsidies for farmers, government policies  and  support  for  agricultural infrastructure,  water supply and transport,  regular rainfall  and regional climate change. Government support for farms including financial aid and policies regarding the ability to use water  for  agricultural  irrigation  can  affect  the  demand  for  Orbia's  irrigation  products  and  irrigation  system solutions.",

Ethane is a raw material used to produce ethylene, which in turn is used in the production of VCM, the raw material necessary for the manufacture of PVC. Variations in PVC, caustic soda and/or ethane prices in the future could affect the Company's operating results and hinder or delay the recovery of the Company's investment in Ingleside.\n\nThe  Company's  mining  concessions  may  be  subject  to  being  declared  invalid,  cancellation,  suspension, expropriation or revocation, pursuant to applicable legal provisions and/or the Company may not be able to renew its existing concessions, which could have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial position.\n\nThe Company owns the rights to several renewable mining concessions, mostly located in Mexico. In Fluor & Energy Materials, there are several mining concessions that expire gradually from 2029 to 2061, which are renewable pursuant to the provisions of the Mining Act in Mexico. Fluor & Energy Materials will take the necessary steps, pursuant to the deadlines established by law, to ensure the renewal of the concessions that are due to expire soon. However, the Company cannot guarantee that such renewals will be granted. Furthermore, and pursuant to Mexican legislation, Fluor & Energy Materials is obligated to verify the investments in exploration and exploitation of these concessions, which to date have been carried out in a timely manner. In addition, PMV has a mining concession for a salt dome in Veracruz, Mexico that expires in 2043.\n\nUnder  Mexican  law,  mineral  resources  belong  to  the  Mexican  nation,  and  the  Federal  Government  may  grant concessions  to  individuals  to  explore  and  exploit  mineral  reserves.  The  Company's  mining  rights  derive  from concessions granted by the Ministry of Economy. The Company's mining operations are mostly located in Mexico and are subject to the regulations and supervision of the respective governmental agencies. Mexican law stipulates that the Federal Government is entitled to declare the rights to the concessions awarded null, cancelled, suspended or void, and such concessions may be subject to additional conditions, or they may not be renewed upon expiration in the event that certain legal grounds are triggered.\n\nAccordingly, the concessions the Company has in Mexico may be revoked without the right to compensation if the Company is unable to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in the concessions. In addition, the lots of land comprising the mining concessions in Mexico, as well as the related assets of its concessions, could be expropriated in the public interest, with a right to compensation, which could be limited to or less than the market value of the assets. In the event of a dispute regarding the amount of compensation, the Company may request that the judicial authority determine such amount. The compensation shall be covered by the State in Mexican pesos, even if payment in kind is agreed. Pursuant to the Expropriation Act, the government will pay compensation within a period of 45 business days from  the  declaration  of  expropriation,  in  pesos  or  through  the  payment  of  another  asset.  The  Mining  Act  and  its regulations do not set forth that, if a competent court decides to cancel a concession, the State must pay compensation to the concession holder.

        "page_content": "Company is unable to ensure fair  compensation,  the  Company's  operating  results  and  financial  position  could  be adversely affected.\n\nSimilarly, Mexican law sets forth that mining concessions will last fifty years, from the date of their registration in the Public Mining Registry and may be extended for the same amount of time subject to certain conditions. Although the Company plans  to  apply  for  such  renewals  and  will  comply  with  all  the  conditions  necessary  to  obtain  them,  the Company cannot guarantee that the concessions will be renewed because the renewal of concessions is subject to the government's discretion. The Company's inability to renew any of its concessions could have a material adverse effect on its operations, operating results, financial position and outlook.\n\nUnder the terms and conditions of the concessions, the Company is required to comply with certain obligations under the Mining Act. Non-compliance may result in administrative sanctions imposed by the Ministry of the Economy or cancellation of the concessions. This could result in a material adverse effect on Orbia's operations, operating results, financial position and outlook.\n\nTo summarize, in the event of a possible expropriation of mining lots or assets used for the exploitation of mining concessions, or if the rights contained in concessions are declared null, cancelled, suspended or revoked, or if Orbia is unable to renew the concessions, or cannot receive adequate or timely compensation, the Company's operating results and financial position may be adversely affected.\n\n## The volume of fluorite reserves and production rate may be different than expected.\n\nThe amount of fluorite reserves in Orbia's mines are determined under standards and practices established for the mining industry, using geological and engineering data to measure the estimated amounts of fluorite deposits that can be economically recovered and processed by mining.\n\nManagement cannot guarantee that estimates of the Company's fluorite reserve quantities will not differ substantially from the quantities of minerals that will be definitively recovered. In addition, fluctuations in market prices and changes in operating and capital costs may cause some of the fluorite reserves to be economically unviable for exploitation. Should this occur, the Company may be unable to obtain enough raw materials to meet its production targets and other commitments, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operating results.\n\n## Epidemics  in  the  countries  where  the  Company  carry  out  its  production  and  commercial  operations  or pandemics that affect all countries could interrupt operations by suspending activities, breaking supply chains or blocking product distribution chains.\n\nOrbia's global operations expose the Company to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus ('COVID-19'). The COVID19  pandemic  and  the  associated  containment  efforts  have  had  a  serious  adverse  impact  on  the  global  economy, including significant disruptions to supply chains and product distribution.\n\nFuture global health crises could materially affect the Company's ability to adequately staff and maintain its operations, including government imposed mandatory closures, work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols or other restrictions to mitigate the further spread of disease. A global health crisis could also disrupt the Company's supply chain and materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to secure supplies for its facilities and to provide personal protective equipment for employees, which could materially and adversely affect its operations.\n\n## Changes in governmental policies in Mexico and other major countries in which the Issuer operates could adversely affect the Company's operations, operating results, financial position and outlook.\n\nThe Mexican Federal Government, as well as the governments of other major countries where the Issuer operates, including the USA, Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom and India, among other countries, have exerted and continue to exert significant influence over the economies of their respective countries, or the political community in which they operate.\n\nAccordingly, the actions and policies of the governments of the countries in which the Company operates could have a material impact on the Company, and more generally on the market conditions, prices and returns of the Company's securities currently traded on the local and international markets.\n\nThere can be no guarantee that changes in the policies of the governments of the countries in which the Company operates will not adversely affect the Company's operations, operating results, financial position and outlook.\n\n## The Company is subject to exchange controls in some of the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe Company is currently subject to exchange controls in some of the countries in which it operates, such as Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa and China, among others. These controls restrict access to foreign currencies and",

In addition, these controls affect Orbia's capacity to receive dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries in these countries.\n\nIf  the Company is prohibited from transferring funds outside of the aforementioned countries or is subject to similar restrictions in other countries in which it operates, Orbia's operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\n\n## Events in Mexico or other countries could adversely affect the Mexican and other Latin American economies, the market value of Orbia's securities, and its operating results.\n\nThe market value of securities of Mexican companies is affected by economic and market conditions in both developed and emerging countries. In recent years, for example, the prices of Mexican debt and equity securities have on occasion undergone substantial declines as a result of events in Mexico or in other countries and markets.\n\nFurthermore, in recent years, there has been a greater correlation between economic conditions in Mexico and the economic  conditions  in  the  U.S.  and  the  European  Union  as  a  result  of  free  trade  agreements  which  resulted  in increased  economic  activity  between  these  parties.  Accordingly,  the  Mexican  economy  continues  to  be  strongly influenced  by  the  U.S.  and  European  economies  and,  therefore,  the  termination  of  free  trade  agreements,  or  a deterioration in economic conditions in, or delays in the recovery of, the economy in the U.S. or Europe, could affect the economy in Mexico and Latin America. These events could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's results  of  operations  and  income,  which  could  affect  its  liquidity,  financial  situation  and/or  the  market  price  of  the securities issued by the Company.\n\n## Foreign exchange fluctuations of the currencies of the countries in which the Company operates, compared to the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect the Company.\n\nBecause Orbia's consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the Company must translate revenues and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in countries where Orbia operates will affect the Company's results of operations and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Furthermore, the Company has exposure to foreign currency movements because certain foreign currency transactions need to be converted to a different currency for settlement. These conversions can have a direct impact on the Company's cash flows.\n\nThe Company manages foreign exchange risk through normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate,  through  the  use  of  derivative  instruments.  The  Company  cannot  be  certain,  however,  that  it  will  be successful in reducing the risks inherent as of result of the exposures to foreign currencies.\n\n## Antitrust laws in Mexico and other countries in which Orbia operates may limit the Company's ability to expand its operations.\n\nIn Mexico and in the countries where Orbia operates, antitrust laws and related regulations could adversely affect the Company's ability to acquire or sell companies and execute joint ventures. The approval of the Federal Economic Competition Commission in Mexico, and of the authorities of each country on this matter, is required for acquisitions, sales or significant joint ventures to be carried out. Failure to obtain antitrust authority approvals could result in fines, mandatory  divestiture  of  assets,  termination  of  key  acquisition  contracts,  or  the  inability  to  continue  business acquisitions or conclude those already agreed upon. The Company continues to expand its operations and may face stricter audits by the competent competition authorities in the various countries where it operates or in the countries which it intends to enter.\n\nOrbia currently has a relevant position in most of the markets where it operates in both Latin America and Europe, according to data published by IHS Markit WVA, IHS Markit Chlor-alkali Market Report, Eurostat Economist Intelligence Unit, and market studies conducted by Orbia. Therefore, as the Company's operations and market position increase, the risks of limitations from antitrust regulations related to future acquisitions increases, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial and operating results and ability to grow.\n\nThe Mexican Congress and the legislative authorities of the countries in which Orbia has a presence may approve legislation that results in increases in tax obligations.\n\nIn recent years, the Mexican government and some of the governments of the countries in which the Company operates have  implemented  various  reforms  to  the  tax  laws  applicable  to  companies,  including  Orbia.  Should  the  Mexican government or any of the governments of the countries in which Orbia operates enact tax law reforms that result in",

The tax position of the authorities could differ from the Company's current or historical tax position, which could result in the payment of higher taxes on items for which the Company was not previously taxed, in addition to the conduct of audits of previous years and tax payments, as well as the imposition of additional taxes.\n\n## IFRS differ  in  several  respects  from  U.S.  financial  reporting  standards  or  many  of  the  Financial  Reporting Standards that apply in the countries in which Orbia operates or in which its securities are traded.\n\nThe Company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, which differ from United States Generally Accepted  Accounting  Principles  in  various  respects.  In  Mexico,  the  USA  and  other  countries,  securities  laws  and regulations have been enacted to promote full and accurate disclosure of corporate information to investors. However, the Company is not required to comply with most of the securities laws in force in the U.S. or other countries. Therefore, the information reported may differ from and be presented in a manner that differs from the information available from companies operating or trading in the U.S. or other countries that are required to report their information according to securities listing standards that are prevalent in those countries.\n\n## (b) Risk Factors related to Securities Issued by the Company.\n\n## The market price of outstanding shares can fluctuate significantly.\n\nVolatility in the market price of ORBIA* shares could prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at the same price or at a higher price than they paid for them. The market price and market liquidity of ORBIA* shares could be significantly affected by several factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control and are not directly related to the Company's performance. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \uf0b7 Changes in the market valuation of companies offering similar products;\n- \uf0b7 Economic, regulatory, political and market conditions in Mexico, the U.S., Europe and other countries;\n- \uf0b7 Industry conditions or trends;\n- \uf0b7 Emergence of technological innovations that could make products and services less attractive or obsolete;\n- \uf0b7 The introduction of new products and services by the Company or its competitors;\n- \uf0b7 Historical and projected quarterly and annual operating results;\n- \uf0b7 Differences between actual or expected results and analysts' and investors' expectations;\n- \uf0b7 Announcements by the Company or third parties and events affecting operations;\n- \uf0b7 Announcements, results or actions taken by competitors;\n- \uf0b7 Investor perceptions of the Company or of the services it provides;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in financial or economic estimates by securities analysts;\n- \uf0b7 Environmental  events,  consumer  perceptions  of  environmental  issues  and  compliance  with  environmental laws;\n- \uf0b7 The announcement of significant operations or capital commitments made by the Company;\n- \uf0b7 Changes in laws or regulations;\n- \uf0b7 Currency devaluations and imposition of capital controls;\n- \uf0b7 Incorporation or departure of key management personnel; or\n- \uf0b7 Future sales of shares.\n\nIn addition, the securities markets and, in particular, the securities markets of companies in Mexico and Latin America have experienced extreme fluctuations in prices and volumes that have often been unrelated to, or disproportionate to, the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the price of Orbia* shares, regardless of actual operating performance.\n\n## Under Mexican law, shareholders' rights may be more limited, different or vague than in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe corporate affairs of the Company are governed by the provisions of its articles of association and Mexican law, which may differ from the legal principles that would apply if it were incorporated in any jurisdiction in the U.S., such as the states of Delaware or New York, or in any jurisdiction other than Mexico. For example, under Mexican law, the protection afforded to minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of directors and officers are, in some respects, lesser than or different to those in the USA or other jurisdictions. In particular, the legal regime of the fiduciary duties of directors in Mexico is not as comprehensive or developed as it is in the U.S.. In addition, the criteria for determining the independence of directors differ from the criteria applicable under the laws of other countries.\n\nThe rights of holders of the outstanding shares who protect their interests in connection with any act by the Board of Directors, the Company or any of its members or its principal officers due to breach of their duty of loyalty may be limited or more vague than the rights granted in other jurisdictions. In particular, any action against the Company's officers and",

        "page_content": "directors can only be initiated by holders of at least 5% of the outstanding shares, as opposed to a single shareholder or group of shareholders and are derivative actions on behalf of the Company rather than the affected shareholders. In addition, rules and guidelines on related party transactions and conflicts of interest may not be as well defined in Mexico as they are in the U.S., leaving the shareholders at a possible disadvantage. Furthermore, the duties of loyalty and diligence of directors and officers are defined only in the LMV and have not been interpreted or defined by the competent courts to date; consequently, the judicial interpretation of the meaning and scope of such duties is uncertain. Recently several reforms were published in Mexico that allow for the institution of class actions, however, the procedures for instituting such actions have not been defined. To date, there has not been a sufficient number of claims relating to breach of fiduciary duties, whether through class actions or derivative actions, to give rise to legal claims based on breaches of fiduciary duties or to assist in predicting the outcome of a potential claim. As a result of the foregoing, minority shareholders of the Company have greater difficulty in practice in deciding whether to exercise their rights against the Company or its directors, officers or controlling shareholders than they would have as shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.\n\n## There can be no guarantee that Orbia will be able to pay or maintain cash dividends, and its dividend policies are subject to change. Payment and the amount of dividends are subject to shareholder approval.\n\nThe dividend is recommended by the Board of Directors and approved by the Company's Shareholders' Meeting. While Orbia's principal shareholders continue to own a majority of the shares representing the Company's capital stock, such shareholders may determine whether dividends will be  paid and the  amount of such dividends. As a result of the foregoing, there may be years in which the Company does not distribute dividends and others in which a substantial portion of Orbia's earnings is distributed. If the latter occurs, the Company's growth potential could be limited.\n\nOrbia's  dividend  payment  policy  also  depends  on  the  generation  of  profits,  cash  flow  generation,  and  projected investments in its different business groups. As a result, there are several factors that may affect the availability and intervals of cash dividend payments to Orbia's shareholders.\n\n## If additional shares are issued in the future, shares may be diluted, and the trading price for ORBIA* shares may decrease.\n\nAs part of Orbia's business strategy, future acquisitions or corporate requirements and other expenses may be financed by issuing additional capital stock. Any issuance of Orbia's capital stock would result in the dilution of the Company's investors' equity. In addition, future issues of shares or sales by controlling shareholders, or the announcement of such an issue or sale, could result in a decrease in the market price of the Shares. Accordingly, the market price and market liquidity of ORBIA* shares could be affected by the issuance of additional shares for any of these purposes.\n\n## The principal and related shareholders, who control Orbia, may have interests that differ from the rest of the shareholders and the holders of the Notes\n\nAt the time of the issuance of this Annual Report, the Company's principal shareholder is Kaluz, which is controlled by the del Valle Perochena family which owns approximately 45.81% of the voting capital stock. Therefore, the del Valle Perochena family should be considered to be a significantly influential shareholder pursuant to the LMV. The del Valle Perochena brothers individually own 0.47%, while other shareholders related to the del Valle family have 9.27% of the voting capital stock. Consequently, along with Kaluz, they should be considered a group which have significant influence over the Issuer, pursuant to the LMV.\n\n## Possible breach of the requirements to maintain a list of securities in the Mexican Stock Exchange or to register them in the National Securities Registry could affect the price of securities.\n\nOrbia, as a result of the registration of its Shares in the RNV and their listing in the BMV, is subject to compliance with various disclosure requirements, among others, in order to maintain such registration and listing. In the event that Orbia is unable to comply with such requirements, the listing of Shares on the BMV could be suspended or even cancelled. In such an event, the market price of the Shares and Notes would be adversely affected.\n\n## The Company holds significant levels of debt.\n\nThe Company's level of debt can have significant consequences for the investor. Among other things, it can:\n\n- \uf0b7 Limit the Company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other future general corporate purposes;\n- \uf0b7 Limit the collaterals and guarantees that the Company can offer to obtain additional financing;\n- \uf0b7 Restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends;\n- \uf0b7 Require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n- \uf0b7 Limit flexibility to plan for or react to changes in operations and industry conditions;\n- \uf0b7 Limit the Company's ability to carry out additional acquisitions or to invest in internal growth opportunities;\n- \uf0b7 Place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors; and",

Any  breach  of  these obligations could result in an event of default on the corresponding contract or security, which in turn could result in the related debt or other credits established under different instruments becoming immediately due and payable. In such an event, Orbia would need to obtain financial resources from alternative sources, which it may do under favorable or unfavorable conditions, at the necessary time, or it may not obtain any resources at all. Alternatively, any default event could require Orbia to sell assets or reduce its operations to satisfy its obligations to its creditors. The event of a default could therefore affect the Company's ability to grow, its financial position or operating results.\n\n## The debt payment guarantees made by Orbia's subsidiaries may not be immediately enforceable.\n\nEach series of Notes and Sustainable Bonds, as well as other financing, are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by certain subsidiaries of Orbia. These guarantees provide creditors with the basis for filing a direct payment  claim  against  such  subsidiaries,  however,  such  guarantees  may  not  be  immediately  enforceable  under applicable law.\n\nIf an attempt was made to legally enforce the guarantees, enforcement could be subject to a court ruling, and because the guarantee had been granted for the direct benefit of the Company, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the guarantor in turn could be incurred for less than their fair value or fair compensation. A court could therefore invalidate the obligations under the guarantees and related agreements and subordinate them to the other debts of the guarantor in turn or take other actions harmful to the holders of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds.\n\nAlthough courts in different jurisdictions measure insolvency differently, in general, a company would be considered insolvent if the sum of its debts, including contingent and unpaid debts, exceeds the fair value of its assets, or if the current value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay the liabilities of its debts, including contingent and unpaid debts, as they become payable.\n\nIf the guarantees cannot be exercised, the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds would be subordinated to all the liabilities, including the accounts payable, of the guarantor subsidiaries. A court may also issue a judgment against the holders of the Notes ordering them to reimburse any amounts paid to them under such guarantees or to exercise the proceeds of the guarantees. If any guarantee or lien were invalidated, the holders of the Notes or the Sustainable Bonds would no longer have a direct claim against the guarantor subsidiary but would retain their rights against the Company and any other guarantor subsidiary, even though there was no guarantee that the assets of the respective subsidiaries would be sufficient to pay the Notes or the Sustainable Bonds in full.\n\nThe provisions of Mexican law may make it difficult for holders of Notes and Sustainable Bonds to convert the amounts paid by the Company to the holders in Mexican pesos into U.S. dollars or to achieve recognition of the full value of such payments.\n\nOrbia is required to make payments in respect to Notes, Sustainable Bonds and other loans in U.S. dollars. However, under the Mexican Monetary Law (Ley Monetaria de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos), obligations to make payments in Mexico in foreign currencies, whether by agreement or upon enforcement of a judgment, may be discharged in Mexican pesos at the exchange rate for Mexican pesos prevailing at the time and place of payment or judgement. Pursuant to the foregoing, Orbia will be legally entitled to make payment of amounts due on the Notes, Sustainable Bonds and other loans taken out in currencies other than Mexican pesos, as set forth by the Mexican Monetary Law, and Orbia can make no assurance that the amounts paid will be converted by the beneficiary into U.S. dollars or that, if converted, such amounts paid would be sufficient to acquire U.S. dollars equal to the amount of the principal, interest, or additional payments due from such Notes, Sustainable Bonds, or loans.\n\nHolders of the Notes and Sustainable Bonds may be limited in their ability to institute proceedings or lawsuits against the Company in Mexican courts.\n\nOrbia  and  some  of  its  guarantor  subsidiaries  are  companies  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  Mexico.  Some  of  the Company's assets and those of some of its guarantor subsidiaries are in Mexico, and a very significant percentage of the Company's sales and those of some of the guarantor subsidiaries originate from sources in Mexico. Therefore, it could eventually be difficult for holders of the Notes and other debt instruments taken out by Orbia in currencies other than the Mexican peso to serve process and bring legal proceedings or lawsuits against the Company or its guarantor subsidiaries outside of Mexico or against its directors or key executives or to enforce judicial rulings issued by courts or",

Although the holders of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds have a direct right to claim payment, this right is not guaranteed over the assets and properties of Orbia or of the guarantor subsidiaries; therefore, the payment of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds is  subordinated with respect to the debt of Orbia and its subsidiaries that have a specific applicable guarantee for payment up to the value of such assets. In addition, under Mexican law, the payment obligations of the Notes are subordinated to certain preferences established by law, including wage and salary claims, guaranteed obligations, social security, workers' housing funds, taxes, fees for and expenses of lawsuits. Similar legal preferences may apply in other jurisdictions where subsidiary guarantors have been incorporated. In the event of Orbia's liquidation, such legal payment preferences will prevail over any other claim, including those of any holder of the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds.\n\n## A  decrease  in  Orbia's  credit  risk  rating  and/or  its  loans  could  adversely  affect  its  ability  to  access  credit markets.\n\nIf  any of the credit ratings are downgraded by the rating institutions, or if the current ratings are subject to negative reviews by the rating agencies, the Company's ability to access the credit markets could be seriously affected and the associated costs of financing could increase. Changes in credit ratings could also affect the price of the Company's securities, including the Notes and the Sustainable Bonds.\n\n## d)  Other Securities\n\nThe securities that Orbia has registered in the RNV and trades in the BMV are:\n\n- i. Ordinary, nominal, without stating a nominal value, freely subscribed shares representing the capital stock of Orbia Advance Corporation, S.A.B. de C.V., and which grant full corporate and patrimonial rights to all holders of such shares, listed under the ticker symbol ORBIA*.\n- ii.

On August 31, 2023, an additional amount of $10 billion pesos was issued in two tranches: one of $2.10 billion pesos and another of $7.90 billion pesos, both under the same terms as the issuance of 2022.\n\n## iii.

Historical Events\n\n## Pre-2021\n\nOrbia's history dates back to 1953 when Cables Mexicanos S.A. was founded by a group of Mexican and American investors  to  satisfy  a  growing  Mexican  market  for  high  carbon  steel  wire  ropes.  In  1978,  holding  company  Grupo Industrial  Camesa, S.A. de C.V. (GICSA) was incorporated, which controlled Aceros Camesa, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries.

Main activity\n\nOrbia is a Mexican public corporation located in the Americas, Europe and in some countries in Asia and Africa. Orbia is a leading provider of products and solutions in multiple sectors, including the construction, infrastructure, agriculture and irrigation, health, transportation, telecommunications, and energy and petrochemical sectors, among others. It is one of the world's largest producers of plastic pipes, fittings and irrigation drippers, as well as fluorite.\n\nOrbia employs more than 24,000 people in 50 countries in which it has 119 production plants, concessions for the exploitation of 2 fluorite mines in Mexico, 8 training academies, and 19 research and development centers.\n\nWith more than 50 years of history and more than 40 years listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange, Orbia applies a business model based on vertical integration, organic growth and strategic acquisitions through which it has direct access to raw materials and its own technology, allowing it to compete in a global environment. As a result, Orbia offers a wide range of materials, products, solutions, and finished products that contribute to the success of its customers and improve people's quality of life.\n\n## Competitive Advantages\n\nOrbia focuses on creating value for its stakeholders, including its shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities in which it operates and employees through the development and continuous improvement of its products and services, starting with its basic raw materials. The main competitive advantages are as follows:\n\n## Vertically integrated operations with direct access to raw materials that create economies of scale and reduce operating expenses\n\nOrbia's Polymer Solutions business is partially integrated with its primary raw material, ethylene, enabling an end-toend  production  chain  from  salt  extraction  to  the  manufacturing  of  plastic  compounds.  Orbia  has  facilities  for  salt production  for  industrial  consumption,  as  well  as  for  the  production  of  ethylene,  chlorine,  caustic  soda,  and  their derivatives, including VCM, EDC, and specialty chemicals. The company also produces PVC for general purpose and specialty resins, as well as compounds. Furthermore, the business is integrated with one of the main raw materials used in the manufacture of plasticizers: phthalic anhydride.",

        "page_content": "Fluor & Energy Materials is the only fluorine company in the world with a vertically integrated value chain, from the extraction of fluorite, through hydrofluoric acid, to the production and sale of aluminum trifluoride (AlF3), refrigerant gases, medical propellants and fluorinated energy materials in the Americas, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe main raw materials of the Building and Infrastructure, Connectivity Solutions and Precision Agriculture business groups are PVC resin, polyethylene and, to a lesser extent, propylene. These are supplied at the best price available on the market, either through purchases from third parties or through vertical integration with the Polymer Solutions business group in the case of PVC, which represents an important competitive advantage.\n\n## Leading positions in PVC and plastic pipe markets in Latin America and Europe and the global fluorite market\n\nOrbia is a top-tier player in the global chemical industry, manufacturing both general purpose and specialty PVC resins. The Company is the largest producer of specialty PVC resins and the sixth largest producer of PVC resins worldwide. The Company believes that the primary markets for such products in the infrastructure and construction industries could experience sustained growth in the long term.\n\nThe emerging markets in which Orbia's Building and Infrastructure and Polymer Solutions business groups sells its main products enjoy attractive growth projections in infrastructure and construction due to a significant housing deficit, insufficient infrastructure, lack of access to water and sanitation, electricity, and other factors. In developed countries, Orbia's businesses  address  the  challenges  to  maintain  and  improve  transport,  water,  electricity,  and telecommunications networks extensively and to address the impacts of climate change.\n\nGlobal demand for PVC continues to be stronger compared to global supply, leading to high-capacity utilization in the industry. PVC demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2023 to 2032. Additionally, Orbia has a strong presence in the American, European, and Asian markets due to its unique position within the Fluor & Energy Materials business group. The Issuer has the concession rights for the exploitation and extraction in Mexico from the world's largest fluorite mine, and has facilities in Mexico, United States, the United Kingdom and Japan for the production of hydrofluoric acid and downstream products such as AIF3, refrigerant gases, medical propellants and fluorinated energy materials. The Company's global positioning is allowing it to expand into high-value, high-growth applications that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable the world's rapid transition to sustainable energy.\n\n## Orbia's  proven  ability  to  integrate  and  operate  acquired  companies  throughout  the  Americas,  Europe,  the Middle East, Asia and Africa\n\nSince  2003,  Orbia  has  grown  rapidly  by  integrating  over  30  acquired  businesses.    Successful  acquisitions  have contributed to the significant growth of Orbia's net sales and EBITDA, making it a leader in the industries in which it operates.\n\nIn this time, Orbia's profile has changed considerably, from a company focused solely on commodities and chemical products, to a company that increasingly provides innovative and specialty products, which has increased its resilience in the face of constant changes and challenges in the global economy.\n\n## A management team with extensive industry experience\n\nOrbia's key executives have extensive experience in leadership positions in top-tier global companies, each with more than  10  years'  experience  in  similar  industries  and  more  than  20  years  of  professional  experience  overall.  The management team has a proven track record of operating successfully in the industry and identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions to grow and strengthen the businesses.\n\n## Strong relationship with major suppliers through long-term contracts\n\nOrbia has established long-lasting relationships with its main suppliers through long-term product supply contracts, which allow it to ensure the supply of domestic and foreign raw materials and inputs. Due to its size and geographical footprint,  the  Company  has  positioned  itself  amongst  its  suppliers'  strategic  clients,  providing  the  Company  with a competitive advantage over its competition.\n\n## Innovation through research, development and patented production processes\n\nOrbia has a product research and development program with people and facilities that allow it to innovate processes and products that are tailored to its customers' needs.\n\nThe Company's 19 research and technology centers located in Mexico, the U.S., the Netherlands, Italy, India, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom and Israel focus on the development of new products to meet market demands and the alignment of processes to achieve safety and the optimization of its production chains.\n\n## Integrated Companies",

        "page_content": "- \uf0b7 VCM Process: VCM is manufactured from ethylene and chlorine. These raw materials are combined in a catalytic reactor to form an intermediate product called dichloroethane (Ethylene Dichloride or EDC). Purified dichloroethane undergoes thermal decomposition to produce VCM. VCM is produced at Polymer Solutions business group facilities in Germany.\n- \uf0b7 Vinyl Process: Orbia's Polymer Solutions business group employs two processes for PVC resin production: suspension and paste. In the suspension process, VCM is combined with water in the presence of a suspending agent in a reactor with agitation. The resulting mixture forms a suspension of VCM in an aqueous phase that remains stable until a VCM-soluble starter is added, initiating polymerization. In the paste process, VCM, water, emulsifier, and catalyst are loaded into a stainless-steel reactor and stirred under controlled pressure and temperature. Orbia's Polymer Solutions business group's production is approximately 79% obtained through suspension polymerization and 21% via paste polymerization. Orbia also produces a variety of PVC copolymers for specialty applications by combining VCM with other plastic monomers.\n- \uf0b7 Compounds: Plastic resins are utilized in the production of compounds by combining them with other additives through a mixing process. This process ensures that the appropriate quantities are integrated into the entire mixture. After this stage, a dry blend is obtained and cooled to a specific temperature. Through various steps and processes, the blend is then converted into pellets suitable for sale.\n\n## Raw Material Sources and Availability:\n\nOrbia's Polymer Solutions business group maintains a secure supply chain through its own investments and long-term agreements with specialized providers and organizations. These agreements are subject to periodic reviews to ensure a steady supply of the essential raw materials.\n\n## Base chemicals and Derivatives\n\n- \uf0b7 Ethane: Polymer Solutions business group joint venture to produce ethylene in the U.S. gulf entered in a long-term agreement to ensure a reliable and consistent supply of ethane.\n- \uf0b7 Salt: Orbia's Polymer Solutions business group holds the rights to a salt dome in Mexico with more than 30 years of potential reserves. The company owns a 25% stake in a joint venture located in Germany that produces brine.\n- \uf0b7 Electricity: In the Mexican operation the business group obtained the electricity through long-term agreements with public and private electric generating companies, in the German facility the electricity is locally supplied in the industrial park owner.\n- \uf0b7 Natural gas: The natural gas for the Mexican facilities is supplied through long-term agreements with public gas companies, and the supply for the German operation is locally provided by the industrial park owner.\n\n## Resins and Compounds Business Segments\n\n- \uf0b7 Ethylene: The business group secures its supply through multiple sources, including a 50/50 joint venture with OxyChem to produce ethylene in a cracker located in Ingleside, Texas, and long-term agreements in Germany.

        "page_content": "PVC:  Orbia is the largest producer of PVC resins in Latin America and the sixth largest in the world. It is also the largest producer of specialty PVC resins globally. The global market for PVC products is closely tied to the construction industry, which is heavily influenced by  the  expansion or contraction  of  economies in different  regions  and  countries.  Global demand expectations for PVC continue to be strong in the long term compared to global supply, leading to expected high-capacity utilization in the industry. However, in the short term (2022-2025), such global cyclical utilization stayed, and will stay below 80% driven by the construction bubble burst in China and high interest rates in the rest of the World. PVC demand is projected to grow at an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 3.3% from 2023 to 2032 supported by several  government  infrastructure  spending  projects  and  building  activities  in  emerging  market  economies  that  will provide housing for fast-growing middle classes, adding approximately 16 million tons of demand in this period.\n\nChlorine-Caustic Soda: Orbia's nameplate represents less than 1% of the global installed capacity for Chlorine-Caustic Soda. The global market for these products is intricately linked to cycles in industrial activity, encompassing sectors such as Vinyls, Alumina, Inorganic and Organic Chemicals, Pulp and Paper, Chlorine Intermediates, among others. Additionally, it is influenced by seasonality in Water Treatment demand throughout the year. Chlorine and Caustic Soda demand in the long-term is projected to grow at an AAGR of 0.4% and 0.5% respectively from 2023 to 2032, adding approximately 4 million tons of demand in this period.\n\n## Revenue Breakdown by Product Category:\n\nPVC resins, plastic compounds, and Derivatives are the primary revenue generators for the last three years, constituting a significant portion of total consolidated revenues.\n\n|                          | Year ending December 31:   | Year ending December 31:   | Year ending December 31:   | Year ending December 31:   | Year ending December 31:   | Year ending December 31:   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                          | Volume Sold  (1)           | Volume Sold  (1)           | Volume Sold  (1)           | Sales  (2)                 | Sales  (2)                 | Sales  (2)                 |\n| Polymer Solutions        | 2023                       | 2022                       | 2021                       | 2023                       | 2022                       | 2021                       |\n| Derivatives  (3)         | 839                        | 910                        | 1,004                      | 553                        | 660                        | 417                        |\n| Resins                   | 1,320                      | 1,356                      | 1,425                      | 1,502                      | 2,310                      | 2,437                      |\n| Compounds                | 238                        | 261                        | 257                        | 643                        | 809                        | 680                        |\n| Eliminations             | (46)                       | (46)                       | (49)                       | (56)                       | (84)                       | (95)                       |\n| Total, Polymer Solutions | 2,351                      | 2,480                      | 2,638                      | 2,643                      | 3,696                      | 3,438                      |\n\n## Distribution Channels:\n\nPolymer Solutions utilizes a business-to-business model, directly marketing products to industries using them as inputs.

        "page_content": "## Production Processes\n\nBuilding & Infrastructure operates in Europe and Latin America with approximately 50 manufacturing plants that operate extrusion lines, injection molding machines, rotational molding, assembly equipment and dedicated lines for geotextiles.\n\nAlthough it masters the usual technologies for PVC, PP, PE and other materials, Building & Infrastructure is also a world leader in a unique technology for producing pipes that transport drinking water. This extrusion technology is called Biaxial in which a pipe undergoes a biorientation of its molecules axially and longitudinally, generating a structure of laminar layers, providing the pipe with significantly greater mechanical resistance compared to conventional pipes and flexibility that makes them practically unbreakable.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nDuring 2023, approximately 78% of the cost of sales for Building and Infrastructure in Latin America was the material cost  of  PVC  resin  and  CPVC  resin.  The  Company  buys  55%  of  this  raw  material  internally  from  the  PVC  resins subsidiary of the Polymer Solutions business group (Vestolit). The remainder is purchased from other regional players as well as from China.\n\nIn Europe approximately 54% of raw material usage is Polyolefins: PE and PP, while the remaining 46% is PVC resin (virgin and recycled) and additives, of which the Polymer Solutions business group provides approximately 11%.\n\n## Cyclic behavior\n\nBuilding and Infrastructure's business performance is influenced by the economic cycles in each of the countries in which it operates, particularly the cycles present in the construction and housing sectors. Additionally, in Europe, there is a seasonal effect related to the winter season during some months of the first and fourth quarters, in which lower levels of sales are generated.\n\n## Distribution Channels\n\nBuilding  and  Infrastructure  distributes  its  products  to  end  consumers  (installers,  contractors  and  engineers,  and specifiers) directly, through distributors, or through businesses specialized in construction, dealers, plumbing specialists, civil engineering specialists or retail DIY businesses.\n\nIn Europe, Building and Infrastructure primarily uses indirect distribution; that is, its products are shipped to wholesalers or retailers, who have both centralized distribution and storage centers, as well as multiple points of retail sale. Building and Infrastructure products are available at approximately 65,000 points of sale in Europe, which include direct and indirect distribution.\n\nIn Latin America, Building and Infrastructure's products are distributed through over 50,000 points of sale with more direct contact with the end consumer, as well as through construction companies.\n\n## Main Customers\n\nBuilding and Infrastructure's main customers are from the construction and infrastructure industry including construction companies, installation companies and underground contractors, as well as municipal governments, cities and gas and water companies that carry out public works. Including inter-company sales, Building and Infrastructure business group represents 33% of Orbia's total sales and the most significant Building and Infrastructure customer represents 6.0% of B&I revenues but is less than 1% of Orbia consolidated revenues.\n\n## Market Information\n\n## Competitive position\n\nBuilding and Infrastructure's market leadership has been built from its well positioned brands: Wavin (with 66 years of history), Amanco, Pavco and Plastigama.   It has also benefited from a robust track record in product development, innovative systems and solutions.  B&I offers a wide portfolio of products and solutions, such as those aimed at solving so-called \"customer pain\" with reliable service level performance. The close links established with customers have been reinforced in recent years through proactive commercial campaigns, as well as through the use of digital tools such as BIM throughout all regions, improving the service to its customers.\n\n## Market share\n\nThe Building and Infrastructure business in Latin America holds approximately 30 % share of the PVC pipe market, based on the Company's own estimates, and the Company also estimates that, in this region, it holds a significant share of the wholesale  markets,  since  it  is  the  market  leader  in  most  of  the  countries.

With more than 50 years of experience and a long-standing reputation for the safety, efficiency, and durability of its products, the business group produces more than 500 million meters of infrastructure annually.\n\nSales of standard HDPE conduit (sized 0.5 to 12 in.) account for the largest share of the group's revenue. HDPE conduit forms the backbone of global fiber and power networks, protecting critical cable assets throughout their installed lifetime, and offering installation and performance benefits over alternative conduit materials. The group has also successfully positioned itself as the world's largest producer of MicroDucts (sized 5 to 27 mm), primarily for the Fiber to the Home (FTTH) and data center markets. These miniaturized pathways, and associated accessories, afford infrastructure owners unmatched fiber density, flexibility, and scalability (both outdoors and in buildings) in the face of exploding connectivity demand for applications such as FTTH, 5G, and IOT. Most of the group's conduit products are available with its patented SILICORE\u00ae ULF ultra-low-friction inner lining, which allows cable to be installed safer, faster, and further.\n\nIn direct response to customer demand and international regulation concerning the sustainability of fiber networks, the group increased the circularity of the conduit manufacturing process. Specifically, the group reworks routine fallout HDPE into new finished products, such as MicroDucts, FuturePath\u00ae, and Smoothwall ECO. Such products contribute to lower Scope 3 emissions for end users (backed by Life Cycle Assessments) and support the group's global 'Zero Waste to Landfill' goal.\n\nConnectivity Solutions also sells a wide range of accessories including duct couplers, woven pull tapes, underground access chambers, and a wide assortment of installation hardware, to complement its core conduit portfolio and improve conduit, MicroDuct, and cable installations.\n\nIn recent years, Connectivity Solutions has expanded its offering to digital education and services targeted at solving real-world customer challenges. Firstly, the number one cited fiber operator challenge, particularly in the U.S., is the scarcity of skilled labor. In response, the group launched Dura-Line Academy, an online education platform geared towards a wide range of users from network owners to designers, engineers, and installers. Its curriculum encompasses all  aspects  of  conduit  design  and  installation,  as  well  as  partner  content  from  industry  bodies  such  as  the  Fiber Broadband Association and other leading equipment manufacturers with whom Connectivity Solution partners. Finally, Dura-Line Academy boasts several courses which are accredited by BICSI, the preeminent professional association for the  Information  and  Communications Technology  (ICT) industry.

The full value chain is depicted below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFluor & Energy Materials supplies approximately 18% of the worldwide demand for fluorite, either directly or through its distribution network. It is the number one market leader in the Americas and Europe and has a significant presence in Asia Pacific. Fluor & Energy Materials sells fluorite to a variety of customers in different industries, including major manufacturers of fluorinated products, some of the largest steel mills in the world, and several of the largest players in the Latin American cement industry.\n\n## Products and Services\n\nFluorite is produced and consumed in two grades: metallurgical grade and acid grade.\n\nMetallurgical grade, or Metspar, is a mineral with a certain natural concentration of fluorine that varies depending on the application.  It  is  a  crucial  raw  material  in  the  production  of  steel  and  cement.  Metspar  enables  the  removal  of impurities, especially sulfur, when added to slag to produce stainless and low carbon steels. It is also a valuable additive in the production of clinker for the cement industry, increasing productivity and product performance. Metspar is a key additive to quality production of steel and cement with lower carbon footprints.\n\nConcentrated fluorite or Acid Grade has a minimum concentration of 97% and is obtained through flotation processes from mineral ores with a lower initial concentration. It is primarily used throughout the world to produce hydrofluoric acid, the chemical precursor to most fluorinated products.\n\n## Production Processes",

        "page_content": "Fluor & Energy Materials operates several mining locations in Mexico. Mainly from two locations in the state of San Luis Potos\u00ed, Fluor & Energy Materials' mineral production is three times that of the second largest producer of fluorite. Following the long-term life of mine plan, Fluorite ore is extracted, along with some impurities such as carbonates and silicates.\n\nFor Metallurgical Grade, the ore extracted from the mine is screened, crushed and sorted according to the desired specifications.\n\nFor Acid Grade, the crushed ore is fed into flotation plants, where the fluorite is concentrated and the impurities are separated.\n\n(See Section 'B \"The Issuer\", item 'X \"Description of its Main Assts\", of this Annual Report for further details).\n\nEnvironmental compliance and sustainability are strongly integrated into Fluor & Energy Materials' plans for mineral extraction and processing to ensure that its environmental and social responsibility goals are achieved. The use of screening equipment for Metspar has enabled better utilization of the mineral resource, and significant investments have been made in Acid Grade processing to use substantially less water per metric ton produced and go to paste or dry-related instead of the traditional wet-related industry practice.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nThe main suppliers of raw materials for the fluorite operations in Mexico are the National Water Commission (water), Iberdrola and the Federal Electricity Commission (electric energy) and Pemex Transformaci\u00f3n Industrial (natural gas).\n\n## Cyclic behavior\n\nThe Fluorite markets have low cyclical behavior.\n\n## Distribution Channels\n\nKoura serves approximately 18% of the global demand for fluorite, either directly or through its distribution network.\n\nSales through distributors are made through long-term contracts. Distributors purchase the described fluorite products directly for resale in the markets in which they are present.\n\n## Main customers\n\nFluor  &  Energy  Materials  maintains  long-term  contracts  with  its  main  metallurgical-grade  and  acid-grade  fluorite customers.

Refrigerant gases, fluoropolymers & fluoro-elastomers, and aluminum trifluoride are some of the major applications where HF is directly used. The volume of HF consumed for materials used in lithium-ion batteries is significantly increasing, and it is expected to be a main growth driver for HF demand in the coming years. Fluor & Energy Materials is one of the leading producers of hydrofluoric acid globally.\n\nAluminum  trifluoride  is  an  essential  element  for  the  manufacture  of  aluminum  and  is  produced  by  the  reaction  of hydrofluoric acid HF with aluminum hydroxide. From its Matamoros plant, Fluor & Energy Materials supplies several of the main global aluminum producers.\n\n## Products\n\nHydrofluoric acid is produced by reacting Acid Grade fluorite with sulfuric acid. Once produced, the hydrofluoric acid is subjected to various stages of distillation until it reaches the required purity to meet the high standards demanded by the market. Sulfuric acid is made by Fluor & Energy Materials starting from sulfur, which is converted into sulfuric acid once it comes into contact with air at high temperatures and with water.\n\nHydrofluoric acid is mainly used in (1) the manufacture of refrigerant gases and propellant gases for air conditioning, refrigerators,  freezers  and  medical  applications  for  treatment  of  respiratory  diseases,  (2)  the  manufacture  of fluoropolymers, (3) the manufacture of aluminum trifluoride, (4)  the production of fluorinated salts, which are used in energy storage, (5) the manufacture of high octane gasolines, (6) cleaning of metallic surfaces such as the pickling of stainless steel, and in other uses to a lesser extent, such as the manufacture of uranium fluoride for the nuclear industry and the manufacture of  semiconductors .\n\nAluminum trifluoride is produced by reacting HF with alumina, usually immediately after the HF has been produced. It is  mainly  used  as  a  flux  in  the  aluminum  smelting  by  fused-salt  electrolysis.  It  is  critical  for  economically  feasible production at almost all aluminum smelters around the world.\n\n## Production Processes\n\nFluor & Energy Materials owns and operates one of the largest HF plants in the world, located in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The plant is strategically located to have easy access to its main raw materials in Mexico and exports 97% of its production of hydrofluoric acid, mainly to the USA, as well as 100% of its production of aluminum trifluoride. The Matamoros plant is operated with the highest stewardship standards and in compliance with all applicable regulations. The Business has invested in systems to achieve low SO2 emission in the sulfuric acid production. Hydrofluoric acid is produced by reacting Acid Grade fluorite with sulfuric acid. Once produced, the hydrofluoric acid is subjected to various stages of distillation until it reaches the required purity to meet the high standards demanded by\n\nthe market.\n\nSulfuric acid is obtained from the oxidation of sulfur into sulfur dioxide SO2, to convert it into sulfur trioxide SO3 and subsequently obtain sulfuric acid.\n\nThe production of aluminum trifluoride is based on hydrofluoric acid, which evaporates and overheats before being injected in gaseous form into a pair of double bed fluidized reactors. In the reactors, it contacts and reacts with aluminum hydroxide, which is in solid form, to produce aluminum trifluoride. This product leaves the reactor in solid form at high temperature (700\u00b0C) so it must be cooled before being sent to storage and transport.\n\n(See Section 2, \"The Issuer\", item x, \"Description of its Main Assets\", of this Annual Report for further information).\n\n## Raw materials\n\nThe main raw materials used in the production of HF are acid grade fluorite and sulfur. Fluorite is supplied from the Business' mine in San Luis Potosi.",

        "page_content": "AlF3 total consumption was approximately 1.2 million metric tons in 2023. China consumed 59%, followed by the Middle East with 8% and India and Russia with 7% each.  Fluor & Energy Materials serves approximately 6% of the global demand for AlF3, either directly or through its distribution network. It is the leader in the Americas and has a strong presence in India, the Middle East and other regions.\n\n## (e.3) Refrigerant Gases and Medical Propellants\n\n## General Overview\n\nFluor & Energy Materials is one of the world's leading suppliers of refrigerant gases, mostly marketed under the Klea\u00ae brand. It sells both directly, especially to original equipment manufacturers (OEMS), and through its distribution network, mainly to the aftermarket segment. It is a leader in Europe and a major player in America, Japan and India.\n\nHFA medical propellants are used to safely deliver a variety of medications in aerosol form, including use in metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for the treatment of asthma and other lung diseases. Fluor & Energy Materials produces and sells the product to the regulated medical and pharmaceutical market under its ZEPHEX\u00ae brand, the global brand of medical propellant gases contained in approximately 75% of inhalers produced worldwide.\n\nThe total volume of fluorocarbon refrigerants in 2023 was estimated to be 1.2 million metric tons. China remains the largest producer (73%), followed by the US (21%).\n\nThe total volume of medical propellants in 2023 totaled approximately 11,000 metric tons. Fluor & Energy Materials supplies more than 70% of the world's needs for medical propellants. Other producers in China and India also produce medical propellants.\n\n## Products\n\nFluorocarbons combine good thermodynamic properties with a safe nature (low toxicity and flammability) and noncorrosiveness . They have unique production processes, but all require HF as a key feedstock. In the last decade, the production and demand of Fluorocarbons has been significantly transformed by environmental legislation, which has focused on eliminating the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to protect the ozone layer and ultimately reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to reduce global warming. As the use of HFCs is phased out around the world, new generations of refrigerants are being introduced to accelerate the transition to low-carbon solutions. It is important to distinguish between non-feedstock and feedstock applications of fluorocarbons, as the production of some CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs for feedstock use is still permitted with appropriate measures to minimize environmental impact.\n\nFluor & Energy Materials is committed to the development of Low Global Warming Potential (LGWP) refrigerant gases, investing significantly in research and development to design a new portfolio that will provide a material improvement on currently available products, benefiting industry and the environment alike, on both a mid and long term basis. Some new LGWP products have already been introduced since 2021, such as Klea \u00ae R473A, R456A, R448A and LFR3, with several more in the pipeline for the next few years.\n\nFluorine-based  medical  propellants  are  used  to  safely  deliver  a  variety  of  medications  in  aerosol  form.  They  are produced by purifying certain HFCs to achieve a medical grade according to pharmaceutical specifications and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) standards.\n\nAs  HFC  use  is  being  phased  out  around  the  world,  new  generations  of  medical  propellants  are  being  sought  to accelerate  the  transition  to  low  carbon  solutions.  Koura  is  leading  the  industry  in  this  transition  to  LGWP  medical propellants with the development and commercialization of HFA-152a.\n\n## Production\n\nRefrigerant gases have unique production processes, but all require HF as a key feedstock. 134a is produced by the fluoridation  of  trichloroethylene  with  hydrofluoric  acid.  Once  the  reaction  takes  place,  the  hydrochloric  acid  that  is produced as a by-product must be removed and the product must be distilled.\n\nFluorine-based  propellants  are  produced  by  purifying  certain  HFCs  to  achieve  a  medical  grade  according  to pharmaceutical specifications and cGMP standards.\n\nIn total, Fluor & Energy Materials has eight operating plants established in Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United States, Taiwan and Japan, of which 6 are certified in accordance with ISO-9001, 4 with ISO-14001, 3 with OHSAS 18001, 1 with TS 16949, 1 with Clean Industry Certification by the Federal Attorney's Office for Environmental Protection (Mexico), 1 with Integral Responsibility certification by ANIQ and 3 with ISRS (International Safety Rating System) levels",

The  4  chemical  process  plants  of  this  business  group  are  signatories  of  the  chemical  industry's  voluntary commitment to Responsible Care.\n\nFluor & Energy Materials has two refrigerant production plants, one in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, and the other in Mihara, Japan, for 134a, an HFC used primarily for automotive and stationary refrigeration. Fluor & Energy Materials refrigerant portfolio is complemented through alliances and supply agreements with other Fluorocarbon producers.\n\nFluor & Energy Materials has a medical grade purification plant for 134a at Runcorn, UK. This facility is the only one of its kind to have received an U.S. Food and Drug Administration audit as well as UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) inspections for cGMP compliance.\n\nFluor  &  Energy  Materials  sells  medical  propellants  under  its  ZEPHEX\u00ae  brand,  supplying  most  of  the  world's pharmaceutical companies. In 2020, Fluor & Energy Materials announced the commissioning of a new Zephex\u00ae 152a cGMP medical propellant production facility, also in Runcorn, which started operations in April 2022.\n\n(See Section 2, \"The Issuer\", item x, \"Description of its Main Assets\", of this Annual Report for further details).\n\n## Raw materials\n\nThe main raw material used in the production of refrigerant gases is HF, which comes from the Business' plant in the city of Matamoros for production of refrigerant gases at its plant in St. Gabriel in the state of Louisiana, USA, and is mainly imported from third parties for production of refrigerant gases in the city of Mihara, Japan.\n\n## Distribution Channels\n\nFluor & Energy Materials sells refrigerants worldwide through regional distributors, key to the aftermarket, mainly without a contract or with a short-term contract. It sells directly to OEM's on short- term contracts.\n\nFluor & Energy Materials has one of the largest shares of HFC consumption within the European regulation of fluorinated gases. However, this historic legislation, aimed at progressively reducing the consumption of HFCs, is compromised by significant illegal imports of HFC products. Fluor & Energy Materials actively participates in the European Fluorocarbons Technical Committee (EFTCC) as one of the member companies working collectively to fight this illegal HFC business and preserve the intent of Fluorinated Gas (F-Gas) regulation. In recent years, enforcement of these regulations has increased and as a result, there are currently fewer illegal imported products appearing in the European market.\n\nMedical propellants are sold in bulk directly to pharmaceutical companies under contract and packaged for smaller customers through agents and distributors without contract.\n\n## Main customers\n\nThe Fluor & Energy Materials Business Group's refrigerant and medical propellants products represents about 5.0% of Orbia's total sales. No single Fluor & Energy Materials refrigerant and medical propellants customer represents more than 1% of the Company's total sales and, therefore, there is no dependence on one or more customers, and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Issuer's results of operations or financial position.\n\n## Market Information\n\n## Competitive Position\n\nFluor  &  Energy  Materials  benefits  from  its  vertical  integration  from  fluorite  to  refrigerants  and  medical  propellants, offering  a  high  level  of  security  of  supply  which  cannot  be  matched  by  other  non-integrated  producers  who  are dependent on fluorite's external supply. Fluor & Energy Materials' strong regional presence in North America and its large HFC consumption quota in Europe also represent significant competitive advantages. In medical propellants, Fluor & Energy Materials supplies 75% of the world's needs for medical propellants.\n\nThe announced investments and development in LGWP refrigerant gases and next generation medical propellants will contribute to sustain and expand this competitive position in the future.\n\n(e.4) Energy Materials (Formerly known as Battery Materials)\n\n## General Overview",

In Fluor & Energy Materials, there are several mining concessions that expire gradually from 2029 to 2061, which are renewable pursuant to the provisions of the Mining Act in Mexico. Fluor & Energy Materials will take the necessary steps, pursuant to the deadlines established by law, to ensure the renewal of the concessions that are due to expire soon. However, the Company cannot guarantee that such renewals will be granted. Furthermore, and pursuant to Mexican legislation, Fluor & Energy Materials is obligated to verify the investments in exploration and exploitation of these concessions, which to date have been carried out in a timely manner. PMV has a mining concession for the salt dome in Veracruz that expires in 2043.\n\nAdditionally, Polymer Solutions holds two valid port concessions. The first is for its operating port in Altamira M\u00e9xico and the second one for its operating port in Cartagena, Colombia.\n\n## iv. Main Customers\n\nSee Section 2) \"The Issuer\", item b, \"Business Description\" sub-part i. 'Main Activity' for each Business Group, of this Annual Report.\n\nOrbia's top ten customers combined represented 8.96% of its consolidated net sales in 2023. Orbia's largest individual customer represented 1.27% of its total net sales in 2023, so there is no dependence on any one or various customers, since the loss of any one of these would not materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## v. Applicable Legislation and Tax Situation\n\nThe Company's operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates. See section 2) 'The Issuer', item V. General Business Strategy, sub-part 'Effects of Laws and Government Regulations on Business Development'\n\nOrbia's business groups may be subject to specific government laws and regulations. Below is a summary of the effects that these laws and regulations have on the development of the Company's business, for each one of its business groups:\n\n## 1. Polymer Solutions (Vestolit and Alphagary)\n\nPolymer Solutions' business is subject to environmental laws and government regulations that require it to carry out its supply, production, transportation, and disposal operations of raw materials and finished products in accordance with a broad range of regulations which are strict; non-compliance can lead to financial losses for the business group.  These laws and regulations include, among others, environmental standards, strict labor regulations in Latin America, and very strict industrial safety requirements. Regulatory requirements apply in six main jurisdictions: Germany, the U.S., Mexico India the UK, and Colombia.\n\nIn particular, the governments of Mexico and Colombia are enacting stricter regulations, and the main political parties of regulating entities are changing.\n\n## 2.

        "page_content": "Building and Infrastructure is a company with presence and operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific, North America, and Latin America. In the normal course of business, Building and Infrastructure is subject to the general government laws and regulations listed at the beginning of this Section.\n\nBesides the foregoing, this business group does not report any additional specific standards that materially affected its operations during 2023.\n\n## 3. Connectivity Solutions (Dura-Line)\n\nConnectivity Solutions is present and has operations in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions. In the normal course of its business, Connectivity Solutions is subject to the general government laws and regulations listed at the beginning of this Section.\n\nThis business group does not report any specific additional standards that materially affected its operations in 2023.\n\n## 4. Precision Agriculture (Netafim)\n\nPrecision  Agriculture is an  Israeli company  with  presence  and  operations  in  the  EMEA,  Asia  Pacific  and  Americas regions. In the regular course of its business, it is subject to general government laws and regulations as described in beginning of this Section. However, it is also subject to compliance with regulations that have an effect its operations as described further below:\n\n- \uf0b7 Agricultural activity is subject to environmental laws or regulations, which may impact the operations of end users and/or the demand for Precision Agriculture products. The adoption of new environmental laws may require Precision Agriculture to remove or recycle its products or impose obligations related to such climate change concerns on its customers. It may not be possible to recover the potential costs associated with the development of such regulatory actions, and therefore could adversely impact the results of the business. Moreover,  certain  jurisdictions,  such  as  the  European  Union,  have  adopted  or  are  considering  adopting environmental, sustainability, and governance (ESG) regulations which may require increased reporting from entities operating in or importing into the EU and/or, in the future, potential financial adjustments to be paid by importers in connection with carbon prices.\n- \uf0b7 Precision Agriculture operates in countries or regions where laws criminalizing bribery and bribery are strictly enforced.  Such  laws  may  conflict  with  local  customs  and  practices,  particularly  in  markets  of  emerging countries, thus impeding the business.\n\n## 5. Fluor & Energy Materials (Koura)\n\nFluor & Energy Materials operates mining projects located in Mexico and that are subject to various laws and government regulations on various matters, including, but not limited to: exploration, development, production, payment of taxes and royalties for extraction, environmental aspects, labor standards, maintenance of claims and mining concessions, land use, territorial claims of local inhabitants, use of water, waste disposal, power generation, protection and remediation of the environment, claims for the conservation of historical and cultural resources, industrial safety, occupational health, and the handling and disposal of toxic substances and explosives. In May 2023 the Mexican Congress enacted a bill reforming the Mining Act as well as other laws related to mining. Fluor & Energy Materials submitted constitutional actions (amparos) against the Mining Act reform bill, which are currently in process at the Federal Courts. In parallel, the minority in Congress submitted an unconstitutionality action against the Mining Act reform bill, which is currently in process at the Supreme Court of Justice.\n\nThe Group's chemical, medical propellants and energy materials operations are located in Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. The manufacturing processes of these products are subject to the specific health and safety  regulations  of  each  country.  Fluor  &  Energy  Materials'  refrigerant  products  are  also  governed  by  various environmental laws and regulations. Worldwide, many countries have signed the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which addresses climate change, limiting and progressively reducing the impact of global warming caused by this class of products. Regional blocs of countries and some individual countries have also adopted their own regulations in terms of control mechanisms and phase-down schedule. The Company also produces a medical propellant that is subject to country-specific medical regulatory controls, such as those of the US Food and Drug Administration, the EU and the UK. The EU and some other jurisdictions are currently consulting on the possible future control of substances known collectively as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). As a result of some recent definitions adopted in the US and EU, some of the refrigerant products that Fluor & Energy Materials manufactures and distributes are now characterized as PFAS. The company continues to monitor legislative and regulatory processes with respect to PFAS that may affect its business.",

Likewise, in the event that the losses derived from a claim exceed the insured limit, the result would have an adverse effect on Orbia's financial results in the form of higher costs, which may not be anticipated.\n\n## xi. Judicial, Administrative or Arbitral Proceedings\n\nWith the exception of the information provided in section 3 Financial Reporting 'Contingent liabilities', the Company and its subsidiaries are not involved in any relevant proceeding of judicial, administrative or arbitration nature, outside of those that are a normal part of the course of business and that have, had or could have a significant impact on the operating results or the financial position of Orbia or its business groups.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in  compliance  with  applicable  regulations,  internal  policies  and  good  practices,  the Company and its subsidiaries maintain reserves to meet the obligations that may arise as a result of the proceedings in which it or its subsidiaries are party to that meet IFRS accounting guidance for recognition.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and its subsidiaries are not aware that any of its shareholders, directors or main officers are part of any judicial, administrative and/or arbitration procedure that could affect the results of the operations nor the financial situation of the Issuer in a material adverse manner.\n\nLikewise, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are part of any tax proceedings that could affect the results of the operation or financial situation of the issuer in a material adverse manner.\n\n## xii.  Shares representing Capital Stock\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company does not have open positions in derivative instruments that can be settled in kind whose underlying assets are ORBIA* shares.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Company's share capital count was 1,968,000,000 shares.\n\nAt the Company's shareholders' meeting held on March 31, 2023, the shareholders agreed to cancel 42,000,000 Class II  common shares, with no par value, which represented the variable portion of the Company's share capital. This cancellation did not result in a share capital decrease since the Company maintained the ownership of those shares as they had been repurchased from its own share capital.\n\nIn the fiscal years 2022 and 2021, Orbia did not modify the number or amount of outstanding shares representing its share capital. The Company's share capital count was 2,010,000,000 shares.\n\nThe fixed portion of the Company's share capital is comprised of Class I registered shares with no right to withdrawal. The variable portion of the Company's share capital is comprised of Class II registered shares with no par value and may not exceed ten times the minimum fixed share capital.\n\nAt the Company's shareholders' meeting held on July 21, 2021, the shareholders agreed to cancel 90,000,000 Class II common shares,  with  no  par  value,  which  represented  the  variable  portion  of  the  Company's  share  capital.  This cancellation did not result in a share capital decrease since the Company maintained the ownership of those shares as they had been repurchased from its own share capital.\n\nAn analysis of the Company's capital stock as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:",

Dividends\n\nDuring the last three years (2023, 2022, and 2021) Orbia has decreed the payment of dividends in cash, as follows:\n\n| General Shareholders'  Meeting   | Dividend Declared in  millions of USD   | Number of  Payments   | Payment  Dates                                           |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Apr-09-24                        | 160                                     | 4 payments            | Apr 23, 2024, remainder to be determined                 |\n| Mar-30-23                        | 240                                     | 4 payments            | Apr 21 2023, Jun 30 2023, Sep 29 2023, and Dec  29 2023  |\n| Apr-01-22                        | 240 + 60  (extraordinary)               | 4 payments            | Apr 13, 2022, Jun 15 2022, Sept 15 2022 and  Dec 15 2022 |\n\nThe declaration, amount and payment of dividends are approved by the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meetings, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors, and dividends may only be paid from profits withheld from accounts previously approved by the shareholders, provided that a legal reserve has been created and any losses from previous fiscal years have been paid or absorbed.\n\nThe distribution of Orbia's dividend payments depends on the generation of profits, flow generation and the investments projected in its different business groups. ( See Section 1, 'General Information,' item c, 'Risk Factors,' item bb, 'Risk Factors Related to Securities Issued by the Company.')\n\nThe amount and payment of future Orbia dividends, if any, will be subject to applicable law and depend on a variety of factors that may be considered by the Board of Directors or shareholders, including future operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, investments in potential acquisitions or other growth opportunities, legal and contractual restrictions on current and future debt instruments and the ability to obtain funds from subsidiaries. Such factors may limit  the  ability  to  pay  future  dividends  and  may  be  considered  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  recommending,  or  by shareholders in approving, the payment of future dividends.\n\nOrbia does not have a dividend payment policy.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, the Company's shareholders approved the payout of a cash dividend of $160 million applied to retained earnings and the net taxable profits account (CUFIN, by its acronym in Spanish). These dividends will be distributed in four equal installments to the holders of the outstanding shares, at each payment date during 2024, less the amount corresponding  to  the  shares  of  the  share  buyback  program.  Dividend  payout  dates  are  to  be  determined  by  the Company's executive officers.\n\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company's shareholders approved the payout of a cash dividend of $240 million applied to retained  earnings  and  the  net  taxable  profits  account  (CUFIN,  by  its  acronym  in  Spanish).  These  dividends  were distributed to the holders of the outstanding shares at each payment date during 2023, minus the amount corresponding",

These dividends were distributed to the holders of the outstanding shares at each payment date during 2022, minus the amount corresponding to the shares of the share buyback program.\n\nOn March 30, 2021, the Company's shareholders approved the payout of a cash dividend of $210 million applied to retained  earnings  and  the  net  taxable  profits  account  (CUFIN,  by  its  acronym  in  Spanish).

The Company is in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2023. ( See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included as an annex to this Annual Report.)\n\n## Hedging of foreign currency obligations\n\nThe Company is exposed to market risks, operating risks and financial risks arising from the use of financial instruments involving interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk, which are centrally managed.\n\nThe Company seeks to minimize  the  effects of  these  risks  by  using  derivative  financial  instruments  to  hedge  risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Company's policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide direction on foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of surpluses. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is regularly reviewed. The  Company  does  not  enter  into  nor  trade  financial  instruments,  including  derivative  financial  instruments,  for speculative purposes.\n\nForeign  Exchange  risk  management :  The  Company  frequently  transacts  in  currencies  other  than  its  functional currency;  consequently,  it  is  exposed  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  which  are  managed  within  the  parameters  of approved policies, using forward exchange rate contracts when considered appropriate and effective in hedging the related risk.  The Company's most significant exposure to foreign exchange risk in its operations is to the Euro, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Colombian peso, and the British pound.\n\nThe Company performed a sensitivity analysis which includes only monetary items denominated in foreign currency and adjusts their translation with a 10% weakening of the functional currency as of December 31, resulting in a hypothetical exchange gain (loss) included in the profit or loss or other comprehensive income statement:\n\n|                     | 2023                                | 2022                                | 2021                                |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Functional Currency | (Figures in millions of US dollars) | (Figures in millions of US dollars) | (Figures in millions of US dollars) |\n| Mexican pesos       | ($143)                              | ($87)                               | ($21)                               |\n| Euro                | (48)                                | (52)                                | (76)                                |\n| Pounds sterling     | (12)                                | (8)                                 | -                                   |",

This management analysis of the Company's results of operations and financial situation must be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements for  the  fiscal years  ended  December  31,  2023,  2022  and  2021,  and  their  respective  explanatory  notes included  in  this  Annual  Report,  as  well  as  with  the  information  included  in  the  sections 'See  Section  3,  'Financial Information', item a, 'Selected Financial Information', of this Annual Report.\n\nThis section contains statements regarding future or anticipated events, which are subject to various risks. Actual results could differ  materially  from  the  results  discussed  in  this  section  in  the context  of  future  events for various  reasons, including those factors indicated in 'Section 1, 'General Information, item c, 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe financial figures contained in this Section have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), with the US dollar as the functional and reporting currency. Unless otherwise specified, figures are reported in millions.\n\nFigures and percentages have been rounded and may therefore not add arithmetically.\n\n## i. Operating Results\n\nOrbia revenue and profitability decreased in 2023 vs. 2022 as a result of weaker market conditions in the construction, infrastructure and capital investment sectors due to high interest rates and lower construction and infrastructure related activities in China leading to increased low cost PVC exports. Orbia demonstrated its resilience and ability to manage through  a  challenging  market  environment  and  focused  on  operational  discipline,  cost  management,  commercial discipline and capital management to maintained strong operating cash flows and a solid balance sheet. Orbia completed multiple  capacity  expansion  and  efficiency  improvement  projects  across  the  Company's  business  groups  and  is continuing  to  drive  cross-business  integration  and  strategic  product  portfolio  expansions,  particularly  in  the  area  of energy materials.\n\nOrbia delivered revenue growth in 2022 vs. 2021 but macroeconomic challenges resulted in lower profitability. 2022 provided unique challenges for Orbia and the world at large, marked by the war in Ukraine, inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nThe Company's consolidated statements of income for 2023, 2022 and 2021; and comparisons of 2023 to 2022 and 2022 to 2021 are included below.\n\n| Consolidated statements of  income (Figures in millions of US  Dollars)   | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   | 2023 vs 2022  % Change   | 2022 vs 2021  % Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Continued Operations:                                                     |        |         |        |                          |                          |\n| Net sales                                                                 | $8,204 | $9,64 8 | $8,783 | (15.0%)                  | 9.8%                     |\n| Cost of sales                                                             | 6,032  | 7,079   | 6,156  | (14.8%)                  | 15.0%                    |\n| Gross profit                                                              | 2,172  | 2,569   | 2,627  | (15.5%)                  | (2.2%)                   |",

Revenues were higher in Fluor & Energy Materials, particularly in refrigerants, but decreased across other businesses. The decrease primarily included lower PVC and caustic soda pricing and volumes for Polymer Solutions, weaker demand in Europe for Building & Infrastructure and deferrals of customer projects due primarily to high interest rates in Connectivity Solutions.\n\nBy region, sales decreased in North America 12%, AMEA 7%, Europe 18% and South America 19% in 2023.\n\nRevenues  reached  a  historic  high  of  $9,648  million  in  2022,  up  10%  from  2021.    Revenues  increased  across  all businesses, except for Precision Agriculture. Primary drivers of the year-over-year increase included strong PVC pricing in the Polymer Solutions businesses, particularly during the first half of the year, strong demand in Connectivity Solutions and improved pricing across the Fluor & Energy Materials product portfolio.\n\nBy region, sales grew in North America 24%, AMEA 20%, Europe 1% and were flat in South America in 2022.\n\nThe revenue change by business group was as follows:\n\n- 1. Polymer Solutions: 2023 and 2022 sales decreased 27% to $2,699 million and grew 8% to $3,696 million respectively.\n- 2. Building and Infrastructure: 2023 and 2022 sales decreased 8% to $2,678 million and grew 0.1% to $2,926 million respectively.\n- 3. Precision  Agriculture:  2023  and  2022  sales  decreased  2%  and  4%  to  $1,063  million  and  $1,085  million respectively.\n- 4. Connectivity Solutions: 2023 and 2022 sales decreased 18% to $1,125 million and grew 38% to $1,370 million respectively.\n- 5. Fluor & Energy Materials: 2023 and 2022 sales grew 8% and 15% to $918 million and $852 million respectively.\n\n## Cost of sales",

    {
        "page_content": "Cost of sales of $6,032 million decreased 15% from 2022. The decrease in cost of sales was driven primarily by lower volumes and raw material costs.\n\nCost of sales increased 15% in 2022 to $7,079 million primarily due to inflationary pressures resulting in higher raw material,  energy,  freight  and  labor  costs.  Raw  materials  and  manufacturing  expenses  increased  18%  and  17%, respectively.\n\n## Operating Income\n\nOperating profit decreased 36% to $849 million in 2023 driven by lower sales in all business groups except Fluor & Energy Materials, which experienced strong pricing and higher volumes.\n\nOperating profit decreased 8% to $1,328 million in 2022 despite record profit levels in Connectivity Solutions and strong performance in Fluor & Energy Materials as other business groups were affected by lower pricing and other economic and market pressures.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nEBITDA decreased 24% in 2023 to $1,460 million while EBITDA margin decreased 199 basis points to 17.8%. The decrease in EBITDA and EBIDTA margin was due to lower prices and softer demand across most markets, particularly in Polymer Solutions, Building & Infrastructure and Connectivity Solutions. The decrease was partially offset by higher profitability in Fluor & Energy Materials.\n\nEBITDA decreased 7% in 2022 to $1,909 million while EBITDA margin decreased approximately 350 basis points to 19.8%. The decrease in EBITDA and EBITDA margin was due to softening demand across certain markets in the second half of the year, coupled with higher input costs, particularly in Polymer Solutions, Building & Infrastructure, and Precision Agriculture. The decrease was partially offset by higher profitability in Connectivity Solutions, as well as in Fluor & Energy Materials.\n\n## Net financial expense\n\nFinancial cost increased $206 million vs. 2022 to $366 million in 2023. The increase in financial costs was largely driven by adjustments in the valuation of put options associated with non-wholly-owned businesses in 2022 that did not reoccur in 2023 (net impact of $112 million). In addition, 2023 included $91 million of higher net interest payments that totaled $296 million, as a result of the impact from Mexican Peso appreciation and additional debt, mainly in Mexican Pesos at higher rates than the Company's average interest rate. Foreign exchange losses also increased year over year due to the appreciation of the Mexican Peso and other currencies. These factors were partially offset by higher interest income from an increase in the cash balance with higher short-term interest rates earned on these deposits.\n\nFinancial costs in 2022 decreased $136 million to $160 million vs. 2021. The decrease in financial costs was largely driven by adjustments in the valuation of put options due largely to higher discount rates used to value the put option liabilities as a result of rising interest rates. This impact was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange, particularly from devaluations of the Euro and the British Pound.\n\n## Income tax\n\nDuring 2023, the Company's tax expense decreased 11% to $329 million, while the effective tax rate increased to 67.9% vs. 35.6% in 2022.  The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by the appreciation of the Mexican Peso and the impact of inflation in Mexico.\n\nDuring 2022, the tax expense decreased 3% to $369 million while the effective tax rate increased 258 basis points to 35.6% compared to 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by one-time items, including a nondeductible impairment charge of $136 million that lowered earnings before taxes. The increase in the effective tax rate was also due to the strengthening of the Mexican Peso and additional charges for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the impact of non-taxable put option revaluations noted above.\n\n## Majority net income\n\nNet income to majority shareholders decreased 89% in 2023 to $65 million primary driven by lower EBITDA.\n\nNet income to majority shareholders decreased 14% in 2022 to $567 million driven by lower EBITDA and the impact of one-time charges including a $136 million non-cash impairment charge.\n\n## Operating results by business group",

The decrease in revenues was driven by lower volumes and prices due to weaker demand and a raw material supply shortage in the Americas due to operational issues at one of the Business' suppliers, and from an extended ethylene joint venture plant turnaround.\n\n2022 sales in Polymer Solutions grew 8% to $3,696 million. Growth in revenue was driven by higher prices during the first half of the year, and strong results in the Specialty PVC and Chlor-Alkali businesses during the year.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nPolymer Solutions cost of sales decreased 20.6%, from $2,925 million in fiscal year 2022 to $2,323 million in 2023, but increased as a percentage of sales from 79% in 2022 to 86% in 2023 primarily due to lower volume and pricing in PVC and caustic soda.\n\nPolymer Solutions cost of sales grew 24.8%, from $2,344 million in fiscal year 2021 to $2,925 million in 2022 and grew as a percentage of sales from 68% in 2021 to 79% in 2022 due to higher raw material and input costs.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nThe gross  profit  of  the  Business  fell  by  51%  in  2023  due  to  lower  PVC  and  caustic  soda  volume  and  prices,  and maintenance turnaround impacts.\n\nThe gross profit of the business group fell by 30% in 2022 due to a decrease in demand during the last quarter of the year as well as reduced PVC prices.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses in Polymer Solutions grew 12% in 2023, from $222 million to $248 million, and as a percentage of sales to 9% vs. 6% due primarily to investment in strategic growth initiatives.\n\nOperating expenses in Polymer Solutions grew 2% in 2022, from $218 million to $222 million, and remained stable as a percentage of sales at 6%.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nPolymer Solutions EBITDA decreased 53% to $382 million in 2023, and EBITDA margin decreased to 14% driven by lower PVC and caustic soda volume and prices, maintenance turnaround impacts, expenses related to strategic growth projects and the translation effect of the stronger Mexican Peso and Colombian Peso on fixed costs.\n\nPolymer Solutions EBITDA decreased 29% to $804 million in 2022, and EBITDA margin decreased to 22%, mainly due to  lower prices and volumes and higher feedstock and energy costs in General Purpose PVC resins, particularly in Europe. This was partly offset by strong pricing in the Specialty PVC and Chlor-Alkali businesses.\n\nThe  Company  expects  the  challenging  market  environment  to  continue  in  2024,  with  slow  housing  demand  and oversupplied export markets, but anticipates that the market may trend upwards in the second half of the year. Should interest rates decline late in the year, this may drive some improvement in PVC volumes and prices, which would be expected to be partially offset by low caustic soda prices.\n\n## Building and Infrastructure Business Group\n\n|                                  |   Year ended December 31, |   Year ended December 31, |   Year ended December 31, |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Building and Infrastructure  (1) |                      2023 |                      2022 |                      2021 |",

The decrease was primarily driven by lower demand in EMEA and lower prices, which were partially offset by higher volumes in Latin America, Asia, and North America.\n\nIn 2022 net sales were $2,926 million, representing growth of 0.1% compared to the previous year (essentially flat) as strong demand early in the year was offset by a decrease in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022, mainly due to demand volatility in Europe and Brazil and the impact of currency devaluation.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nIn 2023, cost of sales decreased 11% to $2,028 million compared to $2,279 million in fiscal year 2022 due to lower volumes.\n\nIn 2022, cost of sales increased 4% to $2,279 million compared to $2,183 million in fiscal year 2021 in line with general inflationary cost pressures on production inputs.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nGross profit increased less than a percent to $650 million in 2023 as a result of lower cost.\n\nGross profit decreased 12% to $647 million in 2022, and gross margin decreased from 24% in 2021 to 22% in 2022 as a result of higher costs.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 19% in 2023 as a result of restructuring cost related to business optimization.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of sales remained stable at 16% in 2022 as the business group was able to manage costs despite high inflation.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n2023  EBITDA  decreased  by  12%  to  $284  million  and  EBITDA  margin  fell  by  approximately  39  basis  points  to approximately  11%  due  to  lower  volumes,  higher  logistics  and  transportation  costs  and  one-time  costs  related  to business optimization.\n\n2022  EBITDA  decreased  by  29%  to  $321  million,  and  EBITDA  margin  fell  by  approximately  30  basis  points  to approximately 112% compared to 2021, as a result of the difficult economic environment faced by the business group.\n\nThe Company expects continued challenges across parts of  EMEA in  2024,  which  would  be  partially  mitigated  by demand recovery should interest rates decline. The Company expects profitability improvements from cost optimization initiatives, overall growth in market share and continued product portfolio expansion.\n\n## Connectivity Solutions Business Group\n\n|                             | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Connectivity Solutions  (1) | 2023                      | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Net sales                   | $1,125                    | $1,370                    | $994                      |\n| Cost of sales               | 688                       | 869                       | 765                       |",

        "page_content": "## Net sales\n\nPrecision Agriculture net sales decreased by 2% in 2023 to $1,063 million. The decrease was driven by a slowdown in demand in Europe and Africa, the impact of extreme weather conditions in the U.S. and lower customer investment in irrigation systems due to both high interest rates and weak crop prices. These factors were partially offset by strong results in Mexico, Brazil, China, India and Turkey.\n\nNet sales in 2022 fell by 4% to $1,085 million. The decrease in revenues was driven by a slowdown in demand in most markets and currency devaluation, partially offset by strength in Latin America and Turkey. The slowdown in Europe was directly related to economic weakness relating to the war in Ukraine and high energy costs affecting key market segments, especially the greenhouse business.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales in 2023 decreased by 3% to $764 million due to the decrease in sales and input cost.\n\nCost of sales in 2022 decreased by 2% to $790 million due to the decrease in sales partially offset by increasing input cost.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nPrecision Agriculture gross profit and gross margin increased 1% during 2023 to $299 million and 29% respectively compared to 2022 due to favorable raw material cost.\n\nGross profit decreased 8% during 2022 to $295 million while gross margin decreased to 27% in 2022 from 29% in 2021 due to the adverse impacts on sales and costs discussed above.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nPrecision  Agriculture  operating  expense  increased  4%  to  $286 million  in  2023  as  a  result  of  growth  initiatives  and inflationary pressures.\n\nIn 2022 operating expenses remained stable, growing less than 1% to 25% of sales.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n2023 EBITDA was $118 million, representing a decrease of 1% vs. 2022. The slight decrease was due to lower revenues, partially offset by favorable raw material prices and tight cost control.\n\n2022 EBITDA was $119 million, representing a decrease of 19%, while EBITDA margin decreased 200 basis points to 11% compared to 2021, as the business experienced a decrease in demand, particularly during the fourth quarter of the year, which was a result of continued destocking in the customer value chain after an inventory build-up in the first half of the year.\n\nThe Company expects improvement in demand in EMEA, while China and India are expected to remain strong in 2024.

The increase reflected higher costs of raw materials, logistics and freight.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nIn 2023 gross profit grew 21% to $419 million and the business group's operating margin grew to 46% driven by favorable pricing and lower raw material cost.\n\nIn 2022 gross profit grew 28% to $346 million and the business group's operating margin grew to 42% driven by strong product pricing which offset lower volumes and higher input costs.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nIn 2023 Fluor & Energy Materials operating expenses grew by 23% to $122 million as result of increasing sales and investment in strategic growth investments.\n\nFluor & Energy Materials operating expenses grew by 13% to $99 million as result of increasing sales in 2022.\n\n## EBITDA\n\nIn 2023 EBITDA grew 16% to $354 million and EBITDA margin grew 276 basis points to 39% compared with 2022 due to strong pricing across the product portfolio.\n\nIn 2022 EBITDA grew 25% to $305 million and EBITDA margin grew 300 basis points to 36% compared with 2021, driven by revenue increases from strong pricing across the product portfolio, which helped offset lower volumes and higher input costs.\n\nThe Company expects volumes to be lower in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of a quota step-down of refrigerant gases in certain regions. The Company will optimize value realization of its quota in regulated markets and from existing products and applications. The Company will also continue introducing new, lower global warming potential, refrigerants and  medical  propellants.  In  addition,  it  will  maintain  control  on  spending  and  capital  investments,  only  dedicating resources to critical initiatives.\n\n## ii. Financial Condition of the Company, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe net debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased from 1.65 times to 2.35 times year-over-year due primarily to the reduction in EBITDA year over year as well as an increase in net debt that was largely driven by the appreciation of the Mexican peso. Working capital increased by $109 million during the year. Capital expenditures amounted to $696 million.\n\nDuring 2023 Orbia made $240 million in dividend payments to shareholders.\n\nOrbia's net debt of $3.4 billion was comprised of total debt of $4.9 billion, less cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023 Orbia covered its liquidity needs using its generation of cash flows from ordinary business operations and financing through loans.",

This issue does not impact Dura-Line's Datacom conduit products.\n\nThe natural gas distribution business, now operated through PolyPipe LLC ('PolyPipe'), conducted an analysis and determined that the issue occurred intermittently and estimates it impacted less than 1% of the small diameter NGD pipe produced by Dura-Line at its plant in Gainesville, Texas. Based on the analysis to date, management believes it is highly unlikely that any possibly affected pipe poses a risk of a near-term performance issue.\n\nPolypipe has resumed shipping and sale of small diameter NGD pipe at its plant in Erwin, Tennessee with enhanced monitoring, production, and quality processes. PolyPipe has received demands for compensation from certain direct and indirect customers for costs associated with addressing the issue, including removing and replacing potentially impacted installed pipe. In September 2022, Southern California Gas Company and San Diego Gas & Electric Company filed a complaint against Dura-Line in the California Superior Court of San Diego (subsequently transferred to the Superior Court of Los Angeles), asserting various claims based on allegations that they may have purchased non-conforming pipe manufactured by Dura-Line and seeking unspecified damages. Dura-Line denies liability and intends to vigorously defend the matter.  PolyPipe may receive additional demands for compensation in the future that may result in litigation and could give rise to potential material liabilities.\n\n## Ethylene Matter\n\nIn 2023 Shell Chemicals Europe B.V. ('Shell') made a claim for damages against several companies, including Orbia and its Vestolit GmbH affiliate, in the Dutch courts.  Shell is alleging damages in an aggregate amount of 1.1 billion Euros from the various defendants relating to infringements of competition law on the ethylene purchasing market, for which the European Commission imposed fines in July 2020.  In connection with the same 2020 European Commission proceeding, Repsol Quimica, S.A. and affiliates also made a claim for unspecified damages in 2023. Orbia and Vestolit reject the allegations, believe that the claim is meritless and intend to vigorously defend their rights in the proceedings.\n\n## Wolkaite Project",

        "page_content": "Netafim Ltd. is currently engaged in a government irrigation project in the Tigray region of Ethiopia called (the Wolkaite project), which is in an advanced stage. The customer is the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (the ESC). Due to civil unrest, a state of emergency has been in effect in the region since November 4, 2021. In late November 2021, Netafim notified the ESC, the Lender, insurers, and other concerned parties that an event of force majeure had occurred as a result of the ongoing civil unrest, suspending Netafim's obligations under the project agreement.\n\nUnder the original project agreement, if the force majeure conditions were to continue for an extended period, each of the parties would have the right to terminate said agreement.  On July 1, 2022, the parties entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the MOU) which suspended until December 31, 2022, the right to cancel the project agreement due to an ongoing force majeure event. The MOU also establishes a period for the parties to assess the condition of the project and to try to reach an agreement to resume the project. At present, as has been publicly reported, Ethiopian government agencies and other parties are engaged with lender groups such as the Paris Group to restructure significant amounts of Ethiopian debt. In this context, pending the successful restructuring of such debt the ESC has failed to make the three most recent payments under the relevant project agreements. All parties are cooperating and monitoring the situation. In addition to potential costs arising from delays to the project and possible damage to the existing project, it is possible that Netafim could incur additional liabilities under certain scenarios.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nIn addition to the matters discussed above, the Company is part to litigation that it considers to be routine and incidental to the business. The Company does not expect the results of any of these litigation matters to have a material effect on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Tax debts\n\nNeither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have outstanding tax obligations as of December 31, 2023.\n\n## Relevant Transactions not Recorded in the Balance Sheet and Income Statement\n\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has no relevant material transactions not recorded in the Balance Sheet or  the  Income  Statement  of  the  Company.  Orbia  does  not  consolidate  acquired  companies  until  the  related transactions have closed, subject to approval by competition authorities, when applicable.\n\n## iii. Internal control\n\nOrbia's  bylaws  provide  for  the  existence  of  the  Audit  and  Governance  Committees,  intermediate  corporate  bodies constituted in accordance with the Applicable Legislation in order to assist the Board of Directors in the performance of its functions. Through the aforementioned Committees and the External Auditor, reasonable assurance is granted that the transactions and acts carried out by the Company are executed and recorded in accordance with the terms and parameters established by the Board of Directors and the governing bodies of Orbia, by the Applicable Legislation and relevant general guidelines, and the criteria and applicable financial information standards (IFRS).\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nOrbia is  governed by corporate governance principles that frame its operations and support its results.

        "page_content": "Orbia has internal control policies that govern various aspects of its operations as well as company-wide accounting policies  designed  to  ensure  consistency  of  accounting  treatment  across  the  organization.      The  Company's  major accounting policies are disclosed in its audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annex to this Annual Report.\n\n## f) Critical accounting estimates, provisions or reserves\n\nIn  the  application  of  the  Company's  accounting  policies  described  in  its  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may have a significant impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on its balance sheet. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in those determinations.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.\n\nConsolidation of Ingleside Ethylene LLC:  The Company consolidates Ingleside Ethylene LLC for which it owns a 50% equity interest as a subsidiary. The Company can contractually control major operating decisions regarding production and sales at the joint venture and accordingly has determined that it has control of this investment.\n\nEstimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives:  The Company annually performs tests to determine whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are impairment. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinites  lives  are  typically  allocated  to  cash  generating  units  (CGUs).    The recoverable amounts of each CGU have been determined based on the calculations of their value in use, which require the use of significant estimates including projected cash flows driven from revenues, anticipated gross margins, capital expenditures, and the rate used to discount future cash flows based on the weighted cost of capital of each CGU. Additionally, the Company has utilized an estimation of fair value less cost to dispose (FVLCD) for one of its CGUs.   Key assumptions used to calculate the FVLCD of that CGU included the determination of comparable market transactions from which to derive the appropriate valuation multiple as well as the assumed cost to dispose of the CGU.\n\nLong lived assets: The Company reviews depreciable and amortizable assets on an annual basis for signs of impairment, or when certain events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recovered during the remaining useful life of the assets.\n\nAdditionally, the Company estimates the useful lives of long-lived assets in order to determine the depreciation and amortization expenses to be recorded during the reporting period. The useful life of an asset is calculated when the asset is acquired and is based on past experience with similar assets, considering anticipated technological changes or other such changes. When such changes to the anticipated use of an asset occur faster or differently than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be reduced. This would lead to the recognition of a greater depreciation  and  amortization  expense  in  future  periods.  Alternatively,  these  types  of  changes  could  result  in  the recognition of a charge for impairment to reflect the reduction in the expected future economic benefits associated with the assets.\n\nInventory and Receivables: The Company uses estimates to determine the net realizable value of its inventories and its allowance for current expected credit losses for its accounts receivable.  The factors that the Company considers to determine the net realizable value of its inventory are production and sales volumes, and changes in demand for certain products, including expected sales prices and costs. The reserve for current expected credit losses is based on the Company's assessment of the probability of default and estimated recovery rate of its accounts receivable at period end based on a variety of inputs, including collection history and an assessment of current factors that may impact the credit worthiness of its customers or risk of non-collection.\n\nOre  Reserves:  The  Company  periodically  evaluates  the  estimates  of  its  ore  reserves  (fluorite  and  salt),  for  the unexploited amount remaining in its existing mines, that can be produced and sold at a profit. Such estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples, combined with assumptions about market prices and production costs relating to the respective mines. The Company updates the estimate for ore reserves at the beginning of each year.\n\nDefined  Benefit  Obligation  Discount  Rate:  To  determine  the  carrying  amount  of  the  Company's  defined  benefit obligations,  the  Company must  estimate  an  appropriate  discount  rate.  The  Company's defined benefit  obligation  is discounted using market yields on high-quality government and corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Judgement must be used to establish the criteria for the bonds to be included in the population from which the yield",

        "page_content": "curve is derived. The most important criteria considered for the selection of the bonds include the size of the issuance of the government and corporate bonds, their rating and the identification of the atypical bonds that have been excluded.\n\nContingent Liabilities:   Management makes judgments and estimates in recording provisions for matters relating to claims and litigation.  Specifically, management must determine when a liability is probable to have occurred, and then, if deemed probable, must estimate the cost of the most likely outcome.  Actual costs may vary from these estimates for several reasons, such as changes in cost estimates for resolution of complaints and different interpretations of the law.\n\nRecoverability of Deferred Tax Assets:  The Company prepares financial projections for each legal entity over which it has control in order to determine whether recorded tax assets may be realized in the future and relies on these estimated projections to determine if a deferred tax asset is recoverable.\n\nLeases: The determination of the value of the Company's right-of-assets and related lease liabilities require various estimates to be made including the expected term of the lease and the incremental borrowing rate used to discount future lease payments when determining the lease liability.\n\nAssets Acquired in Business Combinations: The application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of various valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, including the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research and development activities, probability of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates.\n\nFair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments:  The  fair  value  of  the  financial  instruments  that  are  presented  in  the  financial statements  has  been  determined  by  the  Company  using  the  information  available  in  the  market  or  other  valuation techniques that require judgment to develop and interpret fair value estimates. Additionally, such techniques use inputs based on market conditions as of the reporting date. Consequently, the estimated fair value of the financial instruments presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company could get in the open market. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methods could have a material effect on the fair value calculations.\n\n'Put/Call' Options - Redeemable non-controlling interest: The Company's calculation of the fair value of its 'Put/Call' options  with  minority  shareholders  require  certain  estimates  including  the  amount  and  timing  of  future  EBITDA, determination of the discount rates used to calculate the liabilities, terminal growth rates and probability of execution.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions: The Company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions and tax returns filed in those countries are subject to review and examination by local tax authorities with the rules in some jurisdictions being complex to interpret.\n\nThe Company recognizes uncertain tax positions when it is probable that a relevant taxing authority will not accept the tax treatment as reported in the income tax filing. Estimates have to be made by the Company on the tax treatment of a number of transactions in advance of the ultimate tax determination being certain.\n\nThere is significant judgement and estimation required in determining uncertain tax positions and a risk that all potential tax exposures may not be identified.  However, the Company considers that such uncertain tax positions will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or operating results.\n\n## Main accounting policies\n\nFor  additional  details  regarding  estimates,  provisions  or  critical  accounting  reserves  applied  by  the  Company,  the investing public is recommended to carefully read and analyze Note 4 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Orbia that are included in the Section \"Annexes' of this Annual Report.",

The amount that the external auditors have charged related to the audit as of December 31, 2023, for audit services are $6.2 million dollars, while the other services not related to the audit are approximately $1.5 million dollars, among the main services are those related to transfer pricing studies which represents 14% of the total fees paid.\n\nThe additional services not related to the December 31, 2023, audit do not affect the independence of the external auditor.  These  services  are  permitted  since  they  do  not  entail  the  design  or  implementation  of  internal  controls over   financial information, which continue to be the Issuer's responsibility.\n\nThe appointment/ratification of the independent auditors is submitted annually by management to the Company's Audit Committee, which in turn reports thereon to the Board of Directors.\n\n## b) Transactions with Related Persons and Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the past, the Company has entered into, and intends to continue to, enter into certain transactions with related persons or companies, including, but not limited to, the transactions described in this section.

The  Company  believes  that  these transactions  are  entered  into  under  conditions  similar  to  those  it  could  obtain  from  unrelated  third  parties,  i.e., representing current market prices.\n\n## Relationships and transactions with related parties\n\nThe companies Kaluz, Elementia, S.A.B. de C.V., Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s, S.A. de C.V., Grupo Pochteca, S.A.B. de C.V., Banco Ve por M\u00e1s, S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple, Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s, Casa de Bolsa Ve por M\u00e1s S.A. de C.V., Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s and Constructora y Perforadora Latina, S.A. de C.V., as well as subsidiaries of the foregoing, are considered persons or parties related to the Issuer for the purposes of this Report.\n\nAll transactions with related persons or parties are carried out under conditions similar to market conditions.\n\nOrbia  has  several  investment  securities,  trust,  and  bank  and  investment  contracts  with  Banco  Ve  por  M\u00e1s,  S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple, Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s y Casa de Bolsa Ve por M\u00e1s, S.A. de C.V., Grupo Financiero Ve por M\u00e1s (related parties of Orbia), which generate interest at rates similar to market rates.\n\nOrbia and Kaluz, the Company's main shareholder, maintain an advisory services contract, which establishes that Orbia will pay Kaluz monthly the amount equivalent to the total costs and expenses incurred    by Kaluz as a result of providing such services, to which a market margin is added.\n\nThe Company recognized revenues from related parties for the years ended 2023, 2022, and 2021 of $5 million, $6 million and $4 million, respectively, and expenses to related parties for the years ended 2023, 2022, and 2021 of $5 million each year.

In addition, the CRC reviewed Orbia's position and disclosures on climate change, prepared by the Company's Vice president of Sustainability, and a cyber risk assessment prepared by Orbia's Chief Information Security Officer. The business risks, and specifically those that could be material to Orbia as a whole, were updated and reviewed quarterly during 2023 along with the status of related risk mitigation plans.

An agreement of this nature shall not be understood to be an agreement entered into by shareholders for the appointment of minority Directors. Such agreements shall be  subject  to the provisions of  the LMV and shall not be enforceable  against the Company  to the detriment of the other shareholders or the Company's financial or business interests.\n\nIf  purchases  or  acquisitions  of  shares  are  made,  or  restricted  agreements  are  entered  into,  without  observing the requirement to obtain prior favorable written agreement of the Board of Directors of the Company and, if applicable, compliance  with  the  aforementioned  provisions,  the  shares,  securities  and  rights  pertaining  to such  purchases, acquisitions or agreements, shall not grant any right or faculty to vote at the Company's Shareholders' Meetings, nor shall any value be given to certificates of deposit of shares issued by any credit institution, financial intermediary or stock exchange, depositary or institution or for the deposit of securities, to accredit the right to attend a Shareholders' Meeting. Nor shall such shares, rights or securities be entered in the Register of Shares of the Company or, as the case may be, the Company shall cancel their entry in the Register of Shares kept by the Company.\n\nNotwithstanding and regardless of any consequence arising from noncompliance with the foregoing, each person who acquires shares, securities, instruments, or rights representing the Company's capital stock in violation of the provisions will be obliged to pay the Company a conventional penalty in an amount equal to the price of all the shares, securities or instruments representing the Company's capital stock that have been the object of the forbidden transaction. In the event that the transactions that have given rise to the acquisition of a percentage of shares, securities, instruments, or rights representing the Company's capital stock equal to or greater than 10% (ten percent) of the capital stock are made free of charge, the conventional penalty will be equivalent to the market value of said shares, securities, or instruments, provided that the authorization of the Company's Board of Directors has not been obtained.\n\nIf the Company maintains the shares representing its capital stock registered in the National Securities Registry, the above requirement, in the event of transactions carried out through the stock exchange, will also be subject to the rules established by the Stock Market Act or those issued by the National Banking and Securities Commission in accordance therewith.\n\n## Shares\n\nAll shares, both those representing the minimum fixed capital stock, with no right of withdrawal, and those representing variable capital, are ordinary, nominative, without nominal value and confer on their holders' equal rights and obligations.\n\n## Shareholders' Meetings\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting is the supreme body of the Company. Meetings shall be Ordinary, Extraordinary or Special. The Extraordinary Meetings will be those that meet to deal with any of the matters referred to in Article 182 of the General Corporations Act, as well as Articles 53 and 108 of the LMV. Special  Meetings will be those that meet to deal with matters that may affect a single category of shareholders. All other Meetings shall be Ordinary, the latter being held at least once a year within the four months following the end of the fiscal year, to address the matters indicated in Articles 181 of the General Corporations Act and 56 section IV of the LMV.",
