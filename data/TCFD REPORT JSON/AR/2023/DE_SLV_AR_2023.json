It monitored the activities of the  company's  Board  of  Management,  addressed  the  succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and advised the Board of Management on business management issues.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the Supervisory Board held six meetings and adopted one written resolution. The meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December. The written resolution was  adopted  in  October.  All  meetings  were  held  as  in-person meetings.\n\nAt all meetings held in the financial year under review, the Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board about the development  of  business  at  Allianz SE  and  the  Allianz  Group.  In particular, the Board of Management presented the development of Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments. The Board of Management provided comprehensive information about the development of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, including the planning as well as deviations of actual business developments from the planning. In this context, the Board  of  Management  also  regularly  discussed  the  adequacy  of capitalization, the solvency ratio of Allianz SE and the Group, and the corresponding stress and risk scenarios with the Supervisory Board. The  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the respective auditor's reports, the half-year report as well as quarterly earnings releases were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the first half of 2023 in particular, the meetings again focused on the review of the Structured Alpha matter in close dialogue with the Board of  Management,  assisted  by  the  law  firm  mandated  by  the Supervisory Board. The reports and deliberations also focused on the impact  of  rising  inflation  rates  and  interest  rates  on  the  overall\n\neconomy and the insurance sector as well as a range of strategic topics, including the risk strategy and IT strategy, and the Board of Management's planning for the financial year 2024. The status of the digital implementation of the Allianz Customer Model by means of the Allianz  Business  Master  Platform  and  the  merger  of  the  global MidCorp business with the business of Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE under the trading name Allianz Commercial was reported on at several meetings. Another regular item discussed was cyber risk security. The Supervisory Board also dealt extensively with personnel matters relating to the Board of Management as well as succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The  deliberations  of  the  Supervisory  Board  and  in  particular  the Personnel  Committee  and  Sustainability  Committee  also  included establishing target achievement  and  setting  targets  for  the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received regular, timely and comprehensive reports from the Board of Management. The Board of Management's oral reports at the meetings were prepared with written documents, sent to each member of the Supervisory Board in good time before the relevant  meeting.  The  Board  of  Management  also  informed  the Supervisory  Board  in  writing  about  important  events,  including between meetings. The Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board  of  Management  held  regular  discussions  about  key developments and decisions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board held separate talks with each member of the Board of Management on  each  individual's  status  of  target  achievement,  both  for  the respective half year and the full year.\n\nOnce  again  in  2023,  individual  and  group  training  sessions  were implemented on the basis of a development plan adopted for the further training of the members of the Supervisory Board, for example on the topics of cybersecurity, the sales strategy, and the auditing of financial statements.\n\nAt the meeting on 16 February 2023, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively with the preliminary business figures for the financial year 2022  and  the  Board  of  Management's  dividend  proposal.  The appointed audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (PwC), Frankfurt am Main, reported in detail on the preliminary results of its audit. In the further course of the meeting, the Supervisory Board also discussed the status of the measures taken to implement results from the audit carried out by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regarding the Group steering processes and the System of Governance. Comprehensive discussions were also held on the status of implementation of the actions  adopted  by  the  Board  of  Management  following  the Structured  Alpha  matter.  The  Supervisory  Board  also  obtained  a detailed report on the status of the investigations carried out by the external lawyers into the question of potential misconduct at the level of subsidiaries in connection with the  Structured Alpha matter. The Board of Management also reported on PIMCO's Asset Management business, focusing in particular on governance topics. The Supervisory Board  also  discussed  the  target  achievement  of  the  individual members of the Board of Management and, on that basis, set their variable  remuneration  for  the  financial  year  2022,  subject  to  the approval  of  the  annual  financial  statements.  In  this  context,  the Supervisory  Board  decided  to  make  use  of  its  discretion  to  take unforeseeable extraordinary developments into account in determining  target  achievement  and  to  use  the  net  income attributable  to  shareholders,  adjusted  for  the  effects  of  Allianz's divestment in Russia, as the basis for target achievement. Against the backdrop of the Structured Alpha matter, the Supervisory Board once more also discussed the question of the applicability of the so-called compliance caveat in paying variable remuneration components to members  of  the  Board  of  Management.  The  independent investigations of potential breaches of duty by members of the Board of Management had already concluded in December 2022 that there were no indications of misconduct by any members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE. Hence there was no reason to apply the compliance  caveat.  As  part  of  the  performance  assessment,  the Supervisory Board carried out a fit and proper assessment of the",

At the end of  the  meeting,  the  Supervisory  Board  held  an  executive  session without  the  Board  of  Management  members  being  present  and discussed questions relating to succession planning for the Board of Management as well as the talks of the Supervisory Board Chairman with investors and proxy advisors.\n\nAt the meeting on 2 March 2023, the Board of Management first reported on the business developments to that date in the financial year 2023. The Board of Management also presented its report on the development of risks and solvency in the financial year 2022 and the outlook  for  2023.  The  annual  reports  from  Internal  Audit  and Compliance were also presented and discussed at the meeting. The Supervisory Board  then  discussed  the  audited  annual  and consolidated financial statements and the Management and Group Management Report, including the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report, the solvency statements for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as the Board of Management's recommendation  for  the  appropriation  of  earnings.  The  auditor confirmed that there had been no discrepancies since their February report and issued an unqualified auditor's report for the individual and consolidated financial statements and for the solvency statements. The auditor did not have any reservations, either, regarding the audit of the Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report, which partly went beyond legal requirements. The Supervisory Board then approved the audited annual and consolidated financial statements. It approved  the  Board  of  Management's  proposal  for  the appropriation of earnings for the financial year 2022, the Remuneration  Report  and  the  Supervisory  Board  Report,  the Corporate Governance Statement, and the Non-Financial Statement. Furthermore, the Board of Management reported on the status of investigations into potential misconduct at the level of subsidiaries in relation to the Structured Alpha matter. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved, at the recommendation of the Audit Committee, to propose to the Annual General Meeting the election of PwC as auditor for the 2023 individual and consolidated financial statements and for the review of the half-year financial report for 2023, and to mandate PwC with the supplementary audit of the Remuneration Report and the Non-Financial Statement for the financial year 2023. Moreover, the Supervisory Board reviewed the agenda and proposals for resolution for Allianz SE's 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and approved the stipulations of the Board of Management for the virtual AGM.

Lastly, the Supervisory Board dealt with succession planning for the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management.\n\nOn 4 May 2023, just before the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Management briefed the Supervisory Board on business developments in the first quarter of 2023, as well as on the current situation of both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE, in particular with regard to the development of the Group's solvency. The Supervisory Board also once again dealt with the status of the measures initiated by the Board of Management following the Structured Alpha matter and  the  status  of  the  measures  to  implement  results  of  the  audit carried out by the BaFin regarding the Group steering processes and the System of Governance.\n\nThe meeting on 23 June 2023 was held at Allianz UK in London. At the meeting, the Board of Management provided a comprehensive report on the business developments in the financial year 2023 to that date. The Supervisory Board also dealt with BaFin's findings from the review of the implementation of the insurance supervisory law requirements for IT and the measures initiated by the Board of Management in response to these findings. Furthermore, given the substantial progress in implementing the measures initiated following the Structured Alpha matter, and at the recommendation of the lawyers mandated by the Supervisory  Board,  the  Supervisory  Board  decided  to  dissolve  the Audit Committee working group specifically set up for this purpose in 2021 and to return to regular reporting. In addition, the Supervisory Board obtained a comprehensive report on the status of the merger of the  global  MidCorp  business  with  the  business  of  Allianz  Global Corporate & Specialty SE under the trading name Allianz Commercial. The Board of Management also reported in detail on the current concept of the Allianz Business Master Platform and its implementation status. Other topics covered by reports included the Board of Management's decision to leave the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance, and the business of Allianz UK, which was reported on by the CEO of Allianz UK. In addition, the Board of Management provided its regular status report on cyber risks and cybersecurity at Allianz as well as its annual report on Group data privacy.

The  mandates  of  Board  of Management members Dr. Karuth-Zelle and Mr. Townsend were each extended by five years up until 31 December 2028. At the end of the\n\nmeeting, the Supervisory Board held an executive session without the members of the Board of Management being present and informed itself about the mid-year talks held between the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management. Furthermore,  the  Supervisory  Board  discussed  the  assessment  of Allianz made by an external finance and insurance analyst from the independent analyst firm Autonomous Research with that analyst.\n\nAt the meeting on 28 September 2023, the Board of Management firstly again reported on the business developments in the financial year  2023  to  that  date,  focusing  in  particular  on  the  effects  of damages from natural catastrophes. One of the key items discussed at the meeting was the Board of Management's IT strategy, and, in that context, the implementation status of the current strategy to launch the  Business  Master  Platform.  The  Board  of  Management  also reported on the motor vehicle liability insurance segment in Germany and  provided  an  update  on  the  business  of  Allianz  Direct.  The Supervisory Board also dealt with the status of business activities in the Latin America region.

The Supervisory Board also discussed the succession planning for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board then held its executive session without the members of the Board of Management being present.\n\nOn 1 October 2023, the Supervisory Board extended the mandate of Mr. B\u00e4te as member and Chairman of the Board of Management until the end of the day of the Annual General Meeting resolving on the approval of the actions of the Board of Management for the financial year  2027  by  way  of  a  written  resolution.

At Group level, the  focus  was  on  governance  processes  in  connection  with  ESG commitments.  A  review  of  the  design  and  effectiveness  of  control functions, which were transferred to Allianz Technology together with a large number of IT services, was established as another key audit area at Group level. Other key audit areas were the review of controls over non-financial reporting and the assessment of the appropriateness of horizontal monitoring by Compliance. The results of the audits of the key audit areas were subsequently reported by the auditor at individual meetings. The Audit Committee discussed the assessment of the audit risk, the audit strategy, and the audit planning with  the  auditor.  In  addition,  the  Audit  Committee  held  several discussions  with  the  auditor  in  the  absence  of  the  Board  of Management.  Moreover,  the  Audit  Committee  conducted  an assessment of the quality of the audit and discussed the auditor's fees.

At both meetings, the committee discussed the current risk situation of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with the Board of Management. At the March meeting, the Risk Report and other riskrelated  statements  in  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial statements as well as management and Group management reports were reviewed with the auditor and acknowledged with approval. The appropriateness of the early risk detection system at Allianz SE and the Allianz Group and the result of further risk assessments by the auditor were also discussed. A recommendation was provided to the Audit Committee to include the Risk Report, as presented and discussed, in the Annual Report.\n\nAt both meetings, the Risk Committee extensively dealt with the risk strategy, risk appetite, capital management, the external rating, as well  as  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk  management  system  for  the Allianz Group and Allianz SE.

In addition, the Nomination Committee, together with the Board of Management and in consultation with BaFin, agreed on specific measures to prepare the candidates  at  an  early  stage  for  the  duties  of  members  of  the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE. These measures include, for example, preparing candidates in the framework of a mandate or a guest role on the Supervisory Board of a European subsidiary of Allianz SE, or other suitable measures, as well as the early identification of training measures,  taking  particular  account  of  the  fitness  requirements communicated by BaFin.

At the September meeting, the committee also held discussions with the Board of Management on the Allianz Group's long-term climate targets resulting from the published 'Net-zero plan with interim targets for 2030 for key business areas', and prepared the setting of sustainability targets for 2024 by the Personnel Committee. The committee also focused on the ongoing development of the sustainability strategy, particularly with regard to the general socio-political and business environment, as well as on the application of new artificial intelligence technologies for data usage in customer products. In view of the particular importance of the latter topic for the Allianz Group's business activities, also with regard to aspects of data ethics, the members of the Technology Committee also participated in the discussion of this topic at the relevant meeting.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  obtained  regular  and  comprehensive information on the work performed by the committees.\n\n## Overview of members' participation in Supervisory Board and committee meetings in the financial year 2023\n\n## Individualized publication of members' participation in meetings\n\n|                                           | Presence   | %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|-----|\n| Plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board |            |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)               | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg (Vice Chairwoman) | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Herbert Hainer (Vice Chairman )           | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                           | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Christine Bosse                           | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Rashmy Chatterjee                         | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner                    | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Jean-Claude Le Goa\u00ebr                      | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Martina Grundler                          | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Frank Kirsch                              | 6/6        | 100 |\n| J\u00fcrgen Lawrenz                            | 6/6        | 100 |\n| Primiano Di Paolo                         | 6/6        | 100 |\n\n|                                   | Presence   | %   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|-----|\n| Standing Committee                |            |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                   | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Jean-Claude Le Goa\u00ebr              | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Herbert Hainer                    | 5/5        | 100 |\n| J\u00fcrgen Lawrenz                    | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Personnel Committee               |            |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg           | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Herbert Hainer                    | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Audit Committee                   |            |     |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner (Chairman) | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                   | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Michael Diekmann                  | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Jean-Claude Le Goa\u00ebr              | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Martina Grundler                  | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Risk Committee                    |            |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Christine Bosse                   | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner            | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Frank Kirsch                      | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Primiano Di Paolo                 | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Technology Committee              |            |     |\n| Rashmy Chatterjee (Chairwoman)    | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg           | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Michael Diekmann                  | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner            | 2/2        | 100 |\n| J\u00fcrgen Lawrenz                    | 2/2        | 100 |\n| Nomination Committee              |            |     |\n| Michael Diekmann (Chairman)       | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Christine Bosse                   | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Dr. Friedrich Eichiner            | 5/5        | 100 |\n| Sustainability Committee          |            |     |\n| Christine Bosse (Chairwoman)      | 4/4        | 100 |\n| Sophie Boissard                   | 3/4        | 75  |\n| Gabriele Burkhardt-Berg           | 4/4        | 100 |\n| Michael Diekmann                  | 4/4        | 100 |\n| Frank Kirsch                      | 3/4        | 75  |\n\nUpon a proposal submitted by the Supervisory Board, the company's Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  4 May 2023  appointed  PwC  as auditor for the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as the review of the half-year Financial Report 2023. PwC audited the financial statements of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as the respective management reports and issued an unqualified auditor's report in each case. The management reports each also contain the Non-Financial Statement. The consolidated financial statements were prepared  on  the  basis  of  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE were prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards. PwC performed a review of the half-year Financial Report. In addition, PwC was also mandated to perform an audit of the solvency statements according to Solvency II as  of  31 December 2023  for  Allianz SE  and  the  Allianz Group. Furthermore,  PwC  was  commissioned  to  conduct  an  audit  of  the contents  of  the  Non-Financial  Statement  and  the  Remuneration Report.\n\nAll Supervisory Board members received the documentation relating to the annual financial statements and the audit reports from PwC in due time. The preliminary financial statements and PwC's preliminary audit results were discussed in the Audit Committee on 21 February 2024, as well as in the Supervisory Board's plenary session on 22 February 2024. The finalized financial statements and PwC's audit reports (dated 26 February 2024) were reviewed by the Audit Committee on 5 March 2024 and discussed in the Supervisory Board plenary  session  on  6 March 2024.  The  auditors  participated  in  the discussions  and  presented  the  results  of  their  audit.  Particular emphasis  was  placed  on  the  key  audit  matters  described  in  the auditor's report and on the audit procedures performed. No material weaknesses in the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. There were no circumstances that might give cause for concern about the auditor's independence. In addition, the solvency statements  dated  31 December 2023  for  both  Allianz SE  and  the Allianz Group, as well as the related reports by PwC, were reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.",

It approved the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Board of Management. The financial statements  have  thus  been  formally  adopted.

There  was  also  an  increase  of  \u20ac 332 mn  in  the external reinsurance business, primarily stemming from the following reinsurance  lines  of  business:  other  property  reinsurance,  liabilty reinsurance  and  life  reinsurance.  In  total,  \u20ac 13,765 mn  (2022: \u20ac 12,383 mn)  of  gross  premiums  were  attributable  to  PropertyCasualty reinsurance and \u20ac 949 mn (2022: \u20ac 840 mn) to Life/Health reinsurance.\n\nWith 90.4 % (2022: 90.8 %), the net retention ratio remained almost unchanged compared to the previous year. Premiums earned (net) increased to \u20ac 12,966 mn (2022: \u20ac 11,909 mn).\n\nThe  accident  year  claims 1 ratio  (net)  in  Property-Casualty reinsurance increased slightly to 76.9 % (2022: 76.7 %). The losses from natural catastrophe events in 2023 were mainly driven by floods and storms  in  Italy.  The  recoveries  under  our  retrocession  program  for losses from natural catastrophes increased slightly to \u20ac 284 mn (2022: \u20ac 281 mn),  however,  net  losses  from  natural  catastrophes  after retrocession were higher than in the previous year.\n\nThe  run-off result (net) in Property-Casualty  reinsurance amounted to \u20ac 548 mn (2022: \u20ac 1,201 mn) and was mainly influenced by  fire  and  property  reinsurance  (\u20ac 162 mn),  credit  and  bond reinsurance (\u20ac 110 mn), marine and aviation reinsurance (\u20ac 88 mn) as well as personal accident reinsurance (\u20ac 82 mn). Overall, the calendar year claims ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance increased to 72.5 % (2022: 66.2 %).\n\nThe expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance increased to 29.3 % (2022: 28.2 %), driven by a higher commission ratio of 28.6 % (2022: 27.4 %). The administrative expense ratio remained constant at 0.8 % (2022: 0.8 %).\n\nIn  Life/Health  reinsurance,  the  net  underwriting  result  slightly decreased to \u20ac 37 mn (2022: \u20ac 43 mn).\n\nThe total net underwriting result amounted to \u20ac (240) mn (2022: \u20ac 701 mn), mainly driven by the development of the calendar year loss ratio and expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance in 2023.\n\nIn  2023,  the change  in  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves amounted to \u20ac (193) mn (2022: \u20ac 486 mn). This was mainly driven by a strengthening of the claims equalization and similar reserves in the liability as well as credit and bond reinsurance business. On the other hand,  a  release  of  the  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves occurred in particular in the fire reinsurance line of business.\n\nThus,  the net  technical  result amounted  to  \u20ac (433) mn  (2022: \u20ac 1,187 mn).",

This was partially offset by a lower profit transfer from Allianz Asset Management GmbH, which declined by \u20ac 171 mn to \u20ac 609 mn.\n\nIncome from affiliated enterprises and participations decreased by \u20ac 583 mn to \u20ac 6,468 mn, mainly driven by lower dividend payments from our subsidiaries Allianz Holding France SAS and Allianz Holding Eins GmbH, which went down by \u20ac 193 mn to \u20ac 537 mn and by \u20ac 50 mn to \u20ac 500 m, respectively, as well as the fact that no dividend payment was collected from Allianz Finance II Luxembourg S.A.R.L. in 2023 (2022: \u20ac 278 mn). Several further decreases in this position amounting to \u20ac 240 mn were partially offset by a higher dividend payment from our Group company Allianz Europe B.V., which rose by \u20ac 150 mn to \u20ac 5,300 mn.\n\nIncome from other investments climbed by \u20ac 404 mn to \u20ac 884 mn, mainly consisting of income from bonds (\u20ac 347 mn), funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed (\u20ac 169 mn), intra-group cash pooling (\u20ac 161 mn), and loans (\u20ac 90 mn).\n\nRealized gains went down by \u20ac 536 mn to \u20ac 133 mn and were primarily related to the sale of bonds (\u20ac 71 mn) and shares in affiliated enterprises (\u20ac 52 mn).\n\nIncome from reversal of impairments increased by \u20ac 666 mn to \u20ac 728 mn, mainly driven by write-ups on bonds (\u20ac 651 mn), reflecting a partial recovery of fair values in our bond portfolio in 2023 after the significant decline of bond prices in the previous year.\n\nExpenses  for  the  management  of  investments,  interest,  and other investment-related expenses rose by \u20ac 575 mn to \u20ac 1,575 mn, driven by higher interest expenses (\u20ac 558 mn) particularly related to intra-group cash pooling (\u20ac 428 mn).\n\nDepreciation  and  impairments  of  investments significantly decreased by \u20ac 2,521 mn to \u20ac 237 mn, primarily because write-downs on  bonds  went  down  to  \u20ac 23 mn  in  2023  compared  to  the extraordinary high amount of write-downs recorded in the previous year (\u20ac 2,222 mn) as a result of the sharp rise in interest rates. Further impairments in 2023 were particularly attributable to write-downs on investment funds (\u20ac 175 mn).\n\nRealized  losses declined  by  \u20ac 246 mn  to  \u20ac 231 mn  and  were primarily related to the sale of bonds (\u20ac 209 mn).\n\nExpenses  for  losses  taken  over increased  by  \u20ac 180 mn  to \u20ac 323 mn, mainly due to higher losses taken over from our service provider Allianz Technology SE and from Allianz Direct VersicherungsAG, which rose by \u20ac 64 mn to \u20ac 158 mn and by \u20ac 66 mn to \u20ac 93 mn, respectively.\n\n## Other non-technical result\n\nThe other non-technical result improved significantly by \u20ac 1,832 mn to \u20ac (640) mn. This development is mainly due to a strong improvement by \u20ac 1,273 mn in the result from derivatives, which is attributable to gains from forward currency contracts and a balanced net result from interest rate swaps after considerable losses in both positions in the previous year. In addition, the improvement in the currency translation result by \u20ac 290 mn had a positive impact on the development of the other non-technical result. The improved currency translation result is primarily due to foreign currency translation gains related to liabilities denominated in USD after corresponding losses in the previous year. The decrease of pension expenses by \u20ac 282 mn also contributed to an improvement  in  the  other  non-technical  result.  The  decrease  can\n\npredominantly be explained by the fact that in the reporting year, and contrary  to the previous year,  there was no one-time expense as a result of an increase of the pension trend for the years 2022 to 2024.\n\nAs far as legally permissible, Allianz SE acts as the controlling company ('Organtr\u00e4ger')  of  the  German  tax  group  that  most  German subsidiaries  belong  to.  As  the  controlling  company,  Allianz SE  is liable for the income taxes of this German tax group.\n\nThe  current  tax  charge  of  Allianz SE  amounted to \u20ac (92) mn (2022: \u20ac (532) mn). Moreover, Allianz SE received a tax allocation of \u20ac 407 mn  (2022:  \u20ac 550 mn)  from  Allianz SE  tax group companies that  recorded taxable income. Taking into account other taxes, the income from taxes amounted to \u20ac 365 mn (2022: \u20ac 6 mn).\n\nNet  income increased  by  \u20ac 3,259 mn  to  \u20ac 8,051 mn  (2022: \u20ac 4,792 mn).",

        "page_content": "## Economic outlook 1\n\n2024 is likely to be another year of interest rate reversals, but this time in the opposite direction: the leading central banks will likely start to cut key interest rates in the second half of the year. On the one hand, this reflects the expectation that inflation is largely under control, as annual average inflation will probably be within striking distance of inflation targets in both the United States (2.3 %) and the eurozone (2.5 %). On the other hand, it is a reaction to the continued weakness in  demand,  which  is  fed  by  several  sources:  the  delayed  effect  of interest rate hikes on investment, declining fiscal policy support, and depleted  savings  reserves.  Overall,  we  therefore  expect  economic growth to decline in 2024, falling by 0.3 percentage points to 2.4 % worldwide; for the United States, we expect it to decline to 1.4 % (-1.0 percentage points). Only the eurozone is likely to reach around the previous year's level with a rate of 0.8 %, as a return to positive growth is assumed for Germany. China will also face headwinds, not least due to its structural problems: we expect rather modest growth of 4.6 %.\n\nOngoing uncertainty about the timing and extent of the next interest rate moves means volatility in the financial markets will remain high in 2024. As the expected cuts in interest rates have already been anticipated in many market prices, disappointment and corresponding market reactions cannot be ruled out. Overall, equities and bonds are likely to move more or less sideways.\n\nThe outlook for 2024 is subject to a special caveat since it is a super  election  year.  Citizens  will  go  to  the  polls  in  countries  that account for 60 % of global economic output - from India to the United States - with election results significantly impacting the economic and geopolitical constellation. First and foremost, this applies to the U.S. elections in November. The associated global political uncertainty is fostering a wait-and-see-attitude among companies and households. There is also the threat of rising political and social tensions as a result of increasing polarization in a weak economic environment.\n\n## Insurance industry outlook\n\nInflation will remain a dominant topic for the insurance industry in 2024, as claims inflation is unlikely to fall as quickly as consumer price inflation, mainly due to rising wages. However,  continued premium increases mean that pressure on underwriting results should ease. On the  other  hand,  the  challenging  macroeconomic  and  geopolitical environment is hampering premium growth.\n\nIn view of the increasing geopolitical upheavals, climate-related natural hazards, and technological risks worldwide, the need for risk protection  and  prevention  remains  high.  Thanks  to  its  financial strength, the insurance industry can meet these needs with innovative solutions, so its role as a partner for strengthening social resilience will continue to grow in importance.\n\nDespite  ongoing  high  volatility,  the  investment  environment should remain relatively friendly in 2024. The higher interest rate level offers  good  opportunities  for  long-term  investors,  and  insurers' investment income is likely to continue to rise.\n\nPremium growth in the property-casualty insurance sector  will continue at a slower pace; however, as in the previous year it is likely to be  driven  primarily  by  rising  prices.  At  the  same  time,  claims development  remains  challenging,  with  structural  factors  such  as increasing climate-related natural catastrophes also playing a role. Investment  income  is  expected  to  increase.  As  higher  wages  are putting pressure on operating costs, increasing productivity through fully digitalized processes is essential.\n\nIn the life insurance sector, providers are increasingly reflecting the higher interest rate level in their products, which should benefit demand for savings and pension products. This is possible because awareness of the need for protection in old age not only remains high but should also continue to rise in the future. The same applies to demand in the risk business. Furthermore, higher investment income will strengthen profitability.\n\n## Business outlook\n\nOur  outlook assumes no significant deviations from our underlying assumptions - specifically:\n\n- -interest rate environment to remain at a high level compared to previous years,\n- -no major volatility in the capital markets,\n- -no disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference or major litigation,\n- -level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average levels,\n- -an average U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.091.\n\nAllianz SE provides a wide range of reinsurance coverage, primarily to the  Allianz Group's  insurance  entities  (group-internal  business),  but also  to  third-party  customers  (external  business).  This  includes Property-Casualty as well as Life/Health reinsurance business on both a proportional and non-proportional basis. Due to the broad spread of  exposures  underwritten  by  line  of  business  and  geography, Allianz SE's portfolio is diversified.\n\nAllianz Group uses Allianz SE, in particular, as a vehicle for actively managing its overall exposure to catastrophes. Under a group-wide risk management framework, each operating entity is responsible for managing  its  exposure  to  individual  catastrophes  and  defining  its local reinsurance requirements based on its local risk appetite and capital position. The respective cover is then provided by Allianz SE or one of its subsidiaries. At the Group level, the Allianz SE's Board of Management reviews and approves the risk appetite. The reinsurance division is then responsible for designing and implementing Group catastrophe protection within given exposure limits. These covers take various forms and aim to protect the Group against excessive losses from  major  natural  or  man-made  catastrophes.  However,  despite measures to limit or mitigate our risks, there is still a potential for an unexpected frequency and/or severity of catastrophic events that may materially impact the results of Allianz SE. The top five residual risk exposures  at  the  Group  level  are  summarized  in  the  paragraph 'Premium risk' in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nCompared to the plan for 2023 which was compiled in 2022, net premiums earned were 8 % higher than expected, mainly due to higher than planned net quota share cessions from European Allianz entities. The  net  underwriting  result  was  negatively  impacted  by  natural",

        "page_content": "catastrophe as well as man-made large losses, which were above the historical average. Overall, the combined ratio was higher than plan due to higher accident year losses despite positive prior year reserve releases.\n\nFollowing many years of low profitability in the industry, rates started hardening in 2020 and are expected to further increase in 2024 supported by a high demand for reinsurance protection, general market conditions and rising reinvestments yields. Headwinds from high inflation are expected to slightly ease in 2024. The geopolitical environment and its impact on the overall economic development remain challenging.\n\nAgainst this background, Allianz SE's technical result is planned to increase  in  2024  due  to  rate  increases  and  higher  cessions  from European  Allianz  entities  in  particular  through  net  quota  share programs. Profitability is expected to further improve due to higher attachment points in the assumed business and the cancellation of some reinsurance structures not meeting our profitability expectations. Outgoing reinsurance protection remains broadly stable versus 2023. The actual technical result, however, may vary significantly from our expectations as the reinsurance business is by nature volatile in terms of frequency and severity of losses.\n\nCompared to our outlook, the lower net technical result was more than offset by a positive development in our investment result as well as other non-technical result for 2023. As a result, net income as well as net earnings were above our expectations. For 2024, we plan both net income as well as net earnings to moderately decrease. Based on our  current  expectations,  a  significantly  higher  underwriting  result, partially offset by the development of the equalization reserve, and a largely stable other non-technical result will be more than offset by a moderately lower investment result. We are not planning a specific foreign currency result, nor are we able to anticipate any net gains or losses from derivatives. These could, however, considerably impact the net income of Allianz SE. Given the susceptibility of our non-technical result to adverse capital market developments, we do not provide a precise outlook for the development of our net income. Nevertheless, we are ultimately planning and managing the Allianz SE net earnings in line with the Allianz Group  dividend policy. To this end, we take advantage of the opportunity to make use of the dividends of our subsidiaries,  in  particular  those  of  Allianz  Europe  B.V.,  in  order  to generate net earnings for Allianz SE that match the dividend policy of the  Allianz Group.  For  more  detailed  information  on  our  dividend policy, see the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2023  and the Allianz company website .\n\n## Management's overall assessment of the current economic situation of Allianz SE\n\nAt the date of issuance of this Annual Report, and based on current information  regarding  natural  catastrophes  and  capital  market trends - in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities - the Board of Management has no indication that Allianz SE is facing any major adverse developments.\n\n## Cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements, such as prospects or expectations, that are based on management's current views and assumptions  and  subject  to  known  and  unknown  risks  and uncertainties. Actual results, performance figures, or events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements.\n\nDeviations may arise due to changes in factors including, but not limited to, the following: (i) the general economic and competitive situation  in  Allianz's  core  business  and  core  markets,  (ii)  the performance  of  financial  markets  (in  particular  market  volatility, liquidity, and credit events), (iii) adverse publicity, regulatory actions or litigation  with  respect  to  the  Allianz  Group,  other  well-known companies,  and  the  financial  services  industry  generally,  (iv)  the frequency and severity of insured loss events, including those resulting from natural catastrophes, and the development of loss expenses, (v) mortality and morbidity levels and trends, (vi) persistency levels, (vii) the  extent  of  credit  defaults,  (viii)  interest  rate  levels,  (ix)  currency exchange  rates,  most  notably  the  EUR/USD  exchange  rate,  (x) changes in laws and regulations, including tax regulations, (xi) the impact of acquisitions, including and related to integration issues and reorganization measures, and (xii) the general competitive conditions that,  in  each  individual  case,  apply  at  a  local,  regional,  national, and/or global level. Many of these changes can be exacerbated by terrorist activities.\n\n## No duty to update\n\nAllianz assumes no obligation to update any information or forwardlooking statement contained herein, save for any information we are required to disclose by law.",

The  increase  was  mainly  driven  by internal reinsurance business. The combined ratio increased to 104.5 % (2022: 101.5 %), mainly due to a worsening of the accident year claims ratio to 80.9 % (2022:  78.7 %). The expense ratio remained almost stable  at  24.7 %  (2022:  24.6 %).  The  equalization reserve was fully released in the previous year (2022: release of \u20ac 885 mn). This led to a net technical result of \u20ac (264) mn (2022: \u20ac 811 mn).\n\nThe household and homeowner reinsurance portfolio increased by 14.7 % to gross premiums written of \u20ac 1,405 mn (2022: \u20ac 1,225 mn), mainly from business with Allianz Versicherungs-AG. The combined\n\nratio grew to 103.3 % (2022: 101.8 %), driven by an increase in the calendar year claims ratio to 73.0 % (2022: 71.6 %). The net technical result decreased to \u20ac (43) mn (2022: \u20ac (18) mn).\n\nThe growth of the fire reinsurance portfolio was mainly caused by growth of internal business volume. The combined ratio deteriorated to 105.2 % (2022: 82.9 %), driven by an increase of the calendar year claims ratio to 77.2 % (2022: 55.9 %). After a release of the equalization reserve  of  \u20ac 18 mn  (2022:  strengthening  by  \u20ac (92) mn),  the  net technical result amounted to \u20ac (25) mn (2022: \u20ac 35 mn).\n\nEngineering reinsurance gross premiums increased by 13.8 %. The combined  ratio  worsened  and  amounted  to  89.1 %  (2022:  77.3 %),\n\ndriven by a deterioration of the run-off result by \u20ac 56 mn.  The net technical result declined to \u20ac 47 mn (2022: \u20ac 100 mn).\n\nThe premiums written in the business interruption reinsurance decreased  by  16.9 %  to  \u20ac 237 mn  (2022:  \u20ac 285 mn),  mainly  due  to external  business  volume.  The  combined  ratio  increased  to  68.3 % (2022: 58.6 %) which was primarily driven by a higher accident year claims ratio of 70.0 % (2022: 58.3 %). As a result, the net technical result went down to \u20ac 61 mn (2022: \u20ac 109 mn).\n\nOther property reinsurance includes extended coverage for fire and  business  interruption  as  well  as  hail,  storm,  water  damage, livestock,  burglary,  and  glass  reinsurance.

Despite a decline of the run-off result by \u20ac 189 mn (2022: positive run-off result of \u20ac 80 mn), the combined ratio improved to 117.7 % (2022: 124.0 %). This was owed to a decrease of the accident year claims ratio to 84.5 % (2022: 108.9 %) and a decrease of the expense ratio to 22.0 % (2022: 27.1 %).  The  net  technical  result  amounted  to  \u20ac (175) mn  (2022: \u20ac (158) mn).\n\nPremiums written for liability reinsurance increased by 6.9 % to \u20ac 1,216 mn (2022: \u20ac 1,138 mn), mainly driven by external cessions. The combined  ratio  rose  to  94.7 %  (2022:  74.9 %),  mainly  due  to  an increased calendar year claims ratio of 59.9 % (2022: 44.3 %). After a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (52) mn (2022: \u20ac (4) mn),  the  net  technical  result  amounted  to  \u20ac 10 mn  (2022: \u20ac 255 mn).\n\nIn life reinsurance , the premium revenue increased to \u20ac 671 mn (2022: \u20ac 584 mn); this was mainly driven by external business. The net technical result decreased to \u20ac 26 mn (2022: \u20ac 42 mn).\n\nThe premium revenue of personal accident reinsurance increased by  1.7 %.  This  development  results  in  particular  from  internal reinsurance business. The combined ratio improved to 79.0 % (2022: 85.8 %), mainly driven by a better run-off result. The net technical result thus increased to \u20ac 98 mn (2022: \u20ac 58 mn).\n\nThe gross premiums written in marine and aviation reinsurance increased  to  \u20ac 354 mn  (2022:  \u20ac 331 mn).  The  combined  ratio  rose, mainly due to a higher expense ratio of 37.9 % (2022: 26.8 %).). Despite a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (17) mn (2022: \u20ac (39) mn), the net technical result remained positive at \u20ac 15 mn (2022: \u20ac 39 mn).\n\nGross premiums written in credit and bond reinsurance increased by 6.2 % to \u20ac 332 mn (2022: \u20ac 313 mn), which was mainly caused by growing premium income from Allianz Trade. Due to a worsening of the calendar year claims ratio to 45.1 % (2022: 30.4 %) and a worsening of  the  expense  ratio  to  53.2 %  (2022:  40.5 %),  the  combined  ratio increased to 98.3 % (2022: 71.0 %). The net technical result amounted to \u20ac 60 mn (2022: \u20ac (1) mn), following a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (47) mn (2022: \u20ac (80) mn).\n\nThe premium revenue of legal expenses reinsurance increased by 4.4 % to \u20ac 308 mn (2022: \u20ac 295 mn). The combined ratio improved to 90.5 % (2022: 94.2 %) due to a better run-off result. A strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (34) mn occurred in the financial year (2022: \u20ac (22) mn), leading to the net technical result remaining stable at \u20ac (5) mn (2022: \u20ac (5) mn) compared to the previous year.\n\nIn health reinsurance, the premium revenue increased by 8.6 % to \u20ac 279 mn (2022: \u20ac 257 mn), mainly driven by external business. The net technical result increased to \u20ac 11 mn (2022: \u20ac 1 mn).\n\nOther reinsurance lines include:\n\n- -emergency assistance,\n- -fidelity & political risk,\n- -motor extended warranty,\n- -other property and casualty business.\n\nOther reinsurance recorded an increase in premium volume of 5.1 % to \u20ac 1,104 mn  (2022:  \u20ac 1,050 mn). Following a decrease in  the run-off result, mainly in other property and casualty business reinsurance, the combined  ratio  increased  from  91.6 %  to  106.6 %.  In  total,  the underwriting result of \u20ac (129) mn (2022: \u20ac (82) mn) remained below the previous year's level.",

As  of 31 December 2023, government bonds from France (\u20ac 2.5 bn), Japan (\u20ac 2.0 bn), Germany (\u20ac 1.2 bn), and Spain (\u20ac 0.7 bn) represented the largest exposures in our government bonds portfolio.\n\nFunds  held  by  others  under  reinsurance  business  assumed increased  to  \u20ac 15.0 bn  (2022:  \u20ac 13.9 bn).  This  increase  was  mainly driven  by  internal  reinsurance  business  volumes  as  well  as  a  new internal reinsurance contract.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the fair value of investments amounted to \u20ac 125.8 bn (2022: \u20ac 124.2 bn), compared to a carrying amount of \u20ac 120.6 bn (2022: \u20ac 118.3 bn). The decrease of valuation reserves to \u20ac 5.2 bn (2022: \u20ac 5.9 bn) is primarily driven by lower net asset values of our shares in affiliated enterprises.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables increased from \u20ac 5.7 bn to \u20ac 7.3 bn, driven by a growth of \u20ac 1.0 bn in other receivables and a growth of \u20ac 0.5 bn in receivables from  reinsurance business. The increase in other receivables results from  higher  profit  transfer  agreements  (\u20ac 0.5 bn),  higher  tax receivables (\u20ac 0.4 bn) and higher receivables of cash pool (\u20ac 0.3 bn).\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nAs  of  31 December 2023,  our shareholders'  equity amounted  to \u20ac 41.4 bn (2022: \u20ac 40.1 bn).  A buy-back of own shares at acquisition costs of \u20ac 2.2 bn led to a decrease. 1 This decrease was more than offset by a rise of \u20ac 3.5 bn, due to net income being higher than the dividend paid. The net income increased by \u20ac 3.3 bn to \u20ac 8.1 bn (2022: \u20ac 4.8 bn). \u20ac 2.5 bn (2022: \u20ac 0.5 bn) was transferred from the net income to the revenue reserves.\n\nThe Board of Management proposes to use the net earnings of \u20ac 5,939 mn for dividend payments in the amount of \u20ac 5,402 mn. 2 The unappropriated earnings of \u20ac 537 mn will be carried forward.\n\nOur disclosures concerning treasury shares as required in our financial statements in accordance with \u00a7 160 (1) No. 2 AktG can be found in note 11.",

The other provisions declined by \u20ac 726 mn. This drop resulted mainly from the reduction of the provisions for anticipated losses, which fell by \u20ac 502 mn and was exclusively  driven  by  derivative  transactions.  The  tax  provisions decreased  by  \u20ac 126 mn  and  the  pension  liabilities  went  down  by \u20ac 70 mn in total.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE had the following outstanding financial liabilities :\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Third-party subordinated liabilities    | 17,636 | 17,054 |\n| Subordinated liabilities                | 17,636 | 17,054 |\n| Bonds issued to Group companies         | 3,170  | 2,724  |\n| Other intra-group financial liabilities | 27,756 | 29,291 |\n| Other third-party financial liabilities | 2,099  | 1,851  |\n| Other financial liabilities             | 33,026 | 33,867 |\n| Total financial liabilities             | 50,662 | 50,920 |\n\nOf these financial liabilities, \u20ac 30.9 bn (2022: \u20ac 32.0 bn) were intragroup liabilities.\n\nSubordinated liabilities increased to \u20ac 17.6 bn (2022: \u20ac 17.1 bn), primarily driven by the issuance of new subordinated bonds with a total volume of \u20ac 2.15 bn, which was partially offset by the redemption of a bond with a volume of \u20ac 1.5 bn.\n\nBonds issued to Group companies increased to \u20ac 3.2 bn (2022: \u20ac 2.7 bn) due to new bonds issued with a total volume of \u20ac 0.5 bn.\n\nOther  intra-group  financial  liabilities decreased  to  \u20ac 27.8 bn (2022: \u20ac 29.3 bn) and were composed of the following positions:\n\n## Other intra-group financial liabilities\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Intra-group loans                       | 15,569 | 16,788 |\n| Cash pool liabilities                   | 11,142 | 11,704 |\n| Miscellaneous                           | 1,045  | 799    |\n| Other intra-group financial liabilities | 27,756 | 29,291 |\n\nWhile  liabilities  from  intra-group  loans  declined  from  \u20ac 16.8 bn  to \u20ac 15.6 bn and liabilities from intra-group cash pooling went down from \u20ac 11.7 bn  to  \u20ac 11.1 bn,  miscellaneous  intra-group  liabilities  slightly increased from \u20ac 0.8 bn to \u20ac 1.0 bn.\n\nIn  2023, other  third-party  financial  liabilities amounted  to \u20ac 2.1 bn (2022: \u20ac 1.9 bn). This increase was mainly driven by higher short-term liabilities from unsettled security transactions, which grew by \u20ac 0.4 bn to \u20ac 0.9 bn. Lower margin payments in connection with financial  derivative  transactions,  which  went  down  by  \u20ac 0.2 bn  to \u20ac 0.1 bn, partially offset the increase.",

The main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE are  dividends  received  from  subsidiaries  as  well  as  reinsurance premiums  received,  and  external  funding  raised  in  the  capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily available assets specifically  cash,  money  market  securities,  and  highly  liquid  fixedincome  securities.  Funds  are  primarily  used  for  paying  interest expenses on our debt funding, claims arising from the reinsurance business, operating costs, internal and external growth investments, and dividends or share buybacks to our shareholders.\n\n## Funding sources\n\nAllianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors, such as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings, and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE are both equity and debt funding. Equity can be raised by issuing ordinary no-par value shares. The issuance of debt in various maturities as well as group-wide liquidity management are the main sources of our debt funding.\n\nAs  of  31 December 2023,  the  share  capital  registered  at  the Commercial  Register  was  \u20ac 1,169,920,000.  This  was  divided  into 391,718,983 no-par value shares. As of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE held 260,394 (2022: 1,724,834) own shares.\n\nAllianz SE has the option to increase its share capital base according to authorizations provided by the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The following table outlines Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2023:\n\n## Capital authorizations of Allianz SE\n\n| Capital authorization         | Nominal amount   | Expiry date of   the authorization   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Authorized Capital  2022/I 1  | \u20ac 467,968,000    | 3 May 2027                           |\n| Authorized Capital  2022/II 2 | \u20ac 15,000,000     | 3 May 2027                           |\n| Conditional Capital  2022 3   | \u20ac 116,992,000    | 3 May 2027                           |\n\n- 1\\_For issuance of shares against contribution in cash and/or in kind.\n- 2\\_For issuance of shares to employees (without shareholders' subscription rights).\n- 3\\_To cover conversion or option rights of holders of bonds.\n\nThe cost and availability of debt funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or to Allianz SE. Our main sources of debt funding are senior  and  subordinated  bonds.  Among  others,  money  market securities,  letter-of-credit  facilities,  and  bank  credit  lines  allow Allianz SE to fine-tune its capital structure.\n\nIn the first half-year of 2023, we issued a \u20ac 1.25 bn subordinated bond. In the second half-year of 2023, we issued another USD 1.0 bn subordinated bond and called a \u20ac 1.5 bn subordinated bond. Overall, subordinated  liabilities  increased  to  \u20ac 17.6 bn  (2022:  \u20ac 17.1 bn)  at year-end.\n\nOther financial liabilities decreased compared to the previous year to \u20ac 33.0 bn (2022: \u20ac 33.9 bn), mainly due to lower liabilities from intra-group cash pooling.",

While capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies' capital requirements and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business objectives.\n\nWe closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of the Group, Allianz SE and its other related undertakings, and apply regular  stress  tests  (including  standardized,  historical,  and  reverse stress test scenarios as well as stress and scenario analyses focusing on current and possible future developments). These analyses allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency  strength.  For  example,  the  risk  capital  reflecting  the  risk profile and the cost of capital is an important aspect that is considered in business decisions. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the risk and business strategy by the fact that business decisions to achieve our set targets are taken within the determined risk appetite and in line with the risk strategy. The implemented sound processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continuous alignment of the risk and business strategy, and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity risk management framework ensures that all legal entities in scope are responsible for managing their liquidity risks and maintaining a sufficient liquidity position under both market and business conditions (expected as well as stressed).\n\n## Risk management system and internal control system\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, Allianz SE considers risk management, including an internal control system (ICS), to be a core competency and an integral part of our\n\nbusiness. Our risk management framework covers all operations and business units of Allianz SE in proportion to the inherent risks of the activities, ensuring  that  risks  across  Allianz SE  are  consistently identified,  analyzed,  assessed,  and  adequately  managed.  The  key elements of our risk management framework and internal control system are:\n\n- -Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a robust risk governance structure.\n- -Consistent  and  proportional  application  of  an  integrated  risk capital  framework  to  protect  our  capital  base  and  support effective capital management.\n- -Integration of risk considerations  and  capital  needs  into management and decision-making processes by attributing risk and  allocating  capital  to  business  segments,  products,  and strategies.\n\nOur risk management system is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- -Risk identification, assessment and underwriting: A robust system of  risk  identification,  assessment  and  underwriting  forms  the foundation for appropriate risk management decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwriting, valuation methods,  individual  transaction  and  new  product  approvals, emerging/operational/top  risk  assessments,  liquidity  risk  and scenario analyses, amongst others.\n- -Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk appetite in line with our business strategy. It ensures that rewards are appropriate based on the risks taken and the required capital. It also ensures that delegated decision-making bodies work in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.\n- -Risk  reporting  and  monitoring: Our  comprehensive  qualitative and  quantitative  risk  monitoring  and  reporting  framework provides management with the transparency needed to assess whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits and to identify  emerging  issues  and  risks  quickly.  For  example,  risk dashboard  and  limit  utilization  reports  as  well  as  scenario analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.\n- -Communication  and  transparency: Transparent  risk  disclosure provides the basis for communicating  our  strategy  and performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens the risk awareness and risk culture.\n\nIn order  to  support  these  pillars,  especially  risk  identification, assessment and monitoring, the Allianz Group has established an ICS, which  consists  of  both  specific  risk  controls  and  further  control elements, and which is also applied at Allianz SE level. Its objectives are:\n\n- -Safeguarding the Group's, respectively Allianz SE's, existence and business continuity.\n- -Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n- -Creating a strong internal control environment, ensuring that all personnel are aware of the importance of internal control and their role within the internal control system.\n- -Providing the management bodies with the relevant information for their decision-making processes.\n\nNotwithstanding the oversight exercised by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, controls are performed within the Allianz Group in terms of control areas, activities and reporting, taking into account independence  requirements,  where  applicable.  The  controls  are embedded into the operational and organizational set-up throughout the  Allianz Group  and  are  subject  to  periodic  reviews.  Where appropriate, internationally recognized control frameworks are used, such as the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission  (COSO)  or  the  IT-related  Control  Objectives  for Information and Related Technology (COBIT).\n\nInternal controls, therefore, describe  the  set  of  activities undertaken by and within the Allianz Group, respectively Allianz SE, to achieve  defined  control  objectives,  applied  across  all  business segments and lines of business. These controls help to continuously review  the  effectiveness  of  the  relevant  processes  and  procedures (including operations and reporting), their coherence and proportionality within the Group, and to identify potential actions for",

        "page_content": "the timely rectification of deficiencies. The ICS of the Allianz Group encompasses the entirety of activities undertaken to perform controls in different areas.\n\nThe  ICS  comprises  various  control  concepts.  Besides  general elements related to any control activities and in addition to the Risk Management Framework, specific controls are utilized, in particular, but not exclusively, around entity level controls, financial reporting, IT, risk capital calculation, underwriting  (including  products  and distribution),  investments,  data  privacy,  customer  protection,  and protection/resilience.  These  are  supplemented  by  management reports.\n\nThe  following  information  is  provided  pursuant  to  \u00a7 289 (4)  and \u00a7 315 (4)  of  the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch HGB'). For general information on our integrated risk and control system (IRCS) and Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), please refer to the 'Operational risk' section in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\n## Accounting processes\n\nThe accounting processes we use to produce financial statements are based on a group-wide IT solution and local general ledger. Access rights  to  accounting  systems  are  managed  according  to  strict authorization and hierarchy-linked procedures.\n\n## Control system for financial and non-financial reporting\n\nSpecific internal controls for financial reporting, which follow the NonFinancial  Risk  Management  (NFRM)  framework  -  embedding  the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) approach - are integrated in  the  accounting  and  consolidation  processes  to  safeguard  the accuracy,  completeness,  and  consistency  of  the  information provided in our financial statements.\n\nThe dedicated financial reporting control system approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n- -A centrally  developed  risk  catalog is  linked  to  balance  sheet positions. This risk catalog is the starting point for the definition of the Group's as well as Allianz SE's scope of financial reporting risks.\n\n- -Based on the centrally provided risk catalog, we identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.\n- -Preventive  and  detective  key  controls to  address  financial reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and impact  of  financial  misstatements.  When  a  potential  risk  is detected, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstatement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting processes on IT systems, we have also implemented IT controls. Controls  to  address  non-financial  reporting  risks  have  been introduced and will be expanded going forward.\n- -Internal Audit ensures that these controls are subject to regular control  testing,  in  order  to  assure  reasonable  design  and operating  effectiveness.  Internal  Audit  does  so  through  a comprehensive risk-based approach that assesses the key controls of the company's internal procedures and processes, including local and group-internal controls over financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective.\n\nThe risk management system encompasses both a set of principles for specifically addressing  the  operational  and  reputational  risks stemming  from  non-compliance  with  laws,  regulations,  and  other external  requirements  that  represent  a  significant  compliance  risk (hereafter referred to as 'compliance risks'), as well as their reflection in internal corporate rules.\n\nFor the management of compliance risks, Allianz  maintains a Compliance Management System (CMS). At the center of the CMS, Allianz  has  established  compliance  functions  at  the  levels  of  the Allianz Group and the local operating entities as part of the Second Line of Defense. For details of the CMS, or more specifically of anticorruption  and  bribery  matters,  please  refer  to  the  Non-Financial Statement.\n\nThe  management  feels  comfortable  with  Allianz SE's  overall  risk profile.  It  has no indication that, as of 31 December 2023, our risk management system or internal control system is inappropriate or ineffective, and therefore is confident to meet both the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and day-to-day business needs.\n\nThis assessment is based on several factors:\n\n- -We run an established system to monitor the effectiveness of the internal  control  system  and  to  report  and  promptly  address deficiencies,  such  as  control  failures,  operational  loss  events, financial limit breaches, or system of governance issues. On a quarterly  basis,  the  Group's  'Internal  Control  System  Report', which also covers Allianz SE, is jointly prepared by the Allianz SE key control functions, and shared with the Supervisory Board Audit Committee and the members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE. The report aggregates and rates the severity of known weaknesses in the internal control system, while also tracking their timely and satisfactory resolution.\n- -Our risk management framework, including the internal control system, are regularly subject to audit activities performed by our internal audit function.\n- -In  addition,  external  auditors  are  independently  and  regularly reviewing  Allianz SE's  risk  governance  as  well  as  performing quality reviews of risk processes, including the ICS, and risk early warning systems.\n- -An  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  Allianz SE  Risk Management function, as well as of the implementation maturity of  the  risk  management  framework  and  corresponding  risk management  processes,  is  performed  following  the  Risk Assessment, Diagnostics, Analysis and Reporting (RADAR) process.\n- -Allianz has dedicated guidelines and policies that clearly define the general principles, the roles and responsibilities, as well as the processes,  for  both  the  risk  management  framework  and  the internal control system.\n\nAllianz  will  be  required  to  comply  with  Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) regulations by the end of the financial year 2024. As new CSRD reporting requirements are being established, our internal control system is undergoing continuous enhancements. A dedicated  project  helps  to  ensure  diligent  preparation  for  CSRD implementation, including the early identification of where improvements are necessary.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nAllianz SE's business strategy is aligned with the business aspirations and strategy of the Allianz Group. Allianz SE's main activities are the steering of legal entities  owned, as well as the provision of central",

        "page_content": "finance functions. This includes the provision of central services to legal entities  through  various  functions.  As  a  reinsurer,  Allianz  offers reinsurance services to mostly internal but also external counterparties.\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following objectives for the Allianz Group's medium-term strategy, building on the success of the efforts to simplify the company, with the motto 'Simplicity at Scale':\n\n- -Growth: We consistently seek to capture growth opportunities for our  business,  and  to  create  growth  opportunities  for  our employees. This is how we ensure our leading market position. Due to our full breadth  of  products  and  services,  we  offer comprehensive  solutions  that  meet  our  customers'  needs  and make us a trusted partner.\n- -Margin Expansion: We need to be profitable and efficient. To do so we are continuously improving our productivity, including in our distribution  channels,  while  seeking  to  grow  in  high  margin business segments. Additionally, we will continue our transformation  so  that  our  processes  are  simpler,  digital  and scalable.\n- -Capital Efficiency: We consistently seek ways to use our capital in the most effective way and take action when, among others, it falls below our RoE threshold.\n\nThese objectives have been translated into clear ambitions for the 2022 to 2024 period. With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds 1 ) of more than 13 %, while aiming to grow our earnings per share from \u20ac 21 (baseline  full  year  2021,  as  communicated  in  the  Allianz  Capital Markets  Day  2021)  to  approximately  \u20ac 25 2 by  2024  (reflecting  a compound annual growth rate of 5 % to 7 %).\n\nTo  ensure  the  sustainability  of  our  performance,  we  have  set ourselves non-financial targets that reflect strong underlying organizational health: For customer loyalty, our ambition is for more than 50 % of the business segments of our entities to be or become rated by their customers as a 'loyalty leader' in terms of the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS) by 2024. In terms of employee engagement, our ambition is to score above 75 % on the Inclusive Meritocracy Index.\n\nAt the same time, we have also set the target to become a clear leader in sustainability and diversity.\n\nThe  Allianz Group,  and  therefore  Allianz SE,  faces  an  altered environment on insurance markets. Reinsurance rates, in particular in the  area  of  retrocession,  are  generally  rising,  as  the  market  is characterized by an overall hardening due to large losses. Coverages for large accumulation scenarios for natural catastrophes and manmade exposures are experiencing an increased demand in a volatile market environment, e.g., business areas such as cyber coverage.\n\nTo  implement  these  strategic  objectives,  to  realize  our  growth ambition, and to accelerate our value creation, we have defined five additional strategic areas of focus for the Allianz Group:\n\n- -Transforming the Life/Health and Asset Management franchise:\n- Fully  address  protection  and  savings  needs  and  accelerate transformation  to  a  capital  efficient  model,  leveraging  our strengths  in  Asset  Management  to  deliver  investor-defined risk/return requirements, through various investment disciplines.\n- -Expanding our Property & Casualty leadership position: Beat the best players in each market, building on productivity gains and scale, in retail motor and beyond.\n- -Boosting growth through scalable platforms: Scale our customerfacing platforms and build new operating platforms to grow our business volume and margin.\n- -Deepening  the  global  vertical  integration  and  execution  of agility: Verticalize operating models across lines of business to unleash value from our skills and scale.\n- -Reinforcing capital productivity and resilience: Retain industryleading  financial  strength  and  unlock  further  value  creation potential through an improved risk/return profile and an active management and reduction of tail-risk exposure. Our focus on capital resilience is matched with a focus on talent development and diversity that also strengthens our organizational resilience.\n\nAllianz SE's Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on ensuring the integrity of the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.\n\nOur financial strength renders us resilient against market stress, while our ongoing transformation creates capabilities allowing us to profit from new opportunities in a fast-changing business environment.\n\nAllianz SE's role - as laid out in the Allianz SE business strategy includes  in  particular  providing  central  financing  functions  to Allianz Group companies, and acting as a reinsurer with predominantly group-internal business, but also pursuing opportunities  with  external  clients.  Opportunities  management  is principally a responsibility for the Allianz Group's primary insurance and asset management entities.\n\nAllianz SE's  activities  in  support  of  the  Allianz Group's  opportunity management mainly fall in the following areas:\n\n- -Supporting  the  local  Group  companies'  efforts  to  continuously harmonize and simplify products and processes across all business segments  via  development  of  centralized  expertise  in  data analytics, product design, and distribution platforms.\n- -Supporting the Allianz Group's growth strategy via provision of financing for acquisition of M&A targets.\n- -Reinsurance pooling from Group companies and optimization via retrocessions, as well as reinsurance solutions to optimize their capital needs.\n- -Provision of reinsurance solutions to business partners outside the Allianz Group to support growth.\n\nThe pooling of internal reinsurance on the balance sheet of Allianz SE is an important strategy which has been pursued for many years. As a Group reinsurer, the reinsurance division not only provides guidance and tools to Group companies to manage exposures as effectively as possible, but also provides most of the reinsurance covers to Group companies. The large and diversified portfolio at Allianz SE allows for acceptances  of  a  wide  range  of  reinsurance  solutions  on  a proportional and non-proportional basis. Larger risk concentrations are actively managed via retrocessions on a per risk and per event basis in order to protect our capital. In addition, the reinsurance area within  Allianz SE provides reinsurance solutions to external business partners.",

        "page_content": "In 2023, Allianz SE also supported Group efforts for simplification and digitalization, among others, by further developing centralized expertise in product development and digital distribution platforms.\n\n## Risk governance structure\n\nOur approach to risk governance permits the integrated management of local and global risks, and ensures that our risk profile remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.\n\nWithin our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management of Allianz SE have both Allianz SE and groupwide responsibilities.\n\nThe Board of Management formulates business objectives and sets a corresponding business strategy, risk strategy, and investment strategy. It also defines risk limits and allocates risk capital to the business activities within the  Allianz Group  and specifically also for Allianz SE. The core elements of the risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Management. The Board of Management reports to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the execution of its management activities. The  following  committees  support  the  Board  and  the  Supervisory Board on risk issues:\n\n## Supervisory Board Risk Committee\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  Risk  Committee  reports  to  the  Supervisory Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management. It monitors the effectiveness of the Allianz risk management  framework.  Furthermore,  it  focuses  on  risk-related developments as well as general risks and specific risk exposures, and ensures that the risk strategy is aligned with the business strategy.\n\nFor  more  information  please  refer  to  the  paragraph  'Risk Committee' in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\n## Group Finance and Risk Committee\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  Group's  Committee  Framework,  the  Group Finance  and  Risk  Committee  (GFRC)  reports  to  the  Board  of Management and provides oversight of the Group's and Allianz SE's risk  management  framework,  acting  as  a  primary  early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC also ensures that an\n\nadequate  relationship  between  return  and  risk  is  maintained. Additionally,  the  GFRC  defines  risk  standards,  is  the  limit-setting authority within the framework set by the Board of Management, and approves  major  financing  and  capital  management  transactions. Finally, the  GFRC  supports  the  Board  of  Management  with recommendations regarding the capital structure, capital allocation, liquidity position, and investment strategy, including strategic asset allocation for the different business segments.\n\nThe Allianz Re Risk Committee supports the GFRC on issues relating to Allianz SE's reinsurance business.\n\nVia the Policy Framework, a comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy  and  appetite,  limit  systems,  documentation,  and reporting. These standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of riskrelated  information  (e.g.,  to  the  Board  of  Management  via  the Management  Reporting)  and  a  disciplined  approach  towards decision-making and execution at both the global level (Board of Management of Allianz SE) and local levels (i.e., the Operating and Legal Entities).\n\nIn the Three Lines of Defense model, as a general principle, the responsibility for the First Line of Defense rests with business managers in the related undertaking. They are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their decisions. The Second Line of Defense is made up of independent global oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial,  Compliance,  and  Legal,  which  support  the  Board  of Management in defining the risk frameworks within which the business can  operate.  Group  Audit  forms  the  Third  Line  of  Defense, independently and regularly reviewing risk governance implementation, compliance with risk principles, performing quality reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards, including the internal control framework.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of our Internal Control System, all functions  are  obliged  to  cooperate  and  exchange  necessary information and advice. Given that control activities may be exercised by staff in different organizational units, appropriate mechanisms are in place between the control functions to allow fully informed and educated decision-making.\n\nAllianz SE  has  established  dedicated  responsibilities  for  the three lines of defense with its departments (including reinsurance).\n\n## Risk management function\n\nIndependent risk oversight for Allianz SE is performed by risk control units  within  Group  Risk  and  within  the  reinsurance  department  of Allianz SE.\n\nGroup Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer who also serves as the Chief Risk Officer of Allianz SE. Group Risk supports Allianz SE's  Board  of  Management,  including  its  committees,  by performing various analyses, communicating information related to risk  management,  and  preparing  and  implementing  committee decisions.\n\nGroup  Risk  also  supports  the  Board  of  Management  in developing  the  risk  management  framework  -  which  covers  risk governance,  risk  strategy  and  appetite  -  and  risk  monitoring  and reporting.  Group  Risk's  operational  responsibility  encompasses assessing risks across all risk categories and monitoring limits and accumulations of specific risks across business lines, including natural and  human-caused  (regulatory  terminology:  man-made)  disasters and exposures to financial markets and counterparties.\n\n## Other functions and bodies\n\nIn addition to Group Risk and the local Risk Management functions, legal, compliance, and actuarial functions established at both the Group and the entity levels constitute additional components of the Second Line of Defense.\n\nGroup Legal and Group Compliance seek to mitigate legal risks for  the  Allianz Group  and  Allianz SE  with  support  from  other departments. The objectives of both functions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and  litigation,  and  to  provide  legally  appropriate  solutions  for transactions and business processes. In addition, Group Compliance in  conjunction  with  Group  Legal  and  other  experts  involved  -  is responsible  for  integrity  management,  which  aims  to  protect  the Allianz Group as well as Allianz SE and our other related undertakings and employees from regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nGroup  Compliance  has  defined  preventive,  detective,  and responsive controls for the assigned compliance risk areas, which are based on requirements specified in the compliance standards and Code  of  Conduct.  A  compliance  control  catalog,  including  the development of control objectives arising from the various corporate compliance guidelines, as well as a cataloguing of normative risk scenarios and defined key control activities, are available.",

        "page_content": "Group Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing risks  of  the  Allianz Group  and  Allianz SE  in  line  with  regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks includes, amongst others, the calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance  in  business  planning,  reporting  and  monitoring  of  the results,  and  supporting  the  effective  implementation  of  the  risk management  system.  The  latter  includes  joining  Group  Risk  in  a discipline to regularly monitor internal risk capital models, assumptions,  and  parameters  -  as  well  as  their  changes.  It  also includes providing support regarding capital efficiency management, contributing to the modeling of insurance risk capital, and supporting the  identification  of  underwriting  risks  via  independent  reserve reviews.\n\nFor the modeling of Allianz SE's risk capital, various risk modules are used from Group central model components as well as Allianz SE specific  adaptations,  e.g.,  for  the  reinsurance  business.  Model ownership    is  dedicated  to  the  Allianz SE  departments  with  the respective expertise, such as actuarial or the department for NatCat modeling. Furthermore, a comprehensive risk modeling oversight is performed by the risk controlling departments of Allianz SE to ensure full compliance  with  the  Allianz  Standard  for  Internal  Model Governance,  summarized  in  the  annual  validation  report  for Allianz SE.\n\n## Risk-based steering and risk management\n\nWe  are  exposed  to  a  variety  of  risks,  including  market,  credit, underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\nWe consider diversification across different business segments, lines of business and regions to be an important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event and contributes to relatively stable results. Our aim is to maintain a balanced  risk  profile  without  any  disproportionately  large  risk concentrations and accumulations.\n\nWith  Solvency II  being  the  regulatory  regime  relevant  for  the Allianz Group and Allianz SE, our risk profile is measured and steered based  on  our  approved  Solvency II  internal  model 1 . We  have introduced  a  target  solvency  ratio  range  in  accordance  with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and  related  undertakings,  supplemented  by  ad-hoc  scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses.\n\nIn addition, central elements of Allianz's dividend policy are linked to Solvency II capitalization based on the internal model. This helps us to ensure a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line with the Solvency II framework.\n\nAllianz steers its business portfolio taking a comprehensive view of  risk  and  return,  which  is  based  on  the  internal  model  and  is supported by scenario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted  by  limits  based  on  our  internal  model.  The  Life/Health business segment is steered - in addition to the Return on Equity - by a return on risk capital 2 (RoRC) approach for new business at the product  level,  while  for  the  Property-Casualty  business  segment  a return on equity (RoE insurance) at the portfolio level is used.\n\nRoRC and RoE insurance are indicators that allow us to identify profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable basis. For new  Life/Health  insurance  business,  RoRC  reflects  the  expected average return against the capital commitment over the lifetime of the products and is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions. For Property-Casualty insurance business, the RoE insurance reflects the return against the underlying equity which is allocated to the specific portfolios  based  on  the  respective  risk  capital  requirements.  This allows us to take appropriate risk-based decisions.\n\nAs a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in the steering of the insurance business, and its application satisfies the socalled 'use test' requirement under Solvency II.\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, Allianz SE  holds  and  uses  a  broad  range  of  financial  instruments, which are reflected on our balance sheet as both assets and liabilities.\n\nFor  our  holding  activities  (i.e.,  to  hold  participations,  provide financing for Group companies, cover internal pension liabilities, invest cash pooled from subsidiaries, and as the lender of last resort within\n\nthe Allianz Group), Allianz SE predominantly invests in participations and fixed-income assets.\n\nAs  an  inherent  part  of  our  reinsurance  operations,  we  collect premiums from our customers and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The resulting reinsurance investment portfolio backs the future claims payments and benefits to our cedents. In addition, we also invest shareholders' capital, which is required to support the reinsured risks and the holding activities. Our market risk from liabilities primarily relates to fixed-income instruments held for financing as well as to internal pensions and reinsurance liabilities. Finally, we use derivatives for various purposes. A principal example would be the hedging of planned dividend income from non-euro subsidiaries against adverse currency  market  movements.  In  the  case  of  high  capital  market volatility, or especially adverse market conditions, Allianz SE may also undertake  hedge  overlays  to  support  the  solvency of the Allianz Group. Generally, the use of derivatives at Allianz SE is for the purpose of risk reduction. Guidelines are in place regarding the use of derivatives, for which adherence is monitored by the risk management function of Allianz SE. Asset/liability management (ALM) decisions are taken based on the internal model, considering both risks and returns on the financial markets.\n\nAs the fair values of our assets and liabilities depend on changes in the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. Allianz SE's most important market risk results from changes in the value of its participations in Group companies. The long-dated internal pension liabilities of German Group companies on Allianz SE's balance sheet contribute to interest rate risk in particular, as they cannot be fully matched by available investments due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation, implied volatilities, and currency values, which might impact the value of our assets and liabilities.\n\nTo measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models 3 for the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the sorted portfolio  profit  and  loss  distribution  at  a  certain  confidence  level (99.5 %) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR).",

        "page_content": "Strategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits - including stand-alone  interest  rate  and  equity  sensitivity  limits,  and  foreign exchange exposure limits - are defined for the Group, Allianz SE, and other  related  undertakings.  Limits  are  closely  monitored  and,  if  a breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include escalation to the respective decision-making bodies and/or the closing of positions.\n\nMarket  risk  from  material  M&A  transactions  of  Allianz SE  is managed by assessing risk capital implications.\n\nFinally, guidelines are in place regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIf the duration of our assets is shorter than our liabilities, we may suffer an economic loss in the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing  assets  at  lower  rates  prior  to  the  maturity  of  liability contracts.\n\nBy contrast, opportunities may arise when interest rates increase. Interest rate risk is managed within our ALM process and controlled via an interest rate sensitivity limit and a duration gap limit.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nWe are exposed to changing inflation rates, predominantly due to our Property-Casualty  insurance  obligations,  but  also  due  to  inflationindexed internal pension obligations. While inflation assumptions are taken into account in our underwriting, unexpected rising rates of inflation will increase both future claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities; conversely, if future inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower than anticipated. The risk that inflation rates deviate from inflation assumptions is incorporated in our internal model. Potential severe structural breaks are monitored via historical  and  ad-hoc  stress  tests.  Measures  have  been  taken  to manage currently observed elevated inflation levels. On the PropertyCasualty side, this includes continuous monitoring of claims inflation, sufficient provisioning, and timely adjustments of premium rates to reflect both actual and expected inflation.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nAllianz SE's equity risk predominantly results from the performance of our strategic insurance participations. Other equity risk stems from listed  and  unlisted  equities,  equity  derivatives,  own  shares,  and management incentive plans.\n\nRisks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As the performance of our participations might exceed expectations and stock  values  might  also  increase,  opportunities  may  arise  from participations and other equity investments.\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nFixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads widen.  However,  our  risk  appetite  for  credit  spread  risk  takes  into account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liabilitydriven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity. This  implies  that  we  are  less  affected  economically  by  short-term changes in market prices. In our capacity as a long-term investor, this gives us the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAllianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group typically invest in assets which are denominated in the same currency as  their  liabilities.  However,  some  foreign  currency  exposures  are allowed to support portfolio diversification and tactical investment decisions. Our largest exposure to foreign currency risk comes from our non-euro Group companies: Whenever the euro strengthens, the euro equivalent net asset value of our foreign subsidiaries will decline from an Allianz Group and Allianz SE perspective; however, at the same time,  the  capital  requirements  in  euro  will  decrease,  partially mitigating  the  total  impact  on  the  Allianz Group's  and  Allianz SE's capitalization.  Based  on  the  Allianz Group's  foreign  exchange management  limit  framework,  currency  risk  is  monitored  and managed at the levels of the Allianz Group, Allianz SE, and the other operating entities of the Allianz Group.\n\nThe planned dividend income from non-euro subsidiaries is an important additional source of currency risk.\n\n## Real estate risk\n\nDespite  the  risk  of  decreasing  real  estate  values,  real  estate  is  a suitable addition to our investment  portfolio due  to  good diversification  benefits,  as  well  as  to  the  contribution  of  relatively predictable, long-term cash flows.\n\nAllianz's Group Investment Committee has defined a framework for standard transactions for real estate equity and commercial real estate  loan  investments.  These  standards  outline  diversification targets,  minimum-return  thresholds,  and  other  qualitative  and\n\nquantitative requirements. All transactions that do not meet these standards  or  have  a  total  investment  volume  (including  costs) exceeding a defined threshold must be reviewed individually by Group Risk and other Group center functions. In addition, all applicable limits must be respected, in particular those resulting from strategic asset allocation as well as  its leeways and risk limits, with regards to an investing entity's portfolio.\n\nCredit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality of our counterparties ('migration risk') or the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations ('default risk').\n\nAllianz SE's  credit  risk  profile  originates  from  three  sources:  our investment portfolio, guarantees and retrocession.\n\n- -Investment  portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in fixed-income  bonds,  loans,  derivatives,  cash  positions,  and receivables whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality of the obligor.\n- -Guarantees: Credit risk is caused by the potential default of Group companies  on  commitments  from  contracts  with  external stakeholders, which are backed by guarantees from Allianz SE.\n- -Retrocession: Credit risk to external reinsurers arises when parts of Allianz SE's  reinsurance  business  are  retroceded  to  external reinsurance companies to mitigate risks. Credit risk arises from potential losses from non-recoverability of reinsurance receivables,  or  due  to  default  on  benefits  under  in-force reinsurance  treaties.  Our  retrocession  partners  are  carefully selected by a team of specialists. Besides focusing on companies with a strong credit rating, we may further require letters of credit, cash  deposits,  funds  withheld  or  assets  held  in  trust,  or  other financial measures to further mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parameters  assigned  to  obligors  are  migration  probabilities  and obligor asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings  are  assigned  to  single  obligors  using  a  clearly  defined assignment  process.  The  central  components  of  this  assignment process  are  long-term  ratings  from  external  rating  agencies,  and",

        "page_content": "internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative information available is applied.\n\nThe loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and exposure concentrations per obligor segment.\n\nTo ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the lower investment-grade and non-investment-grade area.\n\nOur group-wide country and obligor group limit management framework (CrisP 1 ) allows us to manage counterparty concentration risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group, Allianz SE, and other operating-entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for  discussions  on  credit  actions  and  provides  notification  services featuring  the  quick  and  broad  communication  of  credit-related decisions across the Group.\n\nClearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The setting  of  country  and  obligor  exposure  limits  from  the  Group's perspective (i.e., the maximum concentration limit), which are adopted by  Allianz SE  and  serve  as  maximum  local  limits  for  the  other operating entities, takes into account the Allianz Group's portfolio size and structure as well as the overall risk strategy.\n\nAllianz SE's  underwriting  risk  consists  mainly  of  premium  risk  and reserve risk in the Property-Casualty reinsurance business, but also biometric  risk  from  the  Life/Health  reinsurance  business,  and  from internal pension obligations.\n\n## Property-Casualty\n\nThe  Property-Casualty  primary  and  reinsurance  business  of  the Allianz Group is exposed to premium-risk-related adverse developments in the current year's new and renewed business, as well as to reserve risks related to the business in force.\n\nAs  part  of  our  Property-Casualty  reinsurance  operations,  we receive  premiums  from  our  cedants  and  provide  reinsurance protection in return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current year turn out adversely relative to expected claims ratios used for pricing.\n\n1\\_Credit Risk Platform.\n\nAllianz SE actively manages premium risk from its reinsurance business. The assessment of risks as part of the underwriting process is a key element of our risk management framework. There are clear underwriting  guidelines,  limits  and  restrictions  in  place,  which  are regularly monitored, e.g.,  in  the  form of Underwriting File Reviews. Excessive risks are not taken or mitigated by external retrocession agreements.  All  these  measures  contribute  to  a  limitation  of  risk accumulation. We also monitor concentrations and accumulation of non-market risks on a stand-alone basis (i.e., before diversification effects) within an Allianz Group global limit framework in order to avoid  substantial  losses  from  single  events,  such  as  natural catastrophes, and from man-made catastrophes, such as terror or large industrial risk accumulations.\n\nPremium  risk  is  subdivided  into  three  categories:  natural catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including manmade catastrophes.\n\nPremium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are used to derive loss distributions. Non-catastrophe risks are modeled using frequency and severity models for large losses and aggregate loss distribution models for attritional losses. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, storms, and floods represent a significant challenge for risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling techniques  which  combine  portfolio  data  (geographic  location, characteristics  of  insured  objects,  and  their  values)  with  simulated natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses. Similar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror events  and  man-made  catastrophes,  including  losses  from  cyber incidents and industrial concentrations. These loss distributions are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\nReserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in bestestimate  reserves  over  a  one-year  time  horizon,  resulting  from fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. We estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not yet been settled. In case of unexpected developments, we would  experience  a  gain  or  loss  dependent  on  the  assumptions applied  for  the  estimate.  In  addition,  the  risk  of  inflation  volatility deviating from historical observations and of changes in yield curves is covered in the specific market risk modules.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  unexpected  reserve  volatility, Allianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group constantly monitor the development of reserves for insurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, related undertakings generally conduct  annual  reserve  uncertainty  analyses  based  on  similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The Allianz Group performs regular independent  reviews of these analyses and  Group representatives participate in the local reserve committee meetings.\n\nAnother  important  instrument  to  mitigate  reserve  risk  is retrocession.\n\nSimilar  to  premium  risk,  reserve  risk  is  calculated  based  on actuarial  models.  The  reserve  distributions  derived  are  then  used within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\n## Life/Health\n\nRisks in Allianz SE's Life/Health segment include risks assumed from reinsurance transactions and from our internal pension obligations.\n\nUnderwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks) include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality, disability,  and  morbidity  risks  are  associated  with  an  unexpected increase  in  the  occurrence  of  death,  disability,  or  medical  claims. Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and pension  products  might  not  be  sufficient  due  to  longer  life expectancies of the insured.\n\nLife/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower than  expected.  As  profitability  calculations  are  based  on  several parameters  -  such  as  assumptions  on  future  mortality  rates,  or morbidity  claims  -  the  actual  development  may  differ  from  the expected  one.  For  example,  lower-than-expected  mortality  rates would lead to additional annuity payments in the future. However, beneficial deviations are also possible; for example, a trend towards healthier  lifestyles  will  most  likely  result  in  lower  overall  health insurance claims.\n\nWe measure these risks within our internal model, distinguishing, where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and trend development of the actuarial assumptions on the one hand and pandemic risk scenarios on the other.\n\nBusiness risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks. They are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by",

        "page_content": "the Property-Casualty business. Cost risks are associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering insurance policies are higher than expected, or that new business volume decreases to a level that does  not  allow  Allianz  to  absorb  its  fixed  costs.  Business  risk  is measured relative to baseline plans.\n\nFor the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks related  to  unpredictable,  adverse  behavior  of  policyholders  in exercising  their  contractual  options,  such  as  early  termination  of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and annuity takeup options.\n\nAssumptions  on  policyholder  behavior  are  set  in  line  with accepted actuarial methods and based on own historical data, where available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on industry  data  or  expert  judgment.  These  are  used  as  a  basis  to determine  the  economic  impact  of  policyholder  behavior  under different scenarios within our internal model.\n\nThe potential interaction between market risks (in particular interest rate risk) and lapse risk is covered by two different modelling aspects:\n\n- -Financial rationality: The Life/Health cash flow models generally contain a dynamic modeling of lapse where the best estimate lapse rate is increased if market returns are significantly higher than the overall return of the insurance policy and vice versa.\n- -Cross effects: This part takes into account that a combined impact of a market rate change and a lapse rate change could deviate significantly from the sum of the two impacts.\n\nConsidering the business model of Allianz SE as primarily a groupinternal reinsurer, business risk is moderate and is only significant for large contracts with long durations.\n\nOperational risks refer to losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, system failures, and external events, and can stem from a wide variety of sources, including the following:\n\n- -'Clients, Products, and Business Practices': potential losses due to a failure to meet the professional obligations or from the design of products.  Examples  include  mis-selling,  non-compliance  with internal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust behavior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc. These\n\nlosses tend to be less frequent but, when they occur, can have a high financial (and reputational) impact.\n\n- -'Execution, Delivery, and Process Management': potential losses arising from  transaction  or  process  management  failures. Examples  include  interest  and  penalties  from  non-payment  or underpayment  of  taxes,  or  losses  associated  with  broker  and agent distribution processes. These losses tend to be of a relatively higher frequency but with little financial impact (although single large-loss events can occur).\n- -Other operational risks including, for example, internal or external fraud, financial misstatement risk, IT risks (such as a cybersecurity incident  causing  limited  availability,  loss  of  confidentiality  or integrity, or regulatory fines 1 ), IT-related risks (such as improper delivery/design or operational stability), a potential failure at our outsourcing  partners  causing  a  disruption  to  our  working environment, etc.\n\nIn  the  last  year,  the  following  two  IT-related  operational  risks  in particular have gained in importance:\n\n- -The first operational risk results from fast developments in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) including generative AI. AI can help  Allianz  to  further  improve  customer  services  and  internal processes but comes also with new operational risks: Public and regulatory concerns about discriminating AI and 'Black Box AI' triggered various regulatory initiatives by supervisory authorities and  regulators  across  the  globe,  especially  the  upcoming European Union AI Act, which is expected to be published in 2024. Allianz addresses these new legal and reputational risks seriously with its AI governance framework, which is already rolled out in various  operating  entities.  It  basically  includes  a  practical guidance for AI promoting transparency, privacy, fairness, human agency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI  solutions.  Privacy  and  ethics  impact  assessments  help  to implement  these  AI  principles  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  These activities  are  supported  by  various  training  and  awareness campaigns for Allianz employees, and by a data advisory board preparing decisions for the Board of Management in the area of AI and data ethics. The Allianz AI governance framework will be further adjusted, especially to implement the European Union AI Act in its final version and structurally rolled out in the operating entities.\n- -The second operational risk is compliance with rising regulatory requirements  on  the  management  of  IT  risks. In  the  second quarter 2022, BaFin conducted an audit on the implementation of the supervisory requirements for insurance on IT (VAIT), with the new version published on 3 March 2022 at Allianz SE. To address the findings, Allianz SE has set up a program under the lead of the division  'Operations,  IT  and  Organization'  and  approved  and submitted  to  BaFin  a  corresponding  remediation  plan.  The remediation plan has been accepted by BaFin.\n\nAdditional recent examples are the European Commission's Digital Operational  Resilience  Act  (DORA)  and  similar  requirements  from local regulators relevant for the Allianz Group. To achieve compliance with the large number of very granular DORA standards, an extensive program coordinated by Group Protection & Resilience was initiated during  2023.  Target  of  the  program  is  to  implement  adequate solutions by January 2025, when the requirements set by the act need to be effectively met by Allianz. Group Risk is participating in the project and is actively involved in contributing to the design required by DORA.\n\nIn  view  of  Allianz SE's  tasks  as  holding  company  for  the Allianz Group and reinsurer, the operational risk capital of Allianz SE is dominated by the risk of potential losses within the areas of 'execution, delivery  and  process  management'  and  'clients,  products  and business practices'.\n\nOperational  risk  capital  is  calculated  using  a  scenario-based approach based on expert judgment, as well as internal and external operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of potential loss events for each material operational risk category are assessed and used as a basis for our internal model calibration.\n\nAllianz has developed a consistent operational risk management framework, which is applied across the Group based on proportionality and focuses on the early recognition and proactive management of material operational risks. The framework defines roles  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  management  processes  and methods: Local risk managers at Allianz SE and at the other operating entities  of  the  Allianz Group,  in  their  capacity  as  Second  Line  of Defense, identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficiencies  via  a  dialogue  with  the  First  Line  of  Defense,  report operational risk events in a central database, and ensure that the framework is implemented in their respective operating entity.",

        "page_content": "This framework triggers specific mitigating control programs. For example, compliance risks are addressed with written policies and dedicated compliance programs monitored by compliance functions across  the  Allianz Group.  The  risk  of  financial  misstatement  is mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting. Outsourcing risks are covered by our Outsourcing Policy, Service Level Agreements,  and  Business  Continuity  and  Crisis  Management programs  to  protect  critical  business  functions  from  these  events. Cyber risks are mitigated through investments in cybersecurity, cyber insurance that Allianz buys from third-party insurers, and a variety of ongoing  control  activities,  developed  and  implemented  along  the following main themes: slow down hackers, increase threat detection, reduce the damage of attacks, and enhance the skills as well as the organizational structure.\n\nWith regards to the last year, in particular IT risk management and  information  and  cybersecurity  were  further  improved  via implementation of the following strategic themes, which were derived from both observed and anticipated risks, considering the strategic outlook of information security, the  threat landscape, and industry trends: (1) protection of digital identity, (2) security service health, (3) cyber resilience.\n\nThe  ICS  for  operational  risk  encompasses  the  management  of compliance,  financial  reporting,  and  other  operational  risks.  The effectiveness of this internal control system is monitored along two dimensions:\n\n- -Monitoring the effective implementation of the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) framework, which is progressively replacing the  Integrated  Risk  and  Control  System  (IRCS)  framework.  If correctly  implemented,  these  frameworks  ensure  that  risks  are identified in time, and controls are appropriately set up and tested frequently to identify potential weaknesses or gaps in the internal control system.\n- -Monitoring the resolution of identified weaknesses in the internal control system.\n\nNFRM strengthens the internal control system by using a new risk taxonomy consistent across the Group, which helps to aggregate the risks  at  Group  level,  and  by  using  an  even  more  rigorous  testing approach.  It  is  being  rolled  out  in  so-called  waves,  with  close monitoring by Group Risk and Group Compliance. Insurance and Asset Management entities of the first two waves - 44 operating entities out\n\nof 67 - have already undergone important implementation steps in 2023 to further bolster assurance activities. Operating entities part of the last wave 3 have continued to apply the IRCS framework and will implement NFRM in 2024.\n\nThe full implementation of the new framework across the Group is expected to be completed by year-end 2024. Meanwhile, Group Risk and Group Compliance are closely monitoring all waves, seamlessly bridging an effective migration between IRCS and NFRM.\n\nThe  NFRM  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  ICS,  whose fundamentals  are  described  in  the  section  'Risk  Management System and Internal Control System'.\n\nThe NFRM is the framework by which the second Line of Defense supports  and  facilitates  the  fulfillment  of  first  Line  of  Defense responsibility  to  implement  an  adequate  and  effective  system  for managing  Non-Financial  Risks.  The  NFRM  aims  to  strengthen  the control system by using a harmonized methodology to:\n\n- -Achieve a consistent and commonly accepted definition of risks that fall under the category Non-Financial Risk, via establishing a set of non-financial risk vectors.\n- -Facilitate the implementation of adequate controls via an NFRM control catalog, consisting of control objectives, risk scenarios, and exemplary key controls.\n- -Ensure a robust testing of these controls, using a systematic riskbased approach.\n\nTo achieve these targets, NFRM has connected and evolved already existing pillars and tools of the Allianz Risk Management and Internal Control  System  framework,  e.g.,  the  Top  Risk  Assessment  (TRA) methodology, the Integrated Risk and Control (IRCS) framework, and the use of internal and external operational loss events.\n\nThe NFRM framework has the following key features:\n\n- -Objective  data  is  used  through  a  consistent  methodology  to facilitate a baseline assessment of non-financial risks.\n- -An assessment of top non-financial risks prioritizes risks to better allocate resources.\n- -A process-level view is used to approach risks and controls from a business view, and to facilitate integrated assurance.\n- -Standardized key controls are defined to support compliance and risk management by design, and to enforce integrated assurance and testing rigor.\n\nFundamental to the NFRM is the concept of a holistic approach. While there are several different sources of operational risks, the process towards the management of the risks always follows the same core principle. This is that operational risks must be identified, assessed, and prioritized, and underlying mitigating controls have to be effective. This is the basic premise behind establishing an integrated approach.\n\nAt the Allianz Group level, it is important to monitor the quality of the local implementation of this framework as a means of ensuring that internal control system weaknesses are identified prior to the occurrence of operational risk events (ex-ante).\n\nTo assess the internal control effectiveness at the Allianz SE level, an  IRCS  Rating  is  compiled  as  an  integral  part  of  the  NFRM framework. Based on the 2023 rating, we have no indication that the IRCS is not adequately designed or to a material degree ineffective. Wherever  shortcomings  in  design  or  effectiveness  have  been identified, remediation has been addressed. No material weaknesses have been identified.\n\nAllianz SE is conducting an NFRM full run for the business year 2023, which incorporates the above conclusions.\n\nOperational risk events are reported in a central database.\n\nThere  are  risks  which,  due  to  their  nature,  cannot  be  adequately addressed or mitigated by setting aside dedicated capital. These risks are  therefore  not  considered  in  the  internal  model.  For  the identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity, and reputational risk.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company's value arising from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their implementation.\n\nStrategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group's Top  Risk  Assessment  process  and  discussed  in  various  Board  of Management-level committees (for example, GFRC). We also monitor",

Progress on mitigating strategic risks and meeting the value creation levers is monitored and evaluated in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogues between the Allianz Group and Allianz SE and the other related undertakings.\n\nTo  the  extent  that  the  strategic  objective  'Growth'  leads  to takeover and acquisition transactions and large single investments, it is of particular importance to Allianz SE.\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nAllianz's reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider of financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas such as  product  quality,  corporate  governance,  financial  performance, customer  service,  employee  relations,  intellectual  capital,  and corporate responsibility.\n\nReputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of the Allianz SE share  price, the value of the in-force business, or the value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation in the eyes of internal or external stakeholders.\n\nThe identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of the  annual  Top  Risk  Assessment  process,  undertaken  by  the Allianz Group and all operating entities. As part of this process, senior management approves the risk strategy for the most significant risks and their potential reputational impact.\n\nThe  main  reputational  risks  faced  by  Allianz SE  and  the Allianz Group are related to strategy execution, environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, cyber risks, litigation risks, and compliance risks. Reputational risk can also arise from sensitive issues within any Allianz  entity,  which  can  impact  the  reputation  of  the  holding company, Allianz SE.\n\nTo  manage  these  risks,  Allianz  has  defined  sensitive  business areas and corresponding risk guidelines that are binding for Allianz SE and its affiliated companies . All relevant functions within Allianz SE cooperate  in  identifying  reputational  and  ESG-related  risks,  with Group Communications (GCOM) and Group Sustainability assessing potential risks on a group-wide basis.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  defined  as  the  risk  that  current  or  future  payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely altered conditions.\n\nLiquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows.\n\nThe liquidity risk profile of Allianz predominantly originates from the uncertainty  about  the  volume  and  timing  of  cash  needs  from insurances liabilities. This relates especially to:\n\n- -Coverage  of  various  types  of  catastrophes  in  the  PropertyCasualty business, with the frequency of such events anticipated to increase going forward as a result of the unfolding climate change effects;\n- -Mass lapse events or rising lapse rates in the Life/Health insurance business, especially in combination with changes in the relevant capital market environment.\n\nMajor risks can also result from derivative transactions used by Allianz to hedge specific market risks.\n\nAllianz is exposed to liquidity risk as well due to large operational risk events, which may potentially result in significant cash outflows.\n\nAnother source of liquidity risk for Allianz are potential regulatory actions  by  local  supervisors,  which  may  reduce  dividends  from subsidiaries to the Group (e.g., due to global events such as partially observed during the COVID-19 crisis).\n\nThe investment strategy of Allianz SE particularly focuses on the quality of investments, and ensures a significant portion of liquid assets in  the  portfolio  (for  example,  high-rated  government  or  covered bonds). We employ actuarial methods to estimate our liabilities arising from  reinsurance  and  internal  pension  contracts.  In  our  liquidity planning process, we reconcile liquidity sources (such as dividends received from subsidiaries, cash from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (including payments due to dividends to shareholders, reinsurance claims and expenses) under a best-estimate liquidity plan, and  under  systemic  as  well  as  Allianz SE-specific  adverse  liquidity scenarios.\n\nThe main goal of planning and managing Allianz SE's liquidity position is to ensure that we are always in a position to meet payment obligations.  To  comply  with  this  objective,  the  liquidity  position  of Allianz SE is monitored and forecasted on a daily basis.\n\nAllianz SE's  short-term  liquidity  is  managed  within  Allianz SE's cash pool, which also serves as a central tool for investing the excess liquidity  of  other  Group  companies.  The  accumulated  short-term liquidity forecast is updated daily. The cash position in this portfolio is subject  to  an  absolute  minimum  and  an  absolute  target  liquidity threshold. Both thresholds are defined for the Allianz SE cash pool in order to be protected against short-term liquidity crises.\n\nAs  part  of  our  liquidity  stress  testing  framework,  contingent liquidity requirements and sources of liquidity are considered to ensure that Allianz SE is able to meet any future payment obligations, even under adverse conditions. Triggers for increased contingent liquidity requirements  include  amongst  others  non-availability  of  external capital markets, combined market and catastrophe risk scenarios for subsidiaries,  as  well  as  lower  than  expected  profit  transfers  and dividends from subsidiaries.\n\nIn order to protect the Allianz Group against the liquidity impact of  adverse  risk  events  beyond  those  covered  by  the  capital  and liquidity buffers at our subsidiaries, Allianz SE holds a strategic liquidity reserve for which the target level is reevaluated annually.\n\nThe strategic liquidity planning for Allianz SE, which covers the periods  of  one  calendar  year  (in  increased  granularity)  and  three calendar years, is regularly reported to the Board of Management.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks\n\nEnvironmental,  social  or  governance  events  and  conditions  (ESG factors), such as climate change, loss of biodiversity or human rights abuses,  are  increasingly  becoming  a  relevant  source  of  adverse impacts on our balance sheet, profitability or reputation. These ESGrelated risks are characterized by their transversal nature, meaning they may materialize within any of Allianz's existing risk categories (e.g.,  market  risk,  underwriting  risk,  operational  risk)  as  either  a consequence  of  societal  responses  to  ESG  factors  -  including regulatory  changes,  litigation,  technological  developments  and changes  in  human  behavior  -  or  due  to  events  causing  physical damage, such as droughts, floods or storms, whereby the magnitude or likelihood is attributable to an ESG factor.\n\nAllianz's strategy for the management of these risks begins with establishing  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  all  the  ways  ESG factors can trigger adverse events within the investment, underwriting, and  operations  areas  of  our  business,  as  well  as  from  a  broader reputational  perspective.  For  this  purpose,  a  dedicated  ESG  risk inventory has been established and a corresponding risk assessment",

Given that all adverse impacts attributable to ESG factors are ultimately realized within one of Allianz's existing risk categories, we aim - to the greatest extent possible -  to embed the identification and management of these risks directly within risk management processes already in place.\n\nAt the Group level, the GFRC is responsible for overseeing ESGrelated risks. In addition, a Group Sustainability Board is in place, which is responsible for Allianz's overall ESG strategy and for steering the integration  of  ESG  aspects  into  core  investment  and  insurance activities.\n\nAt the Allianz SE level, these responsibilities hold accordingly. For a broader perspective on our key ESG integration processes, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\n## Climate change\n\nWithin the broad scope of ESG, climate change is currently the ESG factor of primary emphasis, both in terms of regulatory focus and potential to materially influence our risk profile over a short- to midterm and long-term horizon. Commensurate with this emphasis, an assessment  of  Allianz's  climate  change-related  risks  has  been conducted during 2023, including both a qualitative risk assessment following the structure of the ESG risk inventory, as well as quantitative scenario analyses and stress-testing.\n\nFor  information  about  the  climate  change  risk  management methodology, the outcome of the assessments and next steps, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\n## Internal risk capital framework\n\nWe define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the basis  for  determining  our  Solvency II  regulatory  capitalization.  We calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk capital across all business segments on a quarterly basis. We also regularly project risk\n\ncapital requirements between reporting periods in times of financial market turbulence.\n\nFor the management of our risk profile and solvency position, we utilize an  approach  that  reflects  the  Solvency II  rules  by  comprising  our approved  internal  model  covering  Allianz SE  and  all  other  major insurance operations.\n\n## Internal model\n\nOur internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss of portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe ('holding  period',  set  at  one  year)  and  probability  of  occurrence ('confidence level', set at 99.5 %). We simulate risk events from all risk categories  ('sources  of  risk')  modeled  and  calculate  the  portfolio value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-mitigating measures such as reinsurance contracts or derivatives, under each scenario.\n\nThe risk capital required is defined as the difference between the current  portfolio  value  and  the  portfolio  value  under  adverse conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level. As we consider the impact of a negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered businesses at the same time, diversification effects across products and regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both separately and in aggregate. We also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios representing  historical  events,  reverse  stress  tests,  and  adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc stress tests to reflect current political and financial developments, and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely.\n\n## Coverage of the risk capital calculations\n\nAllianz SE's  internal  risk  capital  model  covers  the  activities  of Allianz SE as the holding company for the Allianz Group, as well as its activities as a reinsurer.\n\nWhereas the model treats most subsidiaries as participations, it applies a look-through rule for 32 subsidiaries and investment funds, which are ancillary to Allianz SE's operations (mainly by holding assets), and reflects their risks - either in full or in part - on a granular level.\n\nUntil the third quarter of 2023, Allianz SE represented the solvency capital requirements for certain minor insurance entities outside the European Economic Area (EEA), with only immaterial impact on the Allianz SE's risk profile, by a book value deduction approach. 1 Due to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter of 2023, the book value deduction method will no longer be used for these entities. Instead,  the  majority  of  these  entities  will  be  treated  as  strategic participations.  Some  entities  that  are  not  fully  consolidated  and immaterial will be treated as investments.\n\nThe risk capital model covers all relevant assets (including fixedincome  instruments,  equities,  real  estate,  and  derivatives)  and liabilities (including the run-off of all technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt and other liabilities such as guarantees).\n\nIn view of the above, Allianz's risk capital framework covers all material and quantifiable risks. Risks not specifically covered by the internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n## Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment\n\nWhen  calculating  the  fair  values  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the assumptions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in  determining  and  discounting  future  cash  flows.  For  liability valuation,  we  apply  the  methodology  provided  by  the  European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to extrapolate the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor.\n\nIn  addition,  we  adjust  the  risk-free  yield  curves  by  a  volatility adjustment  (VA)  in  most  markets  where  a  volatility  adjustment  is defined by EIOPA and approved by the local regulator. This is done to better reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash flows  of  our  insurance  liabilities  are  largely  predictable.  The advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds  yielding  spreads  over  the  risk-free  return  and  earning  this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of having to sell debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.\n\nWe take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful for long-term investors than the default risk. Allianz also models the volatility adjustment dynamically within our approved internal model,",

        "page_content": "which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard formula. For risk capital calculations, we assume a dynamic movement of the volatility adjustment broadly consistent with the way the VA would react in practice; however, we base the movement on our own portfolio rather than the EIOPA portfolio. To account for this deviation, Allianz applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the dynamic volatility adjustment.\n\n## Diversification and correlation assumptions\n\nAs Allianz is an integrated financial services provider offering a variety of  products  across  different  business  segments  and  geographic regions, diversification is key to our business model.\n\nDiversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification factors  include  regions  (for  example,  windstorm  in  Australia  vs. windstorm in Germany), risk categories (for example, market risk vs. underwriting risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (for example, commercial vs. personal lines of property and casualty risk). Ultimately,  diversification  is  driven  by  the  specific  features  of  the investment or (re)insurance products in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an operational risk event in Australia can be considered to be highly independent of a change in credit spreads for a French government bond held as investment.\n\nThe internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and correlation  effects  when  aggregating  results  at  the  Group  level, Allianz SE level, or at the level of other Group companies. The resulting diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are not likely to materialize at the same time.\n\nWhere possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair of market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, considering observations over more than a decade. In cases where historical data or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, correlations  are  set  by  the  Correlation  Settings  Committee,  which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and controlled process. In general, when using expert judgment, we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, we use an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nOur internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior, expenses, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible, additionally considering recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and  actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods. Our internal risk capital and financial reporting framework incorporates comprehensive processes and controls to ensure the reliability of these assumptions.\n\n## Model limitations\n\nAs the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold in the course of one year.\n\nWe use model and scenario parameters derived from historical data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for example, in an unprecedented crisis or as a possible result of severe structural breaks resulting from climate change, our VaR approach might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict.  In  order  to  mitigate  reliance  on  historical  data,  we complement our VaR analysis with stress testing.\n\nFurthermore,  we  validate  the  model  and  parameters  through sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and, where appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for selecting parameters and control processes. Overall, we believe that our validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nSince the internal model takes into account the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the  market  value  of  each  item  accurately.  For  some  assets  and liabilities, it may be difficult, if not impossible - notably in distressed financial markets - to either obtain a current market price or to apply a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates.  Despite  these  limitations,  we  believe  the  estimated  fair values are appropriately assessed.\n\nWhile the aggregate risk capital is exactly modeled, the whole account stop loss construction 1 leads to the use of approximations\n\nwhen reporting contributory risk capital figures for the sub-categories of  underwriting  risk,  as  the  individual  contributions  have  to  be approximated based on the underlying distributions.\n\nIn 2023, our internal model was further enhanced based on regulatory developments, model validation results, and the feedback received in the course of our consultations with regulators.\n\nThe  net  impact  of  regulatory  and  model  changes  on  the Solvency II risk capital of Allianz SE in 2023 was \u20ac 2,223 mn.\n\n## The most important changes are:\n\n- -Treatment  of  certain  minor,  previously  not  included  non-EEA insurance entities mainly as strategic participations, and of some not  fully  consolidated  and  immaterial  entities  as  investments (\u20ac 2.0 bn, + 2 % p on Solvency II ratio);\n- -Dynamic  Inflation  Extrapolation,  which  improves  the  inflation modeling by refining both the coverage of the term structure and the extrapolation to the central bank's long-term inflation target (\u20ac 0.2 bn).\n\nIn the subsequent sections, the risk figures for 2022 after regulatory and model changes will form the basis for the analysis of the changes in our risk profile in 2023.\n\n## Allianz SE: Impact of regulatory and model changes; allocated risk according to the risk profile\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2022\u00b9   | 2022\u00b2   |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|\n| Market risk         | 30,256  | 28,142  |\n| Credit risk         | 531     | 524     |\n| Underwriting risk   | 3,406   | 3,442   |\n| Business risk       | 145     | 145     |\n| Operational risk    | 531     | 531     |\n| Diversification     | (3,177) | (3,314) |\n| Tax                 | (206)   | (206)   |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 31,486  | 29,263  |\n\n1\\_2022 risk profile figures recalculated based on model and regulatory changes in 2023. 2\\_2022 risk profile figures as reported previously.",

        "page_content": "The changes to our internal model affected the risk categories and diversification as follows:\n\n## Market, credit, and underwriting risk\n\nDue to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter of 2023,  certain  minor,  previously  not  included  non-EEA  insurance entities, which were formerly represented by a book value deduction approach, are treated as participations (some not fully consolidated and immaterial entities are treated as investments). Together with the major  model  change  for  inflation  risk  (introduction  of  additional inflation risk factors and dynamic inflation extrapolation) and further model  changes,  this  adjustment  increased  the  market  risk  by \u20ac 2,114 mn.\n\n## Diversification\n\nDiversification between risk categories decreased by \u20ac 137 mn, which was primarily driven by the increase of market risk as well as the decrease  of  underwriting  risk  following  the  regulatory  and  model changes. In particular, the major inflation model change triggered an update  of  the  risk factor correlation matrix impacting  the diversification.\n\nBusiness  and  operational  risk  were  not  affected  by  model changes and remained stable.\n\n## Risk profile and management assessment\n\nThe quantitative risk profile of Allianz SE is primarily dominated by market risk that results from its non-traded insurance participations when  measured  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  treatment  of participations under Solvency II (e.g., without looking through to the underlying risks behind the participations). In order to provide greater transparency, the Group risk figures as reflected in the Allianz Group reports can be interpreted as a 'look-through' into the consolidated risk profile represented by all of the Group's participations as well as those risks unique to Allianz SE. The second largest risk for Allianz SE from an internal model perspective is underwriting risk arising from its reinsurance business and from internal pension obligations.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, the overall risk profile of Allianz SE has remained and is expected to remain stable. 'Stable' in this context\n\nmeans a high exposure to market risk, in particular equity risk from strategic  participations  in  Allianz Group  subsidiaries,  a  moderate exposure  to  underwriting  risk,  and  relatively  low  exposures  to operational risk, credit risk and business risk (i.e., measured as a share of  Allianz SE's  Solvency II  risk  capital).  Please  refer  to  the  section 'Solvency II regulatory capitalization' for further details.\n\nTo support the development of a risk appetite and a risk management framework for these core risks, Allianz SE has elaborated the following risk management philosophy:\n\n- -Financial  risks: Allianz SE's  objective  is  to  support  the  Group strategy while ensuring that financial risk-taking is in line with its risk-bearing  capacity.  To  manage  financial  risk  effectively,  it  is essential  to  clearly  identify,  measure,  monitor,  and  control  the inherent  risks,  especially  in  the  investment  portfolios,  financing transactions, the reinsurance portfolio, and the internal pension obligations.\n- -Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are accepted when acting as a reinsurer for group-internal and external reinsurance business.  Quality  control  mechanisms  are  applied  to  ensure adherence to the Allianz Group's underwriting standards and to monitor  the  quality  of  the  portfolio,  the  underwriting  and retrocession processes. These processes must support sustainable and profitable business decisions, and need to be aligned with the risk appetite of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as to avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and accumulations.\n- -Other  non-financial  risks: These  risks  are  inherent  to  the  core business  and  need  to  be  carefully  managed  via  continuous improvements in risk identification, risk assessment, and control environments.  This  occurs  through  elements  of  the  Group  Risk management framework such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), Non-Financial  Risk  Management  (NFRM),  Reputational  Risk Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\nAllianz faces a challenging financial market  and  operating environment.\n\nMarkets are characterized by the risk of persistently high volatility. Interest rates have further increased, reflecting continued monetary policy tightening by key central banks to counter current inflation rates and long-term inflation expectations being above central banks' long-\n\nterm  inflation  targets.  Bonds  and  equity  markets  are  fragile,  as inflation and economic growth prospects for Europe and the United States are still impacted by repercussions from the war in Ukraine and supply chain disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is the risk of further global political and economic destabilization.\n\nLasting geopolitical and new regional political crises dominate the political and economic agenda. There is no clear resolution on the horizon for the lasting war in Ukraine. In addition, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza risks escalating into a regional military conflict with the involvement of Iran and the United States, encompassing new risks for energy  prices  and  inflation.  Furthermore,  there  is  the  risk  of  a deterioration in the United States-China relationship, as well as of a further hardening of China's attitudes towards Taiwan.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  geopolitical  crises,  there  are  several  other factors that may lead to a persistent high financial market volatility. Lasting momentum for populist and radical parties in the Americas, in Europe, and around the globe could make international cooperation and coordination more challenging and complex, leading to a lower chance of impactful political action on geopolitical and regional crises, as  well  as  on  issues  such  as  climate  change,  due  to  conflicting objectives. The risk factors also include further disruptions to global supply  chains,  which  weigh  on  global  trade,  with  the  potential  to prompt long-term structural shifts in these chains. Lasting risk factors include the challenges of implementing long-term structural reforms in key eurozone countries.\n\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies, combined with the rising use of artificial intelligence, increases the risk of technology obsolescence, cyberattacks, data breaches, system failures, negative impacts  from  the  use  of  deepfake  tools  on  political  and  business processes,  as  well  as  the  risk  of  non-compliance  with  increasing regulation covering IT-related business processes.\n\nTherefore, we continue to closely monitor political, financial and technological developments as well as the global trade situation to manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks.\n\nOur  approved  partial  internal  model  has  been  applied  since  the beginning of 2016 when Solvency II came into effect. There is some uncertainty whether the provisional equivalence of the United States solvency regime for Solvency II purposes will be extended beyond 2025, as well as about future regulatory requirements resulting from the potential introduction of future global capital requirements, and from the current Solvency II review.",

        "page_content": "The  Solvency II  concept  of  'equivalence'  allows  third  country solvency regimes to be recognized and used for Solvency II purposes. Most relevant for Allianz today, it allows the integration of Allianz Life Insurance  Company  of  North  America  into  the  Group  capital calculation based on United States solvency requirements. The current provisional equivalent treatment of the United States expires at the end of 2025 and there is some risk that the equivalence will not be extended  beyond  2025,  with  a  potential  negative  impact  to  the solvency ratio of Allianz Group.\n\nThe  framework  for  potential  future  capital  requirements  for Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) is yet to be finalized by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nIn addition, in the last years the European Commission reviewed the Solvency II directive as foreseen in European legislation. The review has  been  politically  agreed  by  the  trilogue  parties  (European Commission,  European  Parliament  and  European  Council)  in December 2023, and the final text of the directive is expected to be published in the official journal of the European Union in the second or the third quarter 2024. The corresponding update of Level 2 legislation (Solvency II regulation) as well as EIOPA guidelines will be performed by the European Commission and EIOPA during 2024 and 2025 and will cover outstanding technical details as delegated by the directive. The  application  of  the  new  rules  will  start  24 months  after  their publication in the official journal of the European Union, i.e., for the second quarter 2026 at the earliest.\n\nFinally,  the  potential  for  a  multiplicity  of  different  regulatory regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements, based on a parallel application of a global capital framework (Insurance Capital Standard  -  ICS)  as  well  as  Solvency II,  could  increase  operational complexity and costs.\n\n## Management assessment\n\nAllianz SE's management feels comfortable with Allianz SE's overall risk profile and capitalization level. This confidence is based on several factors:\n\n- -Due  to  its  effective  capital  management,  Allianz SE  is  wellcapitalized. We have met our internal and regulatory solvency targets as of 31 December 2023.\n\n- -Allianz SE  has a conservative investment profile and disciplined business  practices  in  the  reinsurance  business,  leading  to sustainable operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.\n- -Allianz SE is well-positioned to deal with potentially adverse future events - such as those related to the ongoing war in Ukraine - due to  our  strong  internal  limit  framework,  stress  testing,  internal model, and risk management practices.\n\nBased on the information available to us at the moment of report completion, we expect to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the  Minimum  Capital  Requirement.  In  addition,  Allianz  is  carefully monitoring  especially  the  development  of  the  war  in  Ukraine, geopolitical tensions and regional political crises, and manages its portfolios to ensure that the Group, Allianz SE, and the other Group companies have sufficient resources to meet their solvency capital needs.\n\nThe Own Funds and capital requirements are based on the market value balance sheet approach, which is consistent with the economic principles of Solvency II 1 . Our regulatory capitalization is shown in the following table.\n\n## Allianz SE: Solvency II regulatory capitalization\n\n| as of 31 December    |      |   2023\u00b9 |   2022\u00b2 |\n|----------------------|------|---------|---------|\n| Own funds            | \u20ac bn |    87.9 |    76.7 |\n| Capital requirement  | \u20ac bn |    33.1 |    29.3 |\n| Capitalization ratio | %    |   265   |   262   |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Solvency II capitalization of Allianz SE stands at 265 %. The increase of 3 percentage points in 2023 results from an increase in own funds by 15 % and a relatively lower increase in  solvency  risk  capital  by  13 %,  both  mainly  driven  by  higher participation values.\n\nThe  Allianz Group  companies  Allianz  Lebensversicherungs-AG and  Allianz  Private  Krankenversicherungs-AG  have  been  granted approval for the application of transitionals on technical provisions. The resulting change in participation values impacts Allianz SE's own funds  and  capital  requirements.  Including  the  application  of transitional measures for technical provisions at these Allianz Group companies, Allianz SE's own funds and capital requirement amounted to  \u20ac 98.1 bn  and \u20ac 36.5 bn, leading to a Solvency II ratio of 269 %. However, the general capital steering for both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE  continues  to  focus  on  the  previous  approach,  i.e., excluding  the  application  of  transitional  measures  for  technical provisions at Allianz Group companies. Consequently, the figures in all subsequent  sections  exclude  transitional  measures  applied  at Allianz Group companies unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Quantifiable risks and opportunities by risk category\n\nThis Risk and Opportunity Report outlines Allianz SE's risk figures, reflecting  its  risk  profile  based  on  pre-diversified  risk  figures  and Allianz SE diversification effects.\n\nWe measure and steer risk based on an approved internal model which quantifies the potential adverse developments of Own Funds. The results provide an overview of how our risk profile is distributed over different risk categories and determine the regulatory capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II.\n\nThe pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effects within  each  modeled  risk  category  (i.e.,  within  market,  credit, underwriting, business, and operational risk), but do not include the diversification effects across risk categories. The Allianz SE diversified risk also captures the diversification effects across all risk categories.",

The change in comparison to the previous year (\u20ac (61) mn) is driven by changes in diversification effects due to an increasing dominance of equity risk.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE's interest-rate-sensitive assets amounting to a market value of \u20ac 42.5 bn would have gained \u20ac 1.9 bn or lost \u20ac 1.7 bn in value in the event of interest rates changing by -100 and + 100 basis points respectively.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nSimilar to previous years, inflation risk leads to a relief in market risk. As of 31 December 2023, the relief amounts to (\u20ac (379) mn).\n\n## Equity risk and equity volatility risk\n\nIn 2023, the contribution of equity risk and equity volatility risk to market risk amounts to \u20ac 30,896 mn. The increase in contribution of \u20ac 1,152 mn in comparison to 2022 is mainly due to higher market values of participations in Group companies and reduced equity put hedges.\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nAt the end of 2023, credit spread risk increased  the market risk by \u20ac 267 mn. The decrease of \u20ac 61 mn compared to the previous year is mainly due to a lower average maturity of the bond portfolio.\n\n## Real estate risk\n\nThe burden on market risk from real estate risk is at a similar level as in 2022 and amounts to \u20ac 153 mn.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAt year-end 2023, currency risk contributed \u20ac 479 mn to market risk. The increase of \u20ac 269 mn in comparison to the previous year is mainly driven  by  higher  market  values  of  participations  in  non-eurozone Group companies.\n\nThe \u20ac 60 mn decrease in credit risk is driven by lower credit risk from the reinsurance business, mainly due to lower retrocession exposures.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  pre-diversified  risk  calculated  for underwriting  risks  stemming  from  our  reinsurance  business  and internal pensions: 1\n\n## Allianz SE: Risk Profile - Underwriting risk by source of risk pre-diversified, \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December                  | 2023   | 2022\u00b9   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Premium natural catastrophe        | 514    | 358     |\n| Premium non-catastrophe and terror | 2,184  | 1,816   |\n| Reserve                            | 1,477  | 1,165   |\n| Biometric                          | 118    | 67      |\n| Total Allianz SE                   | 4,293  | 3,406   |\n\n- 1\\_2022 risk profile figures adjusted based on the 2023 model changes.\n\nFor Allianz SE, the pre-diversified underwriting risk showed an increase of  \u20ac 887 mn,  primarily  driven  by  an  increase  in  reserve  risk  and premium risk for non-catastrophe.",

        "page_content": "## Property-Casualty\n\n## Premium risk\n\nIn 2023, Allianz SE's natural catastrophe risk increased by \u20ac 156 mn, mainly due to the new retrocession structure for natural catastrophe risks.\n\nThe  top  five  scenarios  contributing  to  Allianz SE's  natural catastrophe risk as of 31 December 2023 were a windstorm in Europe, an earthquake in Australia, a flood in Australia, a flood in Germany and a hailstorm in Germany.\n\nAllianz SE's non-catastrophe and terror premium risk increased by \u20ac 368 mn  in  2023,  mainly  due  to  additional  Allianz  intra-group reinsurance transactions.\n\n## Reserve risk\n\nThe increase by \u20ac 312 mn in Allianz SE's reserve risk in 2023 is mainly due to significant natural catastrophe events and reduced retrocession assets.\n\n## Life/Health\n\nIn 2023, Allianz SE's biometric risk increased by \u20ac 51 mn compared to 2022.  The  main  driver  is  an  increase  in  mortality  and  mortality calamity risk due to an increase in Canadian exposure.\n\nThe business risk has increased by \u20ac 48 mn in 2023, also driven by the increase of the Canadian portfolio's exposure.\n\nEnd of 2023, Allianz SE's operational risk was \u20ac 623 mn. The \u20ac 91 mn increase in operational risk resulted primarily from an increase in the operational risk categories 'Suppliers' & 'System Failures'.\n\nDetailed information regarding our liquidity risk exposure, liquidity, and funding - including changes in cash and cash equivalents - is provided in Liquidity and Funding Resources. As can be inferred from the  section  on  the  management  of  liquidity  risks,  while  these  are quantified and monitored through regular stress test reporting as well as properly managed, they are not quantified for risk capital purposes.",

According to \u00a7 317 (2) sentence 6 HGB, the audit of the disclosures is limited to whether the relevant disclosures have been made.\n\n## Corporate Constitution of the European Company (SE)\n\nAs a European company, Allianz SE is subject to special European SE regulations and the German  SE  Implementation Act ('SEAusf\u00fchrungsgesetz - SEAG') and the German Act on the Involvement of  Employees  in  a  European  Company  ('SE-Beteiligungsgesetz  SEBG'), in addition to German Stock Corporation Law. Notwithstanding, key features of a German stock corporation -  in particular  the  two-tier  board  system  (Board  of  Management  and Supervisory Board) and the principle of equal employee representation on the Supervisory Board - have been maintained by Allianz SE. The Corporate Constitution of Allianz SE is laid down in its Statutes. The current version of the Statutes is available on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nThe regulatory requirements for corporate governance (System of Governance)  applicable  for  insurance  companies,  insurance groups,  and  financial  conglomerates  apply.  In  particular,  they include the establishment and further design of significant control functions  (independent  risk  control  function,  actuarial  function, compliance function, and internal audit) as well as general principles for an effective and proper business organization. These regulatory requirements are applicable throughout the Group in accordance with  the  principle  of  proportionality.  The  implementation  of  the regulatory requirements is supported by written guidelines issued by the Board of Management of Allianz SE. Furthermore, Solvency II requires the publication of qualitative and quantitative information,\n\nincluding a solvency statement. Details on the implementation of the regulatory requirements for corporate governance by Allianz SE and by the Allianz Group can be found in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report of Allianz SE and of the Allianz Group, which are published on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nGood  corporate  governance  is  essential  for  sustainable  business performance. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE therefore attach great importance to complying with the recommendations  of  the  German  Corporate  Governance  Code (hereinafter 'Code'), as amended from time to time. There are no statutory provisions on the basis of which recommendations of the Code  are  not  applicable  to  Allianz SE.  On  14 December 2023,  the Board  of  Management  and  the  Supervisory  Board  issued  the following Declaration of Conformity of Allianz SE with the Code:\n\n## Declaration of Conformity in accordance with \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n\nDeclaration of Conformity with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in accordance with \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n\nSince issuing the last Declaration of Conformity on 15 December 2022, Allianz SE has complied with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commission in the version of 28 April 2022, and will comply with the recommendations in the future .\n\nMunich, 14 December 2023 Allianz SE\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Management: Signed Oliver B\u00e4te Signed Giulio Terzariol\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board: Signed Michael Diekmann\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE follows all suggestions of the Code in its version of 28 April 2022.\n\nThe  Declaration  of  Conformity  and  further  information  on corporate governance at Allianz is available on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Board of Management\n\nThe  Board  of  Management  is  responsible  for  setting  business objectives and the strategic direction, for coordinating and supervising the  operating  entities,  and  for  implementing  and  overseeing  an appropriate and effective control and risk management system. The Board of Management also prepares the annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, the respective solvency statements, and the interim reports.\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE currently has nine members. As a general rule, its members may not be older than 62. Further information on the members of the Board of Management can be found in Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management. The composition is also available on the Allianz company website , which also provides the CVs of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Board  of  Management  are  jointly responsible for the management of the company and compliance with legal  requirements.  Notwithstanding  this  overall  responsibility,  the individual members independently head the departments assigned to them. They consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management on important issues. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is also responsible for coordinating the departments.",

The latter include, inter alia, Finance, Risk Management and Controlling Functions, Investments, Operations and IT, Human Resources, Legal, Compliance,  Internal  Audit,  and  Mergers  &  Acquisitions.  Business division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or global lines. Rules of procedure specify the inner organization of the Board of Management as well as the departmental responsibilities.\n\nThe meetings of the Board of Management are convened and chaired by the Chairperson. In addition, any member of the Board may request a meeting, stating the proposed subject of discussion. As a rule, a meeting of the Board of Management was held every two weeks in the financial year 2023.\n\nThe Board of Management has a quorum if all members of the Board of Management have been invited to a meeting and at least half its members -  including the Chairperson or a member of the Board of Management appointed by him - attend the meeting. Unless otherwise  stipulated  by  law,  the  full  Board  of  Management  takes decisions with a simple majority of participating members. In the event of  a  tie,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Board  of  Management  has  the deciding vote. The Chairperson can also veto decisions, but he cannot enforce  a  decision  against  the  majority  vote  of  the  Board  of Management.\n\nThe Board of Management has formed committees from among its members. The task of these committees is to coordinate and decide on matters of the Board of Management referred to them, to prepare decisions for the Board of Management reserved to it, and to submit proposals for resolutions. The committees advise the full Board of Management. The responsibilities and composition of the committees are defined in the respective rules of procedure.\n\nIn the financial year 2023, the following Board of Management committees were in place:\n\n## Board committees\n\n| Board committees                                                                                                                                              | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group Finance and Risk Committee  Giulio Terzariol (Chairman),   Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler,  Dr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger,  Christopher Townsend,  Dr. Andreas Wimmer. | Preparing the capital and liquidity  planning for the Group and Allianz SE;  implementing and overseeing the  principles of group-wide capital and  liquidity management; defining risk  standards and preparing the risk  strategy; approving key financial  transactions and pension-related  transactions; preparing guidelines for  derivatives, Group financing and  internal Group capital management  as well as establishing and overseeing |\n| Group IT Committee  (Chairwoman),  Sirma Boshnakova,  Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler,                                                                                 | Developing and proposing a group- wide IT strategy, monitoring its  implementation, and approving local  and group-wide IT investments as well                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Dr. Barbara Karuth-Zelle  Giulio Terzariol,  Dr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger,  Christopher Townsend.

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board has adopted the following diversity concept for the Board of Management of Allianz SE:\n\nFor the composition of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board aims  for  an  adequate  'Diversity  of  Minds'.  This  comprises  broad diversity with regard to gender, internationality, and educational as well as professional background.\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the achievement of such target, inter alia, on the basis of the following specific indicators:\n\n- -adequate proportion of women on the Management Board;\n- -adequate share of members with an international background (e.g., based  on  origin  or  extensive  professional  experience abroad),  ideally  with  connection  to  the  regions  in  which  the Allianz Group is operating;\n- -adequate diversity with regard to educational and professional background, taking into account the limitations for the Supervisory Board by regulatory requirements (fitness).\n\nThis diversity concept is implemented via the appointment procedure for members of the Board of Management by the Supervisory Board. For the purpose of long-term succession planning, a list of candidates is prepared and updated on an ongoing basis by the Chairperson of the Board of Management in consultation with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. It is ensured that lists of successors will comprise appropriate percentages of candidates with international experience. This is especially taken into account by the Personnel Committee in succession  planning.  The  list  of  candidates  includes  internal  and external  candidates  generally  meeting  the  requirements  for  a mandate in the Board of Management. In the event of a vacancy on the  Board  of  Management,  the  Personnel  Committee,  after  a thorough  examination,  recommends  a  suitable  candidate  to  the Supervisory Board plenary session. It also reports on the selection process  and,  if  necessary,  alternative  candidates.  Prior  to  an appointment  to  the  Board  of  Management,  all  members  of  the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to meet the candidate in person.\n\nCurrently, the Board of Management of Allianz SE comprises four female members, accounting for 44.4 %. Four members of the Board of  Management  have  international  backgrounds  based  on  their\n\norigin.  There  is  an  adequate  degree  of  diversity  with  regard  to educational and professional backgrounds. The Board of Management of Allianz SE is thus composed in accordance with the diversity concept.\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  of  Allianz  SE  has  adopted  a  clear  and comprehensible system for the remuneration of the members of the Board  of  Management.  The  Board  of  Management  remuneration system  must  be  submitted  to  the  General  Meeting  for  approval whenever a material amendment is planned to be effected, but at least every four years. The most recent submission of the remuneration system for the Board of Management of Allianz SE to the General Meeting for approval was on 5 May 2021.\n\nIn  addition, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board must  prepare  a  clear  and  comprehensible  annual  report  on  the remuneration of current and former Board members, which must be submitted to the General Meeting for approval each year.\n\nThe current remuneration system for the Board of Management and  the  Remuneration  Report,  including  the  auditor's  report,  are available on the Allianz company website .\n\nThe Board of Management reports regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board on business development, the company's net assets, financial position and earnings, planning and achievement of objectives, business strategy, and risk exposure. Details on the Board of Management's reporting to the Supervisory Board are laid down in the information rules issued by the Supervisory Board.\n\nImportant  decisions  of  the  Board  of  Management  require approval  by  the  Supervisory  Board.  Approval  requirements  are stipulated by law, by the Statutes, or in individual cases by decisions of the  General  Meeting.  Supervisory  Board  approval  is  required,  for example, for certain capital measures, intercompany agreements, and the launch of new business segments or the closure of existing ones. Approval is also required for acquisitions of companies and holdings in companies as well as for divestments of Group companies that exceed certain thresholds. Moreover, the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE in the version dated June 2021 (hereinafter 'SE Agreement') requires the approval of the Supervisory Board  for  the  appointment  of  the  member  of  the  Board  of Management responsible for labor and social affairs.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  oversees  and  advises  the  Board  of Management on managing the business. It is also responsible for appointing the members of the Board of Management, determining their  overall  remuneration,  succession  planning  for  the  Board  of Management,  and  reviewing  Allianz SE's  and  the  Allianz Group's annual financial statements. The Supervisory Board's activities in the financial  year  2023,  including  an  individualized  disclosure  of  the meeting participation, are described in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\nThe  German  Co-Determination  Act ('Mitbestimmungsgesetz') does not apply to Allianz SE because it has the legal form of a European Company (SE). Instead, the size and composition of the Supervisory Board  is  determined  by  general  European  SE  regulations.  These regulations are implemented  in the Statutes and via the SE Agreement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board comprises twelve members, including six shareholder representatives appointed by the General Meeting. The six employee representatives are appointed by the SE Works Council. The specific procedure for their appointment is laid down in the SE Agreement, which stipulates that the six employee representatives must be allocated in proportion to the number of Allianz employees in the different countries. The Supervisory Board currently in office includes four employee representatives from Germany -  including one trade union representative - and one each from France and Italy. According to \u00a7 17 (2) SEAG, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE shall comprise at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. The regular term of  appointment  for  the  members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  of Allianz SE  is four years. Moreover, a staggered board with different appointment  periods  was  introduced  with  the  elections  to  the Supervisory Board on 4 May 2022.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board is presented in the Supervisory  Board  Report.  Further  information  on  the  Supervisory Board members is presented in Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management. Furthermore, the composition and a general description of the operations of the Supervisory Board are available on the Allianz company website , which also provides the CVs of the Supervisory Board members.",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board takes all decisions with a simple majority. The special requirements for appointing members to the Board of Management, as stipulated in the German Co-Determination Act, and the requirement to have a Conciliation Committee, do not apply to an SE. In the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who - at Allianz SE - must be a shareholder representative. If there is a tie and the Chairperson is not present, the casting vote lies with the vice chairperson elected at the shareholder representatives' proposal. A second vice chairperson is elected at the employee representatives' proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities and the activities of its committees in the framework of a so-called self-assessment. The self-assessment is carried out either by means of an internal questionnaire or by consulting an external consultant. In 2023, the self-assessment was carried out using an internal  questionnaire.  The  Supervisory  Board  plenary  session discusses recommendations for improvements and adopts appropriate measures on the basis of recommendations from the Standing  Committee.  In  addition,  the  fitness  and  propriety  of  the individual members of the Supervisory Board are reviewed as part of an  annual  self-evaluation  required  by  supervisory  law,  and  a development plan for the Supervisory Board is drawn up on this basis. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee also hold regular sessions that are not attended by any of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nPart of the Supervisory Board's work is carried out by its committees. The Supervisory Board receives regular reports on the activities of its committees. The composition of committees and the tasks assigned to them are governed by the Supervisory Board's Rules of Procedure, which can be found on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n## Standing Committee\n\n## 5 members\n\n- -

        "page_content": "## Objectives for the composition of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board\n\n'The aim of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board is to have members who are equipped with the necessary skills and competence to properly supervise and advise Allianz SE's management. Supervisory Board candidates should possess the professional expertise and experience, integrity, motivation and commitment, independence, and personality required to successfully carry out the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board member in a financial services institution with international operations. These objectives take into account the regulatory requirements for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the relevant recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('GCGC'). In addition to the requirements for each individual member, a profile of skills and expertise ('Kompetenzprofil') as well as a diversity concept are provided for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\n## I. Requirements relating to the individual members of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Propriety\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must be proper as defined by the regulatory provisions. A person is assumed to be proper as long as no facts are to be known which may cause impropriety. Therefore, no personal circumstances shall exist which - according to general experience - lead to the assumption that the diligent and orderly exercise of the mandate may be affected (in particular, administrative offenses or violation of criminal law, especially in connection with commercial activity).\n\n## 2. Fitness\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must have the expertise and experience necessary for a diligent and autonomous exercise of the Allianz SE Supervisory Board mandate, in particular for exercising control of and giving advice to the Management Board as well as for the active support of the development of the company. This comprises in particular:\n\n- -  adequate expertise in all business areas,\n- -  adequate expertise in the insurance and finance sector or comparable relevant experience and expertise in other sectors,\n- -  adequate expertise in the regulatory provisions material for Allianz SE (supervisory law,\n- including Solvency II regulation, corporate and capital markets law, corporate governance),\n- -ability to assess the business risks,\n- -  knowledge of accounting basics and insurance specific risk management basics.\n\n## 3. Independence\n\nThe GCGC defines a person as independent who, in particular, does not have any business or personal relations with Allianz SE or its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder, or an enterprise associated with the latter, which may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE states the following with regard to the further specification of independence:\n\n- -  Former members of the Allianz SE Management Board shall not be deemed independent\n- during the mandatory corporate law cooling-off period.\n- -  Members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in office for more than 12 years shall not be deemed independent.\n- -  Regarding employee representatives, the mere fact of employee representation and the existence of a working relationship with the company shall not itself affect the independence of the employee representatives.\n\nApplying such definition, at least eight members of the Supervisory Board shall be independent. In case shareholder representatives and employee representatives are viewed separately, at least four of each should be independent.\n\nIt has to be considered that the possible emergence of conflicts of interests in individual cases cannot generally be excluded. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board and will be resolved by appropriate measures.\n\n## 4. Time of availability\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must ensure that he/she has sufficient time to dedicate to the proper fulfillment of the mandate of this Supervisory Board position.\n\nIn addition to the mandatory mandate limitations and the GCGC recommendation for active Management Board members of listed companies (max. two mandates), the common capital markets requirements shall be considered.\n\nWith regard to the Allianz SE mandate, the members shall take into account that:\n\n- -  at least four, but as a rule six, ordinary Supervisory Board meetings are held each year, each of which requires adequate preparation,\n- -  sufficient time must be set aside for the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements,\n- -  participation in the General Meeting is required,\n- -depending on possible membership in one or more of the Supervisory Board Committees, extra time planning is required for participation in these Committee meetings and to do the necessary preparation for these meetings; this applies in particular for the Audit and Risk Committee,\n\nEmployee representation within Allianz SE, according to the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE, contributes to the diversity of work experience and cultural background. Pursuant to the provisions of the German SE Participation Act (SEBG), the number of women and men appointed as German employee representatives should be proportional to the number of women and men working in the German companies. However, the Supervisory Board does not have the right to select the employee representatives.\n\nThe following requirements and objectives apply to the composition of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board:\n\n- - attendance of extraordinary meetings of the Supervisory Board or of a Committee might be required to deal with special matters.\n\n## 5. Retirement age\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board shall, as a rule, not be older than 70 years of age.\n\n## 6. Term of membership\n\nThe continuous period of membership for any member of the Supervisory Board should, as a rule, not exceed 12 years.\n\n## 7. Former Allianz SE Management Board members\n\nFormer Allianz SE Management Board members are subject to the mandatory corporate law cooling-off period of two years. According to regulatory provisions, no more than two former Allianz SE Management Board members shall be members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nII. Requirements for the entire Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Profile of skills and expertise for the entire Supervisory Board\n\nIn addition to the expertise-related requirements for the individual members, the following shall apply with respect to the expertise and experience of the entire Supervisory Board:\n\n- -  familiarity of members in their entirety with the insurance and financial services sector,\n- -  adequate expertise of the entire Board with respect to regulatorily required areas of investment management, insurance actuarial practice, accounting,\n- -  adequate expertise of the entire Board with respect to technology, including cybersecurity, employee engagement and sustainability (especially Environment, Social responsibility and Governance as well as data privacy),\n- -  at least one member with considerable experience in the insurance and financial services fields,\n- -  at least one member with comprehensive expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other member with comprehensive expertise in the field of auditing. The expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance,\n- -  at least one member with comprehensive expertise in the field of digital transformation,\n- -  specialist expertise or experience in other economic sectors,\n- -  managerial or operational experience.\n\n## 2. Diversity concept\n\nTo promote an integrative cooperation among the Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board strives for an adequate diversity with respect to gender, internationality, different occupational backgrounds, professional expertise, and experience:\n\n- -  The Supervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. The representation of women is generally considered to be the joint responsibility of the shareholder and employee representatives.\n- -  At least four of the members must, on the basis of their origin or function, represent regions or cultural areas in which Allianz SE conducts significant business.\n- -For Allianz SE as a Societas Europaea, the agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE provides that Allianz employees from different E.U. member states are considered in the allocation of employee representatives' Supervisory Board seats.\n- -  In order to provide the Board with the most diverse sources of experience and specialist knowledge possible, the members of the Supervisory Board shall complement each other with respect to their background, professional experience, and specialist knowledge.'",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board pursues these objectives, and thus also the diversity  concept,  when  nominating  candidates  for  shareholder representatives. As employee representatives are appointed according to different national provisions, the potential to influence the selection of employee representatives is limited.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is composed in accordance with these objectives, including the diversity concept:\n\nAccording  to  the  assessment  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  all shareholder  representatives  -  i.e.,  Ms.  Boissard,  Ms.  Bosse,  Ms. Chatterjee as well as Mr. Diekmann, Dr. Eichiner and Mr. Hainer - are independent within the meaning of the objectives (see No. I.3).\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee as a whole are familiar with the sector in which  the  company  operates.  All  shareholder representatives on the Audit Committee, including the Chairperson of the  Committee,  have  comprehensive  expertise  in  the  fields  of\n\naccounting  and  auditing.  The  expertise  in  the  field  of  accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting  principles  and  internal  control  and  risk  management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit.\n\nThe Chairperson of the Audit Committee, Dr. Eichiner, is a business administration  graduate.  He  gained  extensive  knowledge  and experience in both accounting and auditing during his many years as Chief Financial Officer of a DAX-listed company. Ms. Boissard  also acquired extensive knowledge and experience in both of these areas during her many years as a member of the Audit Committee and as part of her role as CEO of Korian S.A.. Finally, Mr. Diekmann also has in-depth knowledge and experience in both areas due to his many\n\nyears  of  service  first  as  CEO  and  later  as  Chairperson  of  the Supervisory Board and long-standing member of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nThe  employee  representatives  on  the  Audit  Committee,  Ms. Grundler  and  Mr.  Le  Goa\u00ebr,  also  have  expertise  in  the  fields  of accounting and auditing due to their long-standing membership of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nWith five female and seven male Supervisory Board members, the gender ratio of 30 % required under the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions is met.

        "page_content": "The remuneration of the Supervisory Board is laid down in the Statutes of  Allianz SE.  The  most  recent  resolution  on  Supervisory  Board remuneration  was  passed  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on 4 May 2023.  The  corresponding  resolution  of  the  Annual  General Meeting and the Remuneration Report, including the auditor's report, are available at the Allianz company website .\n\n## General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the General Meeting. The General Meeting  elects  the  shareholder  representatives  of  the  Supervisory Board and decides on the approval of the actions taken by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. It decides, in particular, on the appropriation of net earnings, capital measures, the election of the auditor, and approval of intercompany agreements. It also decides on the approval of the remuneration system for  the  members  of  the Board  of  Management  presented  by  the  Supervisory  Board,  the remuneration  of  the  Supervisory  Board,  the  approval  of  the Remuneration Report prepared by the Board of Management and the Supervisory  Board,  as  well  as  changes  to  the  Company's  Statutes. Resolutions of the General Meeting shall be passed, unless mandatory legal provisions require otherwise, by a simple majority of the votes cast. In accordance  with  European  regulations and  the  Statutes, amendments to the Statutes require at least a two-thirds majority of the votes cast if less than half of the share capital is represented at the General  Meeting.  In  addition,  such  resolutions  require  the  simple majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution, unless  higher  thresholds  are  stipulated  by  law.  When  adopting resolutions, each share confers one vote.\n\nEach year, an Annual General Meeting is held, at which the Board of  Management  and  Supervisory  Board  give  an  account  of  the preceding financial year. For special circumstances, the German Stock Corporation  Act  provides  for  the  convening  of  an  Extraordinary General Meeting. If authorized by the Statutes, general meetings can also be held in virtual format.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nThe  Allianz Group has an appropriate and effective internal control system  for  reviewing  and  monitoring  its  operating  activities  and business  processes,  in  particular  financial  reporting,  as  well  as compliance with regulatory requirements. The requirements placed on the internal control system are essential, not only for the resilience and value of the company, but also to retain the confidence of the capital market,  our  customers,  and  the  public.  An  assessment  of  the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the System of Governance is conducted regularly in the course of the review of the business organization.\n\nIn addition, the Allianz Group has implemented an appropriate and effective framework and measures to identify, assess, manage, and communicate risks. For further information on the internal control system and risk management system of Allianz, please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nIntegrity is at the core of our compliance programs and underpins the trust  of  our  customers,  shareholders,  business  partners,  and employees. The Compliance function fosters a corporate culture of individual  and  collective  responsibility  for  ethical  conduct  and adherence  to the rules. For further information on the compliance management  system  of  Allianz,  please  refer  to  the  Non-Financial Statement.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nOur  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  internal  compliance  policies  and guidelines derived from it provide all employees, managers, and executive board members with clear and practical guidance, enabling them to act in line with the values of the Allianz Group. The rules of conduct established by the Code of Conduct are binding for all employees worldwide and form the basis for our compliance programs. The Code of Conduct is available on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Directors' Dealings\n\nMembers of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as persons closely associated with them, are obliged by the E.U. Market Abuse Regulation to notify both Allianz SE and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of any transactions carried out by them involving shares or debt securities of Allianz SE  or related financial derivatives or other related financial instruments as soon as the value of the acquisition or disposal transactions by the member reaches or exceeds \u20ac 20 thou in total within a calendar year. These disclosures are published on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Accounting and auditing\n\nThe Allianz Group prepares its accounts according to \u00a7 315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  German  law  and accounting standards.\n\nThe auditor of the annual financial statements and the auditor in charge of the review of the half-yearly financial report were elected by the  Annual  General  Meeting  on  4 May 2023.  The  audit  of  the financial  statements  covers  the  individual financial statements of Allianz SE and  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the Allianz Group. In addition, the auditor audits the (Group) Management  Report,  including  the  Non-Financial  Statement.  In accordance with regulatory requirements, the solvency statements are also audited by the auditor, who also has to audit the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Non-Financial Statement and the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 were also subjected to a substantive audit by the auditor, in addition to the statutory audit scope.",

The annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, and the respective Management Reports are made publicly available within 90 days of the end of each financial year. Additional information is provided  in  the  Allianz Group's  half-yearly  financial  reports  and quarterly  statements.  Information  is  also  made  available  at  the Annual  General  Meeting,  at  conference  calls  for  analysts  and journalists, and on the corporate website. The Allianz company website also  provides  a  financial  calendar  listing  the  dates  of  major publications  and  events,  such  as  annual  reports,  half-yearly financial  reports,  quarterly  statements,  Annual  General  Meetings, and analyst conference calls as well as financial press conferences.\n\n## Information in accordance with the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and the Public Sectors\n\nThe section below outlines the targets set for Allianz SE and the other companies of the Allianz Group  in Germany that are subject to co-\n\ndetermination  (the  'subsidiaries  concerned')  for  the  Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the two management levels below the Board of Management.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 17 (2) SEAG, the share of women and men among the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has to be at least 30 % each. The Supervisory Board fulfills this requirement as it includes five women (41.7 %) and seven men (58.3 %).\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 16 (2) SEAG, it has to be ensured that the Board of Management includes at least one female and at least one male member when appointing members to the Board of Management. This statutory requirement is met by the current Board of Management of Allianz SE. As at 31 December 2023, the proportion of women on the  Board  of  Management  was  33.3 %.  Since  1 January 2024,  the proportion of women on the Board of Management has been 44.4 %.\n\nWith regard to the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of Management  has  set  targets  of  30 %  for  each,  to  be  met  by 31 December 2024. As at 31 December 2023, this target was already met for the first management level with a percentage of women of 34.2 %, but was not yet met for the second level with a percentage of 28.6 %.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  Supervisory  Boards  of  the  subsidiaries concerned, the target quotas for nine of those eleven subsidiaries were set at 33 %, the target quota for one subsidiary concerned was set at 35 %, and the target quota for the remaining subsidiary concerned was\n\nset at 50 % for 31 December 2024. Eight of the eleven subsidiaries reached this target ahead of the due date as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe target quotas for the respective Boards of Management of the subsidiaries concerned were between 25 % and 50 % (35.7 % on average) for 31 December 2024 and were already met by eight of the eleven  companies  as  of  31 December 2023.  For  the  subsidiaries concerned, the respective Boards of Management have set target quotas of 30 % to 40 % (32.9 % on average) for 31 December 2024 for the first management level and target quotas of 30 % to 43.5 % (39.2 % on average) for the second management level below the Board of Management.  Due  to  internal  restructurings,  one  of  the  eleven subsidiaries no longer has any employees below the level of the Board of  Management.  Therefore,  reference  will  only  be  made  to  ten subsidiaries in the following paragraph.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the targets were met by four of the ten subsidiaries concerned for the first management level, while two of the ten companies met the target set for the second management level ahead of the due date. Despite increased efforts to promote women in  the  Allianz Group  and  in  the  individual  subsidiaries,  it  was  not possible to reach the targets ahead of the due date in the other cases as it was not always possible to identify suitable female candidates for all vacant positions. Allianz continues to work to achieve these targets.",

The core objectives of the Group Sustainability Board are: preparing the overall framework for sustainability for the Allianz Group, integrating sustainability into the Group's business processes with Allianz as an organization (operations and organization) and Allianz as a financial institution (investments, insurance,  asset  management),  and  maintaining  oversight  of  and steering overarching sustainability matters.\n\nAllianz established a Sustainability Committee (as a committee of  the  Supervisory  Board)  to  strengthen  the  integration  and implementation  of  our  sustainability  strategy  throughout  the organization and business functions.\n\nThe  core  objectives  of  the  Sustainability  Committee  include: advising  the  Supervisory  Board  on  sustainability-related  issues  to support  economically  sound  and  sustainable  development  and positioning of the Allianz Group, closely monitoring and supporting oversight  of  the  Management  Board's  sustainability  strategy,  in particular the management and execution of the strategic framework for group-wide sustainability measures and conducting preliminary examination  of  the  sustainability-related  disclosures,  including  the\n\nnon-financial statement as part of the Supervisory Board's review. It also  supports  the  Personnel  Committee  in  the  preparation  of  the sustainability-related target setting, as well as the review of the set targets'  fulfillment  for  the  Management  Board's  remuneration.  In 2023, the Sustainability Committee prepared the recommendation of the sustainability-related targets for the members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE, reviewed the respective achievements of the  Board  of  Management,  and  gave  its  recommendation  to  the Personnel  Committee  of  the  Supervisory  Board.  The  Sustainability Committee  was  kept  informed  on  the  sustainability  strategy  and provided advice and guidance on critical issues.\n\nGlobal Sustainability was established in 2021 and supports the Group Sustainability Board in the execution of its responsibilities. This includes  preparation,  coordination,  and  implementation  of  the decisions by the Group Sustainability Board. It supports Allianz's Group Centers  and  operating  entities  to  effectively  integrate  the  Group's sustainability  strategy  into  their  business  processes  and  policy framework. Global Sustainability drives the integration of sustainability-related matters across the organization and business to ensure Allianz plays a role in shaping the societies and economies in which it operates.\n\nGroup Centers take responsibility for sustainability within their functions with the purpose of embedding sustainability across the Allianz  organization and business. Global Sustainability and Group Centers work with an extensive network of sustainability and business experts located across Allianz's operating entities, globally providing guidance  and  setting  minimum  standards  to  ensure  they  embed sustainability  in  their  strategies  and  approaches.  This  network\n\nsupports  implementation  of  the  group-wide  sustainability  strategy, shares  best  practice  and  scales  positive  impacts  across  the organization.\n\nOther Board of Management committees play an important role in decision-making processes:\n\n- -The Group Finance and Risk Committee oversees risk management and monitoring, including sustainability risk.\n- -The Group Underwriting Committee monitors the underwriting business, its risk management and development of underwriting policies and  strategies. This includes the integration of sustainability into these processes and strategies.\n- -The Group  Investment  Committee focuses  on  fundamental investment-related topics, including sustainability-related matters.\n\nWhile many operating entities (OEs) had already established local responsibilities  for  sustainability  integration,  this  was  formalized during 2023 with mandatory roles. Each OE must nominate one Board member to be responsible for sustainability, who will be supported by at least one Sustainability Lead.\n\nIn 2023 and for 2024, the targets for the Board of Management have been further developed to reflect sustainability priorities. The table  below  describes  the  targets  in  more  detail.  Minor  wording changes were applied compared to the publications last year to create consistency  with  the  Allianz SE  Board  Member  target  letters.  The underlying targets remain unchanged compared to last year.",

These KPIs are also used for steering local  entities.  For  further  information  on  the  remuneration  system, please  refer  to  the  Remuneration  Report.  In  addition  to  these sustainability-related targets, we also describe objectives and actions which  help  further  strengthen  our  sustainability  approach  to  the matters described in this chapter.\n\n## Target and achievements: sustainability ratings\n\n| Rating                | Board targets 2023   | Achievements 2023   | Achievements 2023    |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| DJSI/ S&P  Global CSA | Top 5                | 3rd 1               | (2022: 3rd)          |\n| MSCI 2                | AA - AAA             |                     | AA        (2022: AA) |\n\nHaving an in-depth understanding and being able to appropriately respond to the changing context in which we operate is fundamental to us, both to have a positive impact and to manage any potentially adverse impacts. To this end and to stay abreast of the trends that are most relevant to our stakeholders and our business, as well as to align our sustainability strategy, implementation measures, and reporting, we assess the materiality of sustainability matters on a regular basis.\n\nIn  2023,  we  carried  out  a  robust  and  comprehensive  double materiality assessment process (in accordance with the CSRD) and accompanying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) 1 , accounting for the evolving methodology to cover financial materiality (risks  and  opportunities  from  a  business  perspective)  and  impact materiality (impacts on people and planet). This has allowed us to deepen our understanding of matters previously identified as being material to our key stakeholders. It also enabled us to extend our assessment to those sustainability matters that have not been focus\n\nareas  so  far,  but  are  now  moving  more  into  focus,  as  data, methodologies, and overall research and regulatory guidance evolve. The process, methodology, and outcome of the double materiality assessment were thoroughly reviewed and endorsed by our Group Sustainability  Board  and  the  Board  of  Management.  In  addition, Board  of  Management  approval  has  been  granted  via  the Allianz Group Annual Report sign-off process.\n\nThe CSRD double materiality assessment (CSRD DMA) will form the basis of our future reporting and will be reviewed annually. It has also been used to test our 2021 materiality assessment, which was based on the GRI Standards. This GRI materiality assessment, which identified 19 material issues, is still applicable. Topics were ranked and presented in  a  materiality  matrix  based  on  key  stakeholder  views  on  their importance to society and our business. The  highest-ranked topics under the GRI materiality assessment were:\n\n- -Climate change,\n- -Ethics and responsible business,\n- -Cybersecurity.\n\nFor further details on the GRI materiality assessment, please refer to the '06.6' section in the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the\n\n## Allianz company website .\n\nThe CSRD DMA confirms the relevance of the previously identified topics. In addition, it forms the basis for introducing further topics to our  sustainability  reporting  going  forward,  primarily  from  more broadly  looking  into  impacts  in  the  value  chain.  Regarding sustainability-related risks, the CSRD DMA does not identify additional principal risks with expected significant adverse impacts on Allianz (as according to the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch HGB). For further information on (potential) sustainability-related risks, please refer to the section 'Outlook'.\n\nWhile taxation is not covered under CSRD, it remains a relevant topic for Allianz in 2023 under the NFRD and is reported based on GRI 207-Tax. The respective information can be found in the section '04.5' in  our  Group  Sustainability  Report  2023  on  the Allianz  company website as well as in our Group Tax Strategy published separately on the Allianz company website .\n\nPartnerships  also  remain  a  relevant  topic;  going  forward, respective details will be covered under the CSRD topic to which a partnership relates.\n\nThe  topics  'Climate  change'  (ESRS  E1)  and  'Own  workforce' (ESRS S1) are strategic sustainability focus areas at the Allianz Group, supported by the GRI materiality assessment and confirmed by the CSRD DMA. As such, we chose to already converge towards the CSRD with our financial year 2023 reporting for these two topics, in terms of anticipating its structural and many of its content requirements. For all material matters, disclosures in accordance with the topical ESRS and the cross-cutting ESRS will be fully covered as per the CSRD as of financial  year  2024  reporting.  As  at  financial  year-end  2023,  the stakeholder engagement process was still ongoing, so that reporting on this process and reflection of the results will be introduced next year.\n\nFor a description of the CSRD DMA process and outcome for the financial year 2023, please refer to the section 'Outlook'.\n\nOur purpose drives our sustainability priorities. This means supporting the transformation of economies that do not breach environmental barriers.  It  also  means  aspiring  to  achieve  a  social  minimum  for everyone. Building on our business strategy, we have set sustainability priorities that reflect our values and the areas where we think we can make an impact across Environment, Social, and Governance (E, S, and G).\n\nWe prioritize three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the integration of sustainability across Allianz and help us to contribute  to  societal,  environmental,  and  economic  change.  In addition to SDG 13, Climate action, we have chosen SDG 8, Decent work  and  economic  growth,  to  guide  our  work.  We  believe  that delivering the sustainability agenda is only possible if stakeholders work together. This is why we also prioritize SDG 17, Partnership for the goals.\n\nEnvironment : our  priority  is Climate  action/SDG  13.  Our businesses spanning insurance, investment, and asset management are focused on understanding and shaping the climate transformation.",

        "page_content": "Social : our priority is Decent work and economic growth/SDG 8, including education upskilling and employability. We want to  be a partner to our stakeholders, among them customers, governments, regulators, and societies. Our goal is to support the next generations and  persons  with  disabilities  so  that  they  can  access  high-quality employment. Investing in learning and development for our diverse workforce is key to making all of this happen in a changing world of work.\n\nGovernance : our  priority  is  to  create  trust  through  strong leadership.  We  aspire  to  be  a  trusted  partner  for  protecting  and growing  our  stakeholders'  most  valuable  assets.  Against  that background, strong leadership is a key contributor to a company's culture and governance.\n\nIn everything we do across our priorities of E, S, and G, we strive to embed the sustainability principles and activities that are outlined in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\nWe ground our strategy in proactive risk management to detect and address risks across the businesses. Group Risk is responsible for this process. We have not identified any remaining principal risks resulting from our operations, business activities, and business relations that could have severe adverse effects on material non-financial matters. Any  potential  risks  and  impacts  identified  throughout  our  risk assessment have been addressed by the respective concepts we have in place, which we describe in this report.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding sustainability issues allows us to reduce risks and capture opportunities in  underwriting,  claims,  proprietary  investment  management,  and asset management. For further information on climate-related risks, please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report. Our concepts for all other matters for which reporting is required will be addressed in subsequent  sections.  The  ESG  approach  provides  part  of  the foundation  for these concepts  and  is  managed  by  Global Sustainability.\n\nWe  continue  to  expand  and  strengthen  our  sustainability  risk management  framework.  Understanding  the  requirements  and limitations  of  our  operating  entities  helps  us  to  develop  global sustainability processes that can be integrated into local processes and systems.\n\nOur commitment to tackling sustainability topics applies to our own operations and our insurance, investment, and asset management activities.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding and  addressing  sustainability  issues  helps  us  to  reduce  risks  and capitalize on impacts and opportunities in all areas of our business.\n\nAs well as managing risks, sustainability integration directs us to create products and services that add value to society. We collaborate with clients and investee companies to deliver real-world benefits, and channel  capital  flows  towards  sustainable  outcomes  for  all stakeholders.\n\n## Sustainability opportunities and risks\n\nAs an insurance company that manages risks ranging from single events  to  decades,  it  is  important  for  Allianz  to  make  a  holistic assessment of risk.\n\nIn the Allianz Group Risk Policy, we define sustainability risks as events or conditions that could have significant negative impacts on the assets, liabilities, profitability, or reputation of the Allianz Group or one of its companies. Examples include environmental and climate change risks, human rights violations, risks to local communities, and workforce risks.\n\nIf sustainability risks are not identified and managed effectively, they can have significant repercussions for Allianz and our customers, suppliers, investee companies  and  other  stakeholders  These repercussions  include  impacts  on  our  reputation,  supply  chains, business continuity, quality, operations, and finances.\n\nBy  screening  insurance,  investment, and  asset  management projects from a sustainability perspective, we extend our understanding of risks and can exploit potential business opportunities to benefit shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders.\n\n## Our group-wide rules and processes\n\nOur group-wide corporate rules and sustainability processes apply to all  relevant  underwriting,  proprietary  investment,  and  operations activities. They  require  strong  collaboration  between  relevant functions and business areas.\n\nKey processes are included in the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting and Allianz ESG Functional  Rule  for  Investments.  A  new  corporate  rule,  the  Allianz Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS), captures and updates some of the sustainability components of the AS RRIM in effect from 1 January 2024.\n\nThe publicly available Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework provides transparency around our sustainability-related processes  and  guidelines.  We  published  the  fifth  version  of  the Framework in 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\nOur asset management units have developed processes, rules, and governance for integrating sustainability into their investment activities.\n\nConsistent  application  of  sustainability  processes  in  our  own business operations, insurance, and proprietary investment activities is crucial  to  mitigate  risks  and  exploit  the  opportunities  from  the transition to a sustainable economy and society. It is also essential to our transformation into a sustainable financial service provider.\n\n## Regulation as a driver of sustainability integration\n\nWe  welcome  sustainability  regulation  as  a  major  driver  for  fair competition  and  a  level  playing  field. We  believe  that  sound regulation  can  improve  the  structure  and  clarity  of  sustainability information.\n\nIn 2023, we also actively engaged in and supported regulatory developments.  For  example,  we  are  a  member  of  the  European Commission's Platform on Sustainable Finance and have contributed to  the  work  of  the  European  Financial  Reporting  Advisory  Group (EFRAG) on EU sustainability reporting standards. Until April 2022, we did this via in-kind membership of the Project Task Force on European Sustainability Reporting Standards (PTF-ESRS). Since May 2022, when the new EFRAG governance was set up, our contribution has been via an in-kind membership representing the EU insurance industry in the Sustainability Reporting Technical Expert Group (SR TEG).\n\nIn this context, Allianz aims to contribute expert input with respect to  the  insurance  industry,  such  as  on  the  dual  role  of  insurers  as preparers and users of sustainability information, as well as on existing interconnected regulation.",

        "page_content": "We  aim  to  leverage  regulation  on  sustainability  by  ensuring consistent implementation across all Allianz businesses. At the same time, we aim to build business opportunities in line with regulatory concepts.\n\nAllianz  has  established  a  Sustainable  Finance  Regulation implementation project at Group level to drive this. Internal guidance is designed in close interaction with Group Centers and Operating Entities, to ensure consistent interpretation and implementation. The focus  in  2023  was  on  the  implementation  of  Sustainable  Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), namely regarding pre-contractual and periodic  product  disclosure  as  well  as  website  disclosure  in consideration of 'Principal Adverse Impact' for the Life-Asset product offering.\n\nIn 2023, Allianz started convergence into future CSRD reporting with a respective implementation project. The project is managed by the Group Accounting and Reporting function and defines policies, processes and reporting content in line with future ESRS requirements. The Group Sustainability Board oversees progress and deliverables of the project and provides directional guidance. The CSRD project is underpinned by the ambition to implement ESRS requirements with the same quality and diligence as for financial reporting processes.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nHuman-made climate change, one of the greatest global challenges of our time, has already caused far-reaching negative consequences and losses for nature and people. Various human and natural systems are  being  stressed  beyond  the  limits  of  their  adaptive  capacity. Therefore, irreversible damage has already started to occur.\n\nIn order  to  mitigate  these  developments,  the  2015  Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5 \u00b0C by the end of the century. This has resulted in a fixed greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) budget; i.e., an upper limit for global emissions that may still be released. Based on modeled emission pathways from the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report , emissions need to be almost halved every decade to restrict warming to 1.5 \u00b0C with limited or no overshoot, with a 50 % probability of success. This would allow carbon (CO2) emissions to reach net-zero by 2050, meaning that residual emissions would be balanced by atmospheric carbon removal. Climate scientists estimate\n\nthat halting GHG emissions on a net level would subsequently put a stop to further warming.\n\nIn  2022,  however,  annual  energy-related  carbon  emissions reached a record level of 37 billion tons according to the International Energy Agency . If current trends continue, the GHG budget will be exceeded way before 2030 and the target of 1.5 \u00b0C will be overshot significantly. This increases the need for an even more rapid transition later on, as well as the use of atmospheric carbon removal -  i.e., negative emission solutions - to bring warming back to 1.5 \u00b0C by the end of this century. Recent research has shown this is still possible but requires urgent action by companies and policymakers alike.\n\nOur  approach to climate change is grounded  in the Allianz Group Climate Change Strategy. First published in 2005, it steers our response to climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities in our insurance and investment business. Since 2015, the Climate Change Strategy has been built around our efforts to anticipate climate risks, care for our customers, and enable the net-zero transition.\n\nSince 2018, our Climate Change Strategy has committed us to contribute to pursuing efforts that limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C by the end of the century. To anticipate and enable this transition, Allianz has committed to net-zero greenhouse gases (GHG) for our proprietary investments, Property-Casualty insurance, and our own operations. In September 2023,  we  published  our  Inaugural  Net-Zero  Transition Plan  on  the Allianz company  website , which  describes  our intermediary targets for 2030 and key actions to achieve them. This approach builds on the previously released 2025 emissions targets for proprietary investments and own operations.\n\nOur  priorities  include  quantitative  emission  targets,  strategic growth  of  financing  and  insuring  of  low-carbon  technologies  that support net-zero, targeted restrictions for fossil fuel-based business models  to  manage  transition  risks,  and  a  systemic  approach  to investee  engagement  and  policy  advocacy,  supported  by  climate action in our own operations.\n\nThese elements, which address the impacts, risks, and opportunities of climate change, are explained in more detail in the subsequent sections on insurance, investments, own operations, and risks. Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition toward net-zero.\n\nSince the net-zero transition is a systemic issue, it requires a wholeof-society response. Therefore, we are also seeking to join forces with other stakeholders. Our approach on the investment side builds on the work  of  the  U.N.-convened  Net-Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance,  which Allianz co-founded and currently chairs. Furthermore, we encourage companies to implement net-zero strategies via our participation in The B Team, Climate Action 100+, the Transition Pathway Initiative, and the Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nFor  further  information  and  a  full  list  of  sustainability  related memberships,  please  refer  to  the  section  '06.3'  in  our  Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website.\n\n## Climate-related opportunities\n\nOur materiality analysis under CSRD  found  climate-related opportunities to be material for the Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary  investments.  Our  business  strategy  and  our  net-zero transition plan aim to systematically leverage opportunities to finance and insure a low-carbon and climate-resilient future, e.g., by investing in  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency  in  real  estate,  and  electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nWe have strategically insured and invested in low-carbon assets for over a decade. With our 2023 Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan, we  have  also  set  quantitative  targets  for  investing  and  insuring solutions that are needed in the net-zero transition. Our Sustainable Solutions program provides products and services that aim to create positive  impacts  with  our  (re-)insurance  activities  and  investments. Growing sustainable solutions is among the topics included in the annual financial planning processes of our operating entities, in order to systematically identify growth and profitability potential. For further information on sustainable solutions, please refer to the section EU Taxonomy for non-life insurance.\n\nWe believe our intermediate climate targets will help us realize growth potential. For commercial insurance in particular, our transition plan includes a target to achieve 150 % profitable growth in revenues from renewable energy and low-carbon technology solutions by 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Climate policy dialogue\n\nWe can achieve our targets only jointly with public policy and the real economy,  as  the  necessary  changes  require  broad  support.  For instance, sufficient frameworks and market incentives are required to bring down demand for emission-intensive products and to allocate capital  in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory. The private sector, including insurers, can play an important role in raising awareness and making the business case for getting on track to limit global warming. To that end,  we  also  work  with  policymakers  and  regulators  to  support sustainable financing and achieve the goals laid down in the Paris Agreement.  We  are  advocating  for  global  effective  climate  policy which should achieve the following:\n\n- -Embedding  'net-zero by 2050' in short and long-term governmental climate targets, climate strategies, and emissions reduction plans, following the latest climate science in line with pathways of no or low overshoot of a 1.5 \u00b0C temperature rise.\n- -Developing sector policies to promote a swift and socially fair transition,  including  the  development  of  more  granular  short-, medium- and long-term net-zero infrastructure plans.\n- -Implementing stringent carbon pricing to internalize the external costs of pollution, including a phase-out of direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies.\n- -Protecting  nature  and  supporting  regenerative  forestry  and agriculture. Supporting and redirecting fossil fuel-related subsidies to scale up new technologies that will provide solutions in hard-to-abate sectors, e.g., carbon capture and storage, and green hydrogen.\n- -Promoting  mandatory  assured  climate  disclosure,  including transition plans, GHG emissions, associated reduction targets, and alignment with 1.5 \u00b0C trajectories, ideally aligned internationally.\n- -Ensuring sustainable finance regulation that provides a defined, science-based, and reliable framework via a common taxonomy of sustainability, clarification of asset managers' duties, inclusion of sustainability in prudential regulation, and  enhanced transparency of corporate reporting.\n\n## 1.5 \u00b0C alignment of targets\n\nOur emission targets are aligned with credible, science-backed climate scenarios - such as those provided by the IPCC 1 -  that limit global warming in 2100 to 1.5 \u00b0C with only a limited or no overshoot of this temperature during this century. While the individual scenarios differ in  their  assumptions  and  narratives,  they  agree  on  a  necessary emission reduction range for CO2 emissions of 36 % to 69 % from 2020 to 2030, with a median reduction of 48 %. 2 All our existing sub-portfolio targets with a global focus are in line with this. For our motor retail portfolio,  the  targeted  reductions,  which  apply  to  nine  European markets, are aligned with respective net-zero pathways. 3\n\nOur target year 2030 is defined as year-end 2029. Our base years for  the  2030  targets  in  proprietary  investments  and  operations continue to be the base year 2019 (building on existing 2025 targets). This also allows us to filter out the temporary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach taken for our P&C insurance targets was to focus on the most recent year for which data was available, this being 2022.\n\n## Decarbonization levers\n\nFor  our  portfolio  targets,  there  are  generally  two  levers  for decarbonization, that is reducing GHG emissions: either our portfolio companies - i.e., the customers we insure or the companies we invest in - reduce their GHG emissions, or we change the composition of our portfolio over time.\n\nThe former relies directly on GHG emission reductions in the real economy, which is not under our control. The latter can also occur naturally as part of typical insurance and investment business cycles in different lines of business, sectors, and individual customers, and is generally more under our control.\n\nWe aim to achieve GHG emission reductions through actions such as  engaging  customers,  increasing  exposures  to  lower-carbon business, and setting targets for lower-carbon technologies, as well as reducing our exposure to defined fossil-fuel business such as thermal coal. For our own operational GHG emissions, the main levers for reduction are Electricity, Buildings as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and Procurement.  These  elements  are  described  in  more  detail  in  the following sections.\n\nWe  apply  both  absolute  and  intensity  GHG  emission  targets. Absolute  GHG  emissions  refer  to  an  absolute  amount  of  GHG emissions  associated  with  the  respective  business  activity  such  as\n\ninvesting or insuring; absolute GHG emission targets seek to reduce the absolute  amount  of  GHG  emissions.  GHG  emission  intensity  and associated targets, on the other hand, harmonize the GHG emissions through a denominator that relates to a business activity. For example, GHG emissions per million invested or per million of premium.\n\n## Property-Casualty insurance\n\nThe GHG emissions associated with our commercial portfolio will be reduced  as  we  continue  the  planned  implementation  of  our underwriting guidelines for coal as well as for oil and gas in line with announced thresholds and timelines. Our portfolio will also change as we continue to expand our risk appetite in the segment of renewable energy, low-carbon, and transition technologies. We will also benefit from GHG emission reductions in the real economy that our corporate customers pursue as part of their own net-zero strategies as required by governments, investors, and other stakeholders, and in addition, enabled by us as an insurer. A supportive policy environment is crucial here and is an important lever both for the net-zero transition in the global economy and for our target achievement.\n\nThe GHG emissions associated with our motor retail portfolio are planned to be reduced through various initiatives; firstly, by increasing our share of battery electric vehicles for our markets in scope. It is also clear from market research that customers want to drive less, so we will encourage sustainable behaviors by providing offerings that reward these lifestyle changes. Another key lever will therefore be providing further  incentives  for  reducing  GHG  emissions  via  mileage-based product offerings. When considering potential initiatives we took into account future projections in each of the countries for which we have set targets, including energy usage, vehicle usage and vehicle types. Our incentives will therefore balance the improvements we expect to see in the respective markets with Allianz actions aimed at closing the gap to our stated targets. We will therefore actively steer our in-scope portfolios to be more sustainable whilst benefiting from changes we predict to observe in market behavior.\n\nWe will also engage with customers to support their transition to electric mobility and meet their changing needs. We are committed to offering  comprehensive  insurance  products  for  battery  electric vehicles and the related ecosystem, and to supporting our customers in transitioning to new forms of mobility.",

        "page_content": "## Proprietary investment\n\nOur  investment  management  function  allows  us  to  influence  our portfolio allocation by setting targets and frameworks for our asset managers. These include defining concrete decarbonization targets for individual mandates, excluding certain high-emitting companies without reduction plans, and  increasing target volumes  for investments in climate solutions.\n\nIn order to achieve GHG emission reductions in the companies in our  portfolio,  we  cultivate  all  types  of  engagement:  bilateral, multilateral,  and  asset  manager  engagement.  As  part  of  our multilateral engagement activities, the transition of whole sectors is a particular focus.\n\n## Own operations\n\nAs  the  specific  definition  of  net-zero  is  still  evolving  for  financial institutions and we anticipate CSRD requirements, we are no longer referring to the 2030 target for our Own Operations as a net-zero commitment. We will instead refer to it as a 2030 intermediate target. The  rest  of  the  decarbonization  and  removal  targets  for  Own Operations  remain  as  communicated  in  the  Inaugural  Net-Zero Transition Plan.\n\nBy 2025 we aim to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50 % versus a 2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 emissions (for further information, please refer to the section 'Own Operations'). For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions of 70 % and for year-end 2029, 65 % 1 versus a 2019 baseline.\n\nTo address the remaining 30 % 2 of the emissions we will use highquality carbon removal solutions.\n\nKey  levers  for  GHG  emission  reduction  will  be  the  areas  of Renewable Electricity, Buildings, as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and Procurement. In the area of Renewable Electricity, we source 100 % renewable  electricity  from  2023  onwards  and  implement  energy efficiency  measures. 3 For Buildings, we have developed a Buildings Standards Catalogue that includes various measures addressing GHG emission reduction. For Fleet and Business Travel, we aim to shift to a fully electric corporate car fleet by 2030 at the latest, achieve a 40 % reduction of GHG emissions from travel activities by 2025 compared to a 2019 baseline, and purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in order to address GHG emissions from air travel. For Procurement, we will ask 100 % of global framework vendors in our supply chain that provide\n\nservices globally to establish a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with the 1.5 \u00b0C path by 2025.\n\n## Carbon removal and carbon credits\n\nIn  the  past  reporting  year,  we  did  not  use  carbon  removal  and associated  carbon  credits  when  accounting  for  our  GHG  and  the associated reduction targets. Our net-zero targets will likely require the use of atmospheric carbon removal in the respective net-zero targets year. For this, we expect to only use high-quality carbon removal. Our focus remains on GHG emission reductions.\n\n## Governance\n\nUltimate  responsibility  for  all  matters  relating  to  sustainability, including climate, resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group's parent company. This includes climate change and the net-zero transition plan, which has been approved by the Board of Management. Climate-related matters are typically part of all Group Sustainability Board meetings, which are held at least quarterly. For further information, please refer to the section 'Corporate sustainability governance and strategy'.\n\nOur  Climate  Change  Strategy  is  rooted  in  the  established sustainability governance (for further information, please refer to the section  'Corporate sustainability governance and strategy') and its associated policies on sustainability, climate, and the energy sector. For  further  information,  please  refer  to  the  section  'Overarching Policies'.\n\n## Progress\n\nIn the following sections on insurance, investments, and operations, we report  on  the  details  and  progress  of  the  implementation  of  the transition plan.\n\nThe Allianz sustainability approach integrates climate and sustainability-related considerations by applying group-wide corporate rules and sustainability instruments across underwriting and investment  activities.  Key  processes  include  the  internal  Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules, such as the Allianz  Standard for P&C Underwriting (ASU) and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI).\n\nThe AS RRIM has been in place since 2013 and establishes a core set of principles and processes for the management of reputational risks and sustainability issues within the Group. It is owned by Group Risk,  authorized  by  the  Group  Finance  and  Risk  Committee  and acknowledged by the Allianz SE Board of Management. The objective of  the  Standard  is  to  proactively  identify  business  decisions  and business activities with the potential to trigger reputational issues and, where appropriate, take action to minimize their probability and/or impact. This Standard is mandatory for all operating entities of the Allianz Group. For 2024, the intention is for it to be superseded by the Allianz  Standard for Communications and the Allianz  Standard for Integration of Sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, Allianz has four energy-related guidelines in place: thermal coal , oil sands , oil & gas , and renewable/low-carbon energy . The guidelines are owned by Global Sustainability and authorized by the  Allianz SE  Board  of  Management.  They  apply  to  proprietary investments  and  P&C  insurance,  including  facultative  reinsurance. Their common goals are to contribute to the transition from fossil fuels to  cleaner  energy  technologies,  to  manage  sustainability  and reputational risks, and to achieve our net-zero related targets. The three  fossil  fuel  guidelines  define  business  practices  and  business models where we do not provide further services or investments along defined  technical  exclusion  criteria.  They  typically  differentiate between  single-site  restrictions  -  which  apply  to  stand-alone  P&C covers  as  well  as  direct  project  investments  -  and  restrictions  on company-level  exposures.  Purely  to  support  renewable  and  lowcarbon  technologies,  we  allow  ring-fenced  coverages  of  and investments  into  projects  and  subsidiaries  of  companies  that  are otherwise restricted due to the fossil-related energy guidelines. This is described  in  the  Renewable/Low-Carbon  Energy  Guideline.  The guidelines were introduced in 2015 (thermal coal), 2021 (oil sands), 2022 (oil & gas), and 2023 (renewable/low-carbon) respectively.\n\nAs in previous years, we report on the exemptions granted based on the rules outlined in the guideline to companies breaching thermal coal thresholds. In 2023, we received two coal-related requests from our  operating  entities  to  exempt  corporate  clients  from  companybased  restrictions  related  to  both  P&C  insurance  and  proprietary investment segments. Of these, one was granted and one was not granted. The granted one was a 1.5 \u00b0C exemption, which means that the company was assessed to be on a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway despite its coal exposure.  The  option  to  grant  a  grace  period  of  one  year  for",

As a result, there is no further reporting on those exemptions.\n\nThe publicly available 5th version of the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework (formerly the ESG Integration Framework) on the Allianz company website , lays out these main internal policies and processes related to our overarching sustainability risk approach.\n\nThe subsequent sections will outline specific policies applicable to proprietary investments and insurance.\n\n## Current emissions\n\nAccording to the GHG protocol, reporting on emissions associated with insurance underwriting activities is optional. In our motor retail and commercial insurance portfolios, we have made important progress in measuring  insurance-associated  emissions  and  we  set  inaugural emission reduction targets in 2023. For these targets, we follow the methodology of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Insurance-Associated Emissions Standard. 1\n\nAccording to the standard, insurance-associated emissions (IAE) for commercial lines are calculated by multiplying an attribution factor (i.e.,  for commercial lines  this is the  insurance premium  divided by insured  customer's  revenue) by the absolute GHG emissions of the re/insured customer or asset. The attribution factor determines what share of the absolute emissions of an insured customer or asset is attributable to re/insurance.\n\nFor the portfolio in scope of the emission reduction target for commercial insurance, the baseline insurance-associated emissions in 2022  was  1.00 mn  t  CO2e  and  the  insurance-associated  emission intensity was 0.26 kt CO2e/\u20ac mn GWP. 2 Given the lack of reliable and comparable data on customer Scope  3 emissions, our commercial\n\nbaseline currently only covers our customers' Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n\nFor motor retail, the calculation considers the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of insured vehicles within a portfolio and multiplies them by an attribution factor. The attribution factor represents the insurance industry's  share  of  the  total  cost  of  ownership  of  a  vehicle,  which includes other costs such as depreciation, fuel, and maintenance. The carbon emissions of the insured vehicles are multiplied by the industry attribution factor (calculated by PCAF as 6.99 % for 2023) to calculate the insurance-associated emissions.\n\nFor the motor retail portfolios covered by the emission reduction target, the baseline for absolute insurance-associated emissions in 2022 was 2.10 mn t CO2 3 (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) in line with the PCAF standard.\n\n## Overall GHG emission reduction target\n\nFor commercial insurance, we are setting an intensity target for the sub-portfolio of large companies in all sectors, which is managed by Allianz  Global Corporate and Specialty.  We  are  focusing  on those companies for which GHG emission data is available. For the 2022 baseline,  this  cohort  represented  13 %  of  the  premiums  in  the commercial segment for which emission accounting methodologies are currently available. 4 Our target is to reduce the emission intensity of this sub-portfolio by 45 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline (see table '2030 Targets for insurance-associated emissions').\n\nOur  target of a 45 % emission intensity reduction for this subportfolio refers to emission intensity as the main KPI and not to the absolute insurance-associated emissions (in tonnes of CO2e). Emission intensity shows  the  volume  of  customer-generated  emissions associated  with  every  \u20ac 1  million  of  premium  we  write  (tonnes CO2e/million  EUR).  While  defining  an  intensity  target  allows  us  to reflect the expected growth of our portfolio by 2030 in a dynamic way, our targeted reduction is still within the scenario range of necessary absolute  reduction  to  limit  global  warming  to  1.5 \u00b0C.  For  further information, please refer to section  'Transition Plan & Strategy'. In addition to factoring in expected portfolio growth, our target definition was also informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization,\n\nwhich we modeled using authoritative scenarios such as the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) of the International Energy Agency.\n\nOur first intermediary target for commercial lines targets the subportfolio with the largest climate impact and adequate GHG  data quality.  This  will  allow  us  to  steer  our  portfolio  and  measure  our progress  based  on  reasonable  and  verifiable  GHG  emission  data, rather than overly relying on sector estimates.\n\nFor retail insurance, we are setting a target to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our motor retail portfolio. For the motor retail portfolio,  the  target  covers  nine  key  European  markets,  namely: Austria,  Belgium,  France,  Italy,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. Our target is to reduce the absolute carbon emissions within our in-scope portfolios by 30 % by 2030 against our 2022 baseline. Portfolios classified as in scope are aligned with the PCAF standard for personal motor.\n\nFor the 2022 baseline, the in-scope portfolios within these markets represent 55 % of the motor retail premiums. The target focuses on the most relevant motor markets for Allianz where the biggest impact can be made. This includes where there is adequate and reliable data available, in order for emissions to be measured and progress against our target to be accurately tracked.\n\nIn  addition,  our  target  setting  is  aligned  with  limiting  global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C and was informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, which we modeled using scenarios from external data partners.\n\n## 2030 Targets for insurance-associated emissions\n\n|              | Unit of  targets   |   Target  2030 |   Baseline  2022 | Delta target  2030 vs  Baseline  2022 (%)   |\n|--------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Commercial   | kt CO2e/\u20ac  mn GWP  |           0.14 |             0.26 | (45.0)                                      |\n| Retail motor | mn t CO2 1         |           1.47 |             2.1  | (30.0)                                      |\n\nfollows IFRS definition of gross written premiums and deviates from PCAF, which excludes external acquisition costs; following PCAF definition of insurance premiums, scope coverage represents roughly 16 % of the eligible premiums in the commercial segment.

        "page_content": "## Decarbonization levers\n\n## Insured customers decarbonization\n\nIn the commercial  insurance  business,  our  aim  is  to  drive decarbonization  across  all  industry  sectors  and  partner  with  our customers  on  their  net-zero  journeys  by  leveraging  collaboration, sustainability expertise, and best practice, as well as our influence as a major global insurance company.\n\nTo  this  end,  we  will  proactively  approach  customers  to  foster dialogue  and  encourage  a  shift  toward  science-based  net-zero strategies. Firstly, each year we will engage with the top 100 customers, selected  by  premium  size  and  average  industry  sector  emission intensity,  who  do  not  currently  have  an  emissions  reporting  or  a disclosure approach and are therefore currently not in scope for our emission reduction target. By taking this step, we are endeavoring to raise awareness for increased transparency and data exchange and ultimately aiming to close the GHG reporting gap in our portfolio. Secondly, we will engage with customers within the transportation industry  -  specifically  aviation  and  marine  -  by  leveraging  bestpractice exchanges on decarbonization strategies for these sectors. Thirdly, we will seek dedicated exchanges with two to three companies per year on their net-zero strategies. For this engagement category, we will screen our portfolio to identify high-emitting companies who have not yet developed science-based net-zero strategies. Sustainability teams  within  AGCS  will  support  in  the  selection  of  engagement candidates and prepare the engagement dialogues, which will be conducted jointly with the distribution and underwriting teams.\n\nFor motor retail insurance, we will also actively engage with our customers to encourage the transition to net-zero. We aim to engage with 20 million current and potential customers by 2030 to support their transition to electric mobility, mainly through Allianz-developed online platforms, newsletters and advertising. The 20 million target reflects the current and estimated future number of customers in the markets defined as in scope, who do not own a battery electric vehicle (BEV). Engagement will include focusing on the benefits of switching to electric mobility and the practicalities of doing so, for example home charging infrastructure and insurance options.\n\nTo increase our share of sustainably-minded customers, we will offer mileage-based products to reward customers who are actively seeking to reduce their emissions. Our aim in offering such solutions is\n\nto encourage change across the insurance sector in how we, as an industry, approach motor insurance.\n\nBy offering mileage-based products, we will ensure fair and riskadequate  pricing  for  our  customers  that  aligns  with  our  technical excellence program. Increasing our market share of BEVs will enable us to collect more data and thus improve the accuracy of our risk models. We are committed to understanding the risks, gathering data, and being actively involved in research in order to ensure our net-zero plan invests in society to the benefit of all.\n\nTo support the implementation of our actions, a dedicated team within Global P&C at Allianz SE will support engagement activities, which will be achieved in collaboration with OEs.\n\n## Portfolio steering\n\nFurthermore, for commercial portfolios, we are committing to actively supporting the net-zero transition by fostering profitable growth and scaling  up  of  renewable  energy,  low-carbon  and  other  transition technologies that are a key element of the net-zero transformation. Concretely, we aim to profitably grow revenues in Property Damage (PD)  and  Business  Interruption  (BI)  coverages  related  to  these transition solutions 1 by 150 % by 2030 compared to 2022.\n\nIn addition, we are applying the energy-related guidelines as laid out in the section 'Overarching Policies'. The focus on these highemitting sectors is an important lever and contributor to the targeted reduction of emissions intensity at portfolio level.\n\nRestricted companies are listed in the Global ESG Risk List, which is available to all underwriters globally. Training on the application of the policies is offered regularly to support underwriting teams with their implementation.\n\nTo ensure we deliver on our targets, we have clearly defined roles and responsibilities to allow for ownership of the topics and monitoring of  progression  toward  completion.  Although  targets  are  stated  as 2030, there are clear internal interim timelines and reporting processes that will allow for regular monitoring of progress.\n\nAdditionally, to support the implementation of our decarbonization strategy for commercial lines, we have set up two dedicated  sustainability  teams  in  the  AGCS  Chief  Technical  Office (CTO). The Sustainability Governance team oversees the implementation of portfolio strategy, target setting, monitoring, and reporting.  The  Sustainability  Solutions  team  focuses  on  business\n\nand battery manufacturing plants, electric mass transit infrastructure construction (rail), certified green buildings, industry projects related to energy transition (ammonia and bio-based/synthetic fuels), and green  shipping.  We  have  started  working  on  harmonizing  terminology  and  underlying  eligible\n\ngrowth and expansion in line with our 'insuring the transition' actions. Both teams work closely together and support our distribution and underwriting teams. In addition, our Allianz  Risk Consulting teams continue to provide expertise on emerging technology requirements and challenges.\n\nTo further support the transition to net-zero within our motor retail portfolio, we aim by 2030 to insure a larger percentage of BEVs in the Allianz portfolios compared to the share of BEVs in the respective inscope markets.\n\nTo enable this portfolio change, we are committed to offering comprehensive  insurance  products  for  BEVs  and  the  related ecosystem, in order to support our customers in transitioning to this new technology. Our ambition is to be a market leader for BEVs and we have implemented a mobility strategy in order to support this transition. This strategy is an ongoing project with key deliverables and drives  our  ambition  to  be  a  market  leader  through  strategy development, global exchanges, monitoring, and reporting.\n\nA workstream within the technical area oversees the implementation of our mobility strategy. This workstream has a focus on technical leadership in electric vehicles, supporting our markets in the development and implementation of action plans to meet our targets, as well as ensuring the regular delivery and monitoring of key performance  indicators.  It  also  utilizes  Allianz's  global  presence through regular exchanges with OEs as part of internal Mobility Smart Circle meetings and optimizing the pooling of mobility data across countries, leveraging the Group's expertise.\n\nAdditionally,  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  overall decarbonization strategy for motor retail, a dedicated team within Global P&C at Allianz SE oversees target and strategy development, portfolio steering, reporting and monitoring, data maintenance, and quality assurance.\n\n## Insurance-specific policies\n\nAll relevant aspects of our insurance portfolios are governed by the Allianz  Standard  for  P&C  Underwriting  (ASU).  Ownership  and execution of the Standard sits with Global P&C and is governed by the Group Underwriting Committee (GUC). However, ultimate responsibility resides with the Allianz SE Board of Management. The ASU governs the rules and principles for P&C Underwriting within the Allianz Group  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  Group  risk\n\ntechnologies related to the targets for climate solutions (currently used for proprietary investments) and transition solutions (currently used for P&C insurance). We expect to conclude this work and report on it in 2024 fiscal year.",

The  ASU  includes  our  principles  for sustainability and codifies roles and responsibilities within operating entities related to the decarbonization of underwriting portfolios.\n\nThe objectives of the Sustainable Insurance section of the ASU include:  developing  sustainable  business  opportunities,  building resilience  and  anticipating  future  developments  and  adapting  to them, safeguarding against reputational risks, and taking adequate corporate responsibility for our planet.\n\nThe ASU is published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book and is available to all relevant internal stakeholders.\n\n## Current emissions\n\nFor our proprietary investment portfolio, we are calculating financed GHG  emissions  according  to  PCAF  guidance  and  expanding  the methodology to asset classes not yet covered by PCAF. Although we\n\naspire  to  calculate  financed  GHG  emissions  for  as  much  of  our portfolio  as  possible,  we  are  constrained  by  the  development  of methodologies  and  availability  of  data.  Nevertheless,  we  remain committed to progressively expanding the coverage of our portfolio over time.\n\nWe do not calculate financed GHG emissions for covered bonds, ABS/MBS and cash as there is no methodology available yet for these asset  classes.  To  see  these  asset  classes,  please  see  lines  'no methodology' in table 'Financed emissions'.\n\nWe calculate three types of financed GHG emissions defined by the underlying investment: 1) Corporates, which includes all investees with a balance sheet, i.e., - in PCAF terminology - listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, as well as project finance; 2) Real Estate, which includes commercial real estate loans and real estate equity investments; and 3) Public Debt, which includes sovereign debt, sub-sovereign debt, and supranational debt. As there is no specific PCAF guidance on carbon accounting for sub-sovereigns and supranationals, we have adapted the methodology for sovereign\n\ndebt to these two asset classes. We do not cover 100 % of our exposure in these three types of financed GHG emissions (i.e., Corporates, Real Estate and Public Debt) due to the lack of  relevant emission data information.  To  see  this  data  coverage  gap,  please  see  column 'coverage' in table 'Financed emissions'.\n\nFor a detailed description of our carbon accounting methodology, please refer to our explanatory notes on the Allianz company website .\n\nIn 2023, our total financed GHG emissions were 57.3 mn t CO2e compared to 46.4 mn t CO2e in 2022 (see table 'Financed emissions'). The increase was driven in particular by adding new asset classes like sub-sovereigns, supranationals, and infrastructure debt.\n\nOur total coverage of financed GHG emissions increased from 59.6 % to 62.1 %.\n\nThe table below shows the book value, financed GHG emissions, and coverage (i.e., percentage of book value for which financed GHG emissions are calculated) per carbon footprint methodology and is split into IFRS 9 asset classes.",

        "page_content": "## Target setting for GHG emission reduction introduction\n\nWe deem the framework laid out by the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) for target setting for GHG emission reduction to be best practice. Thus we in general follow the recommendations of the NZAOA for setting intermediate decarbonization targets. While the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol (NZAOA TSP) defines targets for engagements, sectors and financing the transition, we display these as actions in line with ESRS E1. The NZAOA TSP was aligned with all relevant stakeholders and vetted in a public consultation and was developed  with  a  strong  reference  to  the  1.5\u00b0C  no/low  overshoot climate  scenarios  in  the  latest  report  of  the  IPCC.  For  further information, please see section 'The scientific basis for establishing net-zero targets' of the NZAOA TSP 1 .\n\nWe have already reached our intermediate 2025 decarbonization target for corporate bonds and listed equities in 2023 as we reduced our financed GHG emissions by 44 % against the target of a 25 % reduction. For full 2025 target reporting, please refer to the section '03.2' in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website . We have also reached our targets for engagements and financing the transition. For further information, please refer to the section 'Decarbonization Levers'.\n\nWe have therefore decided to update our complete range of targets in 2023 and define new targets for 2030. When setting these targets,  we  considered  potential  future  developments  in  large\n\nindustries, especially the E.U. and the U.S., based on the latest climate law and regulation; i.e., 'Fit for 55' and the 'Inflation Reduction Act'. We also wanted our new targets to include what we have learned from previous years; e.g., related to data availability. The targets remain in line with the latest science (IPCC report) and industry best practice (NZAOA TSP) and are broader in terms of coverage and depth. For a detailed explanation of our 2030 targets, please refer to Explaining Allianz Intermediate Climate Target Setting 2030 for Proprietary Investments 2 on the Allianz company website .\n\nAs of the financial year 2024, we will only report on our new 2030 targets.\n\n## Overall GHG emission reduction target\n\nWe have set an absolute GHG emission reduction target for listed corporates  (corporate  bonds  and  public  equity).  Our  target  is  to reduce absolute GHG emissions in the respective asset classes by 50 % by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline emissions.\n\nWe  have  added  a  2030  emission  intensity  reduction  target covering all listed and unlisted corporate exposure (e.g., infrastructure debt) in the amount of 50 % compared to the 2019 baseline emission intensity  (see  table  '2030  Targets  for  emissions  associated  with proprietary investments\").\n\nA reduction of 50 % is in line with latest IPCC scenarios and equals the midpoint  of  the  respective  scenario  range  from  40 %  to  60 %.

As  data  coverage  is uncertain and changing, we cannot set a reasonable absolute GHG emission  reduction  target  for  our overall  corporate  portfolio.  An intensity metric does not rely on coverage as absolute GHG emissions are divided by the respective portfolio exposure. We therefore decided to set an emission intensity reduction target for our listed and unlisted corporates portfolio for 2030.\n\nWe have set 2030 targets that are aligned with the Carbon Risk Real  Estate  Monitor  ( CRREM )  for  our  real  estate  equity  and  debt portfolios. These sectoral decarbonization pathways are based on the latest science, supported by the Science Based Targets initiative, and widely accepted as best practice.\n\nOur  progress  toward  target  achievement  will  be  monitored regularly and reported in the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nThe table below shows Allianz intermediate 2030 decarbonization targets as well as the respective baseline year values, where available. We have defined GHG emission reduction targets for corporates and real estate.",

Each asset manager is then responsible for reaching the respective mandate decarbonization target by taking appropriate actions.  For  real  estate,  for  example,  these  actions  might  include tenant engagement, portfolio transactions, and deep refurbishments. We hold regular deep-dive meetings where we monitor and discuss the decarbonization performance of our asset managers against the set targets.\n\nAs  well  as  setting  decarbonization  targets  per  mandate,  we exclude  certain  companies  in  line  with  our  global  energy-related guidelines for thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas. For further information, please  refer  to  section  'Overarching  Policies'.  These  exclusions therefore contribute to the implementation of our sector targets for oil & gas and utilities that are outlined below. All excluded companies are included in the Allianz Group Risk Global Restricted List and are shared with  all  asset  managers  on  a  regular  basis.  Asset  managers  are obliged to comply with these restrictions.\n\nWe aim to finance the transition of companies in the hard-toabate cement and steel sector that are aligned with a 1.5-degree world  and  have  well-defined  decarbonization  strategies.  We  will therefore  create  a  separate  emission  bucket  and  adjust  the  subportfolio  target  for  listed  equity  and  corporate  bonds  to  reflect additional exposure in those transition leaders included on our new steel and cement climate list.\n\nWe have set sector targets for the high-emitting sectors listed below. These targets will trigger three types of actions supporting our overall GHG  emission  reduction  target:  sector  engagements  (for  further information, please refer to section 'Portfolio company decarbonization'), exclusions, and moving from climate laggards to climate leaders within the respective sectors:\n\n- -Oil & Gas (coverage Allianz O&G 100 list):\n- -Scope 1, 2 and 3 (cat 11): 43.07 g CO2e/MJ in line with IEA NetZero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n- -100 % of AuM to set net-zero targets across all 3 emission scopes (target year 2025)\n- -Utilities (Coverage Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI)):\n- -Scope  1:  0.17  t  CO2e/MWh  in  line  with  IEA Net-Zero  GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n- -Coal phase out in line with 1.5-degree pathway\n- -Steel (Coverage TPI):\n- -Scope 1 and 2: 1.18 t CO2e/t steel in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n- -Automobile (Coverage TPI):\n- -Scope 3 (cat 11): 41.68 g CO2e/km in line with IEA Net-Zero GHG Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\nIn 2023, we added the sectors Steel and Automobile. For both sectors, we are currently implementing data flows as a first step.\n\nPortfolio decarbonization will also be fostered by increasing our share in Sustainable Investments. We have achieved our 2025 target for financing the transition; i.e., we have created between 4 and 5 new blended finance vehicles and have made initial investments in forestry and hydrogen.\n\nWe  have  therefore  included  a  quantitative  2030  target  for investments in climate solutions, which is to increase climate solution investments by at least \u20ac 20 bn by 2030, subject to market environment and constraints.\n\nAs a first step to reach this target, we have defined all low-carbon technologies that qualify as climate solutions 1 . We need to develop a process to align and agree on concrete volumes per annum with all relevant  stakeholders:  operating  entities,  asset  managers,  and relevant Group centers.\n\nWe  have  defined  two  additional  requirements  for  our investments. Firstly, we will predominantly invest in Article 8 or Article 9 funds  (or  equivalent)  as  defined  by  the  EU  Sustainable  Finance Disclosure  Regulation  (SFDR).  Secondly,  we  will  require  a  credible transition plan for all unlisted direct investment with a carbon intensity above 100 t CO2e/\u20ac mn invested.\n\n## Portfolio company decarbonization\n\nThe extent to which we can achieve reduction of GHG emissions for our investee  companies  and  real  estate  investments  depends  on  the respective ownership structure. For example, in the case of fully-owned real estate assets, we can directly influence GHG emissions by deep refurbishments.  However,  if  we  are  only  a  minority  owner,  we  are restricted to indirectly impacting GHG emissions through engagement, for example, or proxy voting (public equity).\n\nOne indirect lever to reach our 2030 GHG emission reduction targets  is  therefore  continued  engagement  and  support  of  our portfolio companies.  We  have  consequently  implemented  a systematic  and  strong  engagement  approach  across  all  types  of engagements: bilateral, multilateral, and asset manager. For further information on our engagement approach, please refer to our 2023 Allianz Investment Management - Our Engagement Approach on the Allianz company website .\n\nWe have already achieved our 2025 engagement targets in 2023 as we have engaged the top 30 (non-aligned) emitters in our portfolio, increased our engagement activities by 100 %, and fully participated in all NZAOA sector and asset manager engagements.",

        "page_content": "We have therefore updated our engagement targets earlier than originally planned. By 2030 (versus September 2023), we firstly want to  engage  with  all  external  asset  managers  who  are  'below expectations' based on a systematic assessment. In order to reach this target,  we  initially  need  to  perform  a  systematic  sustainability assessment of all of our public and private asset managers. If an asset manager  does  meet  our  minimum  expectations,  we  will  start engagement to close identified gaps. We regularly review our public equity asset managers against best practice guidance (e.g., NZAOA guidance on best practice for proxy voting and climate lobbying).\n\nSecondly, we want to participate in 30 multilateral engagements (at  least  15  of  them  with  a  focus  on  climate),  either  as  the  lead organization or as a member. In order to reach this target, we will continuously  review  existing  or  new  multilateral  engagement initiatives. In 2023, we joined the collaborative engagement initiative 'Investor Initiative on Hazardous Chemicals' (IIHC).\n\nThirdly, we aim to engage with 15 non-multilaterally engaged portfolio emitters among the top 100. We will screen the financed GHG emissions of our portfolio companies to identify those qualifying for engagement; i.e., those with the highest financed GHG emissions that are not already engaged.\n\nAs many of our high emitters in the portfolio can only decarbonize properly if the whole sector - including the value chain - decarbonizes, we are also active in sector engagements via multilateral engagement initiatives. Sector engagements are supporting our sector targets for 2030,  in  particular  in  the  oil  &  gas  and  steel  sectors.  For  more information on our sector targets, please refer to the section 'Portfolio allocation changes'.\n\nThe  whole  investment  management  function  of  Allianz  is responsible for implementing climate topics in the existing processes and hence in the investment portfolio.\n\n## Proprietary investment specific policies\n\nWe are committed to managing climate change risk identified as a material  risk  for  our  proprietary  investment  portfolio.  To  align  our investment management function with this commitment, we have set ambitious GHG emission reduction targets that incentivize respective decision-making (see table '2030 Targets for emissions associated with proprietary investments'). Our Allianz  ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI) sets out the rules, principles, and processes that govern  the  integration  and  application  of  climate  topics  to  the Insurance Investment Assets of Allianz.\n\nThe EFRI provides a detailed description of all relevant processes for integrating  climate  into  the  investment  processes  and  managing climate risk:\n\n- -Selecting and monitoring asset managers: Asset managers need to  adhere  to  their  own  qualified  sustainability  policy  including climate  as  a  key  topic.  Regular  review  meetings  with  asset\n\nmanagers covering sustainability topics need to be performed.\n\n- -Systematic evaluation and scoring of investments: For  unlisted assets,  a  case-by-case  evaluation  needs  to  be  performed  to identify potential sustainability risks. For listed assets, sustainability criteria based on MSCI data are used to screen all investments and inform our investment decision-making.\n- -Active  engagements:  As  an  integral  part  of  our  strategy,  we perform bilateral engagements based on systematic sustainability scoring, multilateral engagements, and asset manager engagements.\n- -Exclusions of certain sectors, companies and sovereigns: Certain investments need to be excluded based on the Allianz guidelines for Oil and Gas and Coal-based business models. Some exclusions are triggered by engagement.\n- -Sustainable  Investments:  We  define  sustainable  investments  in line with the SFDR Article 2 (17) and actively pursue investment opportunities that support solutions to environmental and societal challenges, aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (U.N. SDGs).\n- -Risk  management:  The  Allianz  Climate  Change  Risk  Solution (ACCRiS) tool must be used to assess physical climate change risk for fully-owned real estate and prospectively for all single location assets. Whenever a certain level of physical risk is identified, a climate change adaptation plan needs to be implemented.\n\nFor  further  details,  please  refer  to  section  '02.2.1'  in  our  Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\nThe EFRI applies to all proprietary investment assets excluding unit-linked assets and is owned by the Sustainable Investing team. It is authorized by the respective Allianz SE Board Member responsible for Investments. The EFRI is published in the Allianz Corporate Rules Book and is available to all relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe EFRI is mandatory within the Allianz Group for all insurance and reinsurance legal entities, including related pension schemes and all  types  of  investment  assets.  Sustainability  governance  is  fully\n\nintegrated  into  existing  governance  structures  and  makes  use  of existing committees (e.g., the Group Investment Committee).\n\n## Current emissions\n\nIn our own operations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint over time. We have established a dedicated unit - Group Sustainable Operations  -  within  Group  Operations  &  IT  to  align  the  strategic approach across all Allianz  entities, with the aim of  reducing  their environmental footprint and accelerating impact through setting clear targets and sharing best practice. The main operations in scope are Travel and Fleet, Procurement, Facility Management, and IT.\n\nThe total GHG emissions arising from Allianz  Operations were 136,448 t CO2e in 2023. Of that, 31,774 t CO2e result from Scope 1, 7,929 t CO2e from Scope 2, and 96,745 t CO2e from Scope 3. Included Scope 3 GHG emissions from categories 3.1, 3.3, 3.6 and 3.7 cover fueland energy-related emissions, business travel, remote working, public cloud,  and paper use. Scope 3 GHG  financed emissions which fall under category 3.15 are excluded. For further information, please refer to the section 'Insurance Overarching' and the section 'Investments Overarching'.

        "page_content": "## Decarbonization levers\n\n## Renewable electricity\n\nAs a signatory of the RE100 initiative, we have committed to sourcing 100 % renewable electricity (RE) for our group-wide operations and data centers by 2023. RE100 is a global initiative bringing together businesses committed to 100 % renewable electricity.\n\nEnergy sourcing has been a strategic procurement function since 2021 and plays a key role in our transition toward 100 % renewable electricity, mainly by shifting energy procurement from locally driven to globally  driven  processes.  Activities  in  2023  included  leveraging opportunities to agree green tariffs with local power providers and holding  conversations  with  landlords  supported  by  green  lease clauses. We encourage green tariffs and local direct investments in Allianz-owned self-generation, centrally supported by PIMCO Prime Real  Estate.  Furthermore,  renewable  Energy  Attribute  Certificates have played a role in the transition to 100 % renewable electricity as an interim solution for markets and Allianz entities with limited access to renewable electricity.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved our goal of covering 100 % (2022: 89 %) of our electricity for all office buildings and data centers with renewable, low carbon sources. 98.6 % of this is in line with the RE100 technical criteria and 1.4 % is secured via renewable Energy Attribute Certificates from  neighboring  countries  as  we  operate  in  some  countries  like Ukraine,  Saudi  Arabia  and  Ghana 1 where  there  is  currently  no availability of renewable electricity meeting the RE100 criteria. We continue our efforts to cover all our renewable electricity in line with RE100  technical  criteria  and  will  closely  monitor  the  market development in the respective countries.\n\n## Buildings\n\nEmbedding  sustainability  in  our  buildings  encompasses  energy efficiency and reduction. We aim to reduce the energy consumption in our office buildings per employee by 20 % by year-end 2025 against a 2019 baseline.\n\nWe implement environmental management systems (EMS) and energy  efficiency  processes  based  on  ISO14001  and  ISO50001 standards  to  improve  environmental  management  governance practices at some of our major locations and entities. Some locations also  pursue  certifications  such  as  LEED,  BREEAM 2 ,  etc.  To  address energy efficiency and reduction holistically, our operating entities are encouraged to develop approaches to reduce energy consumption.\n\nWe have set up a Buildings Standards Catalogue to harmonize Allianz's approach to sustainability in buildings. This comprehensive listing  of  minimum  standards  includes  elements  of  governance/certifications, furnishings, construction/renovations, renewable energy, energy efficiency, water, waste, food, and commuting, as well as guidance on green lease selection criteria.\n\nIn 2023, we achieved a 47 % reduction in energy consumption in our office buildings per employee compared to our  2019 baseline (2022: 32 %).\n\n## Fleet and business travel\n\nWhen it comes to fleet and business travel, our aim is to continuously reduce corresponding GHG emissions now that COVID-19 measures have been lifted and business trips are permitted again. We aim to reduce  our  GHG  emissions  from  business  travel  by  40 %  by  2025 against a 2019 baseline. As a signatory of the EV100 initiative, Allianz has committed to fully electrify the company fleet by 2030 at the latest.\n\nThe current travel regulation is under review and - once updated in 2024 - will encompass climate-related topics for business travel. In addition, our travel tools offer a sort and filter function based on CO2 emissions for flight searches. Further, meetings should be held digitally whenever possible.\n\nIn 2023,  GHG emissions from business travel were reduced by 44 % per employee against a 2019 baseline 3 (2022: 47 %). As of 2023, 22 % of our fleet vehicles are electrified 4 (2022: 11 %).\n\n## Procurement\n\nWith regard to our supply chain, our target is to ensure that 100 % of global  framework  vendors  -  i.e.,  vendors  providing  products  and services for Allianz globally - have made a public commitment to netzero GHG emissions in line with a 1.5 \u00b0C path by 2025.\n\nThe procurement function sources services and products for the Allianz Group by partnering with thousands of vendors all around the world for activities such as IT, professional services, and marketing. Our procurement policy and processes are reviewed regularly. In 2022, they were updated to align with the Allianz Group sustainability strategy and  to  embed  the  operations  sustainability  strategy  across procurement activities. To ensure our IT partners are following our decarbonization  ambition,  we  have  implemented  sustainability criteria in all Requests for Information (RFIs)/Requests for Proposal (RFPs) and tenders. The catalogue of questions covers environmental aspects  in four categories (Hardware,  Software,  Application/ Infrastructure  &  Communication)  and  produces  a rating based on defined sustainability criteria.\n\nOur assessment indicates that, in 2023, 76 % of global framework vendors had an existing net-zero commitment (2022: 65 %).\n\nSustainability forms part of the individual contribution factor of the remuneration  of  each  member  of  the  Allianz SE  Board  of Management.  This  extends  to  the  decarbonization  targets  of proprietary  investments  as  well  as  own  operations.  For  further information,  please  refer  to  Remuneration  Report  and  the  section 'Corporate responsibility governance and strategy'.\n\nClimate change will materially affect global economies and Allianz, with its  international  footprint  and  many  different  lines  of  business,  is  no exception - as already highlighted in the section on materiality analysis. The risks and opportunities emerging today will evolve and increase over the mid to long term. They include acute and chronic physical impacts on property and human health, such as increasing temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves, droughts, and potential changes in vector-borne diseases.\n\nRisks and opportunities also result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming from the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks include the impacts of changes in climate policy, technology, and market sentiment, and their impact on the market value of financial assets, as well as impacts resulting from climate change litigation.",

        "page_content": "## Impact on and impact of our business\n\nThe Allianz Group is exposed to risks that are influenced by climate change in a multitude of ways. Our core business activities mean that we are affected in two key ways, both of which can influence the ability of assets to generate long-term value:\n\n- -As  an  insurer  providing  insurance  policies  -  e.g.,  covering  health impacts, property damage, or litigation claims - and through changes in the sectors and business models we underwrite.\n- -As  a  large-scale  institutional  investor  with  significant  interests  in various economies, companies, infrastructure, and  real estate that might be affected by the physical impact of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nAs well as being impacted by climate change, the choices Allianz makes about how to conduct our business have an impact on climate change, e.g., by investing in or insuring activities that either cause or reduce GHG emissions. To manage potentially detrimental impacts on both the climate and our business, we have committed to align our proprietary investment and insurance underwriting portfolios to 1.5 \u00b0C climate scenarios.\n\n## Strategy resilience, stress tests, and climate scenario analysis\n\nClimate change considerations are an integral part of our insurance and investment strategy.\n\nWe  apply  various  quantitative  and  qualitative  strategies  when carrying out climate stress testing and scenario analysis. Considerations in this regard include the long-term horizons over which climate change may unfold and the high level of uncertainty over the direction of future climate and economic developments. Our objective is to foster risk awareness, build expertise in the assessment of financial risks from climate change, test our business strategy resilience, and inform risk management and business decision-making.\n\nWe perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons up to 2050 and including scenarios ranging from 1.5 \u00b0C to 4 \u00b0C of average warming by the end of the century. While time horizons naturally differ\n\ndepending on the lines of business under consideration, the range of scenarios we apply allows us to better assess a variety of risks associated with climate change.\n\nWhen we conduct analyses that assess 1.5 \u00b0C scenario alignment, we adjust our scenario selection using guidance developed by the NZAOA that is focused on 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios with no or low overshoot of 1.5 \u00b0C of warming.  This  limits  the  need  to  remove  GHG  emissions  from  the atmosphere in the second half of the century.\n\nWhen  conducting  outside-in  impact  scenario  analysis,  we  use  a broader  range  of  scenarios  in  terms  of  temperature  outcomes  and characteristics. Qualitative assessments are conducted to explore to what extent and across which channels climate change risks affect distinct aspects of our business, unconstrained by the still limited availability of quantitative models to fully cover all aspects of climate change across our entire  business  activities.  We  deploy  quantitative  assessments  for indicative sizing of our exposure to climate change risks. A top-down approach is developed to assess risks at the level of our balance sheet. Complementary bottom-up modeling for the most relevant exposures provides  insights  into  climate  change  risks  at  the  level  of  individual investment or underwriting projects and may support contextualization of results from top-down analyses.\n\nIt should be noted that the analyses included in this report reflect our current  approaches  to  climate  change  risk  assessments.  Prevailing methodological  and  data  limitations  as  well  as  the  high  degree  of uncertainty inherent in any long-term analysis may still limit the decisionmaking  usefulness  of  some  results.  However, these approaches  will change  over  time  as  climate  scenarios  evolve  in  line  with  research, developmental-stage  methods  improve  further,  and  industry  best practices emerge.\n\n## Qualitative assessment of climate change risks\n\nThe guiding objective of the qualitative climate change risk assessment is comprehensiveness, whereby it is important to identify the many ways that Allianz's risk profile can be adversely affected across all areas of the business, in both the short, medium and long term. There are multiple ways\n\nin which climate change may trigger risk events, so it is essential that this understanding is established in enough detail for it to provide a solid basis for applying risk-based prioritization with the aim of evaluating mitigation effectiveness and management actions.\n\nTo achieve full coverage of Allianz's business footprint, the assessment was  structured  along  investments,  property-casualty  underwriting, life/health underwriting, operations, with investments  and underwriting further subdivided into asset class and line of business, respectively. For each area (or alternatively, asset class for investments, and line of business for underwriting), the main relevant climate change-related risk drivers were identified. In this context, a risk driver is any development or event wholly or primarily attributable to climate change that potentially impacts Allianz's risk profile. Such risk drivers can be categorized into technological, regulatory, legal, and consumer behavior developments (transition risks), as well as physical risks such as floods, drought, or wildfires.\n\nFor each risk driver, a range of potential short- to medium-term and long-term  impacts  for  the  insurance  sector  was  considered,  utilizing knowledge  acquired  via  a  combination  of  desktop  research  and consultation with subject matter experts both internal and external to Allianz. Lastly, the potential magnitude of each of these risk impacts was assessed  against  various  dimensions  of  financial  and  non-financial performance.\n\nThe initial qualitative risk assessment was performed throughout 2022 at the Allianz Group level. During 2023, subsidiaries adapted the assessment  according  to  their  local  risk  profiles.  The  outcome  of  this exercise provides further insights into the relevance of climate change risk drivers for both the Allianz Group as a whole and individual subsidiaries, taking into account their specific business profile, geographical presence, and locally applicable regulations.\n\nFor a summary of the main climate change risks faced by the Allianz Group as  well  as  corresponding  impacts  derived  from  the  qualitative  risk assessment, please see tables 'Key climate change transition risks' and 'Key climate change physical risks'.",

The most exposed properties might experience higher losses from property  damage, a loss of rental income due to business disruptions and higher insurance and financing costs. While measures may be taken  to help mitigate the real estate impact of extreme weather events, such as strengthening structures against wind and flood damage,  these typically require costly investments.

In contrast to acute physical risks, these risks are not attributable to  individual extreme weather events, but rather reflect permanent trends or slow-developing climate change impacts.   - For example, rising sea levels that make coastal areas more prone to flooding are likely to increase claims costs and expenses for |\n\nThe above results demonstrate that the most relevant climate change risks for Allianz as an organization relate to proprietary investments and  property-casualty  underwriting.  Risks  related  to  company operations and life/health underwriting are also present, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nIn terms of time frames, the assessment foresees transition risks as more significant in the short to medium term than in the long term under  scenarios  where  alignment  with  the  goals  of  the  Paris Agreement is rigorously  pursued. This reflects the view that a large proportion of measures to address climate change will need to be introduced  in  the  next  5  to  15  years,  which  will  constitute  a comparatively dynamic period of transition risk relevance.\n\nIn terms of the most relevant physical risks, acute physical risks are likewise considered more significant over the short to medium term than the long term. While this may run contrary to the understanding that acute physical risks will continue to increase in both magnitude and frequency, the presumption is that adaptive measures will help blunt impact severity in the longer term. This includes both adaptive measures  by  external  parties  -  such  as  regulations  restricting  or encouraging  movement  away  from  disaster  prone  areas  -  and mitigation  measures  by  Allianz,  such  as  improvements  in  the management  of  insurance  risk  concentrations  and  the  pricing  of insurance coverages.\n\nWhen considering the above results, it is important to understand that outcomes of this qualitative process are highly dependent on the input  of  individual  risk  experts.  Although  the  process  leveraged research  and  statistical  information  where  possible,  professional judgment was applied in determining the impacts specific to Allianz. Provided that professional judgment is subject to various forms of bias, results are liable to change. In addition, the emergence of further statistical and  other  fact-based  research  may  also  influence conclusions.\n\nFor further information on mitigation measures to address and manage risk impacts, please refer to the section 'Conclusion'.",

It demonstrates our continuing efforts to build capabilities and capacities for quantitative climate change risk assessments and gain  experience  with  sizing  balance  sheet  exposures  to  climate change risks.\n\nThe  stress  test  covers  both  sides  of  the  balance  sheet  by measuring asset-  or liability-specific stress impacts, as well as their dependencies  for  a  static  balance  sheet.  We  take  into  account  a period up to 2050, which is relevant both for the implementation of key political and business strategies linked to the Paris Climate Agreement and  for  the  onset  of  increasing  global  warming  and  its  negative consequences. Impacts are estimated for market stresses, as well as property-casualty and  life/health underwriting stresses, using NGFS 1 /IPCC 2 scenario-based  data  from  various  sources.  NGFS scenarios  are  selected for this analysis since they are compiled on behalf of central banks and supervisory authorities for financial stress testing, provide pathways for macroeconomic variables in a variety of scenarios representing different levels of transition and physical risk, and are available open source. IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are the starting point of well-established scientific studies  on  the  development  of  climate-related  hazards  in  climate change scenarios, which can be adapted for modelling underwriting risks. All entities contributing to the Allianz Group's Solvency II model are in scope for the assessment. The main focus of the analysis is to provide a best estimate for market value balance sheet impacts.\n\nFor the current implementation of the integrated climate change stress test, we have considered five scenario narratives from the suite of NGFS  reference  scenarios.  The  (1)  Net  Zero  2050  scenario  is determined by an orderly transition to net-zero emissions  by 2050 following the target to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C through stringent climate policies at the cost of moderate economic strain in the initial years.  The  (2)  Below  2 \u00b0C  scenario  assumes  an  early  and  orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, with an unambitious policy target to limit global warming to below 2 \u00b0C by the end of the century. In this\n\nscenario, policy action has limited impact on economic growth. In the (3) Delayed Transition scenario, GHG emissions remain high until 2030, when strong policy measures are taken to limit warming to below 2 \u00b0C. Physical risks are relatively small in these scenarios over the 2050 time horizon.\n\nThe (4) Nationally Determined Contributions scenario includes all pledged climate policies, even if not yet implemented. However, these pledged policies are still insufficient to limit global warming to below 2 \u00b0C, leading to increasing physical risks. Accounting only for climate policies  that  were  in  place  before  2019,  the  (5)  Current  Policies scenario is characterized by limited transition risks and high physical risks, which start to become more visible over the second half of the projection period.\n\nNGFS  scenarios  are  used  to  obtain  financial  market  variables  for application  in  the  market  stress  module  of  the  integrated  climate change  stress  test.  The  market  stresses  themselves  are  applied  to market values of both assets and liabilities of in-scope entities, where a simplified approach is used to assess the mitigation of stress impacts due  to  policyholder  profit  sharing.  Scenario  variables  used  in  the property-casualty  and  life/health  underwriting  stress  modules  are derived from hazard models that are contingent on the IPCC's RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5. For the life/health underwriting stress module, stress variables are based on a study by Gasparrini et al.3 that projects temperature-related  excess  mortality  under  various  heat  and  cold pathways and their net change up to the end of the century. The life/health underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of liabilities for biometric risk exposure. The property-casualty underwriting stress module relies on projections for Average Annual Loss under RCP scenarios for a selection of the most climate changerelevant country and peril combinations (i.e., inland flooding, hail and tropical cyclone) developed by NatCat modeling experts at Allianz Re. The property-casualty underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of liabilities for NatCat risk exposures.\n\nTo separate the impact of climate change risk from trend growth, stress  levels  are  assessed  relative  to  a  baseline  or  counterfactual scenario as defined by the NGFS, a hypothetical scenario in which neither  progression  of  climate  change  nor  the  implementation  of transition measures is assumed. Furthermore, the calculation of stress impacts is based on instantaneous stresses on the static year-end 2023\n\nbalance sheet, without adaptation or mitigation actions from Allianz and  its  business  partners.  In  particular,  internal  measures  such  as contract repricing, deployment of reinsurance strategies, or portfolio steering  have  not  been  taken  into  account,  as  well  as  external measures  such  as  public  investment  in  flood  defences.  Impact estimates from the different stress test modules are integrated based on a matching of global mean temperatures for 2050 between NGFS and IPCC scenarios as well as consideration of the overall scenario characteristics.  No  diversification  between  market  stresses  and underwriting stresses is assumed for the aggregation.\n\nImpact estimates from the integrated climate change stress test rely on scientific research and scenario data that is available and considered relevant as of the current point in time. Nevertheless, the magnitude  of  outcomes  has  to  be  treated  with  caution  when accounting for the significant uncertainties inherent in climate change modeling and the crucial role of assumptions in long-term projections. These include, but are not limited to, uncertainties in the scientific studies  underlying  the  projected  distributions  of  NatCat  events, uncertainties in the modeling of macroeconomic impacts of physical risks, as well as uncertainties due to the limitations of climate change scenarios in capturing environmental, social, and economic cascading effects or tipping points. Uncertainties around assumptions for the counterfactual scenario can also have a critical impact on results.\n\nIn  terms  of  the  aggregate  market  and  property-casualty  and life/health underwriting stress impacts, two key overarching observations may be derived. Firstly, with the exception of the Delayed Transition scenario, cumulative market value balance sheet impacts over the first 5-10 years of the projection period are largely determined by  the  different  levels  of  transition  risk  in  the  scenarios,  whereas impacts  from  physical  risks  are  small  in  comparison  but  increase gradually. Secondly, market stress is the largest contributor to overall cumulative  market  value  balance  sheet  impacts,  exceeding  the combined  contribution  from  property-casualty  and  life/health underwriting stresses by a considerable margin.",

        "page_content": "Expounding upon the above general observations at the individual scenario level, we note the following:\n\n- -Moderate cumulative market value balance sheet impacts are realized in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, where the initial economic strain subsides rapidly until 2030.\n- -The orderly implementation of the not too ambitious policy target in the Below 2 \u00b0C scenario comes with a low transition risk initially. While stress impacts in the long term in the Below 2 \u00b0C scenario are comparable to stress impacts in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, an overall  negative  trend  compared  to  the  1.5 \u00b0C  scenario  is predicted in the second half of the century due to higher physical risk associated with higher mean temperatures.\n- -In  the  Delayed  Transition  scenario,  very  low  stress  impacts materialize in initial years, followed by high cumulative market value balance sheet impacts of (13.6) % after 2035 with the start of  the  delayed  implementation  of  a  policy  ambition  that  is comparable to that in the Below 2 \u00b0C scenario. Economic recovery is rather slow in this scenario.\n- -Initial  losses  from  transition  risk  in  the  Nationally  Determined Contributions scenarios, comparable to losses in the Below 2 \u00b0C scenarios, turn into losses from physical risk in later years that gradually increase over time.\n- -In the absence of stringent climate policy implementation, stress impacts are relatively muted until the second half of the time horizon for the Current Policies scenario, similar to the Delayed Transition scenario, where stress impacts from physical risk phase in  bringing  about  moderate  cumulative  market  value  balance sheet impacts of approximately (5.5) % in the long term. Beyond this period,  both  the  Current  Policies  and  the  Nationally Determined Contributions scenarios are expected to entail even more material losses as impacts from physical risks increase and outweigh transition risk impacts.\n\nAn excerpt from the aggregated stress test results is shown in table 'Estimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet impacts  in  NGFS/IPCC  scenarios  relative  to  a  baseline  scenario without climate change'. The complete analysis covers the period from now  until  2050,  whereas  the  excerpt  here  shows  the  estimated maximum  adverse  impacts  over  the  5-20  year  period,  taking  into account,  amongst  other  considerations,  that  the  current  NGFS scenarios  are  primarily  aimed  at  modeling  long-term  climateeconomic relationships.\n\nEstimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario without climate change\n\n%\n\n| Scenario                            | Long-term  5-20 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Net Zero 2050                       | (2.8)                   |\n| Below 2 \u00b0C                          | (2.7)                   |\n| Delayed Transition                  | (13.6)                  |\n| Nationally Determined Contributions | (5.2)                   |\n| Current Policies                    | (5.5)                   |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt  is  apparent  from  a  review  of  the  results  of  the  qualitative  risk assessment and consideration of potential risk responses that while some new mitigation measures (such as processes, controls, strategies) tailored  to  climate  change  may  be  necessary,  the  current  risk management  approaches  are  generally  either  adequate,  or  only require smaller modifications. For example, with respect to propertycasualty underwriting, well-established techniques such as premium adjustments,  changes  in  coverages,  exclusions,  expansions,  or revisions  to  risk  limits  can  all  be  effectively  utilized.  Despite  this conclusion, the consequences in areas where climate change is set to fundamentally transform insurance markets are less predictable and require  strategic  attention.  Fundamental  transformation  includes aspects  such  as  coverage  affordability,  the  shrinkage  of  existing markets, or the emergence of new markets, as well as products or coverages encompassing difficult-to-price risks (e.g., similar to industry experience around the emergence of cyber insurance).\n\nFrom the quantitative perspective, the overall impact estimates derived from the integrated climate change stress test are considered to be within Allianz's risk tolerance, considering both the magnitude of predicted losses and the time horizon over which they materialize. Extending this analysis to a dynamic balance sheet view would further support this assessment; for example, accounting for risk mitigating management actions such as adaptation of derivatives hedging and reinsurance programs, repricing of insurance products, or strategic repositioning of investment and insurance portfolios. The approximate estimates we carried out on the effectiveness of selected management actions confirm this view.\n\nAddressing the immediate effects of climate policy implementation requires the incorporation of climate change-specific measures.  These  include  long-term  strategies  aimed  at  aligning\n\ninvestment and insurance portfolios with climate policy targets, as formulated in our transition plan, see the section  'Transition plan & strategy'. However, successfully managing an economic crisis that may unfold as an indirect effect of climate policy implementation - e.g., in the Delayed Transition scenario - necessitates having well-established mitigation  measures  ready  and  operational,  such  as  limiting  or hedging  equity  and  corporate  bond  exposures,  or  effective  asset liability management.\n\nWe will continue to refine our climate change risk assessments in line with the evolving understanding of assessment methodologies and improving data availability and quality, while also accounting for a shifting climatic and political baseline.\n\n## Social matters\n\nThe following section describes the impact of social matters on our business  activities and  relationships,  and  the  impact  of  the Allianz Group's activities and relationships on society. We describe the concepts  and  achievements  related  to  the  management  of  these impacts with a focus on social impact and responsible consumer/sales policies.\n\nAllianz is committed to having a positive social impact and helping to deliver  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (UN SDGs). For further information on our commitment to the UN SDGs, please  refer  to  the  sections  '01.4',  '01.5'  and  '04.4'  in  our  Group Sustainability  Report  2023  on  the Allianz  company  website . We understand social impact as the effect that our global organization has on the well-being of the community - from global society to local communities where we live and work. This ambition is lived out through our company purpose, our group-wide business strategy, and the local efforts of our operating entities.\n\nOur  long-term  approach  as  an  investor  and  insurer  is  an opportunity to offer measures that can mitigate future risks and shape societies  for  generations;  for  example,  through  pension  systems, environmental and climate protection. As a global insurer, we uphold the principle of solidarity. Pooling risks is part of our core business model and we have a keen interest in supporting stable communities. We have a role to play in enabling future generations and persons with disabilities to overcome the economic and social impacts of social risks.",

We consider taxes to be a core component of corporate responsibility and sustainability.\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  take  a  responsible  approach  to  the management of taxes. We aim for being recognized as a compliant, co-operative and reliable taxpayer in each country we operate. For a comprehensive  description  of  our  approach  see  our  Group  Tax Strategy on the Allianz company website .\n\nIn 2023, we have consolidated our tax transparency reporting products  while  keeping  the  same  level  of  information.  We  are presenting  our  total  tax  contribution  and  our  country-by-country reporting  now  in  our  Sustainability  Report  along  with  other information about current tax topics and developments.\n\n## Corporate citizenship\n\nWe are aware that our actions have the potential to influence the future living conditions, employability and well-being of young people and persons with disabilities and that our decisions play an integral part in determining this future.\n\nAllianz  wants to shape its social impact in a meaningful and lasting way. This social impact stems from both the nature of our business and the effect that our global organization has on the wellbeing of the communities it is active in.\n\nWe view supporting and upskilling young people and persons with disabilities to help them get into education and employability as one way to contribute to SDGs, and in particular to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.\n\nOur ambition is shaped by our company purpose, 'We secure your  future' , defined  by  our  group-wide  business  strategy,  and brought to life through our employees and the local efforts of our operating  entities  (OE)  who  actively  implement  our Corporate Citizenship Strategy and strengthen its alignment with the SDG 8 but also with SDG 17 via philanthropic initiatives, global partnerships and volunteerism.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the Social Impact Fund (SIF) which supports our OE's strategic opportunities by focusing on creating measurable impact through intersectoral partnerships.\n\nOn top of this social work and based on the lessons learned from existing partnerships with the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\n\n## Objectives and actions: societal impact\n\n| Topic                            | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate citizenship strategy   | Continue with the implementation of the new strategy and roll-out of the impact measurement  framework.                                                                                                                   | Integrated Social Impact Measurement Framework into data collection process to enhance input- output-outcome-impact (IOOI) reporting in support of local entities setting their ambitions and  measuring the impact of corporate citizenship activities. |\n| Corporate citizenship activities | - Continue to contribute to society through corporate giving and employee volunteering in alignment  with our strategy.  - Identify and launch activities that would be supported through the Allianz Social Impact Fund. | Social Impact Fund supported 18 corporate citizenship programs led by operating entities (OEs) in  partnership with NGOs in delivery of social impact locally in alignment with global strategy.                                                         |\n\n## Responsible consumer/sales\n\nOur strong reputation is built on the trust our customers, shareholders, employees,  and the general public place in our integrity. This trust hinges on the quality of our products, information, and advice, and on the personal conduct and capabilities of our sales employees and representatives.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is at the core of our corporate  culture.  The  Code  emphasizes  that  fairness  towards customers and transparent communication about our products and services - including their limitations - maximizes our opportunity to earn the long-term trust of customers. This is expressed through our Global  Sales  Compliance  Framework program,  which  specifies\n\nstandardized processes and controls for communication, monitoring, and  review, and  is regularly updated  to  reflect regulatory developments.\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Sales Compliance aims to promote and protect  the  interests  of  our  customers.  It  is  designed  to  ensure transparency and the fair, honest, and responsible treatment of Allianz customers  in  their  purchase  of  our  financial  products  and  their dealings with us. The  Standard  lays  the  foundation  for  a comprehensive customer protection framework designed to ensure all Allianz entities adhere to its prudential norms and robust protection. It covers five key areas to address conduct risk: Product Oversight and Governance,  Incentives  and  Steering  of  Distributors,  Standard  of\n\nDistribution, Sales Force Selection and Training, and Monitoring and Reporting.\n\nWe use the globally recognized Net Promoter Score\u00ae (NPS) as our key  metric  for  measuring  customer  loyalty  through  customers' willingness to recommend Allianz. In 2022, we switched to digital NPS tracking. The digital NPS paradigm allows us to measure customer loyalty  continuously,  eliminating  seasonality  and  deepening  our understanding  of  customers'  sentiment.  Additionally,  the  new measurement sets higher standards for our operating entities, which are measured against a broader set of competitors. This year, we achieved a remarkable NPS of 59 % Loyalty Leadership across all our business segments. This result exceeds our target (50 % loyalty leaders\n\nand the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Allianz has further developed a major global initiative: Move Now  is  a  program that prepares our focus groups for their professional future by offering opportunities to move mentally and physically. It is an initiative that OEs can run in the countries we operate in and an initiative which we support financially with our SIF.\n\nFor MoveNow , the SIF picks up and leverages existing formats from the partnerships with the IOC and the IPC. In 2023, it provided resources for 18 local partnerships that focus on the goals of SDG 8. To further  support  its  local  entities  in  setting  their  ambitions  and measuring  and  reporting  on  the  impact  of  corporate  citizenship activities at a local level, Allianz  has introduced the Allianz  Social Impact Measurement Framework .\n\nFor further information, please refer to section '04.4' in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .",

Customers are invited to rate their satisfaction on a five-star scale after their recent experience at predefined touch points along five customer journeys. To this end, we map the main interactions a customer  has  with  Allianz  along  the  following  journeys:  Sales  & Onboarding;  Claims;  Issue  Resolution  &  Contract  Management; Renewal, Cancelation & Termination; and Outbound Communication. If customers rate their experience with three stars or fewer, we follow up with them to resolve the issue directly and gather more insights.\n\nWe use insights from Voice of the Customer and NPS to improve our products, services, communications, and processes. We combine and  analyze  sources  of  customer  data  in  strict  accordance  with applicable  privacy  laws  to  prioritize  and  implement  structural improvements.  Local  operating  entities  use  customer  feedback  to derive concrete actions.\n\nFindings from the VoC and dNPS programs also help us design the global Allianz experience for our customers. In 2023, we continued our  journey  to  co-create  and  scale  one  global  Allianz  customer experience by developing additional initiatives. Firstly, we continued to implement the Annual Policy Review initiative, which was launched in November 2022, as a way to engage with customers and discuss their insurance portfolio and current needs.\n\nSecondly,  we  worked  together  with  the  Allianz  Behavioral Economics  team  to  improve  the  policy  renewal  communication template by providing customers with more clarity and transparency. And  thirdly,  in  June 2023,  we  launched  a  global  Prewarning  & Prevention initiative, focused on helping customers prevent damage to their property due to climate-related events. Working with climate scientists and risk experts across the Group, we co-created the Global Risk Assessment (GloRiA) tool and customer education assets, which enable users to learn more about the Nat Cat risks associated with their place of residence.\n\nThe Allianz  Customer  Model (ACM)  is  our  end-to-end  global business model that puts the customer at the center of our business and enables Allianz to be simple, digital, and scalable. Our ambition is to simplify and harmonize our business globally.\n\nWithin this context, the Allianz Customer Model was designed first for Retail Property and Casualty lines and then extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, MidCorp, Large Corporate and Reinsurance.\n\nOur target has been to continuously roll out the model across Allianz operating entities. As of the second quarter of 2023, ACM has been  rolled  out  to  39  operating  entities,  comprising  99 %  of  gross written premium (GWP) for our retail Property and Casualty business.\n\nA  tangible  example  of  how  the  Allianz  Customer  Model  is transforming our business is our Master Products. A Master Product is a  template  available  in  the  Allianz  Product  Lab  with  streamlined product elements that are linked to harmonized claims and pricing values. Allianz OEs can configure Master Products to create the right product for their market and make adaptations that are required by regulation.  So  far,  we  have  created  21  Property-Casualty  Master Products which cover more than 90 % of Property-Casualty GWP in our OEs (excluding global lines). Harmonized Master Products allow us to efficiently scale essential IT assets such as Quote & Buy and First Notification of Loss in the Business Master Platform. This platform digitalizes  the  business  requirements  of  the  ACM.  It  comprises a combination  of  scalable  technological  elements,  systems  and services  plus  functionalities  and  configurations,  to better  serve  our customers, intermediaries, partners, and employees.\n\nThis involves transforming the whole value chain across products, sales, claims, and operations. Our aim is to continuously roll out the model across Allianz OEs.\n\nRather than selling individual insurance products, our vision is to evolve our products into full ecosystems and offer customers relevant and trusted solutions. In addition, we are using the ACM to upgrade customer journeys at the Group level.\n\nOur  approach  to  customer  responsibility  and  compliance  is described in the section '04.3' of our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nIn this section, we describe the impact of cybersecurity on our business activities and relationships, as well as the impact of the Allianz Group's activities and relationships with regard to IT topics. In addition, we describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on information security, data privacy, and data ethics.\n\nInformation security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks,  programs, devices, and data\n\nfrom  unauthorized  access  and  against  cyberattacks,  and  to  meet related regulatory requirements. Our dedicated Information Security function aims to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of information across the Allianz Group.\n\nAs a core business discipline, information security is managed globally through a robust and mature governance framework aligned with  international  standard  ISO  27001.  Our  approach  is  closely monitored by a dedicated Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)  function  and  the  Allianz SE  Board  of  Management.  An executive  accountability  regime  supports  the  enforcement  of  the governance framework for all entities.\n\nThe Allianz Information  Security  Governance  Framework comprises multiple layers of corporate rules and processes. An overall policy establishes core principles, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the Information Technology and Information Security organizational framework within the Allianz Group.\n\nThe functional rules are complemented by detailed descriptions of best practices to be followed across 16 defined topics to ensure the ''security by design'' principle. Information security is regularly audited, both internally and externally, and regular training is provided through dedicated exercises across all layers of the organization.\n\nTo fulfill our commitment, cyber risk is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz and is closely managed along key risk indicators covering security maturity, risk exposure, and security operations  across  the  Allianz Group.  Performance  against  these indicators is discussed, reviewed, and reported quarterly to the Board of  Management  and  Supervisory  Board.  Monitoring  for  cyber incidents,  and  measures  to  prevent  them  from  occurring,  are implemented  at  a  global  level  and  supplemented  locally  where required,  together  with  the  local  CISOs  that  exist  in  all  Allianz operating entities.\n\nSpecific  actions  to  improve  security  controls  are  continuously evaluated and developed with priorities assigned on a global, riskbased  view  that  is  informed  by  the  current  and  expected  threat landscape. Actions to achieve our cyber risk targets focus on five key risk  areas:  reducing  the  likelihood  of  incidents;  increasing  the likelihood of detection; reducing damage from incidents; streamlining compliance;  and  training/educating  the  organization  to  further improve security awareness.\n\nAll  employees  are  required  to  participate  in  cyber-awareness training  at  least  quarterly.  This  training  includes  activities  like simulated  phishing  e-mails,  awareness  campaigns,  and  dedicated information security training, with the latter being offered regularly.",

All data privacy matters are overseen by Group Data Privacy.\n\nThe Allianz  Privacy Standard (APS) is our global standard for data privacy and the foundation of the Allianz Privacy Framework . As the highest policy document in the Allianz Privacy Framework, the APS defines rules and principles for collecting and processing personal data, including the ten privacy principles that all employees must respect wherever they are in the world:\n\n- 1. Due care.\n- 2. Data quality (purpose limitation, data minimization and storage limitation).\n- 3. Lawful basis (personal data is only processed if we have a lawful basis to do so).\n- 4. Transparency and openness towards employees and customers on where personal data is stored and used.\n- 5. Relationships  with  data  processors  (ensure  organizations  that process  personal  data  on  our  behalf  adhere  to our  privacy requirements).\n- 6. Adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred.\n\n- 7. Security and confidentiality (appropriate technical and organizational  security  safeguards  are  in  place  to  protect personal data).\n- 8. Timely reporting of personal data breaches.\n- 9. Privacy by design and default.\n- 10. Cooperation with data protection authorities.\n\nIn addition to the APS, our data protection authority has approved our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which allow Allianz Group companies  to  lawfully  transfer  personal  data  from  within  the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, where it is required for business purposes.\n\nOur employees play a critical role in upholding our commitment to  protect  personal  data.  To  ensure  all  our  employees  have  the knowledge to properly use and safeguard personal data, they are required to complete annual privacy training. This training covers the Allianz Privacy Framework requirements in detail and provides a solid foundational understanding of core privacy concepts and the proper handling of personal data. For Privacy Experts, five-day Privacy Expert Training is focused on providing Data Privacy Professionals and Data Protection Officers with the practical knowledge to effectively conduct their day-to-day activities. For Privacy Champions, two-day Privacy Champion  Training  is  focused  on  the  practical  knowledge  and exercises  required  for  the  Privacy  Champion  role  to  ensure  data protection compliance within the business.\n\nAs part of our Privacy Risk Management process, we identify and manage privacy risks at the operational process level to ensure they are measured, monitored, and mitigated across our core businesses. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) of processes that use personal data - such as customer health data and employee data - enable the early  identification  of  privacy  risks  and  ensure  they  are  managed appropriately.  We  also  undertake  case-by-case Transfer  Impact Assessments (TIAs) for processes that transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to suppliers in third countries in order to  confirm  an  adequate  level  of  data  privacy  is  maintained.  We designed a TIA template in our privacy management platform, which was rolled out to all our operating entities in the EEA to ensure such assessments are conducted in a consistent, semi-automated way.\n\nIn committing to the highest standards of data protection, we believe the maintenance of a state-of-the-art privacy program needs to be supported by diligent and continuous monitoring and assurance activities. Privacy reviews require every operating entity, global line, and regional office to undergo a rigorous examination of the design,\n\nimplementation, and effectiveness of its local privacy program and related process and controls. The frequency of these reviews is based on risk, but they are carried out at least once every five years. As of the end of 2023, we have conducted 22 privacy reviews, including joint reviews with Information Security and peer Data Protection Officers (DPOs). This is a 37 % increase compared to 2022 and concludes the five-year privacy review cycle.\n\nFor  further  information  on  our  commitment  to  data  privacy, please refer to the section '05.1.2' in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website.\n\nOur aim is to maintain stakeholder trust and position Allianz  as a leader in conducting data-driven business in a trustworthy and ethical manner. This includes elevating data ethics as well as selected data and analytics-related topics in the governance and decision-making processes of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe strive for a responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our business activities based on a strong AI Governance Framework . This includes  ensuring  a  human-centric  approach  in  our  usage  of  AI systems. For each AI system, an appropriate level of human control must  be  determined  according  to  the  inherent  risks  of  harm  for individuals as part of a Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessment.\n\nEnsuring compliance with current and upcoming regulations and embedding best practices in anticipation of regulatory change are also high priorities in fulfilling our data ethics commitments.\n\nFollowing its establishment in 2021, the Data Advisory Board (DAB) has continued its work to elevate and integrate data ethics into governance and decision-making, as well as to support the positioning of  Allianz  as both a leading insurer and investor in the data ethics space and wider sustainability efforts. In 2023, the DAB monitored the final implementation of the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI in OEs that are members of the Renewal Agenda Committee.\n\nFurthermore, emerging risks regarding generative AI have been addressed  by  dedicated  guidelines  in  further  development  of  the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI. Training led by Group Privacy and Group  Data  Analytics  has  been  expanded  to  target  a  broader employee base as well as employees who develop and/or use AI in applicable OEs.\n\nFor further information on our commitment to data ethics, please refer to the section '05.1.3' in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on\n\nthe Allianz company website .",

The Allianz Sustainability Board oversees human rights due diligence for the  Allianz Group, while Global Sustainability seeks to continuously improve human rights related governance.\n\nThe human rights that Allianz is  committed to respecting are those agreed by governments in:\n\n- -The International  Bill  of  Human  Rights : This  consists  of  the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights;  the  International Covenant  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  Rights;  and  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols.\n\n- -The core  International  Labor  Organization  (ILO)  Conventions : These  include  the  prohibition  of  child  labor  and  forced  labor; freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to  collective  bargaining; occupational health and  safety; and  the  elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nAllianz has been a member of the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002 and uses the UNGC principles to guide its business activities. These  principles  cover  human  rights,  labor  rights,  environmental protection, and anti-corruption. For further information on Allianz's Communication on Progress, please refer to the UNGC website .\n\nAllianz aims to identify, prevent, mitigate, or remediate adverse human rights impacts linked to our business activities and operations, including in our supply chain. Our approach is guided by the OECD Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises and  the U.N.  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP).\n\n## Human rights in our own operations and supply chain\n\nAllianz SE has been subject to the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCA) since 1 January 2023. GSCA applies to large companies\n\npolicies and due diligence approach on a wide range of human rights risks, including child labor, forced labor, and slavery. Until further regulatory clarification, Allianz will continue to publish, on the Allianz\n\nbased in Germany and their 'own business area'. The own business area  of  Allianz SE  (as  the  holding  company  of  the  Allianz Group) encompasses  all  entities  that  are  part  of  the  Allianz  System  of Governance,  irrespective  of  location.  Therefore,  our  GSCA  risk management  covers  all  those  Allianz  entities  and  their  suppliers worldwide.\n\nFor  further  information,  please  refer  to  the  Allianz  Policy Statement on Human Rights 1 on the Allianz company website .\n\nAs part of GSCA implementation, Allianz has implemented further due diligence procedures that are appropriate to ensure that risks to the human rights of people working for Allianz or for our suppliers, and those whose human rights may otherwise be directly affected by the economic activities of Allianz or its suppliers are minimized, and that breaches are remedied promptly and adequately.\n\nAt the heart of our due diligence processes are annual and adhoc analyses of human rights risks in our own operations and supplier base worldwide. If risks are identified, we take appropriate measures to minimize them. If human rights violations are identified, we take immediate remedial action to address those violations, in line with our influence on respective suppliers.",

At Allianz, we expect employees to support and adhere to human rights in alignment with international standards. For further information, please refer to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct on the\n\n## Allianz company website .\n\nFurther  measures  have  been  implemented  to  minimize  risks  to relevant human rights and labor standards in our own operations. These include:\n\n- -The protection of human rights has been enshrined in our internal corporate rules, depending on local laws and requirements.\n- -Anonymous feedback tools and surveys give our employees the opportunity  to  evaluate  issues  such  as  workload,  wages,  and diversity.\n- -Extensive measures have been put in place to ensure the physical safety of employees, as well as to improve their health and wellbeing.\n\nWe at Allianz  expect all our suppliers to act with integrity and to respect the rights of their own employees and other people who may be affected by the supplier's business activities. These expectations are embedded  in  our Vendor  Code  of  Conduct and Sustainable\n\n## Procurement Charter\n\n.\n\nAllianz has established a worldwide complaints mechanism that is open to Allianz employees, the employees of our suppliers, and other people whose rights might be impacted by Allianz's operations and business activities.\n\n## Human rights in our business activities\n\nAs a corporate insurer and investor, our human rights due diligence process  forms  part  of  our  overall  sustainability  approach  which  is integrated into our broader risk management system.\n\nWe use a combination of sector and country-specific approaches to identify human rights risks.\n\nHuman rights-related due diligence has been integrated into all sensitive business areas where relevant, to ensure that human rights are part of the overall risk assessment for insurance and investments in non-listed asset classes.\n\nWe  maintain  a  mandatory  referral  list  for  sensitive  countries where  systematic  human  rights  violations  occur.  For  business transactions  located  in  these  countries,  we  carry  out  explicit  due diligence in accordance with our Human Rights Guideline that covers various human rights violations.\n\nWhen  a  human  rights  risk  is  identified  by  an  underwriter  or investment manager, a mandatory referral process starts for further due diligence by sustainability experts and the involvement of central units such as the risk and communication departments.\n\nWhere  an  issue  is  detected  and  the  (re)insurer/investor  has leverage,  engagement  is  encouraged  to  address  and  mitigate  a potential human rights risk.\n\nIf no mitigation measures exist or if leverage cannot be increased, and the risk is determined to be unacceptable, Allianz  declines to engage in the business transaction.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the Allianz Sustainability Integration Framework and chapter '02' in our Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\nObjectives and actions: regulatory requirements\n\n| Topic                    | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                | Progress and actions 2023                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| German Supply  Chain Act | - Appropriate due diligence  processes for the own  operations and global  supply chain of Allianz SE,  with the objective to identify  and minimize human rights  risks and certain  environmental risks | -Risk analyses conducted in  own operations and supply  chain, using a risk-based  approach  - Group Human Rights Officer  monitored Allianz risk  management  - Human rights policy |\n\n## Employee matters\n\nAll  employee  matters  are  managed  by  the  People  and  Culture function at Allianz Group level and across all Allianz operating entities.

Our Group People and Culture strategy is based on fulfilling this purpose and on our employer value proposition ' We care for tomorrow ', staying true to  our  brand  promise  of  expressing  confidence  in  tomorrow,  and putting our customers at the center of what we do. This is what drives our  decisions  and  actions  and  we  do  it  in  line  with  our  people attributes: Entrepreneurship, Customer & Market Excellence, Trust, and Collaborative Leadership.\n\nOur ambition is to be the top employer in the financial services industry  globally.  We  work  to  attract  top  talent  and  support  our employees  on their growth and development journey, delivering a strong  business  impact  and  making  a  positive  social  contribution wherever we operate.\n\nTo reach this ambition, we have based our People and Culture strategy on three pillars:\n\n- 1. The Employees and Candidates pillar includes all our strategic priorities that enable us to attract top talents and to engage, retain, and develop our employees. Strong employee engagement is important to us,  and we foster a culture and working environment where people and performance matter. We ensure  lifelong  learning  and  are  committed  to  growing  and developing  our  people  to  be  prepared  for  the  future.  Fair remuneration as well as health and safety for our employees are of utmost importance. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of flexible work options.\n\n2.\n\n- The Business pillar  includes our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)  engagement  and  Strategic  Workforce  Planning  (SWP) initiative, which fuel our business to deliver on Allianz's strategic goals.

Strategic Workforce Planning, on the other hand, aims to understand  workforce  development  in  response  to  global megatrends and how we can equip our workforce with the skills they need for today and for the future.\n\n- 3. The Brand and Society pillar displays the contribution our People and Culture function makes to business and society and that we create  positive  social  impact.  Our  contribution  is  verified  and acknowledged by external certifications like Great Place to Work\u00ae (GPTW)  and  EDGE  as  well  as  global  rankings  like  Refinitiv. Furthermore, we engage with the World Economic  Forum, for instance,  as  a  member  of  the  Good  Work  Alliance  for  a  more resilient,  equitable,  inclusive,  and  humane  future  of  work.  Our People  and  Culture  operations  contribute  to  generating sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  and  help  to  deliver  on  U.N. Sustainable Development Goal 8, 'Decent work and Economic growth'.\n\nPolicies  are  instrumental  in  implementing  our  Group  People  and Culture strategy. We consider our established Allianz Corporate Rules as policies according to the ESRS' policy definition. At Allianz, we are committed  to  respecting  the  human  rights  outlined  in  the  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the principles and rights set out in the eight  fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organization (ILO) on Fundamental Principles and  Rights  at  Work,  and  the  International  Bill  of  Human  Rights. Furthermore,  Allianz  explicitly  supports  the  goal  of  observing  and implementing the fundamental rights of these external charters. For further  information,  please  refer  to  the  section  'Compliance/anticorruption and bribery matters', the section 'Collective bargaining and social dialogue', and the section 'Human Rights in own workforce'.\n\nThe Allianz Group  Code  of  Conduct reflects  our  values  and principles  and  thus  guides  our  employees  in  their  actions  and\n\ndecisions. How we act, how we operate, and the decisions that we make are focused on caring for each other and treating everyone fairly and with respect. The Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as the health and safety of our employees and clearly commits to a zero-tolerance policy toward discrimination, bullying, or harassment. For further information on the Allianz Group Code of Conduct, please refer to the section 'Compliances/anti-corruption and bribery matters'.\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Human Resources (ASHR) establishes core rules and principles for People and Culture management, and it specifies the role of the respective Group People and Culture functions including professional, organizational, and procedural requirements. The People and Culture function is committed to these principles and acts as a service provider for the business. The Standard applies to the entire  Allianz Group  except  Allianz  Asset  Management  companies which  are  covered  by  separate  standards  aligning  the  general principles outlined in the  ASHR. The following People and Culture topics  are  covered  by  the  ASHR:  Learning  and  development  and performance management (for further information, please refer to the section 'Learning and development and performance management') and health and safety (for further information, please refer to the subsection 'Health and safety'). The ASHR is reviewed once a year and considers interests of key stakeholders, particularly Allianz SE Group centers.  Material  changes  must  be  approved  by  the  respective Allianz SE Board Member in charge of People and Culture. The ASHR will be reviewed in 2024 and updated due to the requirements of CSRD and the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, for instance.\n\nThe Allianz Group Remuneration Policy establishes the general and specific basic principles of the remuneration system. It defines processes  related  to  performance  evaluation,  the  remuneration system (including remuneration plans), and corresponding roles and responsibilities.\n\nCompliance with the Group Remuneration Policy is mandatory within the Allianz Group. The implementation of the policy is guided by the  principle  of  proportionality,  taking  into  account  the  nature  of business, size, complexity, and regulation of the respective operating entity. This principle of proportionality only applies to the 'how' and not to the 'if' of the implementation.\n\nThe  Group  Remuneration  Policy  is  reviewed  once  a  year  in accordance with the regulatory requirements under Solvency II  and\n\napproved by the Allianz SE Board of Management. The review process considers  the  interests  of  key  stakeholders,  particularly  Allianz SE Group centers.\n\nGroup  People  and  Culture  ensures  consistent  implementation and application of the Group Remuneration Policy. Each operating entity concerned is obliged to provide a Statement of Accountability to the management of Allianz SE to confirm local implementation of the Group  Remuneration  Policy.  Both  the  ASHR  and  the  Group Remuneration Policy are published in the Allianz Corporate Rule Book.\n\nOur Allianz  Functional  Guidelines  for  Diversity,  Equity,  and Inclusion (DEI) describe our strategy, rationale, and principles for DEI. They show which targets and ambitions we have set ourselves, and how we implement and monitor those targets. In 2023, we published an  update  that  includes  our  2024  Diversity,  Equity,  and  Inclusion targets and ambitions. The Guidelines are applicable to the entire Allianz Group  except  Allianz  Asset Management companies, which have  their  own  initiatives  to  promote  equal  opportunity.  Our Functional Guidelines for DEI describe our commitments to the U.N. Women's Empowerment Principles, the U.N. Free & Equal LGBTQ+ Standards of Conduct, and membership of the Valuable 500.\n\nOur Allianz  Global  Anti-Harassment  &  Anti-Discrimination Functional  Guideline outlines  our  global  zero-tolerance  standard against harassment (including but not limited to sexual harassment) and discrimination. We encourage employees to speak up in line with our open communication and feedback culture and to use the Allianz Group's whistleblowing channels. For further information, please refer to  the  section  'Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters'.  To reflect important changes, both the Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI  and  the  Anti-Harassment  &  Anti-Discrimination  Functional Guideline are updated  by  the  respective  departments  and subsequently approved by the Group People and Culture Officer.\n\nAll mentioned policies are reviewed once a year.  If one of the mentioned policies or single items within the policy are in conflict with local law or regulations, the local law or regulations will prevail.\n\nBeyond  policies,  it  is  crucial  that  targets  and  ambitions  are implemented  according to our Group People and Culture strategy.

For further information, please refer to  the Allianz  company\n\n## website\n\n.\n\nAllianz SE, as the holding company of the Allianz Group, has been subject  to  the  Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz  (German  Supply Chain  Act  (GSCA))  since  January 2023.  The  GSCA  requires  us  to establish worldwide risk management systems concerning the human rights of our own employees and the employees of our suppliers, amongst others.\n\nIn our own operations, Allianz has established a risk management system that is designed to identify, analyze, and prioritize risks to the human rights of employees. Allianz will continue to further rollout and strengthen these processes over the course of 2024.\n\nAmong protected rights listed in the GSCA, the risk categories that are most relevant for our own operations are: occupational health and safety, equal treatment (which includes DEI and equal pay), freedom of association / collective bargaining, and adequate / living wages.\n\nIf  risks are identified, we  take preventive measures  to mitigate those risks. If violations are found, Allianz is legally obliged to remedy them promptly. The effectiveness of measures is regularly reviewed.\n\nOur  risk  management  system  also  encompasses  an  annual (public)  Policy  Statement  on  Human  Rights,  a  global  complaints mechanism ( SpeakUp@Allianz ), independent monitoring through the Group Human Rights Officer, and an annual (public) report to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control.\n\nThe section '1 st Strategic Pillar: Employees and Candidates' outlines the topics engaging with own workforce, learning and development and  performance  management,  fair  remuneration,  benefits,  social protection,  health  and  safety,  work-life  balance,  and  collective bargaining and social dialogue.\n\n## Engaging with own workforce\n\nListening and engaging with our employees are the cornerstones of implementing our People and Culture strategy. The member of the Board  of  Management  responsible  for  People  and  Culture  is accountable for developing our framework for listening to employees and steering activities to ensure progress towards implementation of our ambition and reaching our ambitions. Operational responsibility is assigned to the Global People and Culture Officer and Local Human Resources Directors. Our employee listening framework consists of the annual Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) and biannual Pulse surveys.\n\nThe AES is our well-established employee platform for gathering employee feedback globally and has been in place since 2010. Our two  key  indicators  recorded  with  the  survey  are  the  Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) and the Work Well Index+ (WWI +). The IMIX measures our progress in building a culture where both people and performance matter, meaning that we enable employees to unlock their full potential. The IMIX score is derived out of a basket of ten questions. In 2023, the IMIX increased by 2 percentage points to 81 % (2022: 79 %). Improvements in our IMIX scores demonstrate that we are making  progress  in  the  areas  of  leadership,  performance,  and corporate culture.\n\nThe WWI + measures employee well-being. A higher index score is associated with higher employee well-being. The WWI+ score rose by + 5pp to 76 % (2022: 71 %). For further information, please refer to the section 'Health and safety'.\n\nThese positive 2023 results were achieved against the backdrop of deteriorating scores of external global benchmarks. We consider\n\nthese good results to be a positive reflection of our ongoing follow-up activity in the aftermath of the survey and our efforts to continuously enhance  the  employee  experience.  Each  Allianz  entity  thoroughly analyzes its results to gain an in-depth insight and agree on effective action plans with their teams. In addition, we expanded our global Engagement  Matters  program  in  2023.  This  initiative  provides frameworks of measures to increase employee engagement, offering support to all entities in identifying initiatives to implement on a global and local level in response to the feedback received. The focus areas identified are connected locally and globally so that Allianz operating entities can work on impactful measures.\n\nThe AES results are directly linked to the performance targets of the Allianz Board of Management. We aim to achieve an IMIX score above 75 % and WWI+ development against previous year and overall ambition level in 2024.\n\nOur  global  Pulse  surveys  constitute  the  second  employee listening channel. Pulse surveys took place in the first  and second quarters of 2023 to check the impact of engagement plans and ask our employees about focus topics including Sustainability, Health and Safety, Personal Development and Risk Culture.\n\nOur  efforts  in  engaging  with  our  employees  have  been recognized  with  awards  and  certifications.  In  2023,  we  proudly achieved  GPTW  certifications  at  43  entities  across  26  countries, marking a substantial leap from 15 entities certified in 2022. Allianz also  reached  a  commendable  82 %  in  the  Trust  Index  and  further narrowed the gap to the 86 % score required for Top 25 World's Best Workplaces. Moving forward, our ambition is to increase the number of  GPTW-certified  entities  as  well  as  the  number  of  OEs  on  the National Best Workplace lists.\n\nFor further information on our processes for engaging with our workforce, please refer to the section 'Collective bargaining and social dialogue'.\n\n## Learning and development and performance management\n\nThis  section  addresses  the  strategic  sub-section  Training  and  skills development including Performance management.\n\n## Training and skills development\n\nLearning  and  development  is  a  key  differentiator  in  the  financial services industry where customer  need are constantly changing in response to a rapidly evolving external context, as observed in various industries.

Allianz is committed globally to employee lifelong learning and development.\n\nTo live up to this commitment, we offer global learning through our global #learn initiative. We have set up programs targeted to key areas,  such  as  property  and  casualty,  life  and  health,  IT,  strategy, finance,  sustainability,  communications,  market  management,  and operations. Allianz operating entities have access to global and local offers  as  part  of  their  broader  action  plans  to  support  employee learning and development.\n\nA special focus in 2023 was put  on the topics of IT, data,  and artificial intelligence. We offered generative AI and ChatGPT training to  all managers  with the  aim of explaining  the new technology to Allianz leaders and in order to develop relevant use cases for Allianz. More than a thousand managers took part in the training between October  and  December 2023.  Additionally,  we  held  the  inaugural global Fit4IT day in 40 operating entities, covering approximately 85 % of  employees.  Our  employees  were  able  to  invest  half  a  day  in upskilling, familiarizing themselves with various IT tools.\n\nWe are also proud of our Allianz Sustainability Training for all our employees  which  covers  the  basics  on  sustainability  -  why  it  is important and what Allianz is doing to integrate sustainability into our business  model  -  and  offers  inspiration  on  how  employees  can contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nWe  employ  a  wide  range  of  learning  and  development approaches including on-the-job learning, mentoring and coaching, classroom trainings, peer circles, and digital learning. We encourage employee learning in all formats, and all are included in the learning hours reported. The total hours reported in table 'S1-13.1' thus include self-directed learning (such as videos and podcasts) as well as other, alternative,  learning  formats  (such  as  coaching),  which  together account for 32.08 % of total learning hours.\n\nWe have a strong focus on digital learning. Through our digital learning ecosystem, employees are able to source learning both from our  AllianzU learning platform powered by Degreed and LinkedIn Learning.  Our  internally  developed  global  learning  offers  are\n\navailable  in  five  languages  and  are  available  to  all  employees. Learning consumption is measured globally on a monthly basis.\n\nDeveloping our leaders is of the utmost importance to us. We run five global programs every year to develop strong leaders:\n\n- -#lead Ignite is targeted at new people leaders who qualify as potential or new Allianz executives. It aims to equip them with the knowledge, mindset, and skills needed to lead at Allianz.\n- -#lead Empower develops the leadership capabilities needed for leaders  at  the  future  and  recently  identified  Allianz  Senior Executive  level  to  make  the  transition  from  leading  teams  to leading leaders and the business.\n- -#lead Transform was created for future and recently appointed top  executives.  The  program  is  built  around  our  core  #lead mindsets: curiosity, resilience, 'we-mentality', and flexibility.\n- -#lead Accelerator prepares future and current board members for leading the organization with strategic project work, board exposure, peer coaching, and external insights.\n- -#sheleads sets  the  standard  for  effective  gender  balance  via sponsorship, peer coaching, and learning sessions with our alumni community. The program enables our female leaders to make their next career move.\n\nIn addition to the global programs, all leaders are encouraged to obtain the Allianz Leadership Passport, which is the 'license' to be a people  leader  at  Allianz  globally.  The  program  sets  minimum standards for all people leaders, with an equal focus on hard and soft skills,  for  our  leaders  to  balance  IQ  and  EQ.  After  obtaining  their Leadership Passport, leaders must refresh their passports on a yearly basis by undertaking further training. Monitoring and reporting on the take up of the #lead passport as well as the five global programs is managed globally by Group People and Culture. We monitor usage and learning consumption on a monthly basis.\n\nTo achieve our commitment to employee lifelong learning, Allianz set  the global target of a yearly minimum average of 43 hours of training per employee by 2024. In 2023, our employees learned on average for 50.01 hours, as reported in table 'S1-13.1'. Additionally, a commitment  to  lifelong  learning  is  included  in  the  Board  of Management  targets  for  2024.  To  support  strong  performance  in current and future responsibilities, employee upskilling and development, we offer them a minimum of one hour working time per week dedicated to training.\n\nThe  training  hours  per  employee  metric  is  monitored  on  a quarterly basis.\n\n## Average training hours per employee, broken down by gender (S1-13.1)\n\n| As of 31 December                |   2023 |\n|----------------------------------|--------|\n| Average training hours 1         |  50.01 |\n| Female                           |  47.52 |\n| Male                             |  52.67 |\n| Not reported as female or male 2 |  69.99 |\n\n## Performance management\n\nAt Allianz, we are committed to developing and growing our people, including  through  performance  management.  Our  performance management  aims  both  to  enhance  the  employees'  individual performance  and  to  align  their  priorities  with  Allianz's  corporate purpose and strategic business goals. Setting priorities properly and conducting  regular  check-ins  enables  employees  to  let  their  full potential  unfold,  which  in  turn  helps  Allianz  achieve  its  business ambitions.  Performance  management  is  an  ongoing,  continuous process of communicating on-the-job priorities, performance expectations, and development goals.\n\nThe framework for Performance Management is implemented within the Allianz Group, documented in the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy .\n\nThe global People and Culture template on our leading People and Culture IT system enables the consistent application of the key steps making up the performance management cycle. The template is available  to  both  the  executive  and  non-executive  employee populations. Execution and outcomes of the Performance Management  process  are  subject  to  local  legal  regulations  and respective  governance  bodies,  e.g.,  local  or  global  Compensation Committees.\n\nThe key steps of the Performance Management Process at Allianz can be described as follows:\n\n- -Priority setting is the initial kick-off of the annual performance management  cycle  and  refers  to  setting  clear,  transparent, outcome-oriented, and flexible goals to be achieved throughout the year while giving guidance on desired behaviors.",

        "page_content": "- -Mid-year check-in is the time to request and provide feedback for the first half of the year. Line manager and employee reflect on priorities  and  behaviors,  and  agree  on  joint  measures  to continuously improve performance through development opportunities  on  the  job  and  off  the  job.  Mid-year  check-in  is supported by our Multi-Rater feedback process. The Multi-Rater feedback  is  a  tool  for  getting  360-degree  feedback  from colleagues.  It  is  mandatory  for  Allianz's  executive  population, whereas  implementation  for  the  non-executive  population  is subject to the local rules and regulations of our operating entities. Based on the 'People Attributes', Multi-Rater provides employees with  valuable  insights  into  their  strengths  and  developmental areas.\n- -The Personal Development Plan (PDP) lays out the employee's yearly development goals. Employees are expected to agree with their manager on their individual development measures, usually during  the  mid-year  review  discussion.  The  PDP  helps  the employee  record  and  track  progress  towards  their  own development goals. The 2023 target of 80% PDP completion by the  Allianz  executive population was achieved, as displayed in table 'S1-13.2'. The same target is set for 2024. For the Allianz nonexecutive population, the 2024 target is a 60% PDP completion rate.\n- -Year-End-Review is the assessment of individual performance of an employee by the line manager at the end of each year. The assessment is based on a 3-point rating scale: below, at, or above target.  The  overall  individual  performance  of  an  employee  is reflected in the Individual Performance Assessment.\n- -Performance  and  Talent  Dialogue is a  calibration  of  an employee's  individual  performance  on  the  basis  of  crosscomparison  within  the  relevant  population.  This  ensures  the application of consistent performance  standards  and  an appropriate level of differentiation  with close attention to nondiscrimination of employees in any regard.\n- -Communication of final Individual Performance Assessment is the feedback discussion between the line manager and employee, which normally takes place in 1Q of the following year and seeks a common understanding of accomplishments and development opportunities.\n\n## Allianz Executives and levels above 3,4 (AE+) with a Personal Development Plan (PDP), broken down by gender (S1-13.2) in %\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                                                 | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Executives with a PDP 1                                                                                           | 83.87  |\n| % of male executives with a PDP out of all male executives                                                        | 83.31  |\n| % of female executives with a PDP out of all female executives                                                    | 84.94  |\n| % of not reported as female or male executives with a PDP out of  all executives not reported as female or male 2 | -      |\n\n## Fair remuneration, benefits, and social protection\n\nThis section summarizes the topic of Adequate Wages and outlines the strategic topic Fair  remuneration. Furthermore, we will address  the topics Benefits and Social Protection.\n\n## Adequate wages\n\nIn accordance with the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy ,  internal and external benchmarking is performed to ensure appropriateness of (individual) remuneration and general pay levels. Allianz expects all operating  entities to follow the principles described  in  the Allianz Group Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Fair remuneration\n\nThe  Allianz  is  committed  to  equity  and  fairness  as  defined  in  our Allianz Group  Code  of  Conduct.  This  includes  ensuring  Allianz operating entities enforce equal pay for equal work in the same or comparable  roles  for  all  genders.  This  principle  is  outlined  in  our Allianz Group  Remuneration  Policy .  An  annual  global  equal  pay review across the organization identifies equal pay gaps which can be mitigated with appropriate action.\n\nIn addition to equal pay, there is also a gender pay gap to be considered.  This consists of the difference in average remuneration between men and women across a whole organization, irrespective of role or seniority. If one gender is more represented in higher paid, senior roles in one organization, for example, there will be a gender pay  gap.  Allianz  takes  several  actions  to  foster  gender  equity  in representation and thus close the gender pay gap. One important action is the ambition to have higher female representation in senior\n\npositions. To reach our gender representation targets, we monitor the percentage  of  our  female  employees  on  a  quarterly  basis  and implement  concrete  actions  towards  target  achievement.  We  also foster  best  practice  exchange  among  operating  entities  to  drive gender  equality  in  representation  (see  also  the  section  'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)').\n\nTo  measure  our  progress  towards  equity  and  fairness  and  to continue to move forward on our journey, in 2021 we launched the EDGE (Economic Dividends for Gender Equality) certification process for our insurance business segment and several global lines, currently covering  73 %  of the Allianz Group's global headcount. EDGE is the leading  standard  for  diversity,  equity,  and  inclusion  and  monitors companies' progress on gender equality against established criteria, including equal pay. We are proud that Allianz has been recertified by EDGE in 2023.\n\n## Benefits\n\nReward and recognition at Allianz go beyond remuneration. Allianz also supports its employees around the world with attractive benefits. This shows that we care about employees' Health, Money, Career, and Time and support them to find professional and personal fulfillment.\n\nOur  Global  Benefits  Strategy  for  the  insurance  business  is structured  around  these  four  pillars.  We  introduced  minimum standards for benefits available to employees across Allianz  in  1Q 2023,  and  we  expect  our  global  rebranding  and  communication campaign to further increase the transparency and visibility of Allianz benefits among employees in 2024.\n\nBenefits take economic, environmental, and social factors into account, and incentives are oriented towards creating long-term value and financial protection. The Allianz Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)  for  instance  offers  employees  Allianz  shares  at  favorable conditions in 43 countries, allowing them to benefit from the success of the  company  and  its  long-term  performance.  As  a  token  of appreciation for meeting previous year Group targets, Allianz offered one Allianz Free Share - or its cash equivalent in countries that do not offer the ESPP - to employees globally in 2023.\n\nFor further information on employee benefits, please refer to our People Fact Book 2023 and our Global recruiting homepage .",

        "page_content": "## Social protection\n\nWe operate in countries where our employees have at least access to social protection programs against loss of income due to major life events: sickness, unemployment, employment injury, parental leave, and retirement. In countries where social protection is not provided through public social security schemes, we aim to close potential gaps through additional offerings. Best practice examples are our entities in the United States, where Allianz provides health insurance benefits, or India, where we provide paternity, and carer leave options. 1\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe health, safety, physical, and mental well-being of our employees is a top priority. We aim to sustain and improve employee health and well-being across our global workforce. Two key levers to achieve this ambition are our Minimum  Health  Requirements and our Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system.\n\nThe four Minimum Health Requirements are:\n\n- 1. Professional  Support: Allianz  offers  employees  24/7  free  of charge  access  to  professional  psychological  support  through Employee Assistance Programs.\n- 2. Leadership Enablement: Allianz offers targeted health and wellbeing  training  for  people  leaders,  through  both  the  #lead program and other platforms to ensure managers are equipped with the knowledge to sustain employee health and well-being as well as to strengthen resilience in their teams.\n- 3. Employee Feedback: Employees have the opportunity to give once a year feedback  on their health and well-being through global surveys, such as Pulse surveys. For further information, please refer to the section 'Engaging with own workforce'.\n- 4. Focus Time: Meeting-free calendar days have been introduced to provide most employees with time to focus on their work.\n\nThe  four  Minimum  Health  Requirements  are  reinforced  by  the 'Agreement  on  Guidelines  concerning  Work  Related  Stress  and Minimum  Health  Requirements'  between  the  Allianz SE  and  the (European) SE Works Council of Allianz SE. It applies to Allianz SE and its subsidiaries with registered offices in the Member States of the E.U., the contracting states of the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland. All best endeavors will be made to adopt the minimum health requirements across the Allianz Group, where national legislation does not prevent this.\n\nThe minimum health requirements were monitored regularly and reported to both management and employee representatives once a year, which shows our commitment to the well-being of our global workforce.\n\nTo effectively manage OHS matters, most local Allianz  entities have  furthermore  implemented  OHS  management  systems.  They include OHS risk and hazards assessments, dedicated action plans to mitigate these risks as well as emergency actions. Internal inspections take place frequently and progress in reducing and preventing health issues and risks is assessed against targets on a regular basis. This includes  procedures  to  investigate  work-related  injuries,  ill  health, diseases, and incidents. Our workforce is trained regularly to raise awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents.\n\nThe health and safety of our global workforce is measured via our Work Well Index+ (WWI +) and other KPIs.\n\n- -Work Well Index+: To track well-being globally, we refer to the WWI+ index, which monitors the progress of health and well-being throughout the organization. We also use pulse check surveys to check in with employees during the year. For further information, please refer to the section 'Engaging with own workforce'.\n- -Regular monitoring of further health and safety indicators: Local Employee  Assistance  Program  providers  perform  quarterly monitoring  of  additional  indicators,  which  are  reported  to  the Allianz  Board  of  Management  on  a  semiannual  basis.  Finally, CSRD-compliant  KPIs,  covering  work-related  injuries,  ill  health, accidents, fatalities, and days lost (see table S1-14) are monitored annually and serve as a point of reference for the health, safety, and well-being of our global workforce.\n\n## Health and safety (S1-14)\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                    | Unit                         | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|\n| Number of fatalities related to work-related  injuries/ill health                    | #                            | 1      |\n| Number of recordable work-related accidents                                          | #                            | 847    |\n| Rate of recordable work-related accidents                                            | Per one  million  work hours | 3.71   |\n| Cases of recordable work-related ill health 1                                        | #                            | 355    |\n| Number of days lost to work-related injuries/  fatalities/ accidents/ ill health 1,2 | #                            | 16,665 |\n\n## Work-life balance\n\nThis section covers  Flexible working options and  the Family-related leave topic.\n\n## Flexible working\n\nAllianz  offers  a  wide  range  of  offerings.  For  us,  hybrid  working combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of mobile working with the  benefits  of  targeted  collaboration  and  in-person  connection. Flexible  work  options  are  key  for  talent  attraction  and  employee engagement, while regular in-person touch points help us foster team spirit, co-creation, and cross-team exchange.\n\nMost of our employees across the globe have the opportunity to spend a minimum of 40 % of their working hours working from outside the office. Our  global  minimum  offering  provides  a  lot  of empowerment, trust, and flexibility to our local teams to decide what works best for their customers, their business, and their teams. The flexible work offerings therefore differ in our operating entities but for all of them customer centricity and customer needs are the north star.\n\nWe  track  the  actual  employee  time  that  was  spent  working outside the Allianz offices on a bi-annual basis and collect employee feedback in our AES survey. The survey results show that flexible work has been one of the positive drivers for employee engagement in 2023.\n\nFor further information on further flexible work options, please refer to our People Fact Book 2023 on the Allianz company website .",

        "page_content": "## Family-related leave\n\nBeing  a  parent  and  caring  for  family  members  are  important responsibilities. Our Allianz  employees deserve support in fulfilling these  roles  and  keeping  a  positive  work-life  balance.  Allianz  is committed to supporting parents and families by offering childcare facilities,  leisure  activities,  emergency  assistance,  and  other  family services. Family-related leave is specific to countries and usually covers maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers' leave. Allianz  adheres  to  all  statutory  requirements  in  the  countries  we operate in and aims to exceed those standards where possible and appropriate.\n\n## Work-life balance metrics (S1-15) In %\n\n| As of 31 December                                                                     |   2023 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Employees entitled to take family-related leave (share of total  employees)           |  99.07 |\n| Employees that took family-related leave (share of entitled  employees)               |   8.56 |\n| Male (share of employees that took family-related leave)                              |  32.78 |\n| Female (share of employees that took family-related leave)                            |  67.06 |\n| Not reported as female or male (share of employees that took  family-related leave) 1 |   0.16 |\n\n## Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue\n\nWe aim to ensure that employee rights are protected across all Allianz operating entities. Allianz was one of the first companies to create panEuropean worker participation standards and to establish a European SE Works Council under the legislation for Societas Europaea (SE) companies (an agreement concerning the participation of employees in Allianz SE).\n\nThrough  this body  and  the  regular  dialogue  between management and employee representatives and their trade unions, Allianz  ensures  effective  representation  of  all  its  employees  at European level. Our (European) Works Council Executive Committee is  evidence  that  Allianz  endorses  the  establishment  of  employee representatives in its Group  companies  and  welcomes  their cooperation with the trade unions.\n\nEmployee representation is widespread across Europe. The right of  workers  to  establish  workers'  representative  bodies  and  thus negotiate  working  conditions  is  guaranteed  by  law  in  many jurisdictions. The mandate of workers' representatives and the role of the  employer  in  regard  to  collective  bargaining  and  the  social dialogue is very much shaped by local legal requirements.\n\nAllianz supports the principles enshrined in the ILO (International Labour Organization) core conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining. In countries where those principles have been enshrined in local law, we fully respect and implement local rules on trade unions and worker representation. In countries that have not ratified the relevant ILO conventions, we respect the primacy of local laws and look for ways to allow our employees to organize and voice their  interests  vis-\u00e0-vis  management.  Globally,  the  percentage  of Allianz's workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements is 48.46 %.\n\nAccording to CSRD reporting requirements, \"coverage\" includes the number of employees to whom the companies concerned are obliged  to  apply  the  collective  agreements.  Irrespective  of  the obligation, there are a large number of companies that apply the collective agreements and provisions on a voluntary basis.\n\nWe work closely with employee representatives (members of the (European) SE Works Council's Executive Committee and employee representatives  on  the  supervisory  board  of  Allianz SE)  to  support change  implementation,  manage  impacts  on  employees,  and promote  opportunities.  The  'social  dialogue'  is  our  pan-European forum that has existed for over a decade. It supports the progress of our business strategy, our agenda, and our response to the increased pace of change in topics such as the digital revolution. Discussions in 2023 included the Strategic Workforce Planning program.\n\n## Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue (S1-8)\n\n| Collective Bargaining Coverage   | Collective Bargaining Coverage   | Collective Bargaining Coverage                                                              | Social Dialogue                         |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Coverage  Rate                   | Employees - EEA 1                | Employees -  Non-EEA 2                                                                      | Workplace  representation  (EEA only) 1 |\n| 0-19 %                           | -                                | Corporate and  Other 3                                                                      | -                                       |\n| 20-39 %                          | -                                | Asia Pacific                                                                                | -                                       |\n| 40-59 %                          | -                                | Global Insurance  Lines & Anglo  Markets, Iberia &  Latin America,  Middle East and  Africa | -                                       |\n| 60-79 %                          | Germany                          | 4                                                                                           | -                                       |\n| 80-100 %                         | -                                | -                                                                                           | Germany 4                               |\n\n- 1\\_For countries with at least 10 % of Allianz's total number of employees.\n- 2\\_For business segments with at least 10 % of Allianz's total number of employees.\n- 3\\_For further information on Corporate and Other (incl.

Our customers are diverse, and in order to best understand and serve them, our workforce needs to be diverse, too. We believe that diverse teams create better results, show higher resilience, and are more innovative and more productive, provided  they  can  act  in  an  environment  where  everyone  can  be themselves and unique views are appreciated. Being both diverse and inclusive has a positive impact on our business.",

        "page_content": "We are committed to strengthening inclusion in our workplace, by ensuring equal opportunities for all, and shaping a diverse workforce along five DEI dimensions: gender, people  with disabilities, nationalities/ethnicities, generations, and LGBTQ+. With our Allianz Functional  Guidelines  for  DEI and  our Anti-Harassment  &  AntiDiscrimination Functional Guideline , we aim to ensure that across our operating entities and functions there is no discrimination for reasons including  gender,  age,  sexual  orientation,  ethnicity,  nationality, physical or mental abilities, religious beliefs, or social background.\n\nAt Allianz, we want to achieve our targets and ambitions for our DEI dimensions  in a sustainable manner. The key to this is an inclusive workplace  environment.  We  have  multiple  actions  in  place  to strengthen our inclusive workplace environment, such as:\n\n- -Global Inclusion Council: Our Global Inclusion Council (GIC) sets the DEI strategy and plays a crucial role in driving initiatives to achieve  our  targets  and  ambitions,  in  integrating  DEI  into  the business and monitoring progress. The GIC has been in place since 2007 and consists of more than 20 Allianz senior managers from operating entities, Allianz Group Center representatives, and the leads of our five global employee networks for DEI which leads to 81 local network chapters.\n- -DEI Employee Networks : Employee networks enable us to engage with  our  employees.  They  help  us  to  raise  awareness,  support employees, advocate for change, and shape the agenda for DEI. We have five global employee networks: 'Allianz NEO' for gender inclusion, 'Allianz Beyond' for disability inclusion, 'Allianz GRACE' for ethnicity and  cultural inclusion, 'Allianz Engage'  for generational inclusion, and 'Allianz Pride' for LGBTQ+ inclusion. 15 new networks operating locally were added in 2023.\n- -DEI as part of daily business - Mentoring Campaign: At Allianz, DEI is integrated into the way we conduct business. Our global Mentoring Campaign  #KeepExploring, which took place throughout  2023,  championed  an  intersectional  approach featuring  personal  experiences  of  employees  presenting  more than one diversity dimension, e.g. combining different generations with nationalities, and/or genders.\n\nGlobal People and Culture monitor the development of our targets and ambitions on a regular basis and report progress to the Allianz\n\nBoard of Management on a semi-annual basis (for gender, this is done on a quarterly basis). Additionally, we support operating entities in setting up their individual local action plans to reach DEI targets and foster best practice exchange.\n\nThe achievements of our DEI strategy are recognized by external global awards and rankings. For example, Refinitiv - a global Diversity and Inclusion Index - identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces. In 2023, Allianz was ranked #1 in the Insurance industry and #1 in Germany across all industries. Our reputation as a DEI leader strengthens Allianz's brand as a trusted provider of financial services.\n\nFor further information on DEI targets and ambitions, see our DEI Booklet 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Gender\n\nAt Allianz, we have already attained overall numerical gender parity in our workforce with 80,949 female and 73,884 male employees. We are committed to equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, and put measures in place to see this reflected in the staffing of leadership positions. As outlined in our Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI 1 , our 2024 targets are to have 30 % women in Allianz  Global Executive positions, and 30 % women in  Allianz  Senior Executive positions. In addition, we aim to have 40 % women in Allianz Executive positions and 50 % women in our talent pools. For further information, please refer to section  the  'Fair remuneration'. Allianz  NEO, our employee network for gender inclusion currently has 20 local networks in place. Allianz  NEO  focuses  on  helping  to  find  concrete  improvement opportunities,  creating  dialogue  and  allyship,  and  endorsing  new perspectives and novel working models for both women and men.\n\n## Generations\n\nWith five different generations currently working together at Allianz, we are committed to leveraging the combined strengths, individual skills, and experiences of all generations. We aim to have a balanced generational  representation,  where  GenZ  and  GenY  (employees under 35) represent at least 25 % of our global workforce. As of the end of 2023, 34.31 % of our global workforce (see table S1-9.2) is younger than 35, which ensures a balanced generational representation.\n\nOur efforts for age inclusion are strongly supported by Allianz Engage, our employee network for generational diversity with 11 local networks in place. Through Allianz Engage, our employees are invited\n\nto proactively contribute to a company culture where the knowledge of all generations is called upon, for example, through mentoring. In the  Allianz Group,  we  have  more  than  700  mutual  mentoring arrangements in place, allowing people from different generations to enter into mentoring partnerships to connect and to share knowledge, experiences, skills and perspectives in a genuine learning exchange beneficial for everyone involved.\n\n## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (S1-9.1)\n\n| As of 31 December                             | 2023   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                               | #      | %      |\n| Gender distribution                           | -      | -      |\n| in Allianz SE Supervisory Board               | 12     | -      |\n| Male                                          | 7      | 58.33  |\n| Female                                        | 5      | 41.67  |\n| Not reported as female or male 1              | -      | -      |\n| in Allianz SE Board of Management             | 9      | -      |\n| Male                                          | 6      | 66.67  |\n| Female                                        | 3      | 33.33  |\n| Not reported as female or male 1              | -      | -      |\n| in Executive positions (top management) 2     | 6,788  | -      |\n| Male                                          | 4,461  | 65.72  |\n| Female                                        | 2,327  | 34.28  |\n| Not reported as female or male 1              | -      | -      |\n| in Allianz Global Executive (AGE) positions   | 235    | 3.46   |\n| Male                                          | 174    | 74.04  |\n| Female                                        | 61     | 25.96  |\n| Not reported as female or male 1              | -      | -      |\n| in Allianz Senior Executive (ASE) positions 3 | 803    | 11.83  |\n| Male                                          | 579    | 72.10  |\n| Female                                        | 224    | 27.90  |\n| Not reported as female or male 1              | -      | -      |\n| in Allianz Executive (AE) positions 3         | 5,750  | 84.71  |\n| Male                                          | 3,708  | 64.49  |\n| Female                                        | 2,042  | 35.51  |\n| Not reported as female or male 1              | -      | -      |",

It  focuses  on  raising  awareness  of  disability inclusion, identifying ways to make Allianz more accessible (physically and digitally). It also aims at creating a safe space for employees to disclose their disability and voice their workplace assistance needs in order to perform at their best. And it promotes Allianz externally as an attractive employer for people with disabilities.\n\nAllianz  has  been  a  Valuable  500  member  since  2020  and  is committed to increasing transparency on disabilities in the corporate landscape through increased disclosure. As an Iconic Leader, Allianz played a crucial role in the identification and definition of five Valuable 500 Disability Inclusion KPIs. These were announced at the World Economic  Forum  in  2023  and  cover  five  dimensions:  Workforce Representation,  Goals,  Training,  Employee  Resource  Groups,  and Digital  Accessibility.  Allianz  reports  on  the  Valuable  500  Disability Inclusion KPIs in our DEI Booklet 2023 on the Allianz company website and is working with Valuable 500 to secure commitment from other members  to  disclose  Disability  Inclusion  KPIs  and  ultimately  grant people with disabilities more equity in the workplace.\n\nAllianz has been a trusted partner of the Paralympic Movement since  2006  and  became  the  first  international  partner  of  the International  Paralympics  Committee  (IPC)  in  2011.  Through  our continuous support, we recognize the athleticism and professionalism of  Paralympians.  Our  efforts  have  a  positive  impact  on  career opportunities for people with disabilities, including through career fairs\n\nfor Paralympic and Olympic athletes, with tangible results, leading to the hiring of 27 Paralympians and Olympians. For further information, see also our People Fact Book 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\nAllianz  is  committed  to  strengthening  its  inclusive  workplace culture  for  its  entire  global  workforce,  including  employees  with disabilities. For more details regarding our local ambitions, please see our DEI Booklet 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Strategic Workforce Planning\n\nAllianz  has  implemented  Strategic  Workforce  Planning  (SWP)  to create  transparency  on  upcoming  workforce  developments.  SWP compares workforce supply by cluster of job profiles (called Talent Segments) against projected workforce demand over the next five years. At Allianz, this is a structured yearly process that is integrated into the annual planning cycle. The result goes far beyond providing transparency on possible recruiting gaps. We are able to steer the mix of roles that we need in our workforce in order to implement Allianz strategies and fulfil our future vision. SWP provides a quantitative assessment of the resources required for ongoing transformations and indicates how our workforce can be equipped with the skills they need to remain employable in the future.\n\nThis global transparency allows us to decide what to focus our work  on  and  customize  solutions  for  up-  and  reskilling  as  well  as retention and recruiting. SWP currently covers approximately 85 % of our 2023 employee population. Global monitoring and steering using SWP  KPIs  ensures  the  implementation  of  Strategic  Workforce Planning and maximizes its value within the business functions.\n\nGood  working  conditions  along  with  equal  treatment  and  equal opportunities for all are the basis for the CSRD convergence approach discussed  in  this  Employee  matters  section.  These  subjects  are  an integral  part  of  our  brand  value  and  societal  commitments,  as reflected in our ratings.\n\nOur  positive  social  impact  is  verified  and  acknowledged  by external certifications and global rankings (for further information, please  refer  to  Great  Place  to  Work  certification  in  the  section 'Processes to engage with own workforce', EDGE certification in the section  'Fair  remuneration',  and  Refinitiv  in  the  section  'Diversity, equity,  and  inclusion  (DEI)').  Beyond  certifications  and  rankings, Allianz is a member of the Valuable 500 and a trusted partner of the International Paralympics Committee (for further information, please refer to section 'Persons with disabilities'). Allianz is a member of the\n\nWorld Economic Forum Good Work Alliance;  for more information, please refer to the Good Work Alliance website . We are committed to human  rights  (for  further  information,  please  refer  to  the  section 'Human Rights in own workforce'), the U.N. Charter, U.N. SDGs, as well as our external certifications, rankings, and partnerships.\n\nFor further information on our social positioning, please refer to section 'Corporate Citizenship'.\n\n## Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\n\nThis section describes the impact of ethics, responsible business, and compliance  matters  on  the  Allianz Group's  activities.  Further,  it describes the impact of the Allianz Group's activities and relationships on  compliance.  The  concepts  and  achievements  related  to  the management  of  these  impacts  are  described  with  a  focus  on  the compliance  management  system,  anti-corruption,  and  bribery matters.  All  compliance  matters  are  overseen  by  Allianz Group Compliance.\n\nOur Compliance Management System helps to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive  stance,  working  with  organizations  such  as  the  Global Insurance  Chief  Compliance  Officers  Forum  to  enhance  our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\n\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE)  program  was  initiated.  In  2023,  the  Compliance  Function continued to develop the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments.  Review  procedures  have  been  expanded  to  confirm adequate  compliance  scope,  ensure  adequate  skills  to  meet  the scope,  and  confirm  compliance  with  global  programs  and  local specificities.  While  CARE  is  primarily  a  challenged  self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with Compliance Reviews of operating entities that are completed and coordinated by Allianz Group Compliance. Compliance  Reviews  are  completed  on  a  risk-based,  three-yearly cycle.\n\nCompliance  Reviews  are  supplemented  by  Targeted  Reviews, which assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust and Sales Compliance. This multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy has several benefits. First, operating",

Second,  frequent  interactions  with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide, and - if necessary -  enforce remedial activities. Finally, people can learn from local and Group best practices, which further reinforces our compliance culture.\n\nAn online compliance management tool provides an overview of issues detected during the above activities. Users are required to use the tool to report and document actions taken to mitigate and follow up on any issues identified.\n\nThe information gathered is the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the Allianz SE Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee is chaired by Allianz Group Compliance. This committee  reviews  all  activities  and  issues  related  to  misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and the Allianz Group Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\n\nAs  part  of  our Global  Compliance  Program , we  follow international standards and applicable laws in relation to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz-specific rules.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct outlines the basic principles and  values  that  guide  the  everyday  decisions  and  conduct  of  all employees. The current version of the Allianz Group Code of Conduct was approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management in 2020. New joiners at Allianz  are informed of their obligation to adhere to the Allianz Group Code of Conduct. The key principles addressed by the Allianz Group Code of Conduct and the accompanying training are mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\n\nAllianz  has  zero  tolerance  of  fraud.  We  are  committed  to complying  with  all  applicable  anti-fraud,  anti-bribery,  and  anticorruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nZero tolerance applies regardless of who benefits from the fraud Allianz as a company, other internal parties (employees, tied agents, intermediaries) or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz. To protect against fraud, we will take prompt and appropriate action where  necessary  -  against  employees,  others  acting  on  behalf  of\n\nAllianz or third parties. This includes appropriately protecting customer and third-party data.\n\nSimilarly,  Allianz  does  not  tolerate  bribery  and  corruption. Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving anything of value (anything monetary or nonmonetary that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain an improper personal or business advantage.\n\nAnti-corruption  training  must  be  provided  at  least  once  every three years to all employees.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report concerns and have multiple channels  for  doing  so.  These  include  via  management,  speaking directly with Allianz Group Compliance, by e-mail, and anonymously via a third-party solution provided by Business Keeper GmbH and accessible via the intranet.\n\nThe same tool is also accessible to external parties on the Allianz company website . Some operating entities provide employees with the option to report via an ombudsman.\n\nAll reported incidents are assessed, documented, and managed according to internal guidelines and with strict confidentiality. The Allianz Group  has  specific  procedures  in  place  to  ensure  that  no retaliation measures are taken against whistleblowers; reflecting our commitment to enable a healthy SpeakUp culture within the company. Retaliation measures are not accepted in any form.\n\nGroup  Compliance  runs  an  annual  awareness  campaign  to remind employees of the avenues available for reporting.\n\n## Objectives and actions: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\n\n| Topic      | Objectives                                                                                                                                              | Progress and actions 2023              |\n|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Compliance | Continue to enhance the  effectiveness of local  compliance organizations by  enriching our compliance  reviews, to further bolster  the governance and | 2023 Compliance Review  Plan executed. |\n\n## EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is a 'green' classification system that translates the EU's environmental objectives into criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable and the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. The EU Taxonomy Regulation came into effect in 2020 and Allianz is reporting Taxonomy-eligibility for the third year in a row; however, Taxonomy-alignment is reported from the financial year 2023 onwards (described subsequently) only. The EU Taxonomy Regulation intends to provide increased transparency for stakeholders.\n\nOn 21 December 2023, the EU Commission published a guidance on Art. 8 EU Taxonomy Regulation. The document was assessed by Allianz  but  could  not  be  fully  considered  for  the  2023  reporting. 1 Details  about  the  implemented  changes  can  be  found  in  the respective subchapters.\n\n## Allianz's approach to Sustainable Solutions in the Property and Casualty insurance business\n\nWe are regarding the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the broader context of sustainable insurance solutions and are consequently reporting on it in combination with our Sustainable Solutions framework.\n\nIt  is  an  integral  part  of  our  strategy  to  not  only  insure  our customers against risks, but also to support them in their challenges of a world which is about to transition to a more sustainable way of living and doing business. We aim to create real world impact through our business activities and contribute to ESG objectives based on science and  in line with regulatory requirements and  international agreements.  This  is  based  on  the  understanding  that  propertycasualty (P&C) insurance can support multiple ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation. The role of the insurance industry is not limited to the classic role as risk managers but goes beyond and includes the public expectations to accelerate a fair and just transition of economies and societies.\n\nTherefore, we have established a comprehensive framework for Allianz Sustainable Solutions, including guidelines, screening criteria",

Simultaneously,  the  Technical  Screening Criteria are used as guidance for our product development with the objective  to  increase  the  resilience  of  our  insurance  activities  and support our customers in building adaptive capacity.\n\nIn 2023, the first year of Taxonomy-alignment reporting, we have been focusing on screening our existing product portfolio, identifying gaps, working on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, and  have  started  developing  and  implementing  further  new Taxonomy-aligned products.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Regulation for non-life insurance business: Underwriting of climate-related perils\n\nFor  non-life  insurance  activities,  the  Climate  Delegated  Act  has established  'climate  change  adaptation'  as  (the  only)  potential substantial contribution to environmental objectives as laid out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe Climate Delegated Act and the Technical Screening Criteria set forth  therein  predominantly  expect  insurance  activities  to adequately reflect climate-related risks and support customers and society in building resilience against the adverse effects of climate change. It consequently reflects the traditional role of the insurance industry  as  risk  manager.  Only  the  'do  no  significant  harm'  and 'minimum  safeguards'  criteria  set  additional  requirements  for Taxonomy-alignment  beyond  the  contribution  to  climate  change adaptation.\n\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation  does  not  impose  business restrictions  or  material  requirements  for  insurance  activities  but introduces disclosure obligations for the insurance Lines of Business (LoBs) in scope. The disclosure of the proportion of Taxonomy-aligned revenues allows for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios, to channel capital flows towards Sustainable Investments. 1\n\n## EU Taxonomy-eligibility\n\nThe  eight  LoBs  of  non-life  insurance  laid  down  in  the  Technical Screening  Criteria  are  in  scope  of  the  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation ('Taxonomy-eligible'), as the insurance products sold under these LoBs have the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation. We define all P&C LoBs laid down in Annex 2 section 10.1 of the Climate Delegated as eligible and they have been included in the Taxonomyalignment  screening.  The  template  'Taxonomy  KPIs  for  non-life underwriting'  below  also  includes  our  Taxonomy-eligible  and Taxonomy-non-eligible  proportions  for  financial  year  2022.  Since Taxonomy-alignment has been assessed for the first time by Allianz for financial year 2023, the 2022 figures are not applicable for these lines and marked as such.\n\n## EU Taxonomy-alignment\n\nTaxonomy-alignment of an activity goes beyond Taxonomy-eligibility. For non-life insurance business, it implies that the insurance activity substantially  contributes  to  climate  change  adaptation,  does  not significantly  harm  the  environmental  objective  of  climate  change mitigation, is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards, and complies with the Technical Screening Criteria. We have screened our  entire  eligible  non-life  insurance  portfolio  under  the  Article  3 Taxonomy Regulation and the Technical Screening Criteria and are reporting accordingly.\n\nIt  is  in  the  nature  of  new  regulations  that  not  all  details  are specified, and a common understanding and application needs to be developed across markets to achieve consistency and comparability. In order to ensure a consistent application across all Allianz entities, we have developed internal guidelines and also taken a conservative approach, where screening criteria left room for interpretation. The following  illustrates  those  aspects  that  we  deem  to  be  the  most important and challenging:\n\n## Leadership in modeling and pricing of climate risks\n\nState-of-the-art modelling techniques (1.1): Assessing and pricing risks adequately is key for a sustainable and resilient insurance operation. The Allianz approach to state-of-the-art pricing is the Technical Price System as part of our Technical Excellence initiative. In the existing Technical Price Certification (TPC), portfolios are screened on a regular basis across the Allianz Group. A successful TPC requires (but is not limited to), that the technical price is available at policy level. This\n\nincludes the best estimate of all future, expected costs of the risk (including the expected ultimate loss) as a forward-looking scenario. Both  output  from  hazard  mapping  and  NatCat  risk  models  are included in expected claims costs. Where and to the extent that a portfolio meets our internal TPC requirements, we have concluded that predicted costs of climate related hazards are properly reflected in the Technical Price at best estimate.\n\nProvide incentives for risk reduction (1.3): This criterion is based on the fundamental understanding, that the insurer should protect itself and set incentives for customers to protect themselves or their assets, against  the  adverse  effects  of  climate  change.  Therefore,  it  is necessary,  however  sufficient,  if  the  climate-related  exposure  is considered in pricing as a price signal of risk (e.g., hazard zones) or in terms and conditions such as deductibles or limits, that serve as a differentiator for respective exposures.\n\n## Product design\n\nRisk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders (2.1): The  regulator  expects  an  insurance  product  to  include  risk-based rewards for customers to take preventive actions in order to protect themselves or their insured assets against climate change risks. Other than for the previous criterion ('Provide incentives for risk-reduction), differentiation only related to the location of a risk is not sufficient. We define preventive actions as any specific measures that can be taken by customers if they are suitable to reduce either the frequency or severity of climate change related claims. They must be considered in the product and be offered to all customers. Risk-based rewards must be reflected in the technical price, and there has to be a direct relation between the preventive measure taken by the customer, and the riskbased reward granted. Hence, general deductibles which do not refer to  specific  preventive  measures  or  no  claims  discounts  are  not sufficient.\n\nThe distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures (2.2): The regulator sees adaptation to climate change risks as an overall societal objective to which insurers and their customers should contribute, since risk-prevention is a key lever for reducing the overall economic burden. Thus, the distribution strategy must include measures to ensure that customers (new and existing) are informed about the preventive measures and the relevance of such preventive measure  that  they  could  take.

        "page_content": "preventive  measures  can  be  shared  individually  (e.g.,  through customer specific risk assessment reports in commercial business) or in general,  which  is  appropriate  for  retail  business  (e.g.,  through information in newsletters, regular contract related communication or terms  and  conditions).  It  is  also  appropriate  to  briefly  inform  the customers  about  the  topic  and  direct  them  to  more  detailed information, for instance on a company website.\n\n## Do no significant harm ('DNSH') - Climate change mitigation\n\nThe  DNSH  criterion  defines  which  insurance  activities  related  to customers engaged in the fossil fuel value chain must not be classified as sustainable  (Taxonomy-aligned).  We  are  taking  a  mainly conservative  approach  and  define  the  fossil  fuel  value  chain extensively as upstream (e.g., exploration, extraction), midstream (e.g., transport, storage, pipelines) or downstream (e.g., refinery, trading and sales including gas stations) activities or related assets. Additionally, we consider commercially used fossil fuel power plants to be part of the fossil fuel value chain. Beyond that, the end-use of fossil fuels is not in scope of this criterion (e.g., combustion engine vehicles or oil-fired heating systems). Thus, the DNSH criterion is automatically fulfilled for retail business, as private use is considered as end-use.\n\nIn our portfolio screening approach, we applied the International Standard of Industrial Classification of economic activities (ISIC codes) to identify policies which are not in line with the DNSH criterion as defined above: The different ISIC codes have been classified as either compliant with DNSH, not compliant with DNSH or to be assessed on an individual customer level. We have screened our portfolios against this internal classification system. As our commercial risks are allocated to ISIC codes (or comparable national or internal classifications), we could identify policies and revenues which do not comply with DNSH.\n\nThere are no further environmental objectives next to 'climate change mitigation' that insurance activities could significantly harm according  to  the  EU  Taxonomy  Regulation,  meaning  that  an assessment of further DNSH criteria is not applicable. These are still indicated  with  a  'Y'  in  the  template  'Taxonomy  KPIs  for  non-life underwriting' below.\n\n## Minimum Safeguards\n\nTaxonomy-aligned  activities  needs to be carried out in compliance with Minimum Safeguards with respect to the value chain (i.e., with respect  to  policyholders  in  the  insurance  context).  Minimum Safeguards require a due diligence process which is aligned with UN\n\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and OECD Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises.  This  is  ensured  by  our Sustainability referral process governed by the Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM), which applies to insurance transactions following a risk-based approach. For more information on the  Sustainability  referral  process,  please  refer  to  the  Allianz Sustainability  Integration  Framework,  version  5.0  on  the Allianz company website .\n\n## Overall results of EU Taxonomy Screening\n\nFor the financial year 2023 we are reporting a relatively low share of Taxonomy-aligned  revenues.  Risk-based  rewards  for  preventative actions and the respective advice to customers turned out to be the most important aspects.  We have  been focusing on screening our existing  product  portfolio,  identifying  gaps,  working  on  immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, and started developing and implementing further new Taxonomy-aligned products.\n\n## Allianz's Sustainable Solutions\n\nChanging customer expectations and demands as well as regulatory evolution are modifying the role of the insurance industry and require a dedicated strategy to manage the impact of sustainability in P&C Business.  The Principles for Sustainable Insurance published by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) outline a strategic approach where all activities in the insurance value chain - including interactions with stakeholders - are performed in a responsible  and  forward-looking  way  by  identifying,  assessing, managing, and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental and social issues. The sustainability requirements aim to  reduce  risks,  develop  innovative  solutions,  improve  business performance, and contribute to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. 1\n\nAgainst  this  background,  we  developed  an  enhanced  Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework. As a result, our overall approach for assessing  and  classifying  Sustainable  Solutions  was  revised.  The former  Sustainable  Solution  definition  and  its  application  were replaced by the new Sustainable Solutions framework as of January 1 st , 2023. This also enables us to report on Sustainable Solutions based on the new Sustainable Solutions framework for the financial year 2023.\n\nThe  Sustainable  Solutions  framework  is  based  on  regulatory requirements (e.g., the EU Taxonomy Regulation) as an integral part.\n\nHowever, it goes beyond and includes additional product elements which contribute to ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation to support our customers in their transition.\n\nWe  define  a  Sustainable  (P&C  insurance)  Solution  as  an insurance product or service that substantially contributes to climate change adaptation and to one or more further environmental, social, or governance objectives, without doing significant harm to any of the other  objectives,  which  is  in  line  with  the  principles  of  Minimum Safeguards  and  hence  supports  our  customers  in  transitioning towards  an  environmentally  or  socially  sustainable  way  of  doing business or living.\n\nTo ensure compliance across the Allianz Group, the Sustainable Solutions framework is codified in internal policies and applies as a harmonized and mandatory framework for all Allianz P&C entities, including a certification process for sustainable products and services. Eligible objectives  and  suitable  product  elements  have  been predefined. They were derived from the EU Taxonomy Regulation where available 2 - and the United Nation Sustainable Development Goals, and can be summarized as follows:\n\n- -Climate  change  mitigation:  avoid,  reduce  or  remove  GHG emissions.\n- -Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: contribute to good status of water bodies.\n- -Transition to a circular economy: promote durability, re-use and recycling.\n- -Pollution prevention and control: improve quality of air, water, and land.\n- -Protection,  conservation  and  restoration  of  biodiversity  and ecosystems.\n- -Encourage  and  expand  access  to  insurance  and  services  for helpers or socially disadvantaged groups.\n- -Foster socially responsible behavior or engagement.\n\nIn 2023, we generated \u20ac 3,026 mn revenues from certified Sustainable Solutions  in  our  P&C  business.  Hence,  the  Sustainable  Solutions framework contributes to our overall purpose: We secure your future.",

        "page_content": "## Information on data sources for revenue disclosure\n\nData  collection  is  conducted  in  the  Solvency II  P&C  LoB  reporting infrastructure. The system is set up in SAP. Information is based on nonconsolidated LoB reporting.\n\n## Definition of premiums\n\nIn line with the requirements that are set forth by the EU Taxonomy Regulation,  Allianz  follows the principle to use figures as premium base  that  relate  to  financial  reporting  and  are  communicated externally  through  Allianz  financial  statements  -  Total  Business Volume  (TBV).  TBV  presents  a  measure  for  the  overall  amount  of business generated during a specific reporting period. As TBV by itself does not represent a premium related to the insurance coverage (it also includes fee and commission income), the following adjustment has been performed: As fee and commission income are not directly linked to the provision of insurance coverage, they are eliminated to arrive at the coverage related premium figure.\n\nThis  premium  figure  represents  the  required  gross  written premiums level.\n\n## Determination of (retro)ceded premium share\n\nFor natural catastrophe events, the Allianz Group  has a centralized program in place that pools exposures from its subsidiaries through internal  reinsurance  agreements.  Allianz SE  limits  exposures  in  this portfolio through external reinsurance. Subsidiaries of the Allianz Group  generally  do  not  enter  into  individual  external reinsurance agreements for natural catastrophe events. Accordingly, a breakdown into single Taxonomy-aligned products is not available, as indicated in the template below.\n\nThe guidance on EU Taxonomy Reporting 1 published by the EU Commission  in  December 2023  states  that  insurance  undertakings should use those insurance premiums that only pertain to the coverage of  climate-related  perils  for  the  purpose  of  computing  Taxonomyalignment. Hence, only the portion of the premium from Taxonomyaligned  products  related  to  the  exposure  stemming  from  climate related perils could be reported as sustainable revenue. We applied this guidance to calculate the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues.\n\nFor our reinsurance contracts issued (third party), we prepared our systems to report the entire premium of any treaty providing coverage for climate-related perils for financial year 2023 reporting, based on\n\nthe prevailing market practice and interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. With the new requirement to unbundle the premium into solely climate risk related, our systems need further adaptation to systematically allow this premium unbundling in the required quality and could not be done in time for financial year 2023.\n\n## Ensure implementation into our business\n\nOur Sustainable Solutions framework and its application have been integrated into the binding Allianz  Standard for P&C  Underwriting (ASU), which governs the rules and principles for P&C underwriting within the Allianz Group and is an integral part of the overall Group risk architecture as described in the Group Risk Policy.\n\nAs of January 2023, all newly developed products and services must  be  assessed  and  classified  under  the  Sustainable  Solutions framework  in  the  product  development  process  by  our  operating entities. Results are validated by a dedicated function within our Group Center Global P&C, which has the responsibility to approve or not approve submitted products as a sustainable and in case of a positive approval, issue a respective certification.\n\nIn addition, as of January 2024, products or services may only be labeled, advertised, or in any other way promoted as Sustainable Solutions (or any other term that implies the sustainability of a solution, such as 'green' or 'social'), if the product or service is certified under our Sustainable Solutions framework.\n\n## Allianz's actions and measurements\n\nThe  Sustainable  Solutions  framework  incorporates  material  ESG objectives  into  P&C  decision-making  and  portfolio  management processes. We aim to shift our product portfolio towards sustainable products by using the Sustainable Solutions framework as guiding considerations in the product development process.\n\nAllianz  has always offered comprehensive insurance cover for climate-related  perils.  Still,  closing  the  insurance  protection  gap remains  a  major  challenge  in  many  markets.  To  increase  the penetration  rate  of  covers  for  natural  catastrophes,  our  product strategy  is  moving  towards  coverage  for  natural  catastrophes  per default (with opt-out elements).\n\nTo manage climate-related risks adequately, we are continuously improving our risk- and pricing-models by integrating the latest data and information on climate change impacts through forward-looking\n\nNatCat  scenarios  and  global  hazard  maps.  However,  effective adaptation to climate change does not only require adequate pricing of risks, but also individual measures by customers. We have therefore started considering preventative actions taken by the customer in our products and pricing models. Living up to our role as a climate risk manager, we are also integrating advisory services into our customer communication and provide relevant information to customers, for example, on how to build stronger resilience against climate-related events.\n\nIn  addition,  we  are  committed  to  offering  comprehensive insurance  products  for  low-carbon  technologies  -  such  as  battery electric vehicles (BEV) and the related ecosystem -  as well as for renewable  energy  technologies,  to  support  the  transition  of  our customers towards more environment-friendly solutions. For instance, Allianz entities offer BEV insurance products, which meet the specific needs of the new ecosystem such as range anxiety, comprehensive coverage of accessory equipment, and coverage for battery disposal. Within our commercial energy and construction business, we offer insurance to cover the setup, installation, and operation of renewable energy  projects  such  as  solar  and  wind  farms,  both  onshore  and offshore.\n\nMaterial  ESG  objectives  are  also  considered  in  our  claims processes. We have started integrating environmental standards into our claims processes by encouraging or incentivizing our customers, car repair shops, and manufacturers to repair instead of replace or to use refurbished parts, where possible. Moreover, we started increasing our claims payments to our customers to not only rebuild damaged assets  such  as  buildings,  but  to  use  more  sustainable  or  energyefficient building materials or elements (build back better), as well as building more resilience against the adverse effects of climate change (build back stronger).\n\n## Allianz's ambition\n\nOur ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee companies across different sectors in their transition to net zero, as well as to support our customers in their transition to environmentfriendly choices.\n\nThe new Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework was launched in January 2023 across all our entities. This includes qualitative targets for the financial year 2023 for to the Board of Management and CEOs",

This means that for Taxonomy reporting as an investor in other undertakings, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Where the Allianz Group fully controls a non-financial investment - including real estate - the scope is not limited in that regard.\n\nThe eligibility and alignment share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries,  NFRD-related  investments,  and  non-NFRD  funds  that may have underlying NFRD investments or non-financial assets. For controlled investments and mortgages with property as collateral,\n\nAllianz has three main asset classes: real estate held for investment, commercial  and  retail  mortgages,  and  renewable  investments. Allianz's minority interest investments in investees are mostly through publicly listed stocks and bonds. Eligibility for Allianz's controlled assets has been determined for all six environmental objectives that are listed in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Alignment reporting is produced for the  two  published  environmental  objectives  of  climate  change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAs in 2022, all real estate asset classes including mortgages are considered 100 % eligible, with the addition in 2023 of joint ventures in real estate. For further information, please refer to section 'Changes to proprietary  investment  reporting'.  Eligibility  (and  alignment)  for Allianz investments in investees is attained via reported data provided by Moody's Analytics.\n\nThe focus of Taxonomy reporting for 2023 is alignment, which is a step beyond eligibility. For an asset to be aligned, three steps are necessary, which is first, the substantial contribution to one or more\n\nenvironmental  objectives  in  line  with  specific  Technical  Screening Criteria,  second,  meeting  the  DNSH  criterion  (related  to  the  other environmental objectives) and third, meeting the minimum safeguards criteria. Naturally, eligibility is a prerequisite for alignment.\n\nAlignment  screening  relates  to  the  first  two  climate  change objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Allianz has attained a relatively low alignment quota from screening our  own  portfolio.  The  main  constraints  included  lack  of  data availability for commercial mortgages, and lack of comparative data for real estate held for investment (typically for Energy Performance Certificates  determined  on  demand  data  that  could  not  be benchmarked to the top 15 % of real estate stock).\n\nFor retail mortgage loans especially, Allianz  uses a third-party provider (SkenData) that employs an EU Taxonomy model to screen real  estate  objects  at  a  building  level.  The  criteria  used  to  assess energy  performance  are  equal  to  the  ones  used  in  energy performance  certificates.  The  DNSH  criteria  considers  both  the",

        "page_content": "exposure  and  vulnerability  (after  considering  mitigating  action). Overall risk materiality is then determined for each building jointly assessing the said factors. Only when such risk is classified as low or medium, the real estate object can be considered Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses only reported data for listed assets (no estimated  data  is  used).  For  single  listed  asset  products,  Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent-level data is sourced. If that is unavailable, Allianz  uses reported data from the ultimate group parent entity. Taxonomy-alignment is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data. The data hierarchy logic  is  suppressed  for  investment  funds.  For  further  information, please refer to section 'Limitations of reported numbers'.\n\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds  and  unit-linked  products.  However,  such  reporting  for  the financial year 2023 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level. For further information, please refer to section 'Limitations of reported numbers'.\n\nAllianz complies with the EU Taxonomy Regulation by reporting the respective Taxonomy KPIs. For investments, these numbers give us a technical view on the current status of our investment portfolio with regards to their Taxonomy-alignment. At this stage, the EU Taxonomy investment  criteria  is  not  used  for  business  or  investment  steering purposes.  However,  we  continue  to  monitor  the  evolution  of  the Taxonomy Regulation to cover further sectors of the economy and become a tool for portfolio steering in the future.\n\n## Nuclear and Gas Delegated act\n\nIn addition, as part of the 2023 Taxonomy reporting, Allianz is required to disclose its exposure to the six nuclear and gas activities stipulated in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (Annex III). This disclosure seeks to elicit the portion of aligned investments that are a result of the stated activities. For 2023, Allianz's exposure to nuclear and gas activities is considered very small (around 2 % of aligned  assets  for  turnover  and  CAPEX  based  on  total  alignment figures). However, additional disclosure tables have been produced with the limitation that some KPIs were unable to be calculated due to lack of data at the climate objective level.\n\n## Reporting about third-party asset management\n\nIn  2023,  Allianz  took  the  decision  to  de-scope  third-party  asset management from EU Taxonomy investment reporting, in line with\n\ncurrent  market  practice  and  interpretation  of  existing  regulatory requirements for 2023 reporting.\n\n## Calculation of KPIs\n\nThe  main  alignment  KPIs  for  2023  include  alignment  based  on turnover  and  alignment  based  on  CAPEX.  For  our  financial investments, each KPI is determined using only reported data for the investee. If, for example, Allianz has an investment in a company with a turnover alignment of 10 % and the book value of the investment is 100, Allianz would report a turnover alignment balance of 10. And if Allianz has covered assets of 200, then the final alignment share based on turnover would be 10/200, or 5 %. The total alignment based on turnover additionally includes alignment shares from Allianz's own investment  real  estate  held  for  investment,  retail  mortgages,  and renewable investments. The total alignment KPI based on CAPEX is determined in the same way.\n\nFor 2023, Allianz has followed the disclosure guidance for insurer investment KPIs detailed in Annex IX/X of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Disclosure Delegated Act). As mentioned earlier,  the  main  changes  regarding  the  Commission  Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 for 2023 are the introduction of alignment KPIs (by turnover and CAPEX) and the separate tables required for nuclear/gas  exposures.  The  Annex  X  template  has  a  number  of shortcomings, with the main one concerning its specification of the non-eligible KPIs. Eligibility and alignment fractions are determined as a percentage of the turnover or CAPEX denominators. As such, these rows need to be made explicit in the template. In the absence of these rows,  the  numbers  have  been  provided  in  the  footnotes  for completeness.\n\n## Changes to proprietary investment reporting\n\nFor Taxonomy reporting in 2023, there were some changes to how Allianz presents its numbers.\n\nThe  first  change  relates  to  the  treatment  of  cash  and  cash equivalents. In 2022, Allianz considered these as non-eligible; however, they were included as part of the denominator for KPI calculations. After reassessing the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz has determined that cash and cash equivalents should not be included in the scope of assets  covered  by  the  investment  KPI.  Annex  X  of  the  Disclosure Delegated Act defines in-scope assets of insurance and reinsurance undertakings  as  'all  direct  and  indirect  investments,  including investments in collective investment undertakings and participations, loans  and  mortgages,  property,  plant  and  equipment,  as  well  as,\n\nwhere  relevant,  intangibles'.  Cash  and  cash  equivalents  are specifically  not  included  in  the  scope  of  assets  covered  by  the investment KPI. This view is affirmed by EIOPA's technical advice on key performance  indicators  under  Article  8  of  the  EU  Taxonomy Regulation of February 26, 2021 (EIOPA-21-184).\n\nThe  second  change  relates  to  the  asset  classes  considered relevant for eligibility. In 2022, Allianz considered investments in real estate funds to be 100 % eligible on the basis that the vast majority of the  underlying  investments  were  in  real  estate.  In  2023,  Allianz determined  that,  by  the  same  logic,  its  joint  venture  real  estate investments  should  also  be  100  %  eligible.  The  impact  of  this reassessment leads to a small reclassification from non-eligible  to eligible for this asset class for 2023.\n\nFinally, in 2023, the transition to a new accounting regime has meant  that  most  of  Allianz's  real  estate  investment  held  for investments  are  measured  at  fair  value,  as  opposed  to  cost  less accumulated  depreciation.  In  particular,  this  has  led  to  higher valuations of the stated asset class compared to the previous year.\n\n## Limitations of reported numbers\n\nFor 2023, Allianz is relying on reported information from investees for the year 2022. For that year, financial institutions were not required to report alignment figures; as a result, alignment quotas for the said companies will be low or zero.\n\nFor investment funds, Allianz uses a fund look-through approach where  possible  to  report  fund  eligibility,  leveraging  data  in  the Tripartite Template  (TPT).  However,  look-through  coverage  of companies was limited for 2023 due to limited adoption of the TPT and the inability to obtain underlying investment eligibility. In addition, the aforementioned data hierarchy approach is suppressed for investment funds: if investment level look-through data is not available, eligibility is assumed to be zero. This is because listed asset data for Allianz SE has been collected for the underwriting KPI, which has a high eligibility share  of  79 %.  This  is  deemed  inappropriately  high  for  investment funds. The conservative approach is designed to mitigate the risk of reporting  eligibility  figures  that  may  not  be  representative  of  the underlying investments. Going forward, Allianz  aims to expand the look-through capability for investment funds.\n\nIn addition, a complete screening of our renewables portfolio was not possible for United States based SPVs. The said investments are 100 % eligible and likely have a high degree of alignment but have not been considered as such for 2023 reporting due to inadequate data at the time of reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Outlook\n\nThe  CSRD  DMA  is  conducted  alongside  the  Allianz  Group's  value chain,  thus covering own operations, supply chain, Life and Health (re)insurance  (Life/Health),  Property  and  Casualty  (re)insurance (Property-Casualty),  as  well  as  our  proprietary  and  third-party investments business. It follows the double materiality principles as per the CSRD/ESRS  and the guidance provided by  EFRAG in its Draft Implementation  Guidance  on  the  materiality  assessment  from December 2023. The CSRD DMA identifies material impacts, risks, and opportunities that (may) arise in the short-, medium- or long-term, or a mix thereof, following ESRS 1. In terms of topical scope, the CSRD DMA covers both the sustainability matters addressed by the topical ESRS as  well  as  Allianz-specific  sustainability  matters  not  (sufficiently) covered therein, based on the previous GRI materiality assessment.\n\nWhen  assessing  impact  materiality,  we  consider  positive  and adverse  actual and potential impacts caused by, contributed to, or connected with the Allianz Group. Such impacts are assessed based on the criteria scale, scope, remediation possibility, and likelihood. When assessing financial materiality - namely, the materiality of risks and opportunities for the Allianz Group - we take into account the likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of the potential financial effects. In this context, we also consider our dependencies on the continuing  use  of  natural,  human,  and  social  resources.  Financial materiality is assessed in accordance with established Allianz-specific risk assessment processes. For opportunities, the identification is tied to our strategy, as the fact that a strategy to exploit opportunities exists is a precondition for (likely) materialization.\n\nAs  to  risks,  besides  the  broad  range  of  risk  assessments established  within  the  Allianz  Group  (e.g.  Top  Risk  Assessment),  a dedicated  in-depth  risk  assessment  covering  the  CSRD  topics alongside the value chain was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023 to  enhance  the  CSRD  DMA  going  forward.  Until  this  deep-dive  is completed  and  given  that  guidance  for  financial  companies  and industry practice is still evolving, for 2023 reporting, all CSRD topics are generally  considered in scope due to potential risks (e.g. policy or reputational risks). This means that we describe (potential) risks based on a conservative initial approach, thereby reporting on topics broadly, despite the majority of them being (currently) considered to be at most designated 'low materiality' from a risk perspective. In a similar vein,\n\nour  impact  assessment  will  be  regularly  reviewed  to  reflect,  for example, evolving regulation and methodology as well as increasing availability of portfolio-specific data.\n\nThe CSRD DMA is primarily based on desktop research and internal experts' evaluations, with consideration of in-house and external data where available and appropriate, depending on the area of the value chain being assessed:\n\n- -For our own operations, supply chain, Life/Health, and PropertyCasualty retail  business, we use desktop research as well as inhouse and external data, where available (e.g. GHG emissions), tailored to the Allianz business context and complemented by expert evaluations. In addition, for our Life/Health  commercial lines, a country analysis is performed to assess impacts regarding potential business conduct and human rights issues.\n\n-\n\n- For  our  Property-Casualty  commercial  lines  and  proprietary investments, the CSRD DMA is data-driven with the aim to identify (potential)  impacts,  risks,  and  opportunities  related  to  the portfolio(s) of the Allianz Group, leveraging internal and external available data sources at country, sector,  and investment  level. Sources include sector proxies for environmental impacts from the Exploring  Natural  Capital  Opportunities,  Risks  and  Exposure (ENCORE) data base, as well as, for investments, for example principle adverse impacts on sustainability factors (SFDR PAIs) or ESG sub-scores by MSCI. In addition, we conduct a country analysis to  assess  impacts  regarding  potential  business  conduct  and human rights issues, similar to the analysis mentioned above for our Life/Health commercial lines. The evaluations of these criteria were enhanced by consulting a broad range of relevant business experts,  in  order  to  ensure  consideration  of  Allianz  portfoliospecific  information,  especially  where  there  was  of  a  lack  of (sufficiently granular) data. Allianz will continue to work on data coverage and quality over the coming  years. As to proprietary investments,  the  first  CSRD  DMA  focuses  on  General  Account investments. The inclusion of unit-linked investments into the CSRD DMA will be revisited during the annual revision process. When assessing impact materiality at portfolio level, we apply absolute thresholds based on gross written premiums for our commercial (re)insurance business and based on assets under management for proprietary investments. This ensures that both multiple smaller impacts  and  fewer  larger  impacts  are  considered  in  the assessment. Similar to the approach for risks, we tend to include\n\n(potential) adverse impacts in the reporting scope at this stage, following a conservative approach.\n\n- -Given  that  regulatory  requirements  and  market  practice  are evolving, the assessment of impacts, risks, and opportunities for our third-party asset management has been initiated based on business experts' indicative qualitative assessment as a first step, assessing  the  extent  to  which  the  asset  management  services offered are associated with (potential) sustainability impacts, risks, and  opportunities.  We  will  further  develop  our  materiality assessment  process  for  the  third-party  asset  management business for the financial year 2024.\n\nThe CSRD DMA conducted for the financial year 2023 suggests that topics across all topical  ESRS are generally material for the Allianz Group, with the level of materiality, the number of material matters considered therein, and the primary drivers of materiality alongside the value chain differing across topics. For example, while the topic 'Climate change' (ESRS E1) is material from an own operations and value  chain  perspective,  the  materiality  of  further  environmental topics (ESRS E2-E5) is generally associated with providing financing and  insurance  to  corporate  clients.  As  to  social  and  governancerelated topics, they are particularly relevant from our own operations perspective (esp. ESRS S1, G1), while also playing a role in our value chain (esp. ESRS S2, S3, S4). For our third-party asset management, we have initiated a more detailed assessment, which will be reflected in our reporting for 2024. In addition to the topics 'Climate change' and 'Own workforce', 'Business conduct' remains a key topic for the Allianz Group. Also, our ongoing focus on customer experience alongside the customer journey remains unchanged (ESRS S4), given its materiality and relevance to the Allianz sustainability strategy.",

        "page_content": "Material (potential) impacts, risks,  and opportunities for Allianz are outlined below in more detail: 1\n\n- -The topic 'Climate change' (ESRS E1) is assessed to be material from an own operations and value chain perspective.\n- -Adverse impacts in our own operations result from energy usage  of  our  operations  and  our  carbon  footprint  (mainly driven by this energy usage as well as by business travel), while positive measures are in place via in-place practices of energy savings and renewables usage.\n- -For Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments, (potential) adverse impacts with respect to climate change can  materialize  through  insuring  and  financing  carbonintensive activities or sectors, or government exposures with high CO2 emissions (per capita). This is a current reflection, while (potential) adverse impacts for the current portfolios are expected to decrease over time as we work to implement our net-zero  transition  plan.  Regarding  positive  impacts  in  our (re)insurance activities and investments, we focus on offering insurance  products  in  line  with  our  Sustainable  Solutions framework and on enlarging our Sustainable Investments. For further information, please refer to the section '02.1.1' in our Group  Sustainability  Report  2023  on  the Allianz  company\n\n## website\n\n.\n\n- -Related  opportunities  are  considered  material  for  our Property-Casualty lines and proprietary investments in that we are  supporting  our  clients  in  their  low-carbon  transition journey in accordance with our Allianz sustainability strategy and targets.\n- -The materiality of climate change risks, especially in our value chain, is mainly driven through physical climate-related risks, with  climate-related  transition  risks  -  such  as  policy  and litigation risks - increasing with longer time horizons.\n- -For further information, please refer to the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .\n\n- -The environmental topics beyond the topic of 'Climate change' which are nature-related - namely 'Pollution' (ESRS E2), ' Water and marine resources ' (ESRS E3), ' Biodiversity and ecosystems' (ESRS E4), and 'Resource use and circular economy' (ESRS E5) are assessed to be material for Allianz, primarily from a general value chain perspective.\n- -For  Property-Casualty  commercial  lines  and  investments, (potential) adverse impacts with respect to these topics can materialize through insuring and financing pollution-, water use-/resource use-intensive and biodiversity-affecting activities, sectors, and governments. For our Property-Casualty retail  insurance  portfolio,  particularly  'Resource  use  and circular economy' is material, also giving rise to opportunities associated with our sustainable claims initiative (repair instead of replace).\n- -Given our provision of insurance coverage, the increase of physical hazards  -  also  induced through biodiversity loss  poses a risk for Property-Casualty, which also puts pressure on insurability. This also applies for proprietary investments, given potential  nature-related  risks  for  our  portfolio.  In  addition, there is also a potential short-term technology and resource scarcity/price  risk  for  Property-Casualty  retail  insurance related to 'Resource use and circular economy'.\n- -The materiality of nature-related risks for our own operations and  supply  chain  is  related  to  potential  supply  chain interruptions  and  implications  for  our  resource  inflows/use, overall  dependency  on  water,  as  well  as  potential  policy changes  in  water-stressed  areas  and  regarding  resource outflow, especially (IT) waste, also with view to stakeholder expectations.\n- -The topic 'Own workforce' (ESRS S1) is assessed to be material for Allianz, as our employees are a key success factor for our business, and as we are committed to creating a Great Place To Work\u00ae.\n- -Positive  impacts  are  created  through  Allianz  practices  on employee  engagement,  training,  learning,  and  personal development, accompanied by strategic workforce planning. We have a strong focus on diversity, equal treatment,  and inclusion as well as on talent acquisition and retention. The health and well-being of our employees continues to be an area  of  focus  -  our  practices  include  offering  flexibility  in working  time,  paying  above  industry-average  wages,  and fostering  freedom  of  association  and  dialogue  with  our employees.  Furthermore,  securing  the  confidentiality  of employee  data  is  key  for  us.  By  implementing  these  and further practices -including annual  risk assessments regarding  the  protection  of  human/employee  rights  in accordance with the German Supply Chain Act - we continue to work to ensure (potential) adverse impacts are prevented and reduced.\n- -In terms of financial materiality, risk drivers relate to policy changes  as well as skill shortage and retention risk, either associated  with  demographic  change,  or  by  not  meeting employee  expectations,  especially compared  to  other employers.\n- -We also see opportunities associated with our employees, in that  the practices mentioned above allow us to attract and retain talent as a key success factor for our business.",

        "page_content": "- -The  social  topics  alongside  the  value  chain  (ESRS  S2-S4)  are assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact and financial perspective.\n- -Potential adverse impacts related to 'Workers in the value chain' (ESRS S2) and 'Affected communities' (ESRS S3) may materialize for our Property-Casualty  commercial lines and proprietary  investments,  given  the  large  underwriting  and proprietary investment portfolios, in which potential cases of insuring and financing activities that adversely affect workers or  communities' economic, social, civil, political, and cultural rights may arise. In addition, the topic 'Workers in the value chain' (ESRS S2) is assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact  perspective  regarding  our  suppliers  (incl.  service providers relevant for our Property-Casualty retail business). In accordance with the German Supply Chain Act, Allianz actively engages with suppliers that are exposed to potential human rights  (or  certain  environmental)  risks  and  expects  that  all suppliers respect human rights and environmental regulations in their own operations and alongside their supply chain.\n- -As to risks, potential cases of adverse impacts regarding value chain workers or affected communities in the value chain can also lead to spill-over effects for Allianz.\n\n- -Regarding 'Consumers and end-users' (ESRS S4), we identify actual positive impacts through our Life/Health and PropertyCasualty retail, as well as our asset management business, by providing  coverage  in  relation  to  personal  life  and  health, strengthening protection against poverty, and fostering access to services for clients to reach their financial goals. In addition, securing data privacy and confidentiality of consumer data is key for us. Financial implications may particularly arise in case of policy changes.\n- -The topic 'Business conduct' (ESRS G1) is assessed to be material for Allianz primarily from an own operations perspective.\n- -Given  our  practices  related  to  corporate  culture  health, whistleblower protection, supplier management, and prevention of corruption and bribery, we deem our impacts on business conduct to be positive. In addition, we engage with political  stakeholders  with  regards  to  sustainability-related aspects, and we  actively engage in and support regulatory developments. Potential adverse impacts may arise from our proprietary investment portfolio, given exposures to sectors or governments  with  higher  likelihood  of  business  conductrelated issues.\n- -As business conduct is also reliant on the proper behavior of individuals, potential risks can never be fully eliminated. As a result, the matters of ethics and responsible business are also considered material from a financial perspective in our own operations  and  value  chain.  In  addition,  cybersecurity  is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz in our own operations.\n- -Opportunities are associated with enhancing our corporate culture,  with  the  aim  of  increasing  risk  awareness  of  our employees and avoiding misbehavior. In addition, engaging on sustainability-related matters with political stakeholders such as the net-zero transition or via our contributions to (EU) standard-setting activities - is an opportunity for us to credibly convey our sustainability ambition and strategy.\n\nFor further information on how we address these material matters (e.g. prevention, mitigation) and contribute to sustainability, please refer to the previous sections of the Non-Financial Statement as well as the Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website .",

Notwithstanding  this  overall  responsibility,  the individual members independently head the departments assigned to them. They consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management on important issues. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is also responsible for coordinating the departments.\n\nDivisional responsibilities for business segments and/or functional responsibilities are assigned to the individual departments. The latter include Finance, Risk Management and Controlling Functions, Investments,  Operations  and  IT,  Human  Resources,  Legal,  Compliance, Internal Audit, and  Mergers  &  Acquisitions.  Business  division responsibilities focus on geographical regions or global lines. Rules of procedure specify the inner organization of the Board of Management as well as the departmental responsibilities in more detail.\n\nFor further information on Board of Management members and their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management.\n\nFor Allianz SE the same key performance indicators and target values as  for  the  Allianz  Group  apply.  In  particular  the  key  financial performance indicators are based on IFRS.\n\nThe  Allianz  Group  steers  its  operating  entities  and  business segments  via  an  integrated  management  and  control  process.  It begins with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which  are  discussed  and  agreed  upon  between  the  Holding  and operating  entities.  Based  on  this  strategy,  our  operating  entities prepare  three-year  plans,  which  are  then  aggregated  to  form  the financial plans for the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the basis for our capital management. On the basis of this plan, the Supervisory Board sets corresponding targets for the Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration\n\nof the Board of Management is linked to short-term and long-term targets  to  ensure  effectiveness  and  emphasize  sustainability.  For further  details  about  our  remuneration  structure,  including  target setting and performance assessment, please refer to the Remuneration Report.\n\nWe continuously monitor our business performance against these targets through monthly reviews - which cover key operational and financial  metrics  -  to  ensure  we  can  move  quickly  and  take appropriate measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz  Group  uses  operating  profit  and  core  net  income  as  key financial  performance  indicators  across  all  its  business  segments. Other  indicators  include  segment-specific  figures,  such  as  the combined ratio for Property-Casualty, core return on equity 1 and new business margins for Life/Health, and the cost-income ratio for Asset Management.\n\nBesides  performance  steering,  we  also  have  a  risk-steering process  in  place,  which  is  described  in  the  Risk  and  Opportunity Report.\n\nNon-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) too,  are taken into  account  when  determining  the  variable  remuneration  of  the Board  of  Management.  Non-financial  KPIs  include  customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction as well as various environmental indicators. For further information on non-financial KPIs, as well as an overview of the development and expected development of these non-financial KPIs, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nFor an overview of the development and expected development of the most important financial KPIs, please refer to the Outlook 2024 of the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2023.\n\n## Branches\n\nIn 2023, Allianz SE operated its business from Munich and from branch offices  in  Rome  (Italy),  Casablanca  (Morocco),  Singapore,  Labuan (Malaysia),  Wallisellen  (Switzerland),  Vienna  (Austria),  and  Dublin (Ireland).\n\n## Takeover-related Statements and Explanations\n\nThe  following  information  is  provided  pursuant  to  \u00a7 289a  of  the German  Commercial  Code  ('Handelsgesetzbuch  -  HGB')  and \u00a7 176 (1) of the German Stock Company Act ('Aktiengesetz - AktG').\n\nAs  of  31 December 2023,  the  share  capital  of  Allianz SE  was \u20ac 1,169,920,000. It was divided into 391,718,983 registered and fully paid-up shares with no par value. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. Each no-par value share carries one vote.\n\nShares may only be transferred with the consent of the company. An approval  duly  applied  for  may  only  be  withheld  if  it  is  deemed necessary  in  the  company's  interest  on  exceptional  grounds.  The applicant will be informed of the reasons.\n\nShares acquired by employees of the Allianz Group as part of the employee stock purchase plan are generally subject to a three-year lock-up period.

According to the Statutes, the Board of Management shall consist of at least two persons; the Supervisory Board determines the number of any additional members (\u00a7 5 (1) of the Statutes). The members  of  the  Board  of  Management  are  appointed  by  the Supervisory Board for a term of up to five years; reappointment is permitted for a maximum of five years in each case (\u00a7 5 (3) of the Statutes). A simple majority of the votes cast in the Supervisory Board is required to appoint members to the Board of Management. In the case of a tie vote, the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who pursuant to Article 42 of the SE Regulation must be a shareholder representative, shall have the casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes). If the Chairperson does not participate in the vote, the Vice-Chairperson shall  have  the  casting  vote,  provided  they  are  a  shareholder representative. A Vice-Chairperson who is an employee representative has no casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes).\n\nAmendments  to  the  Statutes  are  governed  by  Article  59  SE Regulation,  \u00a7 179 AktG, and the Statutes. \u00a7 13 (4) of the Statutes of Allianz SE  stipulates that, unless mandatory law requires otherwise, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting or, if at least one half of the share capital is represented,  a  simple  majority  of  the  votes  cast.  Where  the  law requires a majority in capital for a shareholder resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented at the General Meeting is sufficient, provided this is in line with legal requirements. The Supervisory Board may alter the wording of the Statutes (\u00a7 179 (1) AktG and \u00a7 10 of the Statutes).\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized to issue shares as well as to acquire and use treasury shares as follows:\n\nIt may increase the company's share capital on or before 3 May 2027, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by issuing new registered no-par value shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind, on one or more occasions:\n\n- -Up to a total of \u20ac 467,968,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/I): In case of  a  capital  increase  against  cash  contribution,  the  Board  of Management may exclude the shareholders' subscription rights for these shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board (i) for fractional amounts, (ii) in order to safeguard the rights pertaining to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants, including mandatory convertible bonds, and (iii) in the event of a capital increase of up to 10 %, if the issue price of the new shares is not significantly  below  the  stock  market  price.  The  Board  of Management  may  furthermore  exclude  the  shareholders' subscription rights with the consent of the Supervisory Board in the event of a capital increase against contributions in kind.\n- -Up to a total  of  \u20ac 15,000,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/II): The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded. New shares may only  be  issued  to  employees  of  Allianz SE  and  its  Group companies.\n\nThe  company's  share  capital  is  conditionally  increased  by  up  to \u20ac 116,992,000 (Conditional  Capital  2022).  This  conditional  capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that the holders of convertible  bonds,  bonds  with  warrants,  convertible  participation rights,  participation  rights,  and  subordinated  financial  instruments issued  against  cash  by  Allianz SE  or  its  subsidiaries,  based  on  the authorizations  granted  by  the  General  Meeting  on  4 May 2022, exercise  their  conversion  or  option  rights,  or  to  the  extent  that conversion  obligations  from  such  bonds  are  fulfilled,  and  to  such extent that treasury shares or shares from authorized capital are not used for such purpose.\n\nUnder an authorization by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, the Board of Management may, until 3 May 2025, buy back Allianz shares corresponding to up to 10 % of the lower of (i) the share capital at the moment of the shareholder resolution and (ii) the share capital at the moment of the buy-back, and to use those shares for other purposes (\u00a7 71 (1) No. 8 AktG). Together with other treasury shares that are held by Allianz SE, or which are attributable to it under \u00a7\u00a7 71a et seq. AktG, such shares may not exceed 10 % of the share capital at any time. The shares acquired pursuant to this authorization may be used, under exclusion of the shareholders' subscription rights, for any legally admissible purposes, in particular those specified in the authorization. Furthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares under this authorization may also be carried out using derivatives, provided such derivatives do not relate to more than 5 % of the share capital.\n\nThe following essential agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-control condition following a takeover bid:\n\n- -Our  reinsurance  contracts,  in  principle,  include  a  clause  under which  both  parties  to  the  contract  have  an  extraordinary termination  right  if  and  when  the  counterparty  merges  with another  entity  or  its  ownership  or  control  situation  changes materially. Agreements with brokers regarding services connected with  the  purchase  of  reinsurance  cover  also  provide  for termination rights in case of a change of control. Such clauses are standard market practice.\n- -Allianz SE  is  also  party  to  various  bancassurance  distribution agreements  for  insurance  products  in  various  regions.  These distribution agreements normally include a clause under which the parties have an extraordinary termination right in the event of a change of control of the other party's ultimate holding company.",

In  line  with  the  relevant  general conditions, the company will release the RSUs to plan participants on the day of the change of control, without observing any vesting period that would otherwise apply. The cash amount payable per RSU must equal or exceed the average market value of the Allianz share and the price offered per Allianz share in a preceding tender offer. By providing for the non-application of the vesting period in the event of a change of control, the terms take into account the fact that the conditions  influencing  the  share  price  are substantially different when there is a change of control.",

They are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of generally three to five years. In case of a permanent impairment, an unscheduled write-down is recognized. Based on the capitalization option  in  accordance  with  \u00a7 248 (2)  sentence 1  of  the  German Commercial Code, the internally generated intangible assets are capitalized.\n\nThese  items  are  recorded  at  acquisition  or  construction  cost  less depreciation in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) sentence 1 of the German Commercial  Code  in  conjunction  with  \u00a7 341b (1)  sentence 1  of  the German Commercial Code. Depreciation is measured mainly using a straight-line method according to ordinary useful life. The useful life of newly acquired properties is based on the remaining useful life in the  purchase  report. For all other assets, we use tax depreciation tables. In case of a permanent impairment, the values of these items are adjusted through unscheduled write-downs.\n\n## Shares in affiliated enterprises and participations\n\nThese  are  recorded  at  cost  less  impairments,  in  accordance  with \u00a7 341b (1)  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  in  conjunction  with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nImpairments are measured either as the difference between the acquisition cost and the respective value, in accordance with IDW RS HFA 10 in conjunction with IDW S1, or as the difference between the acquisition cost and the lower share price as of 31 December 2023, or in some cases as the difference between the acquisition cost and the net asset value.\n\nWherever the market value on the balance sheet date is higher than the previous year's valuation, the value is written up to no more than the historical acquisition cost.\n\n## Loans in affiliated enterprises and participations\n\nThese  items  are  normally  recorded  at  cost  less  impairments,  in accordance  with  \u00a7 253 (3)  sentence 5  of  the  German  Commercial Code. However, when converting foreign currency loans into euro at\n\nCommercial Code (HGB), the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Law on the Supervision of Insurance Enterprises (VAG), and the Government  Order  on  the  External  Accounting  Requirements  of Insurance Enterprises (RechVersV).\n\nAll  amounts  in  these  financial  statements  are  presented  in thousands of euro (\u20ac thou), unless otherwise stated.\n\nthe reporting date, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\n## Stocks, interests in funds, debt securities and other fixed and variable income securities, miscellaneous investments\n\nThese items are generally valued in accordance with \u00a7 341b (2) of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 253 (1), (4), and (5) of the German Commercial Code, using either the acquisition cost or the stock exchange or market value on the balance sheet date, whichever is lower. We calculate the acquisition cost by averaging the different acquisition costs for securities of the same type.\n\n## Registered bonds, debentures, and loans\n\nThese items are recorded at cost less impairments in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. In accordance with  \u00a7 341c  of  the  German  Commercial  Code,  amortized  cost accounting is applied and the difference between acquisition cost and the redemption amount is amortized over the remaining period, based on the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Assets to meet liabilities resulting from retirement provision commitments\n\nThese assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) of the German Commercial Code, and offset against the liabilities in accordance with \u00a7 246 (2) of the German Commercial Code. Group life insurance contracts are recorded at asset value.\n\nIf the liabilities exceed the fair value, the exceeding amount will be shown under other provisions. If the fair value of the assets exceeds the liabilities, the exceeding amount is shown as an excess of plan assets over pensions and similar obligations.\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition cost less depreciation on a straight-line  basis.  The  expected  useful  life  is  based  on  the  tax depreciation tables. Low-value assets worth up to \u20ac 250 are written off immediately. A compound item for tax purposes formed in accordance with \u00a7 6 (2a) of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) for assets from \u20ac 250 to \u20ac 1,000 is depreciated by one fifth each year.\n\nWhen calculating deferred taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset.\n\nBased on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 274 (1) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code, the surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is not recognized.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed,\n- -bank deposits,\n- -accounts receivable on reinsurance business,\n- -other receivables,\n- -cash with banks and cash on hand.\n\nThese  items  are  recorded  at  face  value  less  repayments  and impairments.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -unearned premiums,\n- -aggregate policy reserves,\n- -reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses,\n- -reserves for premium refunds,\n- -claims equalization and similar reserves,\n- -other insurance reserves.\n\nInsurance reserves are set up according to the German Commercial Code  and  the  Government  Order  on  the  External  Accounting Requirements of Insurance Enterprises (RechVersV) requirements. The primary goal is to ensure our ongoing ability to satisfy reinsurance contract liabilities in all cases. Generally, reinsurance reserves are booked according to the cedent's statements. For claims incurred but not yet reported, or not sufficiently reported, additional reserves are calculated using actuarial techniques.\n\nInsurance  reserves  in  the  ceded  reinsurance  business  are calculated according to the terms of the retrocession contracts.\n\nUnearned premiums are accrued premiums already written for future risk periods. They are calculated in accordance with German accounting principles, partly on the basis of information received from the cedents and partly using nominal percentages. Where unearned premiums are calculated using such percentages, these are based on many years of experience and the latest information available.\n\nAggregate policy reserves for Life/Health reinsurance are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are established for the payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have  occurred  but  are  not  yet  settled.  Reserves  for  loss  and  loss adjustment  expenses  fall  into  two  categories:  case  reserves  for reported claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not yet reported, or not sufficiently reported.\n\nReserves for premium refunds are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nFor Property-Casualty reinsurance, the equalization reserve, the reserve for nuclear power plants, the product liability reserve for major pharmaceutical risks, and reserves for risks relating to terrorist attacks are calculated according to \u00a7 341h of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 of the Government Order on the External  Accounting  Requirements  of  Insurance  Enterprises.  The reserves are set up to moderate substantial fluctuations in the claims\n\nof individual  lines of business. In cases where above-average or below-average  claims occur, changes in the reserves mitigate the technical result for the individual lines of business.\n\nOther insurance reserves are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nPension provisions are calculated applying actuarial principles. Other obligations, such as provisions for jubilee payments, early retirement payments and phased in early retirement benefits are also calculated in accordance with actuarial principles.\n\nAccording to \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, the discount rate used for calculating the pension obligations has to be derived from a 10-year average; for calculating other obligations, it has to be derived from a 7-year average.\n\n\u00a7 253 (6) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code states that a  positive  difference  resulting  from  the  calculation  of  pension obligations with the discount rate of 7-year average versus 10-year average is earmarked for profit distribution.\n\nApart  from  that,  with  respect  to  the  discount  rate,  the simplification option set out in \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code has still been applied (duration of fifteen years). The effect resulting from the change in the discount rate is reported under other non-technical result.\n\nFor further information regarding the accounting for pensions and  similar  obligations,  please  refer  to  note 14  to  our  financial statements.\n\nRemaining  other  provisions  are  recognized  at  the  settlement amount. Long-term provisions are discounted applying the net approach in accordance with IDW RS HFA 34.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -subordinated liabilities,\n- -funds held with reinsurance business ceded,\n- -other liabilities.\n\nThese items are valued at the settlement amount. Annuities are recorded at present value.",

Premiums and discounts carried forward as prepaid income and expenses are amortized over the remaining life of the related financial instruments.\n\nTransactions  are  generally  recorded  in  the  original  currency  and converted into euro at the relevant daily rate (middle forex spot rate).\n\nLoans to affiliated enterprises denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date, and applying the strict lower of cost or market value principle.\n\nThe valuation of foreign currency shares in affiliated enterprises and participations, stocks, interests in funds, and other variable and fixed-income securities is performed by converting their value from the original currency into euro, using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date.\n\nComparing the acquisition cost in euro with the value in euro as described above, the moderate lower-value principle is applied for\n\naffiliated  enterprises and participations. For other investments, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\nAs a result of this valuation method, currency gains and losses are  not  separately  determined  and  shown  as  foreign-exchange gains/losses in the other non-technical result. Instead, the net effect of both changes (exchange rate and value in original currency) is reflected in the impairments/reversals of impairments and in the realized  gains/losses  calculated  for  these  asset  classes  and  is disclosed in the investment result.\n\nIssued debt securities and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Unrealized losses are recognized immediately in the income statement, while unrealized gains are not.\n\nAll other monetary assets and liabilities with a remaining term of one year or less recorded in foreign currency are valued at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Both unrealized losses and  gains  resulting  from  the  valuation  of  these  foreign  currency positions are reflected immediately in the other non-technical result, as according to \u00a7 256a of the German Commercial Code neither \u00a7 253 (1)\n\nsentence 1 nor \u00a7 252 (1) number 4 clause 2 of the German Commercial Code are applicable.\n\nAllianz SE made use of the option of forming valuation units as defined in \u00a7 254 of the German Commercial Code. This option is used for derivative contracts in which Allianz SE acts as an intra-group clearing  agency.  In  this  function,  Allianz SE  enters  into  derivative transactions with other Group companies and hedges the exposure resulting from these transactions by entering into mirror positions with the same term and structure but with different partners. Opposing positions  whose  performances  completely  offset  each  other  have been combined into valuation units and form a perfect micro hedge.\n\nWhen  accounting  for  valuation  units,  we  apply  the  'freezing' method, which means that mutually offsetting changes in value of opposing positions (i.e., within valuation units) are not recorded in the income statement. More details regarding derivative transactions combined into valuation units are explained in note 16 to our financial statements.",

The transaction prices are used for recent transactions. In individual cases, marketbased valuation models based on market multiples of relevant peers or internal valuation models considering the individual conditions defined in shareholder agreements are applied.\n\nThese items are measured at the stock exchange value quoted on the last trading day of 2023 or, if there is no active market, at the prices obtained from brokers or pricing services.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans are valued using the Discounted Cash Flow method.

Based on the expected development of market conditions, the decline in market value is not expected to be of an enduring nature.

As a result, Allianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of these old pension promises. The German subsidiaries reimburse the costs, with Allianz SE assuming responsibility for settlement. Consequently, these pension provisions are reported by Allianz SE.\n\nAs  of  1 January 2015,  Allianz SE  completely  assumed  the obligations resulting from the agents pension fund ('Vertreterversorgungswerk  -  VVW')  from  Allianz  Beratungs-  und Vertriebs-AG. Effective from 1 January 2017, the German subsidiaries only reimburse the service costs for their employees. There is no longer any cost reimbursement for the risks arising from changes in interest rate, inflation, and mortality tables.\n\nThe following table shows a breakdown of pension provisions:\n\n## Settlement amount of the offset liabilities \u20ac thou\n\n| as of 31 December                               | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Old pension promises of the German subsidiaries | 2,165,571 | 2,235,075 |\n| Pension promises of Allianz SE                  |           |           |\n| agents pension fund (VVW)                       | 6,610,021 | 6,602,289 |\n| old pension promises to employees               | 296,979   | 300,958   |\n| contribution-based pension plans                | 389,954   | 372,538   |\n| deferred compensation                           | 142,532   | 143,429   |\n| Total                                           | 9,605,057 | 9,654,288 |\n\nThe settlement amount is calculated on the basis of the projected unit  credit  method  and/or  reported  as  the  present  value  of  the entitlements acquired. In the case of security-linked pension plans, the fair value of the offset assets is shown.\n\nDue to the fact that there is no employment relationship between the tied agents and Allianz SE, and since Allianz  Beratungs-  und Vertriebs-AG no longer reimburses any costs, the pension obligations resulting from the VVW are recorded at their full present value.\n\n## Actuarial parameters\n\n%\n\n| as of 31 December                                         |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate (10-year average)                           |   1.83 |   1.79 |\n| Discount rate (7-year average)                            |   1.76 |   1.45 |\n| Rate of pension trend 1                                   |   2    |   2    |\n| Rate of salary increase  (including average career trend) |   3.25 |   3.25 |\n\nContrary  to  the  above  rates,  part  of  the  pension  promises  are calculated using a guaranteed pension increase rate of 1.00 % p.a..\n\nThe  mortality  tables  used  are  the  Heubeck's  RT2018G  tables, which have been adjusted with respect to mortality, disability, and labor turnover to reflect company-specific circumstances.

These obligations  are  basically  calculated  in  the  same  way  as  pension obligations,  using  the  same  actuarial  assumptions  (except  for  the discount rate).\n\nOffsettable plan assets are held at Methusalem Trust e.V. to secure the phased-in early retirement and long-term credit account obligations.

The positive premium development in the Property-Casualty reinsurance is particularly  attributable  to  motor  reinsurance  as  well  as  fire  and property  reinsurance.  In  life  reinsurance,  gross  premiums  written increased by \u20ac 87 mn.\n\n## 18 \\_ Allocated interest return (net)\n\nThe allocated interest return (net) mainly corresponds to the agreed interest rate for deposited provisions and is therefore transferred from the  non-technical  section  to  the  technical  section.  It  amounts  to \u20ac 14 mn (2022: \u20ac 12 mn).\n\n## 19 \\_ Run-off result\n\nIn 2023, the run-off result in Property-Casualty reinsurance amounted to \u20ac 548 mn (2022: \u20ac 1,201 mn). The positive run-off result was mainly due to group-internal quota share reinsurance treaties, primarily with Allianz Versicherungs-AG and Allianz Trade, as well as the recovery under our retrocession program.\n\n## 20 \\_ Change in other insurance reserves (net)\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                           | 2023     | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Change in aggregate policy reserves (net) | 23,486   | 13,502 |\n| Other insurance reserves (net)            | (14,202) | 34,489 |\n| Total                                     | 9,284    | 47,991 |\n\nThe change in aggregate policy reserves (net) was mainly driven by life reinsurance.\n\nThe other insurance reserves (net) mostly include reserves for credit and bond reinsurance.\n\n## 21 \\_ Underwriting expenses (net)\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                                  | 2023        | 2022        |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gross underwriting expenses                      | (3,797,341) | (3,488,029) |\n| Less: commission received on retroceded business | 48,716      | 175,759     |\n| Net                                              | (3,748,625) | (3,312,270) |\n\nThe increase of underwriting expenses (net) mainly followed a growth in  the  premium  development  and  therefore  resulted  in  higher commissions. The expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance increased  to  29.3 %  (2022:  28.2 %),  mainly  driven  by  a  higher commission ratio of 28.6 % (2022: 27.4 %).\n\n## 22 \\_ Investment income\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                                                                                                        | 2023            | 2022           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| a)  Income from participations  thereof from affiliated enterprises:  \u20ac 6,421,923 thou (2022: \u20ac 6,908,596 thou)        | 6,467,998       | 7,051,064      |\n| b)  Income from other investments  thereof from affiliated enterprises:  \u20ac 362,390 thou (2022: \u20ac 217,059 thou)         |                 |                |\n| aa)  Income from real estate, real estate rights,  and buildings, including buildings on land  not owned by Allianz SE | 16,824          | 16,225         |\n| bb)  Income from other investments (see below)                                                                         | 867,670         | 464,135        |\n| c)  Income from reversal of impairments                                                                                | 727,641         | 61,170         |\n| d)  Realized gains                                                                                                     | 132,734         | 668,750        |\n| e)  Income from profit transfer agreements                                                                             | 2,944,639       | 2,219,478      |\n| Total                                                                                                                  | 11,157,505      | 10,480,823     |\n|                                                                                                                        | 2023            | 2022           |\n| bb)  Income from other investments                                                                                     |                 |                |\n| Debt securities                                                                                                        | 346,951         | 195,308        |\n| Funds held by others under reinsurance  business assumed                                                               | 168,901         | 94,522         |\n| Receivables from intra-group cash pooling                                                                              | 160,949         | 86,583         |\n| Loans to affiliated enterprises                                                                                        | 64,044          | 66,642         |\n| Bank deposits                                                                                                          | 44,319          | 6,416          |\n| Interests in funds                                                                                                     | 14,894          | 12,991         |\n| Other                                                                                                                  |                 |                |\n| Total                                                                                                                  | 67,612  867,670 | 1,673  464,135 |",

This  significant  improvement  is  primarily  attributable  to  the  improvement  of  the  result  from  derivatives  by \u20ac 1,273 mn, the improvement of the foreign currency translation result by \u20ac 290 mn, and the decrease of pension expenses by \u20ac 282 mn.\n\nThe result from derivatives significantly improved from \u20ac (971) mn to \u20ac 302 mn, primarily because considerable losses in 2022 resulting from interest rate swaps (\u20ac (660) mn), which were driven by the sharp rise of interest rates in 2022, and from foreign currency forwards (\u20ac (255) mn),  turned  into  gains  in  2023,  amounting  to  \u20ac 6 mn  and \u20ac 187 mn, respectively.\n\nThe result from foreign currency translation improved to \u20ac 201 mn following  \u20ac (89) mn  in  the  previous  year,  mainly  driven  by  foreign currency translation gains of liabilities denominated in USD (\u20ac 186 mn) in 2023 after corresponding losses in 2022 (\u20ac (224) mn). The overall improvement was partially offset by the foreign currency translation of  liabilities denominated in GBP, as foreign currency translation gains  of  GBP  liabilities  in  2022 (\u20ac 107 mn)  turned  into  losses  in 2023 (\u20ac (27) mn).\n\nAllianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of the pension provisions of its German subsidiaries (see note 14 for more details). Expenses incurred in this context are recognized as service expenses from  pension  plans  charged  to  Group  companies,  as  they  are reimbursed  by  the  German  subsidiaries  according  to  the  cost allocation contract and result in corresponding service revenues.\n\nThe pension expenses amounted to \u20ac (195) mn in the reporting year after \u20ac (477) mn in the previous year. The first-time application of a higher pension trend due to inflation for the years 2022 to 2024 and the change in the valuation assumptions for the agents pension fund led to one-time pension expenses of \u20ac 330 mn in 2022, which did not occur in 2023. On the other hand, the cost for the reassessment of the pension amounts of active agents in the agents pension fund, and thus the pension expenses, increased by \u20ac 55 mn in 2023.",

In addition, a review of the  Allianz Group's  consolidated  interim  financial  statements  was performed. The 2023 and 2022 fees for audit services include fees for the implementation audit of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17.\n\nTax  services  primarily  refer  to  tax  compliance  services,  other services mainly refer to consulting services.\n\nDetails  of  the  fees  to  the  auditor  for  services  to  Allianz SE, pursuant to \u00a7 285  No. 17 of the German Commercial Code, can be found  in  the  notes  to  the  Allianz Group's  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## 25 \\_ Income taxes\n\nIn 2023, the tax income, most of which is net operating income, increased to \u20ac 315 mn (2022: \u20ac 18 mn).\n\nAs the controlling company ('Organtr\u00e4ger') of the tax group, Allianz SE files a consolidated tax return with most of its German affiliated enterprises. The tax compensation payments received from members of the tax group decreased to \u20ac 407 mn (2022: \u20ac 550 mn).\n\nThe  greatest  differences  between  accounting  and  tax-based valuation concern the pension accruals, bonds, and reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses resulting in deferred tax assets.\n\nThe valuation of the domestic deferred taxes is based on a tax rate of 31 %.\n\nThe company has elected not to carry forward any deferred tax on the assets side of the balance sheet, as permitted under \u00a7 274 (2) HGB.\n\nThe Allianz Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two rules. The Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Germany, the jurisdiction in which Allianz SE  as  the  ultimate  parent  entity  of  the  Allianz Group  is incorporated, and will be applied for the first time on 1 January 2024. Since the Pillar Two legislation was  not effective at the time of the reporting date, Allianz SE is not subject to any tax burden.\n\nUnder  Pillar  Two  legislation,  Allianz SE  is  required  to  pay  an additional tax on the difference between its effective Pillar Two tax rate per tax jurisdiction and the minimum tax rate of 15 % (minimum tax). If tax jurisdictions introduce a local minimum tax, Allianz SE will -\n\ndepending on the structure of the local minimum tax regulation - be exempt from paying a minimum tax in this tax jurisdiction.\n\nIt is not expected that Allianz SE will be significantly affected by the effects of the minimum tax. Impacts  are expected primarily in jurisdictions that have an overall income tax rate of less than 15 %. Although Allianz Group is present in more than 80 countries, there are only few jurisdictions where the effective tax rate is below 15 %. As many of those countries will introduce a domestic minimum tax, direct financial impact for Allianz SE will be limited.\n\n## 26 \\_ Net earnings\n\n\u20ac thou\n\n|                                         | 2023        | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Net income                              | 8,050,813   | 4,791,846 |\n| Unappropriated earnings carried forward | 388,333     | 637,981   |\n| Transfer to other revenue reserves      | (2,500,000) | (500,000) |\n| Net earnings                            | 5,939,146   | 4,929,827 |",

As of 31 December 2023, USD 0.2 bn in commercial papers were issued as part of the program,\n- -letters  of  credit  issued  to  various  Allianz Group  companies amounting to \u20ac 0.9 bn.\n\nGuarantee declarations totaling \u20ac 0.75 bn have also been made for life policies signed by Allianz Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A.\n\nContingent liabilities exist because of indirect pension promises organized via pension funds (Allianz  Versorgungskasse VVaG) and support funds (Allianz Pensionsverein e.V.). Because the adjustment obligation according to \u00a7 16 of the German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG) is not funded in the APV old tariff, the resulting deficit as of 31 December 2023 amounts to \u20ac 56 mn (2022: \u20ac 57 mn). In addition, Allianz SE has a joint liability of \u20ac 597 mn (2022: \u20ac 574 mn) for a part of the pension promises belonging to its German subsidiaries.\n\nIn the context of the sale of investments, guarantees were given in individual cases to cover counterparty exposures or the various bases used to determine purchase prices.\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE has  issued  guarantees  to  various Allianz Group companies totaling \u20ac 0.4 bn.\n\nAllianz SE  enters  into  contingent  liabilities  only  after  careful consideration  of  the  risks  involved.  On  the  basis  of  a  continuous evaluation of the risk situation of the contingent liabilities entered into, and taking into account the knowledge gained up to the preparation date, it can be assumed that the obligations underlying the contingent liabilities can be met by the respective principal debtors. As of today, and to the best of our knowledge, Allianz SE assesses the probability of a loss resulting from contingent liabilities to be extremely remote.\n\n## Legal obligations\n\nLegal obligations to assume any losses arise on account of management control agreements and/or profit transfer agreements with the following companies:\n\n- -Allianz Africa Holding GmbH (until 31 May 2023),\n- -Allianz Asset Management GmbH,\n- -Allianz Climate Solutions GmbH (until 28 April 2023),\n- -Allianz Deutschland AG,\n- -Allianz Digital Health GmbH,\n- -Allianz Direct Versicherungs-AG,\n- -Allianz Finanzbeteiligungs GmbH (until 31 December 2023),\n- -Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE,\n- -Allianz Global Health GmbH (until 27 April 2023),\n- -Allianz Investment Management SE,\n- -Allianz Kunde und Markt GmbH,\n- -Allianz Technology SE,\n- -Allvest GmbH,\n- -IDS GmbH-Analysis and Reporting Services.\n\nThere  are  financial  obligations  of  \u20ac 561 mn,  which  result  from advertising agreements (\u20ac 511 mn), and payment obligations arising from investments (\u20ac 50 mn).\n\nAllianz SE is involved in legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings in Germany and foreign jurisdictions, including the United States. Such proceedings  arise  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  including, amongst others, Allianz SE's activities as a reinsurance company, employer, investor, and taxpayer. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in substantial damages or other payments or penalties, or result in adverse publicity and damage to Allianz SE's reputation. As a result, such proceedings could have an adverse effect on Allianz SE's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Apart from the  proceedings  discussed  below,  Allianz SE  is  not  aware  of  any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on its financial position or profitability. Material proceedings in which Allianz SE is involved include in particular the following:\n\nIn January 2023, a putative class action complaint has been filed against Allianz SE and in its amended version, against Allianz GI U.S. in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges violation of Federal U.S. Securities Laws by making false or misleading statements in public disclosures such as the annual reports of Allianz in the period between March 2018 and May 2022 regarding  the  Allianz GI U.S.  Structured  Alpha  matter  and  internal controls. Allianz SE considers the action to be unfounded.",

In addition,  we  have  audited  the  management  report  of  Allianz SE including the non-financial statement to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 [Articles] 289b to 289e HGB  [Handelsgesetzbuch:  German  Commercial  Code] included in section Non-Financial Statement  for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the management report listed in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the accompanying annual financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles,\n- -the accompanying management report (excluding the nonfinancial statement included therein) as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements  and  appropriately  presents  the  opportunities and risks of future development; we do not express an audit\n\n- opinion on those parts of the management report listed in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report and\n- -the  non-financial  statement  included  in  section  Non-Financial Statement of the management report is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and European  requirements  as  well  as  with  the  specifying  criteria disclosed by the Company's executive directors.\n\nPursuant  to  \u00a7 322  Abs.  [paragraph]  3  Satz  [sentence]  1 HGB,  we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal  compliance  of  the  annual  financial  statements  and  of  the management report.\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\")  in  compliance  with  German  Generally  Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] - (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Annual Financial Statements and of the Management Report\" section of  our  auditor's  report.  We  are  independent  of  the  Company  in accordance  with  the  requirements  of  European  law  and  German commercial  and  professional  law,  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  other German  professional  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided nonaudit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the annual financial statements, on the management report and on the nonfinancial statement included in the management report.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  annual  financial\n\nstatements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters  of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- -Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n- -Measurement of shares in affiliated companies and participations\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\n\n- -Matter and issue\n- -Audit approach and findings\n- -Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter, we present the key audit matters:\n\n## Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n\n## Matter and issue\n\nIn  the  annual  financial  statements  of  the  Company,  technical provisions (so-called 'claims provisions') amounting to  \u20ac 17,279 mn (13.4 % of total assets) are reported under the 'Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses' balance sheet item.\n\nInsurance  companies  are  required  to  recognize  technical provisions  to  the  extent  necessary  in  accordance  with  reasonable business judgment to ensure that they can meet their obligations from insurance contracts on a continuous basis. Defining assumptions for the  purpose  of  measuring  the  technical  provisions  requires  the Company's  executive  directors,  in  addition  to  complying  with  the requirements of commercial and regulatory law, to make estimations of future events and to apply appropriate measurement methods. The gross provision is generally determined on the basis of the cedents' information or, in the case of outstanding settlements, on the basis of an estimate. The Company reviews the appropriateness of the cedents'",

        "page_content": "information  and,  if  necessary,  makes  appropriate  increases  to  the amounts.\n\nThe  methods  used  to  determine  the  amount  of  the  claims provisions and the calculation parameters are based on judgments and assumptions made by the executive directors. This also includes the  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  increased  inflation  rates  on  the calculation of the reserves. In particular, the lines of  products with long claims settlement periods, low loss frequency or high individual losses are usually subject to increased estimation uncertainties and usually require a high degree of judgment by the Company's executive directors.\n\nMinor changes to those assumptions and to the methods used may  have  a  material  impact  on  the  measurement  of  the  claims provisions. Due to the material significance of the amounts of these provisions  in  relation  to  the  assets,  liabilities  and  financial performance of the Company as well as the considerable scope for judgment on the part of the executive directors and the associated uncertainties in the estimations made, the measurement of the claims provisions was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n## Audit approach and findings\n\nAs part of our audit, we evaluated the appropriateness of selected controls established by the Company for the purpose of selecting actuarial methods, determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims in propertycasualty insurance.\n\nWith the support of our property-casualty insurance valuation specialists, we have compared the respective actuarial methods applied and the material assumptions with generally recognized actuarial practices and industry standards and examined to what extent these are appropriate for the valuation. Our audit also included an  evaluation  of  the  plausibility  and  integrity  of  the  data  and assumptions used in the valuation including the assessment of the executive directors regarding the impact of increased inflation rates, and  an  analysis  of  the  claims  settlement  processes  and  the reconciliation of the information provided by the cedents. Furthermore,  we  recalculated  the  amount  of  the  provisions  for selected lines of products, in particular lines of products with large reserves or increased estimation uncertainties. For these lines of products we  compared  the  recalculated  provisions  with  the  provisions calculated by the Company and evaluated any differences.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors\n\nare  appropriate  overall  for  measuring  the  technical  provisions  in property-casualty insurance.\n\n## Reference to further information\n\nThe Company's disclosures on the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims are contained in section Accounting, Valuation, and Calculation Methods in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of shares in affiliated companies and participations\n\n## Matter and issue\n\nIn the annual financial statements of the Company shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments amounting to \u20ac 75,594 mn (58.6 % of total assets) are reported under the \"Investments\" balance sheet item.\n\nShares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments are measured in accordance with German commercial law at the lower of cost and fair value. For shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments whose valuation is not based on stock exchange prices or other market prices, the income approach is used for all significant operating companies (property insurance companies, banks and asset management companies). For life and health insurance companies, the  valuation  is  based  on  the  appraisal  value.  Companies  whose business  purpose  is  essentially  limited  to  the  management  of investments (asset holding companies), the fair value is determined on the basis of the fair values of the respective underlying investment properties, which are determined using different valuation methods (e.g. net asset value, discounted cash flow method).\n\nThe measurement of the fair values is based on the business plan set up by the executive directors. In this context, the executive directors have to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in particular about the future development of the business and the effect of the development of macroeconomic factors on the business of the shares in affiliated companies and the companies listed  as  other equity instruments. The discount rate used in the context of the income approach is the individually determined cost of capital for the relevant financial investment.\n\nSmall changes in the assumptions made as well as in the methods applied  can  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  measurement  of  the shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments. On the basis of the values determined and supplementary documentation, write-ups amounting in total to \u20ac 24.3 mn and write-downs amounting\n\nin total to \u20ac 32.9 mn were required for the financial year. Due to the significance  in  terms  of  the  amount  of  the  shares  in  affiliated companies and other equity instruments for the Company's assets, liabilities  and  financial  performance  as  well  as  the  considerable judgments  of  the  executive  directors  and  the  related  estimation uncertainties, the measurement of the shares in affiliated companies and  other  equity  instruments  was  of  particular  significance  in  the context of our audit.\n\n## Audit approach and findings\n\nAs part of our audit, we assessed methodology used by the Company for the purposes of the valuation and the assumptions made by the executive directors in light of the significance of the shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments. Our assessment was based on, among other things, our knowledge of the industry, our investment valuation expertise and our industry experience. We evaluated the company's valuation process, including the design and effectiveness of the  controls  in  place.  On  that  basis,  we  performed  tests  of  detail related to the valuation for selected shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments. Our selection was risk-oriented with regard to the size and significance for the company's financial statements and in the case of specific indications for a permanent impairment. Our tests of detail included, among other things, the assessment of the selected  valuation  method,  its  consistent  application  and  the arithmetic  correctness  of  the  applied  procedures.  In  addition,  we checked the assumptions underlying the valuation (planned budget, derivation of the discount rate and assumptions on the perpetual annuity) for their appropriateness.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors for the measurement of the shares in affiliated companies and  other  equity  instruments  are  substantiated  and  sufficiently documented.\n\n## Reference to further information\n\nThe Company's disclosures relating to shares in affiliated companies and  other  equity  instruments  are  contained  in  section  Accounting, Valuation, and Calculation Methods and in section '3 \\_ Market value of investments' of the notes to the financial statements.",

In addition,  the  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  such  internal control  as  they,  in  accordance  with  German  Legally  Required Accounting  Principles,  have  determined  necessary  to  enable  the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, the executive directors  are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern.  In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going  concern  basis  of  accounting,  provided  no  actual  or  legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore,  the  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  the preparation of the management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities  and  risks  of  future  development.  In  addition,  the executive  directors  are  responsible  for  such  arrangements  and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement included in the management report in accordance  with  the  applicable  German  legal  and  European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Company's executive directors. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have  considered  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a  nonfinancial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent reporting in the non-financial statement) or error.\n\nThe applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject  to  considerable  interpretation  uncertainties  and  for  which authoritative  comprehensive  interpretations  have  not  yet  been published. Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations  of  such  wording  and  terms  in  the  non-financial statement in section 'EU Taxonomy Regulation' of the non-financial statement. The executive directors are responsible for the defensibility\n\nof these interpretations. As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently  by  regulators  or  courts,  the  legal  conformity  of  these interpretations is uncertain.\n\nThe  supervisory  board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the Company's  financial  reporting  process  for  the  preparation  of  the annual financial statements and of the management report as well as of the non-financial statement included in the management report.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  whether  the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the annual financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies  with  the  German  legal  requirements  and  appropriately presents  the  opportunities  and  risks  of  future  development,  and whether  the  non-financial  statement  has  been  prepared,  in  all material respects, in accordance with the applicable German legal and  European  requirements  and  with  the  specifying  criteria  disclosed by the Company's executive directors, as well as to issue an auditor's  report  that  includes  our  audit  opinions  on  the  annual financial statements, on the management report and on the nonfinancial statement.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement.

We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual  financial  statements  and  of  the  management  report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of  the  annual  financial  statements  and  of  arrangements  and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  respective opinions.

We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n- -Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the non-financial statement as a whole. As explained in the description of the responsibilities of the executive directors, the executive directors have interpreted the wording and terms contained in the relevant regulations; the legal conformity of these interpretations is subject to inherent uncertainties mentioned in this description. Those inherent uncertainties in the interpretation apply to our audit accordingly.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

It explains the application of the remuneration system in the 2023 financial year, using detailed and individualized  specifications  on  the  remuneration  of  current  and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe report was jointly created by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, taking into consideration the requirements of \u00a7 162  of  the  German  Stock  Corporation  Act  (AktG),  and  the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its currently valid version.\n\nIt was  also  decided  to  allow  the  auditor  to  carry  out  a comprehensive,  content  audit  of  the  Remuneration  Report  going above and beyond the legal requirements of \u00a7 162 (3) AktG.\n\n## The remuneration year of 2023 at a glance\n\n## The economic and geopolitical environment\n\nIn the first half of the year in particular, 2023 was characterized by the continued dynamic inflation trend in many leading economies. Only in the second half of the year was a slow normalization of inflation rates achieved thanks to rapid interest rate hikes by central banks.  The  economic  impact  of  high  inflation  and  restrictive monetary  policy  was  also  evident  on  the  international  capital markets. In addition to high claims inflation, the insurance industry and asset management therefore also had to successfully navigate a very volatile investment environment. Natural disasters, such as the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria as well as thunderstorms in Germany, also posed major challenges for our industry in 2023. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East contributed to the challenging geopolitical and economic environment.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee closely monitored business developments, particularly with regard to potential target achievement at Group level and individual remuneration targets at the half-year and year-end 2023. In addition to the financial targets, the non-financial targets and target achievement for 2023 were also discussed intensively, and changes to the Management Board were prepared and implemented.\n\n## Group financial targets\n\nThe annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI) allocation are based on two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50 %.\n\nThe  operating  profit  target  of  \u20ac 14.20 bn  was  exceeded  to \u20ac 14.75 bn, as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Corporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and more  than  compensated  for  the  slight  decline  in  the  Asset Management  business  segment.  This  resulted in a target achievement of 107.69 % for the operating profit.\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty  business  segment  and  thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering options. In the Board's remuneration system, which will be submitted for approval by the 2025 Annual General Meeting, the Group's financial target of net income attributable to shareholders will be adjusted going forward by eliminating certain non-operating effects such as fluctuations from market movements.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management  cannot  control  in  either  direction.  For  this  purpose, 100 % target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward or downward fluctuation range of \u20ac 500 mn.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders amounted to \u20ac 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range of \u20ac 7.9 - 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00 %.\n\nOverall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.85 %.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Board of Management performance in 2023\n\nIn the financial year under review, the Board of Management faced unprecedented challenges requiring a team effort. In addition to the geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, the Board of Management  had  to  meet  supervisory  requirements  and  adopt decisions to implement the digital future. These topics had  to be jointly addressed by the entire Board of Management across the divisional  areas  of  responsibility.  The  members  of  the  Board  of Management also successfully handled the additional tasks arising from the streamlining effected in the financial year under review. This applies in particular to the business activities in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, Allianz X, and the implementation of IT verticalization and business model transformation.\n\nAs a result, the Board of Management achieved a record result in  terms  of  operating  profit  and  net  income,  despite  a  massive adverse impact resulting from natural disasters, high inflation, and rapidly  rising  interest  rates.  This  strong  overall  performance  was achieved on a sustainable basis: Customer satisfaction at  Allianz once  again  reached  top  scores.  The  proportion  of  local  business segments  considered  as  market  leaders  in  terms  of  customer satisfaction as measured by the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS), for example, grew to 59 %.  Employee testimonials were also very positive. The Inclusive Meritocracy Index and Work Well Index Plus, which are used to measure employee satisfaction, rose to new record levels of 81 % and 76 %, respectively, bucking a negative trend in the\n\nindustry.  In  addition,  the  Board  of  Management  also  met  its ambitious environmental targets. Examples include CO2  emissions per employee, which were reduced by 62 % versus the baseline year 2019 and were thus further reduced compared to the previous year (-57 %) despite a normalization of travel behavior after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDue to the very good overall team performance of the Board of Management  in  all  cross-divisional  matters,  for  the  first  time  the Supervisory Board unanimously decided to refrain from differentiating the individual contribution factor for the annual bonus for the 2023 financial year and to set a common factor of 1.15 for the regular Board members and to assess Mr. B\u00e4te's performance in leading  the  Board  of  Management  team  with  a  factor  of  1.17. Individual performance by the individual members of the Board of Management is described in detail below.\n\n## Potential application of malus and clawback\n\nIn the financial year, there was no reason to reduce the payment of variable remuneration (malus) or to reclaim variable remuneration already paid out (clawback).\n\n## Approval of remuneration system and Remuneration Report\n\nThe  system  for  the  remuneration  of  members  of  the  Board  of Management  was  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on\n\n5 May 2021 with a majority vote of 87.14 %. The remuneration system applies to all members of the Board of Management who were in office in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Remuneration Report for 2022 was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023 with a majority vote of 82.94 %.\n\nOverall, the remuneration system and the Remuneration Report are strongly supported by investors and proxy advisors. In discussions with the Supervisory Board, it is emphasized, among other things, that the transparency provided with regard to Board of Management remuneration exceeds the best practice standard in Germany in many respects and that the Supervisory Board exercises its discretionary powers, as granted to them to the usual extent, very responsibly.\n\n## Changes to the composition of the Board of Management\n\nGiulio Terzariol was released from his mandate as a member of the Board of Management on 31 December 2023 so that he can pursue a career opportunity outside the company in his home country.\n\nClaire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre took over from Giulio Terzariol on 1 January 2024  and  has  been  working  with  Mr.  Terzariol  on  a seamless handover of his responsibilities.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management\n\nRemuneration  is  designed  to  be  appropriate  compared  to  peer companies,  given  the  Allianz Group's  range  of  business  activities, operating environment, and business results achieved. The aim is to ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of the  company  that  is  in  line  with  our  corporate  strategy.  The  key principles are as follows:\n\n- -Support  of  the  Group's  strategy: The  design  of  variable compensation, and in particular of performance targets, reflects the business strategy and sustainable long-term development of the Allianz Group.\n- -Alignment  of  pay  and  performance: The  performance-based variable component of the remuneration of members of the Board of  Management  forms  a  significant  portion  of  the  overall remuneration, corresponding to 70 % of the target compensation.\n- -Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder interests: A  major  part  of  the  variable  remuneration  reflects longer-term  performance,  with  deferred  payout  (64 %),  and  is linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz share price.\n\nThe Board of Management's remuneration is decided upon by the entire  Supervisory  Board,  based  on  proposals  prepared  by  the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee. If required, the Supervisory Board  may  seek  outside  advice  from  independent  external consultants.  The  Personnel  Committee  and  the  Supervisory  Board consult  with  the  Chairperson  of  the  Board  of  Management  in assessing the performance and remuneration of Board  of Management  members.  The  Chairperson  of  the  Board  of Management is generally not involved in discussion about their own remuneration. The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the requirements of the AktG in its currently valid version, as well as with regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\nClarity and comprehensibility are ensured at all times. Feedback from investors is also considered.\n\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the target total compensation and regularly reviews the appropriateness  of  the  remuneration.  This  is  based  on  both  a horizontal  comparison  (i.e.,  with  peer  companies)  and  a  vertical comparison (in relation to Allianz employees). Again, the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, if necessary with the assistance of external consultants.\n\nThe  structure,  weighting,  and  level  of  each  remuneration component should be adequate and appropriate.\n\n## Horizontal appropriateness\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly benchmarks the remuneration of the Board of Management of Allianz SE against other DAX companies and selected international companies (including, for example, the top positions in the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance), taking into account the company's position, and the Allianz Group's long-term performance, relative size, complexity, and internationality.\n\nAs  part  of  the  review  in  2022  of  the  appropriateness  of  the remuneration of the Board of Management, a need to adjust the level of remuneration for the Board members at Allianz SE was identified for 2023 and going forward. A comparison of Board of Management remuneration with the DAX 40 companies on the basis of turnover, number  of  employees  and  market  capitalization  shows  that  the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Management Board and the ordinary  members  of  the  Management  Board  is  below  the comparative value. In addition, the reduction of the entire Board of Management to nine members and the associated redistribution of tasks led to an increase in the workload for the remaining Board members.  For  these  reasons,  the  Supervisory  Board  deemed  an increase  in  the  annual  target  remuneration  of  5%  for  all  Board members to be appropriate. The exact amounts can be found in the graph  relating  to  the  overview  of  the  structure  of  the  target remuneration.\n\n## Vertical appropriateness\n\nThis  comparison  is  based  on  the  total  direct  remuneration  of  a member  of  the  Board  of  Management  and  the  average  direct remuneration of an employee of the German Allianz companies. The Supervisory  Board's  decision  in  December  is  based  on  the  factor resulting from this comparison for the previous financial year. For the 2022 financial  year, the factor for the Chairperson of the  Board of Management to an employee was '65' and the factor for a regular Board member to an employee was '37'. For the 2023 financial year, the respective factor for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to  an  employee  is  '68'  and  the  factor  regular  board  member  to employee is '36'.",

        "page_content": "## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe  fixed  remuneration  components  comprise  the  base  salary, perquisites,  and  pension  contributions.  These  components  provide competitive remuneration to attract and retain Board of Management members with experience and skills that enable them to develop and successfully  implement  the  Allianz  Group's  strategy.  They  secure  a reasonable level of income in line with market conditions and promote a company management that is commensurate with risk.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe base salary, which is not performance-related, is paid in twelve equal monthly installments.\n\n## Perquisites\n\nPerquisites  mainly consist of contributions to accident and liability insurances, tax consultant fees, and the provision of a company car and further individual perquisites if applicable. Perquisites are not linked to performance. Each member of the Board of Management is responsible for paying the income tax due on these perquisites. The Supervisory  Board  regularly  reviews  the  level  of  perquisites;  a contractual annual cap applies. If an appointment to the Board of Management requires a change of residence, relocation expenses are reimbursed to an appropriate extent.\n\n## Pension contribution\n\nTo  provide  competitive  and  cost-effective  retirement  and  disability benefits, company contributions to the defined-contribution pension plan  'My  Allianz  Pension'  are  invested  with  a  guarantee  for  the contributions paid but no further interest guarantee.\n\nEach year,  the Supervisory Board decides whether a budget is provided and, if so, to what extent. The current pension contribution generally represents 15 % of the target remuneration  of the Board members.\n\nApart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62. Should Board membership  cease  before  the  retirement  age  is  reached,  accrued pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may have additional pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of Management  prior  to  2015.  Payments  of  social insurance contributions abroad required by Allianz in individual cases may also give rise to additional pension entitlements.\n\n## Performance-based remuneration\n\nThe  performance-based  variable  remuneration  includes  the  shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. This composition  aims  to  balance  short-term  performance,  longer-term success, and sustained value creation. The Supervisory Board ensures that the variable remuneration targets are challenging, sustainable, and ambitious.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe  annual  bonus  provides  incentives  for  profitable  growth  and further  development  of  the  operating  business  by  successfully implementing the business objectives for the respective financial year. In doing so, the overall responsibility for reaching the Group targets as well as the individual performance with regard to the operational responsibilities of the individual members  of  the  Board  of Management are taken into consideration.\n\nThe  annual  bonus  is  calculated  by  multiplying  the  target achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus. It is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant financial  year, with payment limited to a maximum of 150 % of the target amount.\n\n## Long-term incentive - LTI\n\nThe long-term, share-based remuneration is oriented mainly towards the sustainable increase in the enterprise value. Taking the share price performance in absolute and relative terms as a basis, it encourages combining the interests of the shareholders with those of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nOther stakeholder aspects are taken into consideration by setting strategic sustainability targets. The achievement of these targets forms the  basis  for  the  final  assessment  at  the  end  of  the  four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nAlmost two thirds (64 %) of the variable remuneration is  sharebased, so as to adequately reflect the long-term performance of the company in the Board of Management remuneration.\n\n## Additional remuneration principles\n\n## Shareholding obligation and shareholding exposure\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are obliged to build up the following degree of share ownership within three years:\n\n- -Chairperson of the Board of Management: two times base salary, i.e., \u20ac 4,013 thou,\n- -Regular Board of Management member: one time base salary, i.e., \u20ac 1,024 thou.\n\nOwnership is required for the entire term of service on the Board of Management.  Shares  will  be  acquired  through  mandatory  pay component conversion. In the event of a base salary increase, the shareholding obligation increases accordingly. The ownership obligation ceases with the end of the mandate.\n\nIn  combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management has significant economic exposure to Allianz stock. This amounts to approximately  800 %  of  base  salary  for  the  Chairperson  and approximately 700 % of base salary for a regular Board member.\n\n## Malus/clawback\n\nIn order to ensure sustainable corporate development and to avoid taking inappropriate risks, variable  remuneration components may not be paid, or payment may be restricted, in the event of a significant breach  of  the  Allianz  Code  of  Conduct  or  regulatory  Solvency II policies or standards, including risk limits.\n\nIn  the  same  way,  variable  remuneration  components  already paid  may  be  subject  to  a  clawback  for  three  years  after  payout. Additionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may be implemented if this is required by the supervisory authority (BaFin) in accordance with its statutory powers.\n\n## Payout cap\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 87a (1) sentence 2 (1) AktG and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has determined a remuneration cap.",

        "page_content": "Thus,  the  actual  payout  for  the  underlying  financial  year  comprising the base salary, variable remuneration and pension service cost  -  will  be  capped  at  maximum  of  \u20ac 11,750 thou  for  the Chairperson of the Board of Management, and at \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management. If the remuneration for the financial year exceeds this amount, compliance with the maximum limit will be ensured by reducing the payout of the long-term variable remuneration accordingly.\n\nThis payout cap principle was introduced for the first time for the 2019 financial year. Given that the actual amount of the long-term variable  remuneration  paid  out  cannot  be  determined  until  after vesting and the final sustainability assessment, compliance with the payout cap will be reported on for the first time in the Remuneration Report for the 2024 financial year.\n\n## Deviation from the remuneration system\n\nThe Supervisory Board can temporarily deviate from the remuneration system in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the statutory requirements (\u00a7 87a (2) AktG), if this is necessary in the interests of the long-term welfare of the company. The assessment may take into account  both  macroeconomic  and  company-related  exceptional circumstances,  such  as  impairment  of  the  long-term  viability  and profitability of the company. The deviation requires a prior proposal by the Personnel Committee.\n\nParticular  components of the remuneration system from which deviations may be made in exceptional cases include the base salary, the annual bonus and the LTI, including their relationship to each other, their respective assessment bases where applicable, the target setting and target achievement assessment principles, and the determination of any payout and payment dates. The duration of the deviation shall be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but should  not  exceed  a  period  of  four  years.  In  a  crisis  situation,  for example, this principle is intended to allow the appointment of a new Board member with skills such as crisis management expertise, with a remuneration structure that temporarily deviates from the remuneration structure.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to deviate from the remuneration system.\n\n## Remuneration adjustment\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of extraordinary  unforeseeable  developments  when  determining  the amount of the variable remuneration components. This rule takes up a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and allows for the adjustment of the remuneration in rare unforeseeable exceptional cases.\n\nConceivable cases of application include, for example, significant changes in accounting rules, or in the tax or regulatory framework, as well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting. The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may also adjust the target remuneration of  members  of  the  Board  of  Management,  insofar  as  this  is appropriate to ensure that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Board  of  Management  or  a  regular  member  of  the  Board  of Management  is  appropriate  with  regard  to  their  duties  and performance. In doing so, it shall take into account the horizontal and vertical comparison of the Board of Management remuneration. The aim  of  this  rule  is  to  moderately  adjust  Board  of  Management remuneration on the basis of horizontal and vertical salary trends, and thus to avoid major salary increases.\n\nRather  than  being  automatic,  adjustment  requires  a  justified decision by the Supervisory Board on a case-by-case basis. Such a moderate adjustment of the target remuneration does not in itself represent  a  significant  change  to  the  remuneration  system.  These adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective Remuneration Report for the financial year.\n\n## Termination of service\n\nBoard of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years. For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Severance payment cap\n\nPayments for early termination to Board members with a remaining term of contract of more than two years are capped at twice the annual  compensation,  consisting  of  the  last  financial  year's  base salary and 100 % of the variable target compensation. If the remaining term of contract is less than two years, the payment is made on a prorata basis  for the remaining term of the contract. Contracts do not\n\ncontain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of Management service.\n\nIn the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the non-compete clause in the event of premature termination of service.\n\n## Transition payment\n\nBoard members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a transition  payment  after  leaving  the  Board  of  Management.  The transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most recent base salary (paid for a period of six months), plus a one-time payment of 25 % of the target variable remuneration at notice date. Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, this  pension is deducted from the monthly transition payments. In the event of a contractually  agreed  non-compete  clause,  the  remittance  of  the transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from the non-compete clause.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n## Internal and external Board appointments\n\nWhen a member of the Board of Management simultaneously holds an appointment at another company within the Allianz Group or their joint ventures with outside partners, the full amount of the respective remuneration is transferred to Allianz SE.\n\nIn recognition of related benefits to the organization, and subject to  prior  approval  by  the  Supervisory  Board  of  Allianz SE,  Board members  are  also  allowed  to  accept  a  limited  number  of  nonexecutive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations. In these cases, 50 % of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE.\n\nThe  respective  Board  member  will  only  retain  the  full remuneration  for  that  position  if  the  Allianz SE  Supervisory  Board classifies  the  appointment  as  a  personal  one (ad  personam) .  Any remuneration paid by external organizations will be itemized in those organizations'  annual  reports;  the  level  of  remuneration  will  be determined by the governing body of the relevant organization.",

The annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable  to  shareholders,  each  at  50 %.  The  resulting  target achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business division  and  the  performance  of  the  individual  Board  member.  If targets are not met, the variable compensation  can be reduced to zero. If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is limited to 150 %.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group financial targets\n\nThe Group financial targets are based on equally weighted targets for Group  operating  profit  and  Group  net  income  attributable  to shareholders.  Adjustments  are  only  applied  to  acquisitions  and disposals that account for more than 10 % of the Group's operating profit or net income attributable to shareholders, or that have a valueadding  effect  from  a  risk  management  perspective  (e.g.,  portfolio transfers) and were not yet known at the time the plan was prepared. This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from having  a  negative  impact  on  the  remuneration  of  the  Board  of Management.\n\nOperating  profit  highlights  the  underlying  performance  of ongoing core operations.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and non-controlling  interests  (minorities).  Furthermore,  the  net  income forms the basis for the dividend payout, as well as for calculating the return on equity. Both key performance indicators (KPIs) are important steering parameters for the Allianz Group and therefore reflect the level of implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Group's financial target achievement is limited to a maximum of 150 % and can drop to zero.\n\nThe  minimum,  target,  and  maximum  values  for  the  Group financial targets are set annually by the Supervisory Board. These targets  are documented for the respective next financial year and published ex-post in the Remuneration Report.",

In addition, overarching strategic goals that apply to all Board members are set.\n- -Performance (business division targets): For Board members with business-related division responsibilities, the contribution to the financial performance  is  based  on  various  indicators  of profitability (e.g., operating  profit and  net  income)  and productivity  (e.g.,  expense  ratio)  for  the  respective  business division.

Most  of  the  performance  indicators  are provided with quantitative criteria,  and therefore offer a sufficiently concrete basis for the combined assessment.\n\nEach  ICF  category  -  strategic  priority,  performance,  and sustainability - has a significant weighting, and all three categories are of equal importance and make an equal contribution to the overall assessment. However, the individual indicators are not weighted on a fixed percentage basis, so that the ICF is not determined on the basis of a formulaic calculation. This allows the Supervisory Board to take appropriate  consideration  of  the  individual  criteria  and  to  react appropriately to changes in priorities during the year. In particular, significantly  underperforming  in  one  category  should  allow  a  low overall rating without being balanced out by the other indicators.\n\nSince performance is determined without a specified weighting, the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) design\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the largest portion of variable compensation. It promotes alignment with shareholders  and  reflects  the  sustainable  implementation  of  the\n\ncompany's long-term strategy. The LTI is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in the  deferred  sustainability  assessment  following  the  four-year contractual vesting period.\n\n- -Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually in the form of virtual Allianz shares, known as restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs to be granted corresponds to the LTI allocation amount, divided by the allocation value of an RSU at grant:\n- -The LTI allocation amount is calculated by multiplying the LTI target amount by the annual bonus achievement factor, and capped at a maximum of 150 % of the target level.\n- -The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual financial media conference 1 . As RSUs are virtual stock without dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the net present value of the expected future dividend payments during the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nsimulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the volatility of the peer index, their correlation, and the expected dividends. The value of the RSUs used\n\nThe LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years. After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based on the relative performance of the Allianz share, the relevant share price, and the results of the sustainability assessment.\n\n- -Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute shareprice development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance of the Allianz  share into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Allianz share is benchmarked against the TSR of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index by reflecting the relation of the total performance of the Allianz share ('Allianz TSR') and the total  performance  of  the  STOXX  Europe  600  insurance  index ('Index  TSR')  between  the  start  and  end  of  the  four-year contractual  vesting  period.  The  payout  is  based  on  the  TSR performance factor, which is calculated as follows:\n- -At the end of the contractual vesting period, the difference between the Allianz TSR and the Index TSR is determined in percentage points; the result is multiplied by '2' because the comparison  with  competitors  and  the  market  is  critically important, so the outperformance/underperformance is given a twofold weighting.\n\nfor the board members' compensation may deviate from this IFRS value, as a simplified calculation method was applied to increase transparency and traceability.",

Example:  1 percentage  point  outperformance results in a relative performance factor of 102 %; 1 percentage point  underperformance  results  in  a  relative  performance factor of 98 %.\n\nIn order to avoid incentivizing excessive risk-taking, the relative TSR performance  factor  is  limited:  it  can  vary  between  zero  (for underperformance of the index by - 50 percentage points or lower) and  200 %  (for outperformance  of  the  index  by  minimum + 50 percentage points or higher).\n\n- -Sustainability assessment: Prior to the payout of each LTI tranche, the Personnel Committee makes a preliminary assessment before the  Supervisory  Board  determines,  whether  there  are  any sustainability-related  concerns  regarding  a  full  payout.

The operating profit target of \u20ac 14.20 bn was exceeded  to  \u20ac 14.75 bn  as  the  Property-Casualty,  Life/Health, Corporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset Management business segment. This resulted in a target achievement of 107.69 % for the operating profit.\n\nThe transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering\n\noptions. For the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management cannot control in either direction. For this purpose, 100 % target  achievement  was  defined  as  a  plateau  with  an  upward  or downward fluctuation range of \u20ac 500 mn. Net income attributable to shareholders amounted to \u20ac 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range of \u20ac 7.9 - 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00 %.\n\nOverall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.85 %.\n\n## Group financial target achievement 2022 und 2023\n\n| Group financial target achievement   | Operating profit   | Operating profit   | Net income attributable to shareholders   | Net income attributable to shareholders   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Financial year                       | 2022               | 2023               | 2022                                      | 2023                                      |\n| Bonus curve                          |                    |                    |                                           |                                           |\n| 0 % - Floor in \u20ac bn                  | 6.70               | 7.10               | 3.60                                      | 3.70                                      |\n| 100 % - Target in \u20ac bn               | 13.40              | 14.20              | 7.20                                      | 7.9 - 8.9                                 |\n| 150 % - Max in \u20ac bn                  | 16.75              | 17.75              | 9.00                                      | 11.00                                     |\n| Target achievement                   |                    |                    |                                           |                                           |\n| Achievement level in \u20ac bn 1          | 14.16              | 14.75              | 7.17                                      | 8.54                                      |\n| Achievement level in %               | 111.40             | 107.69             | 99.29                                     | 100.00                                    |\n| Weight in %                          | 50.00              | 50.00              | 50.00                                     | 50.00                                     |\n\n|   Achievement level combined in % |         |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|\n|                           2022    | 2023    |\n|                            105.35 |  103.85 |\n\n- 1\\_The 2022 operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders shown in this table (and also in the following tables within the Remuneration Report) are as published in the Annual Report 2022 and have not been adjusted to reflect the application of the new accounting standards IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts), which have been adopted as of 1 January 2023.",

        "page_content": "As CEO, Oliver B\u00e4te and his Board of Management team once again led  the  company  to  a  record  profit.  In  addition  to  the  very  good financial performance, his strong personal commitment also helped the company to again achieve top scores for brand value as well as customer and employee satisfaction, forming an excellent basis for the continued  successful  development  of  Allianz.  With  regard  to  the Capital Markets Day to be held in December 2024, the Supervisory Board  expects  to  see  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  the updated corporate strategy in the new financial year. Moreover, the initiatives launched to deliver further productivity gains in the core business and accelerate profitable customer growth are expected to be consistently pursued.\n\nSirma Boshnakova successfully drove the growth of the platform business  ahead  in  the  completed  financial  year:  Apart  from  the continued strong development of Allianz Partners, Ms. Boshnakova successfully  launched  the  Solvd  claims  service  platform  in  several markets. The Allianz Direct direct insurance company also reported robust growth and was migrated to a new IT infrastructure. In addition, the conclusion of a partnership in the bancassurance channel in the Netherlands forms an important basis for further growth. Alongside the continued scaling of Solvd, the Supervisory Board expects Ms. Boshnakova's area of responsibility to deliver further improvement in profitability in 2024.\n\nBarbara  Karuth-Zelle delivered  significant  progress  in  major technology  projects,  in  particular  the  realignment  of  the  Business Master Platform. She also achieved considerable enhancements of the  stability  of  infrastructure  services  and  user  satisfaction  with workplace  services.  Ms.  Karuth-Zelle  was  also  responsible  for  the implementation of important productivity and digitalization initiatives. In addition, Ms. Karuth-Zelle consistently improved the company's IT security and reinforced Group IT Governance by driving ambitious transformation projects forward. Also, the economic management of the IT budget progressed in the completed financial year. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see continued steady improvements, particularly  with  regard  to  the  speed  of  implementation  and profitability  of  the  IT  portfolio,  as  well  as  significant  and  visible productivity gains at Allianz Technology.\n\nKlaus-Peter  R\u00f6hler delivered  further  productivity  gains  in  the portfolio he manages by and drove important transformation projects forward  within  the  Allianz  Group.  The  significant  improvement  in customer satisfaction, for example in life insurance in Germany and Switzerland,  is  particularly  noteworthy.  Employee  satisfaction  also continued to improve year-on-year in almost all subsidiaries in Mr. R\u00f6hler's portfolio. The achievement of financial targets in Mr. R\u00f6hler's portfolio  was  adversely  affected  by  losses  from  natural  disasters, particularly in Germany. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see further efficiency gains through IT investments and the consistent further development of pricing and claims models in property insurance,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  mapping  of  natural  events resulting from climate change.\n\nAs CFO, Giulio Terzariol once again contributed significantly to the company's very solid position in all key financial indicators. Despite an extremely challenging economic  environment,  he  further strengthened the solvency ratio, achieved the confirmation of or even improvements in key credit ratings, and safeguarded Group liquidity. He was also instrumental in ensuring that the high inflation rate only had a moderate impact on the combined ratio in property insurance and the Group result. Mr. Terzariol also successfully implemented the integration  of  the  control  functions  and  strengthened  Group Governance in the long term. After a career spanning 25 years at Allianz with assignments in various places including the U.S., Asia and at the Munich head office, Mr. Terzariol left the company at the end of the year at his own request. The Supervisory Board thanks Mr. Terzariol for his outstanding contributions to the sustainable success of Allianz and wishes him all the best for the future.\n\nG\u00fcnther Thallinger once again achieved a solid investment result in a challenging capital market environment characterized by extreme interest rate increases in many economies. Moreover, Mr. Thallinger's consistent reallocation of the investment portfolio helped secure the company's  strong  positioning,  even  with  regard  to  a  potential continued  increase  in  capital  market  volatility,  as  well  as  Group liquidity. Allianz's leading position in the area of sustainability was further expanded, in particular due to Mr. Thallinger's strong personal commitment  in  formulating  and  implementing  the  new,  ambitious Net-Zero  Plan.  For  2024,  the  Supervisory  Board  expects  to  see  a\n\nconsistent  adjustment  of  the  investment  portfolio  to  the  changing economic framework, taking account of capital market requirements, as well as further profitable growth in the health insurance business.\n\nChristopher  Townsend again  achieved  strong  results  in  the Commercial Lines business in the 2023 financial year, driven by a very gratifying  performance  delivered  by  both  Allianz  Commercial  and Allianz Trade. The entities in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, newly allocated to his area of responsibility, also delivered notably improved results. In addition, Mr. Townsend continued to drive the development of  the  global  Commercial  Lines  business  forward.  For  2024,  the Supervisory  Board  expects  to  see  sustained  improvements  in  the results of Allianz UK and the realization of the financial targets and visible productivity gains from the globalization of the Commercial Lines business.\n\nRenate Wagner quickly adjusted to her new responsibility for the Asia-Pacific business in the completed financial year and achieved robust growth and solid profitability despite continued challenges in Australia. Moreover, Ms. Wagner's efforts relating to the workforce and culture at Allianz again delivered very good results. Examples include employee satisfaction, which reached a record level and the top score among Allianz's competitors in the completed financial year. Allianz once again won several awards to honor its success in the area of Diversity & Inclusion. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects further profitable  growth  in  Asia  and  improved  results  in  Australia. Furthermore, strategic HR planning will remain a top priority in times of shortages of skilled labor.\n\nAndreas  Wimmer safeguarded  the  resilience  of  the  Asset Management  business  segment  and  U.S.  Life  Insurance  in  a  very challenging capital market environment. In Asset Management, he cushioned adverse market effects through disciplined cost management  and  achieved  robust  new  business  despite  strong volatility. In addition to very good growth in U.S. Life Insurance, he also successfully drove an ambitious IT transformation forward. For 2024, the Supervisory Board expects to see the expansion of business with alternative asset classes for third-party customers and the consistent continuation  of  the  integration  of  the  Life  Insurance  and  Asset Management business segments in order to strengthen the resulting business opportunities and the capital efficiency of the Allianz Group.",

        "page_content": "The  following  tables  show  the  individual  remuneration  of  those members  of  the  Board  of  Management  who  were  active  in  the reporting year.\n\nThe  table  'Remuneration  in  the  financial  year'  features  the remuneration  awarded  and  due  in  accordance  with  \u00a7 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG. It includes the payments made in the financial year for base salary, perquisites, and other remuneration. For the variable remuneration, the components for performance fully rendered in the financial  year  are  reported.  This  requirement  is  met  where  the applicable performance criteria are fulfilled and conditions subsequent and suspensive have been met or have ceased to exist. For the 2023 financial year, this is the annual bonus that refers to the 2023 performance period and is paid out in March 2024.  For the share-\n\nased renumeration, the payout of the Allianz Equity Incentive (AEI) RSU allocated in 2019 for the 2018 financial year, which vested in the 2023 financial year, is reported.\n\nThe additional table 'Remuneration for the financial year' goes above and beyond the requirements of \u00a7 162 AktG. It includes  the contributions to base salary and perquisites made in the respective financial year, as well as the annual bonus for the respective financial year and the allocation amount of the share-based remuneration for the financial year.\n\nThe amounts for the annual bonus and LTI allocation reported here result from the achievement of the targets for the financial year. The  information  therefore  directly  depicts  the  correlation  between remuneration and business development.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration for the financial year is decisive for reviewing the retention of the general payout cap of \u20ac 11,750 thou for\n\nthe Chairperson of the Board of Management and \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member. It is reviewed prior to the payout in 2028 of the LTI tranches allocated for the 2023  financial year, and reported in the Remuneration Report for the respective financial year.\n\nFurthermore, the pension expenses in the financial year are listed in both  tables,  even  if  these  expenses  are  not  regarded  as remuneration awarded and due in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG. Finally, in  addition  to  the  absolute  amounts,  the  share  of  the  individual remuneration components relative to the total remuneration is stated.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the information provided for by the Stock Corporation  Act  on  remuneration  awarded  and  due  to  former members of the Board of Management is shown in a separate table.\n\nThe following diagram presents the allocation of the remuneration components in the two tables, using the financial year 2023 as an example:\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for\n\nthe Group's financial target achievement - operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nDr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger  received the share-based compensation for the first time in the 2022 financial year and Giulio Terzariol in 2023. The significant change from 2020 to 2021 in Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler's remuneration is explained by the fact that he joined the Board of\n\nManagement during the year, so the remuneration reported for 2020 is pro rata only. The same rationale applies to the increase from 2021 to 2022 in Dr. Andreas Wimmer's remuneration, as he joined during 2021.\n\nRemuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of  Management  for  the  financial  years  following  their  departure comprises  mainly  pension  payments,  share-based  compensation payouts, and other remuneration.",

Furthermore, the structure of the Supervisory Board's remuneration is regularly  reviewed  with  regard  to  its  compliance  with  German, European, and international corporate governance recommendations and regulations.\n\n- -The set total remuneration is both aligned with the scale and scope of the Supervisory Board's duties and appropriate in view of the Company's activities and its business and financial situation. This also reflects the contribution made by the monitoring activity of the Supervisory Board to the long-term development of the Company.\n- -The remuneration takes into account the individual functions and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members, such as Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, or Committee memberships.\n- -The remuneration structure allows proper oversight of management  as  well  as  independent  decisions  on  executive personnel and remuneration.\n- -Given  Allianz's  relative  size  and  complexity  as  well  as  its sustainable  performance,  the  remuneration  of  the  Supervisory Board is oriented towards the fourth quartile of the supervisory board remuneration of peers in the DAX.\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE provides for a  fixed  remuneration.  Supervisory  Board  members  who  had  only served on the Supervisory Board during part of the financial year receive one twelfth of the remuneration for each month of service commenced.  This  shall  apply  accordingly  for  membership  of Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Remuneration System was presented to the Annual General Meeting of Allianz SE on 4 May 2023  and was approved with a majority vote of 95.07 %.\n\n## Fixed annual remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of a Supervisory Board member consists of a fixed cash amount paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the financial year. Each regular Supervisory Board member receives a fixed remuneration amounting to \u20ac 150 thou per year. The Chairperson receives \u20ac 450 thou, each Deputy Chairperson receives \u20ac 225 thou.\n\n## Committee-related remuneration\n\nThe Chairperson and members of the Supervisory Board committees receive additional committee-related remuneration which is also paid pro  rata  temporis  after  the  end  of  the  respective  quarter  of  the financial year. The committee-related remuneration is as shown in the graph below:\n\n## Attendance fees and expenses\n\nIn addition  to  the  fixed  and  committee-related  remuneration, members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  receive  an  attendance  fee  of \u20ac 1,000 for each Supervisory Board or committee meeting they attend in person. Should several meetings be held on the same or consecutive days, the attendance fee will only be paid once. The attendance fee is payable after the respective meeting.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with their Supervisory Board activities. The company provides insurance coverage and technical support to the Supervisory Board members to an extent reasonable for carrying out their Supervisory Board duties.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The executive directors and the supervisory board are also  responsible  for  such  internal  control  as  they  determine  is necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  a  remuneration  report, including the related disclosures, that is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration  report.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the auditor's  judgment.  This  includes  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of material  misstatement  of  the  remuneration  report  including  the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control  relevant  to  the  preparation  of  the  remuneration  report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting  estimates  made  by  the  executive  directors  and  the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, including  the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report  required  by  \u00a7 162 Abs. [paragraph]  3 AktG,  including  the issuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit opinion includes that the information required by \u00a7 162 Abs. 1 and 2 AktG  has  been  disclosed  in  all  material  respects  in  the remuneration report.\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Allianz SE. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties; no third parties are included in the scope of protection of the underlying engagement.  \u00a7 334 BGB  [B\u00fcrgerliches  Gesetzbuch:  German  Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, 26 February 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nFlorian M\u00f6ller\n\nDennis Schnittger\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)",
