In it, you'll find information about our continued delivery of Responsible Growth, and the success we had with clients, teammates, communities, and shareholders.\n\nDuring 2023, our company made $26.5 billion in net income. This included pretax charges of $2.1 billion for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Special Assessment and net $1.6 billion for the impact of the future cessation of the Bloomberg Short-term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), which combined to total $3.7 billion pretax, or $2.8 billion a/fter-tax. Excluding these charges, we made $29.3 billion. We earned strong, double-digit adjusted return on equity, 1 and we delivered capital back to our shareholders, and increased our dividend.\n\nAs we think about 2023, we have to put it into context of the last few years. We saw COVID impacts to economies around the world in 2020 and beyond, and we saw high inflation due to the excessive government fiscal and monetary stimulus. We had the Federal Reserve monetary response to the inflation, which, in its own view, was delayed too long, resulting in one of the fastest rate-rising scenarios in absolute terms (500 bps plus), relative terms (from 25 bps to 550 bps, or 20+ times the interest rate), and the time elapsed from first hike to pause. We saw major regional wars start in Europe and the Middle East, requiring funding support from Europe and the U.S. We saw trade disruptions, sanctions, and other reactions to the wars and other geopolitical turbulence. We saw bank failures and disruptions-the costs of which were sent to the larger banks (note the $2.1 billion FDIC charge that your company accrued in the fourth quarter). We have seen regulator reactions to those failures.\n\nSo how did your company do in light of all that?\n\nWe earned more than $100 billion a/fter tax (an annual average of $26 billion in a/fter-tax earnings) for 2020-2023, bringing us to more than $200 billion in the last 10 years.\n\nHow did we do that? We drove Responsible Growth and its core tenets: Grow and win in the market, no excuses; Grow with our customer focus; Grow within our risk framework; and Grow in a sustainable manner.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Simply put, we stood strong for shareholders, clients, teammates, and communities in 2023, during another year of change and volatility across the financial services sector and beyond. Our ongoing commitment to Responsible Growth helped us deliver for all our stakeholders.\n\nOne of Bank of America's core values is our focus on teamwork and delivering together. With that in mind, I want to thank our Board of Directors for their guidance and our Management Team for helping to lead our work this year. More information about these leaders is available on pages 14 and 15, along with perspective from our Lead Independent Director Lionel Nowell on page 13. Lionel also shares a tribute to our friend Frank Bramble, a 17-year member of the Board who passed away last year. We miss Frank and his guidance.\n\nI also want to recognize my 213,000 teammates who drive Responsible Growth by living our purpose and values. Every day, they come to work ready to win for clients, communities, shareholders-and for one another. I am honored to lead this extraordinary team.\n\nTogether, this year we continued to deliver on the strength of our franchise as we drove organic growth across our eight lines of business, carefully managed risk, and maintained our disciplined focus on Operational Excellence, which helped enable us to control expenses as we continued to invest in the future.\n\n## DELIVERING CONSISTENT, LONG-TERM RETURNS\n\nWe believe that a long-term view of our stock performance is helpful in times of near-term volatility and that ultimately our consistent performance for stakeholders will drive our share price.\n\nOver the course of the last decade, our stock price has shown strong performance against the KBW Bank Index, which tracks the performance of the leading publicly traded banks in the U.S. At the same time, bank stocks have faced challenges when compared to broader indexes: for example, the S&P 500 index\n\n## 10-year stock performance vs. key indexes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhas performed well, but was heavily driven by a narrow group of technology companies in 2023, influencing both long- and shortterm comparative performance.\n\nYour company also remains well-positioned for the future. Our credit quality is strong; we have capital ratios in excess of current and expected potential regulatory minimums; our brand is highly respected; our employee satisfaction and loyalty rates remain at best-in-class highs, and turnover is near an all-time low; and clients continue to bring us more business across our entire company.\n\nMost importantly, we are also well-positioned to drive growth further-no matter what the market or the world sends our way. This is outlined in greater detail in the remainder of this letter and throughout the pages of this report.\n\nYour company remains well-positioned for the future. Most importantly, we are well-positioned to drive growth further -no matter what the market or the world sends our way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

These results include pretax noninterest expense of\n- $2.1 billion ($1.6 billion a/fter-tax) for the FDIC Special Assessment\n- and a net pretax charge of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion a/fter-tax) for the impact of BSBY's future cessation, or $0.20 and $0.15 per\n- diluted share, respectively. Excluding these notable items, full-year adjusted net income was $29.3 billion, or adjusted diluted EPS of $3.42, which grew 7% compared to 2022.\n\nOur results were once again driven by organic growth across our lines of business, higher interest rates, a strong deposit franchise benefitting net interest income, good sales and trading results, and careful expense management.\n\nTotal assets of $3.18 trillion in 2023 were up 4% compared to 2022. Total deposits of $1.92 trillion were down less than 1% over the year. They have increased 4% from a trough in mid-May 2023.\n\nIn 2023, loans and leases increased to more than $1.05 trillion. Asset quality remained strong, but continued to rise from historic lows in 2022, and still remains strong among historical comparisons. Provision expense for the year was $4.4 billion.\n\nOur strong capital position, in addition to solid earnings, enabled us to return $12 billion to shareholders in common stock dividends and share repurchases in 2023, while simultaneously investing in customer growth. For the year 2023, our dividend rose 7%, to $0.92 per share for the year.\n\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (CET1) rose 8% year-over-year from $180 billion in fourth-quarter 2022 to $195 billion at the end of fourth-quarter 2023. And our CET1 ratio of 11.8% exceeds our current minimum regulatory requirements. The amount of CET1 we have leaves us wellprepared for any proposed capital rules (the Basel III 'End Game').\n\n## DELIVERING RESPONSIBLE GROWTH IN 2023\n\nNow I'd like to share some specific examples of how your company performed against the four tenets of Responsible Growth in 2023.\n\nGrow and win in the market, no excuses. 2023 continued to be a year defined by organic growth across all of our eight lines of business:\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer Banking: Retail Banking and Preferred Banking\n- \u00b7 Global Wealth & Investment Management: Merrill and The Private Bank\n- \u00b7 Global Banking: Business Banking, Global Commercial Banking, and Global Corporate & Investment Banking\n- \u00b7 Global Markets\n\nResponsible Growth calls us to deliver on our purpose with every client: helping them to achieve their financial goals. We do this by asking one question: What would you like the power to do? We listen to their unique answers, and then we get to work, developing and providing the necessary products and services seamlessly, across our eight lines of business.\n\nThe client teams within each line of business work together to grow and win by serving clients across the company, as they continue to drive client referrals so that we can provide solutions across a client's entire financial life. We track client referrals between our lines of business in our local markets. For 2023, our client teams drove more than 8.6 million total referrals among our lines of business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor our consumers, a core service we provide is transaction ('checking') accounts. In 2023, we ended the year with a record 36.7 million checking accounts, including 20 straight quarters of net account growth. Ninety-two percent of our accounts are serving as a primary account. Our record consumer investment assets of $424 billion grew $105 billion, or 33%, from the fourth-quarter 2022, driven by $49 billion of client flows from new and existing clients and higher market valuations. We ended the year with 3.8 million consumer investment accounts, up 10% from 2022. We also opened 4.6 million new consumer credit card accounts during the year.\n\nRecord\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n36.7M checking accounts - including 20 straight quarters of net account growth at year-end 2023\n\nIn 2023, we celebrated the ninth year of our award-winning loyalty program, Preferred Rewards, with 11.1 million total clients enrolled - an 8% year-over-year increase from fourth-quarter 2022. Members of the program enjoy many exclusive benefits and pricing discounts, all designed around the ways they save, spend, and borrow with Bank of America and invest with Merrill. They achieved these benefits by doing more business with us. The program consistently maintains a best-in-class 99% annualized membership retention rate.\n\nSmall business owners can access our leading products, scale and expertise through a number of channels: our financial centers across the U.S. - including our ATM network; and digitally through videoconferencing, chat, and mobile technology. This breadth of service has allowed us to consistently maintain our position among the nation's largest Small Business lenders, and we ended 2023 with $25 billion in small business loans and a 3% increase in Small Business checking accounts, to end the year at 3.9 million Small Business checking customers. We ranked No. 1 in FDIC data on loans under $1 million principal amount to businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Both businesses continue to assist clients through recent market turbulence and economic uncertainty. In 2023, we welcomed a record number of new wealth management clients to our company, with approximately 40,000 net new relationships across Merrill and The Private Bank.\n\nIn addition, we opened a record of nearly 150,000 bank accounts in 2023, as we continued to grow relationships across the wealth continuum. Client balances reached $3.8 trillion, up 12%, driven by higher market valuations and positive net client flows. We achieved assets under management (AUM) flows of $52 billion in 2023, totaling AUM balances of $1.6 trillion, up $216 billion over 2022.\n\nGlobal Banking serves our commercial and corporate clients. Global Corporate & Investment Banking had more than $172 billion in outstanding average loans and $273 billion in average deposits. Global Commercial Banking serves mid-sized U.S. companies, primarily, with $195 billion in average loans and more than\n\n$180 billion in average deposits at the end of 2023. Business Banking serves companies with $5-$50 million in revenue, ending the year with more than $12 billion in outstanding average loans and more than $50 billion in average deposits.\n\nTogether, these groups (with small business) form the best continuums to serve businesses of all sizes. They have received multiple awards in the past year for relationship management, advice, and transactional capabilities. In 2023, we were No. 3 in both U.S. and international investment banking fees. We also added roughly 2,500 new clients to the Global Banking platform this year while continuing to deepen relationships with existing clients.\n\nGlobal Markets had a standout year. Global Markets serves institutional investors and the needs of corporate and commercial clients as they interface with the capital markets. The team drove the highest sales and trading revenue in our company's history$17.4 billion -as we continued to benefit from the investments we have made in this business. Overall Global Markets average trading-related assets were up 3% year-over-year and average loans of $129.7 billion increased 11%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Erica continues to drive increased client engagement, in part because it gives us the ability to deliver important information and answer questions in real time. Since launching five years ago, Erica is nearing 1.9 billion interactions with more than 40 million of our clients. It took four years to reach the first billion interactions and only a bit over a year to approach our second billion. Client engagement with Erica is accelerating, nearly doubling in just the past year.\n\nThe public interest in AI clearly has grown in the past year, even though we have been applying it for years. With Erica being driven by AI and machine learning, and a lot of discussion about applying AI to business, it could be helpful to set forth what we are doing on everyone's favorite topic these days. We are an innovation company. We hold more than 4,500 patents. Our patents are o/ften cited by other innovators in technology and in the financial industry. We believe we provide a great platform for innovation here, but as with all technology, it has to be understood and controlled in our environments, and we do that. So, we use AI for customer service with Erica. We are piloting the use of AI in computer programming, to improve how we do our own coding, in areas where we use machine learning and algorithm models today, and in other areas. AI can be applied effectively. Erica tells us that. But it has to be done carefully.\n\nWe are an innovation company. We hold more than 4,500 patents.

As of fourth-quarter 2023, the number of consumer clients who are active Zelle users increased 18% year-over-year to 21.5 million. These active users sent and received 342 million transfers worth $101 billion, an increase of 26% and 25% year-over-year, respectively. Our clients continue to use it more o/ften than writing a check, and the reduced work allows us to be an extremely efficient provider. We can pass our savings, driven by Zelle and our digital practices, to consumers (see for example the overdra/ft policies we have adopted or our low-cost checking accounts).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur wealth clients also demand digital innovation, and their usage is increasing, as these figures from the close of fourth-quarter 2023 show:\n\n- \u00b7 Zelle transactions by Private Bank clients increased 37%.\n- \u00b7 Merrill households are 83% digitally active, while our Private Bank clients are now 92% digitally active.\n- \u00b7 Digital check deposit rates for Merrill and Private Bank clients ended the year at 75% for both businesses.\n- \u00b7  Merrill now has 80% of households enrolled in information eDelivery.\n- \u00b7 72% of eligible Merrill bank and brokerage accounts were opened through Digital Onboarding in fourth-quarter 2023, up from 39% a year ago.\n\nSimilar growth can be seen in our CashPro\u00ae and BA360 platforms for commercial, corporate, and business banking clients. Seventy-five percent of those clients are digitally active on the platforms, as of fourth-quarter 2023. Our easy-to-use CashPro app also continues to save our commercial clients time, including an ever-increasing percentage of credit documents uploaded digitally. CashPro app engagement in the fourth quarter of 2023 saw active users increasing 21% and sign-ins increasing 24%, in turn driving a 35% increase in quarterly CashPro app payment approvals for a record value of $245 billion. Erica has been added to CashPro and is off to a great start.\n\nBank of America also knows that in addition to high-tech, many clients will need a level of high-touch service, where they can receive in-person expert support and guidance. Our digital savings allow us to invest here. To make that possible in 2023, we opened 50 new financial centers, and renovated 911 more. Since 2018, we have invested more than $3 billion in capital in our branch system. We plan to continue to invest a like amount over the next several years. We ended the year with 3,845 financial centers and 15,168 ATMs. This network also includes our phone, office, and chat capabilities. We also are planning to expand into Omaha, Louisville, Boise, Birmingham, Madison, New Orleans, Milwaukee, Dayton, and Huntsville. This growth of our footprint will help us to better serve our clients, expand relationships and drive local community growth and development.\n\nWorking together for our clients, Bank of America's combined hightech and high-touch client service continued to result in record-high levels of Consumer satisfaction.\n\nWorking together for our clients, Bank of America's combined high-tech and high-touch client service continued to result in record-high levels of Consumer customer satisfaction, which, in turn, drives Responsible Growth as clients seek to do more of their financial business with us.\n\nAnother key aspect of growth with a customer focus is our work in the affordable housing sector. We have continued progress toward our $15 billion Community Homeownership Commitment to help 60,000 individuals and families purchase a home. Since the program launched in 2019, we have helped nearly 45,000 individuals and families with more than $11 billion in affordable lending to purchase a home and provided more than $453 million in down payment and closing cost grants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also continued to provide capital for private equity and venture funds led by diverse managers, as well as growth equity funding for the minority entrepreneurs they support, to help diminish barriers that make it difficult for underrepresented minority and women entrepreneurs to access start-up and growth capital. As of December 2023, we have committed more than $550 million in equity investments to minority- and women-led funds, more than doubling our initial $200 million commitment. This creates opportunity for some who would otherwise not get it. You can read more about how we are investing in diverse entrepreneurs on page 40.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupply chain diversity is important for our company. To that end, in 2023, approximately $2 billion of our more than $18 billion in annual spending was with diverse suppliers, helping create growth opportunities for those companies.\n\nOur ability to drive client satisfaction across our company owes thanks, in part, to the members of our National Community Advisory Council (NCAC). The NCAC was established 18 years ago as a group of external advisors, analysts, and consumer advocates that meets from time to time throughout the year to provide the company with unique external perspective on the products and services we offer.",

This framework has continued to allow us to grow\n\n- during the current volatile market environment, while maintaining\n- a heightened state of awareness, constantly reviewing the market\n\nenvironment and our practices to support the ongoing strength\n\n- and resiliency our clients and investors value. We continue to take\n- a proactive approach toward managing risk to monitor, mitigate, and control existing risks and identify emerging ones. This includes continuing a key focus on operational and compliance risks and driving Operational Excellence across our businesses.\n\nRecognizing and managing risk is integral to how we drive Responsible Growth every day. This applies to all my teammates worldwide, with our 8,000-plus teammates in Risk, Compliance, and Audit leading the discipline across the enterprise. It is core to who we are.\n\nEffective risk management helps enable us to be well-prepared for any situation, including severe economic stress scenarios. This is well illustrated by the fact Bank of America had the lowest stressed credit loss rates among peers in 10 out of the past 11 Federal Reserve Board annual stress tests. In 2023, credit quality began to rise off historic lows of the previous couple years, ending with $3.8 billion in net charge-offs. We also added to our reserve for loan losses, bringing our total provision expense to $4.39 billion.\n\n7,897 0.87% Overall, our $3.2 trillion balance sheet continues to be supported by high levels of capital and liquidity, enabling us to continue to grow our business with clients, while meeting potential regulatory requirements, returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends, and repurchasing shares. This ongoing strength underpins our position, expressed to regulators and elected officials, that additional significant capital requirements for already well-capitalized U.S. financial institutions restrict our ability to deliver for our stakeholders, drive the economy, and remain globally competitive.\n\n4,383\n\n0.49% Grow in a sustainable manner. Responsible Growth requires us to grow in a sustainable manner, with a simultaneous focus on three components.\n\nThe first of these is our appetite for enhancing Operational Excellence (OpEx) at every opportunity. OpEx is at the heart of\n\n2013\n\n## Net charge off (NCO) and coverage ratios normalizing\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNCO in $MM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNCO in $MM\n\nNCO Ratio\n\nhow we reduce costs by eliminating inefficiencies in our processes across our company and reinvest the savings into the people and things that are core to it: our client experience; our team; our capabilities; our communities; and our shareholders. Second, we aspire to be a Great Place to Work for our teammates. This is driven by a career mindset-we want to not only attract the best employees, we want to keep them with us, always learning, sharing their experiences, and helping us reward our shareholders with lower turnover costs. Third, we know that when the communities in which we live and do business are strong, Bank of America is strong, too. So, we share our success to help communities address their biggest challenges.\n\nDriving Operational Excellence. OpEx has served us well over prior years and is critical to supporting our growth priorities in the years ahead. Uncovering additional improvement and simplification opportunities allows us to serve clients well and redirect current expenses to support incremental growth.\n\nWe empower all of our employees to drive OpEx across the company. As a result, we have implemented nearly 15,000 employee-sourced suggestions since 2014 to simplify our work and create greater efficiency. In addition to making it easier to serve our clients, these ideas have resulted in nearly $5.3 billion in expense savings and 12.5 million hours of capacity saved as of year-end 2023.\n\n## Our OpEx results to-date include approximately:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3,648\n\n0.38%\n\n4,121\n\n0.42%",

That is strong work by the team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $3.8B invested per year in tech initiatives - made possible by our OpEx efforts\n\nThis discipline also allowed us to invest, to expand annual tech initiatives to $3.8 billion per year, to open in new markets, and to expand sales force capacity, all while reducing headcount.\n\nMaking our company a Great Place to Work . In 2023, we continued our established practice of delivering a set of the most competitive and supportive benefits to help our employees develop as professionals, thrive mentally and physically, and bring their entire selves to work, every day.\n\n## Highlights include:\n\n- \u00b7 We increased our U.S. minimum hourly wage to $23 in our next step toward $25 by 2025. This means that any employee who works full-time for our company makes, at minimum, nearly $48,000 per year and has access to our comprehensive benefits.\n- \u00b7 As a further investment in our team, and in recognition of their contributions to our company in 2023, the Management Team, Board of Directors, and I once again presented approximately 97% of our teammates with a Sharing Success compensation award. This was the seventh time teammates received this award, with more than $4.8 billion distributed since the program was introduced in 2017 following the passage of tax reform. While others made it a one-year program, we did not. Nearly all of the 2023 Sharing Success awards are in company stock; stock ownership by our employees is a key priority for our company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Our new sabbatical program for employees went active, celebrating teammate milestones of 15 years of service or more. As of 2023 year-end, more than 10,000 employees had taken either a four-, five- or six-week paid leave, depending on years with the company.\n- \u00b7 We continued to expand the global capabilities of The Academy, Bank of America's award-winning onboarding, education, and professional development organization dedicated to the growth and success of all teammates across the enterprise. In 2023, there were more than 127,000 Academy program enrollments.\n- \u00b7 For the 11 th year in a row, U.S. teammates earning less than $50,000 annually did not see an increase in medical premiums.\n\n## Employee turnover near record low\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also continued our critically important work to maintain and strengthen an inclusive and supportive environment where every employee can build and enjoy a meaningful career. This workand so much more-helped drive our Employee Engagement to 87%, up 2% from last year, while our Diversity & Inclusion Index remained strong at 84%.\n\nOur goal for you as shareholders is to acquire the best talent and have them spend their career here, with strong performance. Each year we recognize our long-service teammates. When you recognize hundreds of employees with more than 30 years of service, you see the impact of being the best place for teammates to work.\n\nYou can read more about how we are investing in teammates in our Human Capital Management update on pages 46-63.\n\n<!-- image -->",

From wildfires in Maui, to shootings in far too many of our markets, to hurricanes and\n- floods-Bank of America stood with our communities and\n- supplied much-needed relief funds and volunteer efforts to\n- help them recover.\n- We also witnessed a rise in expressions of hate around the world, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Israel that occurred on Oct. 7. In response, we built on our long-standing, broad-based work to help fight hate and discrimination directed toward any group. We do this work inside the company and through our support to expert, leading organizations. This includes our partnership with the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism in their fight against all forms of hate, and other groups, such as World Food Programme, which provides humanitarian aid in Gaza, along with other important work.\n\nIn 2023 we also shared our success with those who have so ably served our country, announcing our second round of financing-$10 million-for the Veteran Loan Fund. This doubles a two-year commitment that has already funded more than 500 small businesses built by former military personnel. We also have hired thousands of veterans over the last several years, exceeding our goals.\n\nOur commitment to sharing success with communities also demands we help society accelerate toward a secure and sustainable lower-carbon future. We are doing so by mobilizing capital and working alongside our clients and partners.\n\nOur commitment to sharing success with communities also demands we help society accelerate toward a secure and sustainable lower-carbon future. We are doing so by mobilizing capital and working alongside our clients and partners to address the need for energy affordability, sustainability and security.\n\nThe transition to a cleaner-energy economy is estimated to take tens of trillions of dollars over the next 30 years. Recognizing the amount of capital necessary, in 2021 we set a goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion by 2030 to support the Sustainable Development Goals, with $1 trillion focused on the environmental transition. We have since mobilized $560 billion in sustainable finance, with more than $316 billion focused on the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI'm sometimes asked why Bank of America invests so much energy and money in clients who are engaged in clean energy transition. The answer is simple: it's good business.\n\nI'm sometimes asked why Bank of America invests so much energy and money in clients who are engaged in clean energy transition. The answer is simple: it's good business. Our clients (big and small) need our advice and capital for them to meet their goals. And for the world to secure availability of affordable energy everywhere, it has to involve energy companies, large corporations, small businesses, and energy experts. The private sector is vital to accelerating this transition because no one company, charity, or country's government can drive this change by themselves-they don't have the money, the talent, or the innovation. Only the private sector, working together, does.\n\nBank of America has a long history of leading and participating in public-private and cross-sector coalitions focused on accelerating and scaling climate finance in a targeted and equitable manner. This includes the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), which was initiated in 2019 by His Majesty King Charles III in his former role as His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, and which I am honored to chair. The SMI continues to bring together hundreds of companies from the private sector, including at COP28 where it helped to deliver the first-ever Business & Philanthropy Climate Forum.\n\nYou can read more about our approach to Sustainable Finance and how we're helping our clients make the transition they seek on page 42.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD TO 2024\n\nOur BofA Global Research team has been named Institutional Investor's No. 1 or No. 2 global research leader for each of the past 13 years. Their basic view is that the U.S. economy will see a 'so/ft landing' this year. Throughout 2022, the research team predicted a 2023 recession, but as we moved through the first half of last year, that recession prediction continued to be pushed out. Why is that? The consumer continued to spend. While the rate of spending has slowed over the course of 2023, year-over-year spending growth now looks like the more normal pattern one might expect in a lower-GDP-growth, lower-inflation environment, similar to pre-pandemic. Additionally, employment levels remain strong in a historical context and wage growth remains solid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13\n\nconsecutive years our BofA Global Research team has been ranked No. 1 or No. 2 by Institutional Investor",

        "page_content": "We also have a line of sight into one of the largest pools of consumer data in the world: our own customer base. We analyze the balances and behavior patterns of 69 million clients, representing nearly $4.1 trillion going into the economy. In 2023, consumer spending growth fell to 4%, which is similar to growth levels seen in 2016 when the economy grew at 2% and inflation was low.\n\nSo, as I write this letter, here's the current economic snapshot: consumers have slowed down; but they still have money and they still have the ability to borrow. And because they continue to be employed, we expect a so/ft landing for the U.S. economy. All of this points to a more normalized, pre-pandemic position. The current rate environment is proving to be a drag on economic activity as intended. The slowdown from 4.9% growth in third-quarter 2023 to our projected levels of 2%-2.5% in the first half of 2024 is a slowdown and has to be watched to ensure the so/ft landing. In addition, fiscal spending by Federal and local governments has to come down, as deficits are too high. This will be an additional drag.\n\nOf course, there are risks to this economic view.\n\nThese include the Ukraine-Russia war, the Middle East conflict between Hamas and Israel, and the near-term economic ramifications of both. There have been impacts and questions\n\naround the shipping of goods, which raises prices for those goods. And, of course, there's the opportunity cost of these wars, with consumer and business spending and borrowing there heavily impacted-and further risk if the conflicts escalate. We're also mindful of U.S. and global relationships with China and hopeful it can remain on productive, solid ground. In addition, governmental deficits are running high, and must pull back, which will lead to a further drop on the economy.\n\nAt the end of the day, capitalists and entrepreneurs don't like uncertainty. When uncertainty comes, they slow down their spending and borrowing. This more conservative behavior is also driven by a perception that too many direct market drivers are out of control. And there's nothing more outside of control for the average global consumer and business than certain geopolitical events.\n\nAs I travel around the country and the world, geopolitical risks are raised by many. Outside the U.S., there also is a lot of curiosity about this year's elections in the U.S. Rest assured, whatever the election outcomes, we will be ready. Our company's oldest heritage dates to 1784. There have been a lot of elections since then, and some interesting ones. There have been a lot of geopolitical changes here and around the world. Our job is to just manage through it.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Charity doesn't provide enough money. Governments are short on cash and run huge deficits, and at the same time, policies shi/ft, which makes long-term change hard to achieve. The required scale of progress can only be achieved through the combined efforts of private sector companies around the world-with support from policy makers. And the universal Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics (SCM) in this report help consistently track that progress to prove capitalism is working across the breadth of global industry to support key societal goals, including the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nYou can find our 2023 SCMs on page 66. This is the fourth consecutive year we have published these metrics in our Annual Report, in addition to our financial disclosures. We believe this provides the most relevant, useful and transparent information. This disclosure is comprehensive and straightforward, allowing you, our shareholders, to assess your company and our performance in many non-financial, measurable ways.\n\nMany observers express different views on disclosures; for example, there are multiple shareholder proposals in our proxy statement, each expressing different views on what is the right disclosure or action. We encourage you to review our SCMs and all the other disclosures we reference in this Annual Report and proxy statement.\n\nBuilding on the work of the SCMs, which were developed by the International Business Council in coordination with the Big Four global accounting firms, we continue to advocate for a global, transparent standard for non-financial disclosure to measure the progress the private sector is making to help ensure the flow of capital goes where it is needed most to help make progress on important priorities, including the clean energy transition. The emergence of the voluntary disclosure standards from the International Sustainability Standards Board, for example, is a constructive step toward ensuring that wherever we operate and are required to disclose our activities in these areas, we are doing so against consistent, transparent, global standards. The SCMs have helped shape this work, and we will continue to work with leaders in both the voluntary and regulated disclosure processes to drive progress. We need convergence so companies can get the work done rather than spend valuable resources on a multitude of similar but inconsistent measures.\n\nIn a time of continued change in the domestic and global economy, we continued to manage our company for the long term and to do what we do best: drive Responsible Growth.",

We are focused on delivering profits and purpose. We drove organic growth and record Consumer client satisfaction. We closely managed risk. We invested in our people, our digital capabilities, and the physical spaces where we work together to support our clients, while reinforcing our commitment to manage expenses for the long term. We made our company simpler and more efficient, while identifying ways to do that even more in the years ahead.

That was once again the case in 2023, as your company successfully delivered in another year of change and volatility.\n\nBank of America was able to do all of this through its continued focus on Responsible Growth.\n\nThis commitment to Responsible Growth is shared by your company's Board, and it extends throughout the organization to all the employees serving clients and our communities every day. This is clear to all of us on your Board, as we conduct ongoing, fulsome oversight of the company's activities, including key areas such as Bank of America's strategic plans, enterprise risk management, human capital development, and external initiatives developed to strengthen the communities we serve.\n\nThis focus on Responsible Growth is incredibly important to everyone at Bank of America, as well as your Board. It was especially important to Frank Bramble, a 17-year member of the Board, who passed away in September 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrank counseled our company and industry through a time of tremendous change, first joining the Board in 2006 through Bank of America's acquisition of MBNA, where he served as executive vice chairman. Frank's decades of experience, his thoughtful insight, his disciplined approach to risk management, and his determination were deeply valued by his fellow directors, as well as by leaders throughout the company. He continuously wanted and expected more of us, believing in Bank of America's purpose and in Responsible Growth. I know that Frank was incredibly proud of Bank of America, and I share that pride. We will truly miss his wisdom and dedication to this company.\n\nI encourage you to review this Annual Report and the 2024 Proxy Statement, which are full of examples outlining how Bank of America's enduring focus on Responsible Growth continues to enable your company to generate solid results, even in a year in which so much around us in the world has changed.\n\nThank you for investing in Bank of America. We look forward to delivering for you and all our stakeholders, today and in the years ahead.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLionel L. Nowell III\n\nMarch 1, 2024",

This includes solutions to reduce their carbon footprint, assisting them in identifying technologies and pathways that can be deployed and followed as they transition, and providing a full suite of financial solutions, including lending, capital raising, advisory, investment services and risk management, to help them meet their goals.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is estimated to take hundreds of trillions of dollars over the next 30 years and beyond, presenting an unprecedented business opportunity for Bank of America to partner with clients in areas where they need strategic assistance the most, therefore increasing market share and continuing to grow responsibly.\n\nRecognizing the amount of capital required, in 2021, we set a goal to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion by 2030 that is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, with $1 trillion focused on the environmental transition and the remaining dedicated to inclusive social development. Since our announcement of this goal in 2021, we have mobilized and deployed $560 billion in sustainable finance, with more than $316 billion focused on the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy. This includes capital for efficient, low-carbon power generation and transmission, sustainable transportation with an emphasis on electric vehicles and sustainable fuels, sustainable food and agriculture, clean water and sanitation, recycling and up-cycling, and carbon-capture and off-setting solutions.\n\nWhile the private sector is a vital component of accelerating this transition, no single company or country can do it alone. We have a long history of leading and participating in public-private and cross-sector coalitions focused on accelerating and scaling climate finance in a targeted and equitable manner. This includes the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), which was launched in 2020 by His Majesty King Charles III, in his former role as His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales, and is chaired by our CEO, Brian Moynihan. SMI continues to bring together the private sector, including at COP28, where SMI served as a delivery partner of the first-ever Business & Philanthropy Climate Forum.\n\n42\n\n|    BANK OF AMERICA 2023\n\nThrough our financing, work with clients and public-private sector collaborations, we focus our efforts on areas where we can expand our product capabilities and existing capital mobilization activities, and innovate by bringing new financing solutions to bear for our clients and communities-all with a focus on an affordable, clean and more secure energy future.\n\n- \u00b7 We served as transferability underwriter, placement agent and financial advisor to IRG Acquisition Holdings (IRGAH) - a partnership between Invenergy, CDPQ and funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure Partners on the first announced large-scale transfer of Production Tax Credits since the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. This transaction provided significant capital to IRGAH for the acquisition of American Electric Power's portfolio of 14 projects across 11 states, comprising 1,200 megawatts (MW) of wind generation and 165 MW of solar projects.\n- \u00b7 We acted as sole initial purchaser, structuring agent, dealer-manager and bookrunner on the first-ever debt-for-nature transaction in Continental Africa to refinance $500 million of sovereign debt of the Gabonese Republic. Political risk insurance of up to $500 million provided by the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation resulted in an Aa2 investment grade rating, which attracted investors, extended the tenor and lowered interest payments. In addition, the Gabonese Republic will contribute $125 million in new funding for nature and ocean conservation, supporting its commitment to protect 30% of its lands, freshwater systems and oceans by 2030.\n- \u00b7 We issued our inaugural Euro-denominated green bond for \u20ac1 billion, designed to advance equipment, technology and infrastructure supporting the generation, storage, transmission and distribution of electricity from renewable energy. This issuance complemented our other U.S. dollar-denominated issuances and solidified our position as one of the largest U.S. corporate issuers of ESG-themed bonds.",

We do this in a number of ways, including philanthropy and volunteerism. Building on the educational resources we provide to our teammates, our award-winning onboarding, education and professional development organization-The Academy-provides free education to individuals in local communities to help advance their career growth and success.

During the past two years, 74% of job seekers found jobs within six months.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt's been our longstanding practice that most of our entry-level roles do not require four-year degrees. Through our skills-first approach, we provide training and resources to help prepare individuals to work in financial services. One example is our partnership with external partners, including Year Up-a nonprofit organization that provides young adults with training and internships that help them reach their full potential. We've provided internships to hundreds of Year Up participants in the U.S., offering them one-on-one mentor support, professional development and networking opportunities. Many of the Year Up interns are welcomed to our company as full-time employees, where they can continue to advance their career.\n\n## Our local investments in education and training help build a stronger talent pipeline.\n\nWhen given the chance to generate wealth and achieve economic mobility, individuals and their families can enhance their lives and contribute to the overall prosperity of the broader community. By engaging with stakeholders across our markets, we will continue to build momentum and deliver on the tangible outcomes of jobs and careers for individuals.",

During Mental Health Awareness Month, teammates wore green to show support and tuned in to 70 live webinars on topics like overcoming burnout, coping with anxiety and embracing self-care.\n\nWe also continued our partnership with Thrive Global to provide instructor-led training opportunities and self-guided videos for teammates to build mental resiliency and learn how to better handle life's everyday challenges, as well as manager-focused wellness training so they can best support teammates.\n\n## SABBATICAL PROGRAM\n\nMore than 10,000 employees celebrating at least 15 years of continuous service with our company participated in the first year of our global sabbatical program. It is designed for teammates to enjoy an additional 4-6 weeks of paid time off to use as they need, ultimately providing a chance to recharge and refocus. Teammates have shared stories from their travels to new locations, time spent with new family members, adventures in learning new hobbies and giving back to communities.\n\n## EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP) AND ONSITE SPECIALISTS\n\nTeammates and members of their households can connect with our Employee Assistance Program for 12 free in-person confidential counseling sessions annually and unlimited phone consultations. Teammates can use these sessions for a variety of issues, including relationships, grief or loss, anxiety, caregiving and time management, or simply to find someone to talk to.\n\nImproving the reach of these services, onsite EAP specialists and benefits navigators are now located in work locations across 18 states and many of our international locations. These counselors offer work and life benefits expertise and face-to-face confidential counseling to assist with personal and professional needs.\n\nOnsite Employee Assistance Program specialists and benefits navigators are now located in work locations across 18 states and many of our international locations.\n\n## LIFE EVENT SERVICES (LES)\n\nOur specialized LES team supports teammates in the moments that matter most, providing personalized connections to resources by tapping experts inside and outside the company for assistance with significant events, such as domestic violence, natural disasters, terminal illness, retiring from the company, survivor support and more.\n\nIn 2023, LES continued to serve as a critical, front-line team in response to disasters and crisis events, connecting teammates and their families to emotional wellness support, back-up child and adult care, emergency relief and other resources. LES supported more than 3,800 teammates and their families in 2023 following tragic events across the globe, including in Hawai'i, Maine, Vermont, Israel, Gaza, Libya, Mexico and Morocco.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We support teammates in reaching financial wellness with retirement savings plans and other programs, and provide access to self-guided tools and expert advice.\n\n## TUITION ASSISTANCE AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT\n\nOur Tuition Assistance & Academic Support program provides access to academic specialists who help employees find programs and courses that align with their goals. We offer up to $7,500 in tuition assistance when teammates return to school or pursue eligible job-related courses, degrees or professional certifications, as well as a network of schools that offer discounted tuition and/or waived fees. In 2023, we provided nearly 6,000 employees with more than $19.5 million in support through these programs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$7.5K offered in tuition assistance\n\nto return to school or pursue eligible job-related courses and certifications\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 401(k) AND FINANCIAL COUNSELING\n\nTo help with long-term retirement savings and planning, we automatically enroll U.S. teammates into the 401(k) plan as soon as they're eligible.

In October 2023, we increased our minimum hourly pay to $23, making progress toward increasing our minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $25 by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on our 2023 performance, we once again provided our teammates Sharing Success compensation awards announced in 2024. This is the seventh time this award has been given since 2017, growing to a more than $4.8 billion investment in our teammates. Approximately 97% of our employees have received or will receive an award this year. Most awards are in the form of Bank of America common stock that vests over four years, providing the opportunity to further share in our company's long-term success. These awards are in addition to our standard annual compensation and bonus awards.\n\nWe continue our rigorous processes and analyses with external experts to examine individual employee pay\n\nbefore year-end compensation decisions are finalized, and adjust where appropriate. This approach has helped us maintain robust policies and practices that help reinforce equal pay for equal work, including reviews with oversight from our Board of Directors and senior leaders.\n\nIn 2023, results of this equal pay for equal work review showed that compensation received by women was on average more than 99% of that received by men, and that compensation received by people of color in the U.S. was on average more than 99% of that received by non-people of color employees. We strive to pay our employees fairly based on market rates for their roles, experience and individual performance, and we regularly benchmark against other companies both within and outside our industry to help confirm our pay is competitive.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This spans programs from entry-level hiring through more senior-level recruiting.\n\nStudents join us from more than 400 universities for entry-level opportunities through our highly competitive campus program. As part of our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce, we hired from more than 30 Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In addition, we've developed partnerships with 34 community colleges to collaborate on a career readiness curriculum for careers in financial services and connect to diverse talent.\n\nIn addition, we work with more than 90 external partners, including nonprofit organizations, to help identify talent and expand our impact-including Road to Hire, UnidosUS, Urban Alliance, Year Up, the National Black MBA Association, Association of Latino Professionals for America, National Association of Asian American Professionals, Ascend, Vietnam Finance Society, The National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development and The Asian American Foundation, Junior Achievement, Hiring Our Heroes, Disability:IN, Native American Finance Officers Association and Out & Equal.\n\nIn 2023, we believe we continued to drive progress in the strength and diversity of our employees with our efforts on:\n\n## ENTRY-LEVEL PROGRAMS\n\nOf more than 1,900 full-time campus hires in 2023, 44% were women and 62% were people of color.\n\n## EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nWe provided more than $68 million to workforce development organizations that are providing critical skills-training, work experience and support to help individuals from low- and moderate-income communities obtain and succeed in family-sustaining jobs.\n\n## MILITARY HIRING\n\nBank of America hired more than 1,600 military and veterans, which was more than 12% of our U.S. external hires for the year.\n\n## PATHWAYS\n\nWe surpassed our aspirational goal of hiring 20,000 individuals from low- and moderate-income communities two years early.\n\n## LGBTQ+ TALENT\n\nWe recruited and developed talent through targeted partnerships with organizations such as Lesbians Who Tech, Trans Can Work and Reaching Out.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our onboarding experience connects teammates to our core values and purpose, to education that helps them hit the ground running in a new role and to upskilling programs that help them take their career to the next level. It's how we focus on being a company that people are proud to work for, where they feel cared for and are given the opportunity to achieve their personal and professional goals.\n\nIn 2023, The Academy launched an expanded global orientation for new teammates to provide a foundation for how we drive Responsible Growth and to deliver a consistent experience focused on our company and culture, with more than 2,600 interns and 1,900 full-time campus hires completing the orientation. For teammates who are new to their role, we provide learning programs that offer support through cohort-based high-touch experiences and skill-building opportunities.\n\nSince 2021, The Academy has expanded the number of structured education programs offered, and in 2023, expanded offerings to our teammates across the globe. Our structured education programs are designed to help teammates be job-ready and have advanced skill development opportunities to drive increased proficiency and career progression. The Academy also expanded on-demand offerings, providing more self-paced sessions that help teammates advance their abilities with client engagement, problem solving, data management and many more.\n\nWe continue to drive innovative learning through our focus on immersive technology. We were the first financial institution to offer a comprehensive set of tools leveraging technology like virtual reality, artificial intelligence and practice simulations within our financial centers, and have expanded this to contact centers across the U.S. We've received consistent teammate feedback that the practice repetitions help them deliver better service to our clients and customers.\n\n## Investing in our leaders and managers\n\nOur investment in employee development is further enhanced by our supportive leaders and managers, and we offer a range of development programs to help cultivate their skills. Through assessments, professional coaching and a consistent manager curriculum, we're continually building on the skills of our managers to equip them for success and help them progress in their careers, strengthening our pipeline of leaders.\n\nOur manager development series-built around eight expectations of managers at Bank of America-was launched in 2021 in response to employee feedback and designed to build manager capabilities to lead their teams more effectively to drive Responsible Growth. The curriculum focuses on what it means\n\n## Broad engagement in our programs in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto be a successful manager at the company, from championing diversity and inclusion to being a financial steward to effectively managing risk. It culminates in a capstone experience that helps enable managers to integrate the eight manager expectations and build an action plan to further their learning.\n\nTraining and coaching continue beyond the manager curriculum through our Manager Excellence program. Consultants provide virtual or in-person sessions to help managers build their skills and connect everyday decisions to enterprise priorities, and managers can connect to peers for advice and dialogue through an internal online social community.",

In 2023, we continued to narrow the gaps at all leadership levels, with improvements in representation of Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic-Latino teammates in all key categories, such as management levels 1-3, managers, executive/senior level and midlevel. And we invest in talent acquisition programs and community partnerships to help create a strong and diverse talent pipeline that mirrors the clients and communities we serve.\n\n## Helping to combat hate\n\nOur longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion importantly includes our broad-based work to help fight hate and discrimination directed toward any group, including but not limited to antisemitism, homophobia, Islamophobia, racism, sexism, xenophobia or discrimination based on one's race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability or veteran status.\n\nOur company partners and collaborates with many leading organizations around the world to address societal and humanitarian needs. For example, in 2023, we made a multi-year $20 million commitment to support the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism (FCAS) as it focuses on raising awareness and combating hate through their national Blue Square campaign. Our teammates ordered more than 54,000 Blue Square pins to wear and share their commitment to combating hate.

With the tight labor market and challenging global external environment, we experienced historically low turnover throughout the year, resulting in an 8% annualized turnover rate-the lowest on record other than the pandemic year of 2020.\n\nWith our variety of resources and programs that support career growth and development, we're helping teammates have long-term careers with our company.

Our Net Zero goal  includes operations, supply chain and financing activities (i.e., Scope 1,  Scope 2 and material Scope 3). As a next step toward our Net Zero  goal, we added two sectors and published 2030 science-aligned  targets for reducing emissions associated with financing activities for  now five key sectors: Auto Manufacturing, Energy, Power Generation,  Aviation and Cement. The majority of these targets were set using the  International Energy Agency's Net Zero 2050 1.5\u00b0 aligned scenario.

The results of our  equal pay for equal work review are disclosed in the Proxy Statement.  Our analysis focuses on total compensation, is global for women, and  covers the U.S. for people of color.  SASB answers: Variable incentive remuneration awards (both annual  and deferred) are subject to distinct features that can result in the  awards being canceled or prior payments being clawed back in the  event of certain detrimental conduct or financial losses. We believe  these features encourage appropriate behavior and manage risk in  our compensation program.

The Sustainability Information included in this report may consider disclosure recommendations and broader definitions of materiality used by certain voluntary external frameworks and reporting guidelines that differ from mandatory regulatory reporting, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, any such Sustainability Information may be presented from a different perspective and in more detail than in Bank of America Corporation's regulatory reporting, and materiality and any use of the term 'material' in the context of the Sustainability Information may be distinct from such term as defined for SEC reporting purposes. Any inclusion of Sustainability Information in this report is not an indication that the subject or information is material to Bank of America Corporation for SEC reporting purposes.\n\nAdditionally, Sustainability Information may be based on current or historic aspirations, goals, targets, commitments, estimates, assumptions, standards, metrics, methodologies and internal control frameworks, and currently available data, which continue to evolve and develop, and any statements made in connection with Bank of America Corporation's aspirations, goals, targets or commitments are not guarantees or promises that they will be met. The Sustainability Information is as of the date referenced, subject to change without notice and may be regarded as indicative and for illustrative purposes only. The Sustainability Information may vary based on applicable laws, rules and regulations and in different geographic areas. Such Sustainability Information may also include the use of financial and non-financial metrics and/or other information that vary in source, quality, timeliness and completeness and are subject to significant measurement uncertainties, which may include the methodology, collection and verification of data, various estimates and assumptions and/or underlying data that is obtained from third parties, o/ften which we cannot independently verify.\n\nCertain statements contained in this report may constitute 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about our future financial performance and business and sustainability-related statements regarding our aspirations, goals, targets and commitments, such as our commitment to\n\nachieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050 in our financing activities, operations and supply chain, interim 2030 net zero greenhouse gas emissions targets, including financed emissions targets, and sustainable finance commitments, which may evolve over time. We use words such as 'anticipates,' 'targets,' 'expects,' 'hopes,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'goals,' 'believes,' 'continue' and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as 'will,' 'may,' 'might,' 'should,' 'would' and 'could' to identify forward-looking statements. Forwardlooking statements are not based on historical facts, but reflect management's current expectations, plans or forecasts, are not guarantees of future results or performance, involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and o/ften beyond our control and are inherently uncertain. You should not place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statement. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy prices, technological innovations and advances, climate-related conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes, public policies, engagement with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders, the quality and availability of third-party data, including data measured, tracked and provided by data providers, our clients and other stakeholders, our ability to gather and verify data, our ability to successfully implement sustainability-related initiatives under expected time frames, third-party compliance with our expectations, policies and procedures and other unforeseen events or conditions. Discussion of additional factors, including uncertainties and risks, can be found in Bank of America Corporation's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Bank of America Corporation undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise a/fter the date the forwardlooking statement was made.\n\nWebsite references and/or links throughout this report are provided for convenience only and the content of such websites is not incorporated by reference into this report.",

These statements can be  identified  by  the  fact  that  they  do  not  relate  strictly  to historical  or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words  such  as  'anticipates,'  'targets,'  'expects,'  'hopes,' 'estimates,' 'intends,' 'plans,' 'goals,' 'believes,' 'continue' and other similar expressions or future  or conditional  verbs  such  as 'will,'  'may,'  'might,'  'should,'  'would'  and  'could.'  Forwardlooking statements represent the Corporation's current expectations,  plans  or forecasts  of its  future  results,  revenues, liquidity, net interest income,  provision  for credit losses, expenses,  efficiency  ratio,  capital  measures,  strategy,  deposits, assets,  and  future  business  and  economic  conditions  more generally,  and  other future  matters.  These  statements  are  not guarantees of future  results  or performance and involve certain known  and  unknown  risks,  uncertainties  and  assumptions  that are  difficult  to  predict  and  are  often  beyond  the  Corporation's control.  Actual  outcomes  and  results  may  differ materially  from those  expressed  in,  or implied  by,  any  of these  forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement  and  should  consider the  following  uncertainties  and risks, as well as the risks and uncertainties more fully discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K: and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation's potential judgments, orders, settlements, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory investigations, proceedings and enforcement actions, including as a  result  of our participation  in  and  execution  of government programs  related  to  the  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  (COVID-19) pandemic, such as the processing of unemployment benefits for California  and  certain  other states;  the  possibility  that  the Corporation's  future  liabilities  may  be  in  excess  of its  recorded liability  and  estimated  range  of possible  loss  for litigation,  and regulatory  and  government  actions;  the  possibility  that  the Corporation could face increased claims from one or more parties involved  in  mortgage  securitizations;  the  Corporation's  ability  to resolve  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  and  related claims; the risks related to the discontinuation of reference rates, including increased expenses and litigation and the effectiveness of hedging  strategies;  uncertainties  about  the  financial  stability and  growth  rates  of non-U.S.  jurisdictions,  the  risk  that  those jurisdictions  may  face  difficulties  servicing  their sovereign  debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and  the  Corporation's  exposures  to  such  risks,  including  direct, indirect  and  operational;  the  impact  of U.S.  and  global  interest rates,  inflation,  currency  exchange  rates,  economic  conditions, trade  policies  and  tensions,  including  tariffs,  and  potential geopolitical instability; the impact of the interest rate, inflationary, macroeconomic, banking and regulatory environment on  the  Corporation's  assets,  business,  financial  condition  and results  of operations;  the  impact  of adverse  developments affecting  the  U.S.  or global  banking  industry,  including  bank failures  and  liquidity  concerns,  resulting  in  worsening  economic and  market  volatility,  and  regulatory  responses  thereto;  the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected  due  to  changes  in  economic  assumptions,  customer behavior,  adverse  developments  with  respect  to  U.S.  or global economic  conditions  and  other uncertainties,  including  the impact  of supply  chain  disruptions,  inflationary  pressures  and\n\nlabor shortages  on  economic  conditions  and  our business; potential  losses  related  to  the  Corporation's  concentration  of credit risk; the Corporation's ability to achieve its expense targets and  expectations  regarding  revenue,  net  interest  income, provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, effective tax rate, loan growth or other projections; adverse changes to the Corporation's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; an inability to access capital markets or maintain deposits or borrowing costs; estimates of the fair value and other accounting values, subject to impairment assessments, of certain of the Corporation's assets and  liabilities;  the  estimated  or actual  impact  of changes  in accounting standards or assumptions in applying those standards; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory  capital  and  liquidity  requirements;  the  impact  of adverse  changes  to  total  loss-absorbing  capacity  requirements, stress  capital  buffer requirements  and/or global  systemically important bank surcharges; the potential impact of actions of the Board  of Governors  of the  Federal  Reserve  System  on  the Corporation's  capital  plans;  the  effect  of changes  in  or interpretations of income tax laws and regulations; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations  and  regulatory  interpretations,  including,  but  not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation  assessments,  the  Volcker Rule, fiduciary standards, derivatives regulations and potential changes to  loss  allocations  between financial institutions and customers, including  for losses  incurred  from  the  use  of our products  and services,  including  electronic  payments  and  payment  of checks, that were authorized by the customer but induced by fraud; the impact  of failures or disruptions  in  or breaches  of the Corporation's operations or information systems or those of third parties, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents; the risks related to the development, implementation, use and management  of emerging  technologies, including artificial intelligence  and  machine  learning;  the  risks  related  to  the transition  and  physical  impacts  of climate change; our ability  to achieve environmental, social and  governance  goals  and commitments or the impact of any changes in the Corporation's sustainability  strategy  or commitments  generally;  the  impact  of any  future  federal  government  shutdown  and  uncertainty regarding the federal government's debt limit or changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy; the emergence or continuation of widespread  health  emergencies  or pandemics;  the  impact  of natural  disasters,  extreme  weather events,  military  conflicts (including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the conflict in the Middle East,  the  possible  expansion  of such  conflicts  and  potential geopolitical consequences), terrorism or other geopolitical events; and other matters.\n\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made,  and  the  Corporation  undertakes  no  obligation  to  update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances  or events  that  arise  after the  date  the  forwardlooking statement was made.\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in  the  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A.

        "page_content": "## Net Interest Income\n\nNet interest income  increased  $4.5  billion to  $56.9  billion in 2023 compared to 2022. Net interest yield  on  a  fully taxableequivalent (FTE) basis increased 12 basis points (bps) to 2.08 percent for 2023. The  increases  were  primarily driven  by benefits  from higher interest rates  and  loan  growth, partially offset by higher funding costs, lower deposits and net interest income related to Global Markets activity. For more information on net interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 83, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see  Interest Rate  Risk  Management for the Banking Book on page 131.\n\n## Noninterest Income\n\n## Table 2 Noninterest Income\n\nTable 4 Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                | 2023     | 2022      |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Fees and commissions:                |          |           |\n| Card income                          | $ 6,054  | $  6,083  |\n| Service charges                      | 5,684    | 6,405     |\n| Investment and brokerage services    | 15,563   | 15,901    |\n| Investment banking fees              | 4,708    | 4,823     |\n| Total fees and commissions           | 32,009   | 33,212    |\n| Market making and similar activities | 12,732   | 12,075    |\n| Other income                         | (3,091)  | (2,799)   |\n| Total noninterest income             | $ 41,650 | $  42,488 |\n\nNoninterest income decreased $838 million to $41.7 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The following highlights the significant changes.\n\n- \u25cf Service charges decreased $721 million primarily driven by the  impact of non-sufficient funds  and  overdraft policy changes, as well as lower treasury service charges.\n- \u25cf Investment and brokerage services decreased $338 million primarily due  to  lower transactional  revenue  and  asset management fees  driven  by declines  in  assets  under management (AUM) pricing, as well as lower average market valuations, partially offset by the  impact of positive  AUM flows.\n- \u25cf Investment banking  fees  decreased  $115  million  primarily due to lower advisory and debt issuance fees, partially offset by higher equity issuance fees.\n- \u25cf Market making and similar activities increased $657 million primarily driven by improved trading in mortgage products in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in Equities, partially offset by the  net $1.6  billion  impact of BSBY's future cessation.\n- \u25cf Other income decreased $292 million primarily due to higher partnership  losses  on  tax-advantaged investments  and losses  on  sales  of available-for-sale  (AFS) debt securities, partially offset by certain  negative  valuation  adjustments  in the prior year.\n\n## Provision for Credit Losses\n\nThe  provision  for credit losses  increased  $1.9  billion to  $4.4 billion  in  2023  compared  to  2022. The  provision  for credit losses for 2023 was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. For the same period in the prior year, the  provision  for credit losses  was  primarily driven  by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a  reduction  in  COVID-19  pandemic uncertainties. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 125.\n\n## Noninterest Expense\n\n## Table 3 Noninterest Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                     | 2023     | 2022      |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Compensation and benefits                 | $ 38,330 | $  36,447 |\n| Occupancy and equipment                   | 7,164    | 7,071     |\n| Information processing and communications | 6,707    | 6,279     |\n| Product delivery and transaction related  | 3,608    | 3,653     |\n| Marketing                                 | 1,927    | 1,825     |\n| Professional fees                         | 2,159    | 2,142     |\n| Other general operating                   | 5,950    | 4,021     |\n| Total noninterest expense                 | $ 65,845 | $  61,438 |\n\nNoninterest expense increased $4.4 billion to  $65.8  billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to higher investments in people and technology and higher FDIC expense, including $2.1 billion  for the  estimated  special  assessment amount arising from the  closure  of Silicon  Valley Bank  and  Signature  Bank, partially offset by lower litigation  expense  and  revenue-related compensation.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)      | 2023     | 2022      |\n|----------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Income before income taxes | $ 28,342 | $  30,969 |\n| Income tax expense         | 1,827    | 3,441     |\n| Effective tax rate         | 6.4 %    | 11.1 %    |\n\nIncome  tax expense  was  $1.8  billion  for 2023  compared  to $3.4  billion  in  2022, resulting  in  an  effective  tax rate  of 6.4 percent compared to 11.1 percent.\n\nThe  effective  tax rates  for 2023  and  2022  were  primarily driven  by our recurring  tax preference benefits, which primarily consisted of tax credits from investments in affordable housing and renewable energy. Also included in the effective tax rate for 2023  were  tax impacts  from charges  recorded  in  the  fourth quarter of 2023 related to the FDIC special assessment and the impact of BSBY's  future  cessation. For more  information  on these charges, see Executive Summary - Recent Developments on  page  80. For more  information  on  our recurring  tax preference  benefits, see Note  19  -  Income  Taxes to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Absent the  tax credits related to tax-advantaged investments and discrete tax benefits, the  effective  tax rates  would  have  been  approximately 25 percent for both periods.",

The increase in  assets  was  primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  increased  $102.9  billion  primarily driven  by increased  funding  to  support balance  sheet and liquidity positioning.\n\n## Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell\n\nFederal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a  short-term basis. Securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to  resell  are  collateralized  lending  transactions utilized  to  accommodate  customer transactions, earn  interest rate  spreads  and  obtain  securities  for settlement and  for collateral. Federal  funds  sold  and  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements to  resell  increased  $13.1  billion primarily due  to  the  investment of excess  cash  from higher federal  funds  purchased  and  securities  loaned  or sold  under agreements to repurchase, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, as well as client activity within Global Markets .\n\n## Trading Account Assets\n\nTrading  account assets  consist primarily of long  positions  in equity and  fixed-income  securities  including  U.S. government and  agency securities, corporate  securities  and  non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets decreased $18.8 billion primarily due to a decline in inventory within Global Markets .\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nDebt securities  primarily include  U.S. Treasury and  agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We reinvest cash in the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate  and  liquidity risk. Debt securities  increased  $8.6 billion  primarily due to  investment of excess cash from higher federal  funds  purchased  and  securities  loaned  or sold  under agreements to repurchase, short-term borrowings and long-term\n\ndebt. For more  information  on  debt securities, see Note  4  Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans  and  leases  increased  $8.0  billion  primarily driven  by higher credit card spending and growth in commercial loans. For more  information  on  the  loan  portfolio, see  Credit Risk Management on page 111.\n\n## Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses increased $660 million driven by the Corporation's consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card  loan  growth  and  asset quality, partially offset by a reserve  release  in  the  Corporation's  commercial  portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions applicable  to  the  commercial  portfolio. For more  information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 125.\n\n## All Other Assets\n\nAll  other assets  increased  $15.7  billion  primarily driven  by Global Markets activity.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nAt December 31, 2023, total liabilities were approximately $2.9 trillion, up  $110.3  billion  from December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and long-term debt.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits decreased $6.5 billion primarily due to an increase in customer spending  and  customers' movement of balances  to higher yielding investment alternatives.\n\n## Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\n\nFederal  funds  transactions  involve  borrowing  reserve  balances on  a  short-term basis. Securities  loaned  or sold  under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions  utilized  to  accommodate  customer transactions, earn  interest rate  spreads  and  finance  assets  on  the  balance sheet. Federal  funds  purchased  and  securities  loaned  or sold",

        "page_content": "under agreements  to  repurchase  increased  $88.3  billion primarily driven  by an  increase  in  repurchase  agreements  to support liquidity.\n\n## Trading Account Liabilities\n\nTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and  fixed-income  securities  including  U.S. Treasury and agency securities, non-U.S. sovereign  debt and  corporate securities. Trading  account liabilities  increased  $15.1  billion primarily due  to  higher levels  of short positions  within Global Markets .\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes  payable  and  various  other borrowings  that generally have  maturities  of one  year or less. Short-term borrowings increased $5.2 billion primarily due to an increase in FHLB  advances  and  commercial  paper to  manage  liquidity needs. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings, Collateral  and  Restricted  Cash to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt increased  $26.2  billion primarily due  to  debt issuances  and  valuation  adjustments, partially offset by debt maturities and redemptions. For more information on long-term debt, see Note  11  -  Long-term  Debt to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## All Other Liabilities\n\nAll  other liabilities  decreased  $17.9  billion  primarily driven  by Global Markets activity.\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders' equity increased $18.4 billion primarily due to net income  and  market value  increases  on  derivatives, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases.\n\n## Cash Flows Overview\n\nThe  Corporation's  operating  assets  and  liabilities  support our global  markets  and  lending  activities. We  believe  that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund  our operating  liquidity needs. Our investing  activities primarily include  the  debt securities  portfolio  and  loans  and leases. Our financing  activities  reflect cash  flows  primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, long-term debt and  common  and  preferred  stock. For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 106.\n\n## Supplemental Financial Data\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn  this  Form 10-K, we  present certain  non-GAAP  financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise  include  components  that differ from the  most directly comparable  measures  calculated  in  accordance  with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance  with  prospective  regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP  financial  measures  and  may not be  defined  or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used\n\nby other companies.\n\nWhen  presented  on  a  consolidated  basis, net interest income  on  an  FTE  basis  is  a  non-GAAP  financial  measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income  on  an  equivalent before-tax basis  with  a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this  calculation, we  use  the  federal  statutory tax rate  of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which  measures  the  basis  points  we  earn  over the  cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation  of these  items  on  an  FTE  basis  allows  for comparison  of amounts  from both  taxable  and  tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.\n\nWe  may present certain  key performance  indicators  and ratios  excluding  certain  items  (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains  (losses)), which  result in non-GAAP  financial measures. We believe  that the  presentation  of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional  information  to  assess  the  underlying  operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize  tangible  equity, a  non-GAAP  financial  measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding  mortgage  servicing  rights  (MSRs)), net of related deferred  tax liabilities ('adjusted' shareholders' equity or common  shareholders' equity). These  measures  are  used  to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and  investment models  use  both  return  on  average  tangible common  shareholders' equity and  return  on  average  tangible shareholders' equity as  key measures  to  support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:\n\n- \u25cf Return  on  average  tangible  common  shareholders' equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The  tangible  common  equity ratio represents  adjusted  ending  common  shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.\n- \u25cf Return  on  average  tangible  shareholders' equity measures our net income  as  a  percentage  of adjusted  average  total shareholders' equity. The  tangible  equity ratio  represents adjusted  ending  shareholders' equity divided  by total tangible assets.\n- \u25cf Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending  common  shareholders' equity divided  by ending common shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful  information  because  they present measures  of those assets  that can  generate  income. Tangible  book  value  per common share provides additional useful information about the level  of tangible  assets  in  relation  to  outstanding  shares  of common stock.\n\nThe  aforementioned  supplemental  data  and  performance measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures  to  the  corresponding  GAAP  financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 139.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain  key financial  and  nonfinancial  performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We believe  they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide additional information about our underlying operational",

We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE basis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  periodically review  capital  allocated  to  our businesses and  allocate  capital  annually during  the  strategic and  capital planning  processes. We  utilize  a  methodology that considers the  effect of regulatory capital  requirements  in  addition  to internal  risk-based  capital  models. Our internal  risk-based capital  models  use  a  risk-adjusted  methodology incorporating each  segment's  credit, market, interest rate, business  and operational  risk  components. For more  information  on  the nature  of these  risks, see  Managing  Risk  on  page  98. The capital  allocated  to  the  business  segments  is  referred  to  as allocated  capital. Allocated  equity in  the  reporting  units  is comprised  of allocated  capital  plus  capital  for the  portion  of goodwill  and  intangibles  specifically assigned  to  the  reporting unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see Note  7  -  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor more  information  on  our presentation  of financial information on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on  page  83, and  for reconciliations  to  consolidated  total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see Note 23 Business  Segment  Information to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain  key financial  and  nonfinancial  performance indicators  that management uses  when  evaluating  segment results. We believe  they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide additional information about our segments' operational performance, customer trends and business growth.",

Lending, offers  a  diversified  range  of credit, banking  and investment products  and  services  to  consumers  and  small businesses. Deposits  and  Consumer Lending  include  the  net impact of migrating  customers  and  their related  deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between  Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM , as well as other client-managed businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coastto-coast network including financial centers in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As  of December 31, 2023, our network includes  approximately 3,800  financial  centers, approximately 15,000  ATMs, nationwide  call  centers  and  leading  digital banking  platforms  with  more  than  46  million  active  users, including approximately 38 million active mobile users.\n\n## Consumer Banking Results\n\nNet income  for Consumer Banking decreased $923  million to $11.6 billion due to an increase in provision for credit losses and  higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue. Net interest income  increased $3.6  billion to  $33.7 billion primarily driven  by higher interest rates  and  loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $248 million to  $8.3 billion primarily driven by the  impact of non-sufficient funds  and  overdraft policy changes.\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $3.2 billion to $5.2 billion primarily driven  by credit card  loan  growth  and  asset quality. Noninterest expense  increased $1.3  billion to  $21.4\n\nbillion primarily driven by continued  investments  in  the business, including  people  and  technology, higher litigation expense, including  consumer regulatory matters, and  higher FDIC expense.\n\nThe  return  on  average  allocated  capital  was  28  percent, down from 31 percent, due to an increase in allocated capital and lower net income. For more information on capital allocated to  the  business  segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 88.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits  includes  the  results  of consumer deposit activities that consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include noninterest-  and  interest-bearing  checking  accounts, money market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate  sensitivity and  maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees and ATM fees, as well as  investment and  brokerage  fees  from Consumer Investment accounts. Consumer Investments serves investment client relationships through the Merrill Edge integrated investing and banking service platform, providing  investment advice  and guidance, client brokerage  asset services, self-directed  online investing  and  key banking  capabilities  including  access  to  the Corporation's network of financial centers and ATMs.",

Noninterest income decreased $264  million  to  $2.9  billion primarily driven  by the  impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $965 million to $13.4 billion primarily due  to  continued  investments  in  the  business, including  people  and  technology, higher litigation  expense, including consumer regulatory matters, and  higher FDIC expense.\n\nAverage deposits decreased $69.1 billion to $987.7 billion primarily due to net outflows of $51.8 billion in money market savings and $28.6 billion in checking, partially offset by growth in time deposits of $19.9 billion.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  key performance  indicators  for Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide  additional information  to  evaluate  our deposit profitability and  digital/ mobile trends.\n\n## Key Statistics - Deposits\n\n| Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs)   | 2023 2.70%   | 2022 1.86 %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Year end                                             |              |               |\n| Consumer investment assets (in millions) (2)         | $424,410     | $ 319,648     |\n| Active digital banking users (in thousands) (3)      | 46,265       | 44,054        |\n| Active mobile banking users (in thousands) (4)       | 37,927       | 35,452        |\n| Financial centers                                    | 3,845        | 3,913         |\n| ATMs                                                 | 15,168       | 15,528        |\n\nConsumer investment assets  increased $104.8  billion to $424.4 billion driven  by market performance  and  client flows. Active mobile banking users increased approximately two million, reflecting continuing changes in our clients' banking preferences. We had a net decrease of 68 financial centers and 360 ATMs  as  we  continue  to  optimize  our consumer banking network.\n\n## Consumer Lending\n\nConsumer Lending  offers  products  to  consumers  and  small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include debit and credit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread  revenue  on  its  lending  activities, Consumer Lending  generates  interchange  revenue  from debit and  credit card transactions, late  fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous  fees. Consumer Lending  products  are  available to  our customers  through  our retail  network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans, including  loans  held  on  the  balance  sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.\n\nNet income for Consumer Lending decreased $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses. Net interest income  increased  $353  million to  $11.1 billion primarily due to higher loan balances. Noninterest income increased $16 million to $5.5 billion, relatively unchanged from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe provision for credit losses increased $3.3 billion to $4.7 billion primarily driven  by credit card  loan  growth  and  asset quality. Noninterest expense  increased  $374  million to  $8.1 billion primarily driven by continued  investments  in  the business, including people and technology.\n\nAverage  loans  increased  $16.4  billion  to  $304.6  billion primarily driven by an increase in credit card loans.\n\nThe  table  below  provides  key performance  indicators  for Consumer Lending. Management uses  these  metrics, and  we believe  they are  useful  to  investors  because  they provide additional information about loan growth and profitability.\n\n## Key Statistics - Consumer Lending\n\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2023     | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Total credit card  (1)      |          |           |\n| Gross interest yield  (2)   | 11.88 %  | 10.42 %   |\n| Risk-adjusted margin  (3)   | 7.83     | 10.06     |\n| New accounts (in thousands) | 4,275    | 4,397     |\n| Purchase volumes            | $363,117 | $ 356,588 |\n| Debit card purchase volumes | $527,074 | $ 503,583 |\n\nDuring 2023, the total risk-adjusted margin decreased 223 bps  primarily driven  by higher net credit losses, lower net fee income  and  lower interest margin.

Merrill Wealth Management provides tailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products.\n\nBank of America  Private  Bank, together with  Merrill  Wealth Management's Private Wealth Management business, provides comprehensive  wealth  management solutions  targeted  to  high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions  to  meet clients' wealth  structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.\n\nNet income for GWIM decreased $728 million to $3.9 billion primarily due to lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. The operating margin was 25 percent compared to 28 percent a year ago.\n\nNet interest income decreased $319 million to $7.1 billion primarily driven  by lower average  deposit balances  and  a portfolio mix shift to higher yielding deposit products.\n\nNoninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage  services  income, decreased  $324  million to  $14.0 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by lower transactional revenue and asset management fees driven by declines in AUM\n\npricing  as  well  as  lower average  market valuations, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $346 million to $15.8 billion primarily due  to  continued  investments  in  the  business, including strategic hiring and technology, as well as higher FDIC expense, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.\n\nThe  return  on  average  allocated  capital  was  21  percent, down from 27 percent, due to lower net income and, to a lesser extent, a small increase in allocated capital.\n\nAverage  loans  totaled  $219.5  billion, relatively unchanged from the same period a year ago. Average deposits decreased $53.0 billion to $298.3 billion primarily driven by clients moving deposits  to  higher yielding investment cash  alternatives, including offerings on our investment and brokerage platforms.\n\nMerrill Wealth  Management revenue  of $17.5  billion decreased  four percent primarily driven  by lower net interest income, lower transactional  revenue  and  asset management fees driven by declines in AUM pricing as well as lower average market valuations, partially offset by the impact of positive AUM flows.\n\nBank  of America  Private  Bank  revenue  of $3.6  billion increased  one  percent primarily driven  by higher net interest income as well as higher asset management fees driven by the impact of positive AUM flows.",

Fees earned on AUM are calculated as a percentage of clients' AUM balances. The asset management fees charged to clients per year depend on various factors but are commonly driven by the breadth of the client's relationship. The net client AUM flows represent the  net change  in  clients' AUM balances  over a\n\nspecified  period  of time, excluding  market appreciation/ depreciation and other adjustments.\n\nClient balances increased $402.5 billion, or 12 percent, to $3.8 trillion at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. The increase in client balances was primarily due to the impact of higher end-of-period  market valuations  and  positive net client flows.",

Global  Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both  the  primary and  secondary markets. Global  Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and  custody services  globally to  our institutional investor clients  in  support of their investing  and  trading activities. We  also  work  with  our commercial  and  corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and  commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income  and  mortgage-related  products. As  a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be  required  to  manage  risk  in  a  broad  range  of financial products  including  government securities, equity and  equitylinked  securities, high-grade  and  high-yield  corporate  debt securities, syndicated  loans, MBS, commodities  and  assetbacked securities. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global  Banking under an  internal  revenue-sharing arrangement. Global  Banking originates  certain  deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 94.\n\nThe following explanations for year-over-year changes in results for Global  Markets , including  those  disclosed  under Sales and Trading  Revenue, are  the  same  for amounts  including  and excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP financial  measure. For more  information  on  net DVA, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 83 .\n\nNet income  for Global  Markets increased  $496  million to $4.7 billion in  2023 compared to 2022. Net DVA losses were $236  million  compared  to  gains  of $20  million  in  2022. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $690 million to $4.9 billion. These increases were primarily driven by an increase in revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.\n\nRevenue increased $1.4 billion to $19.5 billion primarily due to  higher sales  and  trading  revenue  in  the  current-year period and  negative  valuation  adjustments  on  leveraged  loans  in  the prior-year period. Sales  and  trading  revenue  increased  $887 million, and  excluding  net DVA, increased  $1.1  billion. These increases  were  primarily driven  by higher revenue  in  FICC. Noninterest expense  increased  $786  million to  $13.2  billion, primarily driven  by continued  investments  in  the  business, including  people  and  technology, partially offset by expenses recognized for certain regulatory matters in the prior-year period.\n\nAverage  total  assets  increased  $12.1  billion  to  $869.8 billion, driven  by higher levels  of inventory, increased  secured",

Year-end  total  assets increased  $5.1  billion  to  $817.6  billion  driven  by the  same factors as average assets.\n\nThe  return  on  average  allocated  capital  was  10  percent, unchanged from the same period a year ago. For information on capital  allocated  to  the  business  segments, see  Business Segment Operations on page 88.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nSales  and  trading  revenue  includes  unrealized  and  realized gains  and  losses  on  trading  and  other assets  which  are included  in  market making  and  similar activities, net interest income, and  fees  primarily from commissions  on  equity securities. Sales  and  trading  revenue  is  segregated  into  fixedincome  (government debt obligations, investment and  noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed  securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate  and  credit derivative  contracts), currencies  (interest rate  and  foreign  exchange  contracts), commodities  (primarily futures, forwards, swaps  and  options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The  following  table  and  related  discussion  present sales  and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets , with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table  and  related  discussion  also  present sales  and  trading revenue, excluding  net DVA, which  is  a  non-GAAP  financial measure.

For more  information  on  our ALM activities, see Note  23  -  Business  Segment  Information to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe net loss in All Other increased $2.3 billion to $4.0 billion primarily due to lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by a higher income tax benefit.\n\nNoninterest income decreased $3.2 billion primarily due to a net charge incurred as a result of the impact of BSBY's future cessation, higher partnership losses for tax-advantaged investments  and  losses  on  sales  of AFS  debt securities. The announcement of BSBY's  future  cessation  resulted  in  a  $1.6 billion  net charge  due  to  the  Corporation's  determination  that certain  forecasted  BSBY-indexed  interest payments, which had been designated in cash flow hedges, were no longer expected to occur beyond November 15, 2024 as they will transition to a new  reference  rate. Accordingly, during  the  fourth  quarter of 2023, the Corporation  reclassified the fair value of the interest\n\nrate  swaps  used  in  the  cash  flow  hedges  related  to  these forecasted transactions from accumulated other comprehensive income  (OCI) into  noninterest income. The  Corporation  also recognized  subsequent fair value  changes  of the  interest rate swaps into noninterest income until they were re-designated into new cash flow hedges.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.6 billion primarily due to an accrual of $2.1 billion for the estimated amount of the FDIC special assessment resulting from the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as well as higher costs related to a liquidating  business  activity in  the  current year, partially offset by higher litigation expense in the prior year.\n\nThe income tax benefit was $8.4 billion in 2023 compared to a benefit of $6.0 billion in 2022. The income tax benefit in All Other resulted  from both  periods  having  income  tax benefit adjustments to allocate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits to Global  Banking and Global  Markets. The  increase  in  the income  tax benefit in  2023  was  primarily due  to  the  benefit recorded against pretax charges for the FDIC special assessment and impact of BSBY's future cessation, as well as higher income tax credits related to tax-advantaged investment activity.",

        "page_content": "## Managing Risk\n\nRisk  is  inherent in  all  our business  activities. Sound  risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed  well, risk  can  result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to  execute  our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach  to  risk  management with  a  defined  Risk  Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board.\n\nThe  seven  key types  of risk  faced  by the  Corporation  are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational  and reputational.\n\n- \u25cf Strategic risk  is  the  risk  to  current or projected  financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to  changes  in  the  regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive  environments  in  the  geographic locations  in which we operate.\n- \u25cf Credit risk  is  the  risk  of loss  arising  from the  inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.\n- \u25cf Market risk  is  the  risk  that changes  in  market conditions adversely impact the  value  of assets  or liabilities or otherwise  negatively impact earnings. Market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk.\n- \u25cf Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash  flow  and  collateral  needs  while  continuing  to  support our businesses and customers under a  range  of economic conditions.\n- \u25cf Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material  financial  loss  or damage  to  the  reputation  of the Corporation  arising  from the  failure  of the  Corporation  to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures.\n- \u25cf Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed  internal  processes  or systems, people or external events.\n- \u25cf Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.\n\nThe  following  sections  address  in  more  detail  the  specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk.\n\nAs  set forth  in  our Risk  Framework, a  culture  of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities  and  encourages  the  necessary mindset and behavior to  enable  effective  risk  management and  promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success  of the  Corporation  and  is  a  clear expectation  of our executive management team and the Board.\n\nOur Risk  Framework  serves  as  the  foundation  for the consistent and  effective  management of risks  facing  the Corporation. The  Risk  Framework  sets  forth  roles  and responsibilities  for the  management of risk  and  provides  a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees  and  executive  officers, establishes  risk  appetite and associated limits for our activities.\n\nExecutive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted  returns  of each  business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as  the  capital  plan  and  Risk  Appetite  Statement, and recommends  them annually to  the  Board  for approval. Our strategic plan  takes  into  consideration  return  objectives  and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets  financial  objectives  for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital  for each  business. Capital  allocations  are  regularly evaluated  as  part of our overall  governance  processes  as  the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue  to  evolve. For more  information  regarding  capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 88.\n\nThe  Corporation's  risk  appetite  indicates  the  amount of capital, earnings  or liquidity we  are  willing  to  put at risk  to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with  applicable  regulatory requirements. Our risk  appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to  assist senior management and  the  Board  in  assessing  the Corporation's  risk  profile  across  all  risk  types  against our risk appetite  and  risk  capacity. Our risk  appetite  is  formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits.\n\nOur overall  capacity to  take  risk  is  limited; therefore, we prioritize  the  risks  we  take  in  order to  maintain  a  strong  and flexible  financial  position  so  we  can  weather challenging economic times  and  take  advantage  of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we  set objectives  and  targets  for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate  in  a  safe  and  sound  manner at all  times, including during  periods  of stress. We  also  maintain  operational  risk management and operational resiliency capabilities designed to permit us to meet the expectations of our customers and clients through a range of operating conditions.\n\nOur lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the Corporation's risk appetite. Senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits. The  Board, and  its  committees  when  appropriate, oversee financial  performance, execution  of the  strategic and  financial operating  plans, adherence  to  risk  appetite  limits  and  the adequacy of internal controls.\n\nFor a  more  detailed  discussion  of our risk  management activities, see  the  discussion  below  and  pages  101  through 136.\n\n## Risk Management Governance\n\nThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the  Board  and  its  committees  may delegate  authority to management-level  committees  or executive  officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which  may be  evidenced  in  documents  such  as committee  charters, job  descriptions, meeting  minutes  and resolutions.\n\nThe  chart below  illustrates  the  interrelationship  among  the Board, Board  committees  and  management committees  that have  the  majority of risk  oversight responsibilities  for the Corporation.",

The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective  Risk  Framework  and  oversees  compliance  with  safe and  sound  banking  practices. In  addition, the  Board  or its committees  conduct inquiries  of, and  receive  reports  from senior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk Management (GRM) and/or Corporate  Audit to  execute  its responsibilities. The  Board  committees  discussed  below  have the  principal  responsibility for enterprise-wide  oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk  profile  and  oversee  senior management addressing  key risks  we  face. Other Board  committees, as  described  below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.\n\nEach of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports  to  the  Board  on  risk-related  matters  within  the committee's  responsibilities, which  is  intended  to  collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and  independence  of the  Independent Registered  Public Accounting  Firm, the  performance  of our corporate  audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements, and makes  inquiries  of senior management or the  Chief Audit Executive  (CAE) to  determine  whether there  are  scope  or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute  its  responsibilities. The  Audit Committee  is  also responsible  for overseeing  compliance  risks  pursuant to  the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Committee\n\nThe  ERC  oversees  the  Corporation's  Risk  Framework, risk appetite  and  senior management's  responsibilities  for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing  the  Corporation. The ERC may consult with  other Board committees on risk-related matters.\n\n## Other Board Committees\n\nOur Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee oversees  our Board's  governance  processes, identifies  and reviews  the  qualifications  of potential  Board  members, leads Board and committee succession planning and their formal selfevaluation, and  reviews  our ESG  activities, shareholder input and shareholder engagement process.\n\nOur Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees establishing, maintaining  and  administering  our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer's (CEO) compensation to  our Board  for further approval  by all  independent directors; reviewing  and  approving  our executive  officers' compensation, as  well  as  compensation  for non-management directors; and reviewing  certain  other human  capital  management topics, including pay equity.\n\n## Management Committees\n\nManagement committees receive their authority from the Board, a  Board  committee, or another management committee. Our primary management risk  committee  is  the  MRC. Subject to Board  oversight, the  MRC  is  responsible  for management oversight of key risks  facing  the  Corporation, including  an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity.\n\n## Lines of Defense\n\nWe have clear ownership  and  accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines  of defense  are  integrated  into  our management-level governance structure. Each of these functional  roles  is  further described in this section.\n\n## Executive Officers\n\nExecutive  officers  lead  various  functions  representing  the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to  executive  officers  from the  Board, Board  committees  or management-level committees. Executive  officers, in  turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level    committees, management routines    or",

        "page_content": "individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with  our Risk  Framework, risk  appetite, and applicable  strategic, capital  and  financial  operating  plans, as well as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and other employees  make  decisions  individually on  a  day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive  officers  and  other employees  may also  serve  on committees and participate in committee decisions.\n\n## Front Line Units\n\nFLUs, which  include  the  lines  of business  as  well  as  Global Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.\n\nThree  organizational  units  that include  FLU  activities  and control function activities, but are not part of GRM are (1) the Chief Financial Officer Group; (2) the Chief Administrative Officer Group; and (3) Global Strategy and Enterprise Platforms.\n\n## Global Risk Management\n\nGRM is  part of our control  functions  and  operates  as  our independent risk  management function. GRM, led by the Chief Risk  Officer (CRO), is  responsible  for independently assessing and  overseeing  risks  within  FLUs  and  other control  functions. GRM establishes  written  enterprise  policies  and  procedures outlining how  aggregate  risks  are  identified, measured, monitored and controlled.\n\nThe CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed to  develop  and  implement a  meaningful  risk  management framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to  both  the  ERC  and  the  CEO. GRM is  organized  into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.\n\n## Corporate Audit\n\nCorporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate  Audit provides  independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the Corporation's credit platform through examinations and monitoring.\n\n## Risk Management Processes\n\nThe  Risk  Framework  requires  that strong  risk  management practices  are  integrated  in  key strategic, capital  and  financial planning  processes  and  in  day-to-day business  processes across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We employ an  effective  risk  management process, referred  to  as Identify, Measure, Monitor and  Control, as  part of our daily activities.\n\nIdentify - To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified  and  well  understood. Proper risk  identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in  our business  activities  or key risks  that may arise  from external  factors. Each  employee  is  expected  to  identify and escalate  risks  promptly. Risk  identification  is  an  ongoing process  that incorporates  input from FLUs  and  control\n\nfunctions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.\n\nMeasure -  Once  a  risk  is  identified, it must be prioritized  and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements  and  quantitative  limits. Risk  is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and legal  entity, and also  on  an  aggregate  basis. This risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk  profile  due  to  changes  in  strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio  quality and  the  overall  economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.\n\nMonitor - We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk  appetite, policies  and  standards. We  also  regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk limits  are  breached  and  have  processes  to  appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level  committees  or the  Board (directly or through an appropriate committee).\n\nControl - We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through  policies, standards, procedures  and  processes. The limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the Board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits  may be  absolute  (e.g., loan  amount, trading  volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk  categories). Our FLUs  are  held  accountable  for performing within the established limits.\n\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational  roles  and  responsibilities. Establishing  a  culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers' financial lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical to effective risk management. We are committed to the highest principles  of ethical  and  professional  conduct. Conduct risk  is the  risk  of improper actions, behaviors  or practices  by the Corporation, its  employees  or representatives  that are  illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to  the  Corporation, our shareholders  or our customers, damage  the  integrity of the  financial  markets, or negatively impact our reputation. We  have  established  protocols  and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation appropriately. All employees are held accountable  for adhering  to  the  Code  of Conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities. In addition, our performance  management and compensation  practices  encourage  responsible  risk-taking  that is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite.\n\n## Corporation-wide Stress Testing\n\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning  processes, we conduct capital  scenario  management and stress forecasting on a regular basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to a wide range of economic and  business  scenarios, including  economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress  forecasts  provide  an  understanding  of the  potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital  and  risk management practices. The  intent of stress  testing  is  to",

These  contingency plans  include our Financial  Contingency and  Recovery Plan, which  provides monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital and/or liquidity, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other risk reducing strategies at various levels of capital or liquidity depletion during a period of stress. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.\n\n## Strategic Risk Management\n\nStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk  categories  along  with  credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions  about external  or internal  factors, inappropriate  business  plans, ineffective  business  strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the  regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive  environments  in the  geographic locations  in  which  we  operate, such  as competitor actions, changing  customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments.\n\nAn aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the Corporation's capital  levels  are  not adequate  to  meet minimum regulatory requirements  and  support execution  of business  activities  or absorb  losses  from risks  during  normal  or adverse  economic and  market conditions. As  such, capital  risk  is  managed  in parallel to strategic risk.\n\nWe  manage  strategic risk through  the  Strategic Risk Enterprise  Policy and  integration  into  the  strategic planning process, among other activities. Our strategic plan is consistent with  our risk  appetite, capital  plan  and  liquidity requirements, and  specifically addresses  strategic risks  impacting  each business.\n\nOn  an  annual  basis, the  Board  reviews  and  approves  the strategic plan, capital  plan, financial  operating  plan  and  Risk Appetite  Statement. With  oversight by the  Board, senior management directs  the  lines  of business  to  execute  our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The  executive  management team monitors business  performance  throughout the  year and  provides  the Board  with  regular progress  reports  on  whether strategic objectives  and  timelines  are  being  met, including  reports  on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on  assessing  forecasted  earnings  and  returns  on  capital, the current risk  profile, current capital  and  liquidity requirements, staffing  levels  and  changes  required  to  support the  strategic plan, stress  testing  results, and other qualitative  factors  such as market growth rates and peer analysis.\n\nSignificant strategic actions, such  as  capital  actions, material  acquisitions  or divestitures, and  resolution  plans  are reviewed  and  approved  by the  Board. At the  business  level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services,\n\nregulatory change and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board  and  the  ERC, executive  management performs  similar analyses  throughout the  year, and  evaluates  changes  to  the financial  forecast or the  risk, capital  or liquidity positions  as deemed  appropriate  to  balance  and  optimize  achieving  the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted  financial  strength. Proprietary models  are  used  to measure  the  capital  requirements  for credit, country, market, operational  and  strategic risks. The allocated  capital  assigned to  each  business  is  based  on  its  unique  risk  profile. With oversight by the  Board, executive  management assesses  the risk-adjusted  returns  of each  business  in  approving  strategic and  financial  operating  plans. The  businesses  use  allocated capital  to  define  business  strategies, and  price  products  and transactions.\n\n## Capital Management\n\nThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is  more  than  adequate  to  support its  business  activities  and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain  ready access  to  financial  markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength  for our subsidiaries, and  satisfy current and  future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a  key consideration  in  the  development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.\n\nWe  conduct an  Internal  Capital  Adequacy Assessment Process  (ICAAP) on  a  periodic basis. The  ICAAP  is  a  forwardlooking  assessment of our projected  capital  needs  and resources, incorporating  earnings, balance  sheet and  risk forecasts  under baseline  and  adverse  economic and  market conditions. We  utilize  periodic stress  tests  to  assess  the potential  impacts  to  our balance  sheet, earnings, regulatory capital  and  liquidity under a  variety of stress  scenarios. We perform qualitative  risk  assessments  to  identify and  assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital  requirements. Management assesses  ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital  guidelines  and  capital  position  to  the Board or its committees.\n\nWe  periodically review  capital  allocated  to  our businesses and  allocate  capital  annually during  the  strategic and  capital planning  processes. For more  information, see  Business Segment Operations on page 88.\n\n## CCAR and Capital Planning\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan, which includes supervisory stress testing by the  Federal  Reserve. Based  on  2023  stress  test results, our stress  capital  buffer (SCB) is  2.5  percent effective  October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024.\n\nIn  October 2021, the  Board  authorized  the  Corporation's $25 billion  common  stock  repurchase  program (October 2021 Authorization). Additionally, the Board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the Corporation's equity-based  compensation  plans.

As  of December 31, 2023, the  remaining  repurchase  authority was approximately $12.7  billion (including  repurchases  to  offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans).\n\nThe  timing  and  amount of common stock  repurchases  are subject to  various  factors, including  the  Corporation's  capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and  may be  suspended  at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated  transactions, including  repurchase  plans that satisfy the  conditions  of Rule  10b5-1  of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).\n\n## Regulatory Capital\n\nAs a BHC, we are subject to  regulatory capital  rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital  ratios  and  buffer requirements  and  outlined two  methods  of calculating  risk-weighted  assets  (RWA), the Standardized  approach  and  the  Advanced  approaches. The Standardized  approach  relies  primarily on  supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models.\n\nThe Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to  the  Prompt Corrective  Action  (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced  approaches  institutions  under Basel  3  and  are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA under both  the  Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches. The lower of the  capital  ratios  under Standardized  or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements  is  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy, including under the  PCA  framework. As  of December 31, 2023, the common  equity tier 1  (CET1) capital, Tier 1  capital  and  Total capital ratios under the Standardized approach were the binding ratios.\n\n## Minimum Capital Requirements\n\nIn  order to  avoid  restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and discretionary bonus  payments  to  executive  officers, the Corporation  must meet risk-based  capital  ratio  requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer\n\nand a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers  and  surcharge  must be  comprised  solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, the  Corporation's  minimum CET1  capital  ratio requirements  were  10.4  percent under the  Standardized approach  and  9.5  percent under the  Advanced  approaches. Effective  October 1, 2023  through  December 31, 2023, our CET1  minimum requirement was  9.5  percent under both  the Standardized and Advanced approaches.\n\nThe Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on  an  annual  basis  under two  methods  and  is  subject to  the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with  the  approach  prescribed  by the  Basel  Committee's assessment methodology and  is  calculated  using  specified indicators  of systemic importance. Method  2  modifies  the Method  1  approach  by, among  other factors, including  a measure of the Corporation's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. Effective  January 1, 2024, the  Corporation's  G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, increased 50 bps, resulting  in  an  increase  in  our minimum CET1  capital  ratio requirement to 10.0 percent from 9.5 percent. At December 31, 2023, the  Corporation's  CET1  capital  ratio  of 11.8  percent under the  Standardized  approach  exceeded  its  CET1  capital ratio  requirement as well  as  the  new  minimum requirement in place as of January 1, 2024.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  also  required  to  maintain  a  minimum supplementary leverage  ratio  (SLR) of 3.0  percent plus  a leverage  buffer of 2.0  percent in  order to  avoid  certain restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and  discretionary bonus payments  to  executive  officers. At December 31, 2023, our insured  depository institution subsidiaries  exceeded  their requirement to  maintain  a  minimum 6.0  percent SLR  to  be considered  well  capitalized  under the  PCA  framework. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is  total  leverage  exposure  based  on  the  daily average  of the  sum of on-balance  sheet exposures  less permitted  deductions  and  the  simple  average  of certain  offbalance  sheet exposures, as  of the  end  of each  month  in  a quarter.\n\n## Capital Composition and Ratios\n\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches  as  measured  at December 31, 2023  and  2022. For the  periods  presented herein, the  Corporation  met the  definition  of well  capitalized under current regulatory requirements.",

Eligible  long-term debt for TLAC ratios  is  comprised  of unsecured  debt that has  a  remaining maturity of at least one   year and   satisfies  additional\n\nrequirements as prescribed in the TLAC final rule. As with the risk-based capital ratios and SLR, the Corporation is required to maintain TLAC ratios in excess of minimum requirements plus applicable  buffers  to  avoid  restrictions  on  capital  distributions and  discretionary bonus  payments  to  executive  officers. Table 14 presents  the  Corporation's  TLAC  and  long-term debt ratios and related information as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.",

Under the capital proposal, the Advanced approaches  would  be  replaced  with  a  new  standardized approach, referred  to  as  the  expanded  risk-based  approach, which would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. U.S. banking regulators also issued proposed rules to revise the risk-based capital surcharge for G-SIBs, which would be effective two calendar quarters after finalization. On August 29, 2023, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules that would change the criteria for debt instruments included in the Corporation's  eligible  long-term debt and  TLAC. Any final  rules issued  are  subject to  change  from the  current proposals. The Corporation is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rules on its regulatory capital, eligible long-term debt and TLAC requirements.\n\n## Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation\n\nThe  Corporation's  principal  U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries  are BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith  Incorporated  (MLPF&S). On  August 13, 2023, Merrill Lynch  Professional  Clearing  Corp. (MLPCC) merged  into  its immediate parent, BofAS. Prior to that date, MLPCC was a fullyguaranteed  subsidiary of BofAS  and  provided  clearing  and settlement services  as  well  as  prime  brokerage  and  arranged financing services for institutional clients. Following the merger, client services  previously provided  by MLPCC  are  now  being provided by or through BofAS.\n\nThe Corporation's principal European subsidiaries undertaking broker-dealer activities are Merrill Lynch International (MLI) and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).\n\nThe  U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries  are  subject to  the  net capital  requirements  of Rule  15c3-1  under the  Exchange  Act. BofAS computes its capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and  MLPF&S computes  its  capital  requirements  in  accordance  with  the alternative standard under Rule 15c3-1. BofAS is registered as a  futures  commission  merchant and  is  subject to  Commodity Futures  Trading  Commission (CFTC) Regulation  1.17. The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to  FINRA Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.\n\nBofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its  reserve  requirement in  addition  to  a  certain  percentage  of securities-based  swap risk  margin. BofAS must also  notify the SEC  in  the  event its  tentative  net capital  is  less  than  $6.0 billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 31, 2023, BofAS had tentative net capital of $21.4 billion. BofAS also had regulatory net capital  of $19.4  billion, which  exceeded  the minimum requirement of $4.6 billion.\n\nMLPF&S  provides  retail  services. At December 31, 2023, MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $5.8 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $134 million.\n\nOur European  broker-dealers  are  subject to  requirements from U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is  regulated  by the  Prudential  Regulation  Authority and  the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital  requirements. At December 31, 2023, MLI's  capital resources  were  $33.9  billion, which  exceeded  the  minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $11.4 billion.\n\nBofASE, an authorized credit institution  with  its  head  office located  in  France, is  regulated  by the  Autorit\u00e9  de  Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel  et de  R\u00e9solution  and  the  Autorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s Financiers, and  supervised  under the  Single  Supervisory Mechanism by the  European  Central  Bank. At December 31, 2023, BofASE's  capital  resources  were  $9.6  billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $3.6 billion.\n\nIn addition, MLI and BofASE became conditionally registered with  the  SEC  as  security-based  swap  dealers  in  the  fourth quarter of 2021, and  maintained  net liquid assets  at December 31, 2023 that exceeded  the  applicable  minimum requirements under the Exchange Act.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\n## Funding and Liquidity Risk Management\n\nOur primary liquidity risk  management objective  is  to  meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while  continuing  to  support our businesses  and",

        "page_content": "customers  under a  range  of economic conditions. To  achieve that objective, we  analyze  and  monitor our liquidity risk  under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to  diverse  funding  sources, including  our stable  deposit base, and  seek  to  align  liquidity-related  incentives  and  risks. These liquidity risk management practices  have  allowed  us  to effectively manage  the  market stress  from increased  volatility due to the failure of certain financial institutions in the first half of 2023. Our practices  have  also  allowed  us  to  effectively manage  market fluctuations  from the  rising  interest rate environment, inflationary pressures  and  changes  in  the macroeconomic environment.\n\nWe  define  liquidity as  readily available  assets, limited  to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can  use  to  meet our contractual  and  contingent financial obligations  as  they arise. We  manage  our liquidity position through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including  intraday) basis  under both  expected  and  stressed conditions. We  believe  that a  centralized  approach  to  funding and  liquidity management enhances  our ability to  monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes  access  to  funding  sources, minimizes  borrowing  costs  and  facilitates  timely responses  to liquidity events.\n\nThe Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and  Recovery Plan. The  ERC  establishes  our liquidity risk  tolerance  levels. The  MRC  is  responsible  for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures  within  the  established  tolerance  levels. The  MRC reviews  and  monitors  our liquidity position  and  stress  testing results, approves  certain  liquidity risk  limits  and  reviews  the impact of strategic decisions  on  our liquidity. For more information, see  Managing  Risk  on  page  98. Under this governance  framework, we  developed  certain  funding  and liquidity risk  management practices  which  include: maintaining liquidity at Bank of America  Corporation  (Parent) and  selected subsidiaries, including our bank  subsidiaries and  other regulated  entities; determining  what amounts  of liquidity are appropriate  for these  entities  based  on  analysis  of debt maturities  and  other potential  cash  outflows, including  those that we  may experience  during  stressed  market conditions; diversifying  funding  sources, considering  our asset profile  and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.\n\n## NB Holdings Corporation\n\nThe Parent, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB  Holdings  Corporation  (NB  Holdings). We  have  transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional Parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to NB Holdings. The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred  any assets. These  arrangements  support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the  Parent would  be  resolved  under the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nIn  consideration  for the  transfer of assets, NB  Holdings issued a subordinated note to the Parent in a principal amount equal  to  the  value  of the  transferred  assets. The  aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future  asset transfers. NB  Holdings  also  provided  the  Parent with  a  committed  line  of credit that allows  the  Parent to  draw\n\nfunds  necessary to  service  near-term cash  needs. These arrangements  support our preferred  single  point of entry resolution  strategy, under which  only the  Parent would  be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include  provisions  to  terminate  the  line  of credit, forgive  the subordinated  note  and  require  the  Parent to  transfer its remaining  financial  assets  to  NB  Holdings  if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the Parent becomes imminent.\n\n## Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\n\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the Parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and highquality, liquid, unencumbered  securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred  to  as  Global  Liquidity Sources  (GLS), is  comprised  of assets  that are  readily available  to  the  Parent and  selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central  banks  outside  of the  U.S. We  limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even  in  stressed  conditions, through  repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow  us  to  meet the  liquidity requirements  of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.\n\nTable 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nTable 15 Average Global Liquidity Sources\n\n|                                        | Three Months Ended  December 31   | Three Months Ended  December 31   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in billions)                  | 2023                              | 2022                              |\n| Bank entities                          | $ 735                             | $  694                            |\n| Nonbank and other entities  (1)        | 162                               | 174                               |\n| Total Average Global Liquidity Sources | $ 897                             | $  868                            |\n\nOur bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Bank  subsidiaries  can  also  generate  incremental liquidity by pledging  a  range  of unencumbered  loans  and securities  to  certain  FHLBs  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this  pool  of specifically-identified  eligible  assets  was  $312 billion and $348 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these  assets, including  regularly monitoring  our total pool  of eligible  loans  and  securities  collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to  change  at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated  by the  bank  subsidiaries  can generally be  used  only to  fund  obligations  within  the  bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the Parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.\n\nLiquidity is  also  held  in  nonbank  entities, including  the Parent, NB  Holdings  and  other regulated  entities. The  Parent and  NB  Holdings  liquidity is  typically in  the  form of cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of",

However, HQLA  for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion  of excess  liquidity held  at certain  subsidiaries. The LCR  is  calculated  as  the  amount of a  financial  institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the  institution  could  encounter over a  30-day period  of significant liquidity stress, expressed  as  a  percentage. Our average  consolidated  HQLA, on  a  net basis, was  $590  billion and  $605  billion for the  three  months  ended  December 31, 2023 and  2022. For the same  periods, the average consolidated LCR was 115 percent and 120 percent. Our LCR fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.\n\n## Liquidity Stress Analysis\n\nWe utilize  liquidity stress  analysis  to  assist us  in  determining the  appropriate  amounts  of liquidity to  maintain  at the  Parent and  our subsidiaries  to  meet contractual  and  contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and  utilize  incorporate  market-wide  and  Corporation-specific events, including  potential  credit rating  downgrades  for the Parent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical  experience, experience  of distressed  and  failed financial  institutions, regulatory guidance, and  both  expected and unexpected future events.\n\nThe  types  of potential  contractual  and  contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited  to, upcoming  contractual  maturities  of unsecured  debt a nd  reductions  in  new  debt issuances; diminished  access  to secured  financing  markets; potential  deposit withdrawals; increased  draws  on  loan  commitments, liquidity facilities  and letters  of credit; additional  collateral  that counterparties  could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited  to, credit rating  downgrades, could  negatively impact potential  contractual  and  contingent outflows  and  the  related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.\n\nWe  consider all  sources  of funds  that we  could  access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available  sources  with  corresponding  liquidity requirements  by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is  a  liquidity requirement for large  banks to maintain a minimum level  of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the  ability of banks  to  lend  to  households  and  businesses  in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The  U.S. NSFR  applies  to  the  Corporation  on  a consolidated  basis  and  to  our insured  depository institutions. For the  three  months  ended  September 30, 2023  and December 31, 2023, the average consolidated NSFR was 119 percent and 120 percent.\n\n## Diversified Funding Sources\n\nWe  fund  our assets  primarily with  a  mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated  funding  approach  diversified  across  products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n\nThe  primary benefits  of our centralized  funding  approach include  greater control, reduced  funding  costs, wider name recognition  by investors  and  greater flexibility to  meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations  make  Parent funding  impractical, certain  other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n\nWe  fund  a  substantial  portion  of our lending  activities through  our deposits, which  were  $1.92  trillion  and  $1.93 trillion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These  deposits  are  diversified  by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, 50 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking , 16  percent in GWIM and  27  percent in Global  Banking . As  of the  same  period, approximately 68 percent of consumer and  small  business  deposits  and  79 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who  have  had  accounts  with  us  for 10  or more  years. In addition, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, 28 percent and 34 percent of our deposits  were  noninterest-bearing  and  included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients.\n\nWe consider a  substantial  portion  of our deposits  to  be  a stable, low-cost and  consistent source  of funding. We believe this  deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale  funding  sources. Our lending  activities  may also  be financed  through  secured  borrowings, including  credit card securitizations  and  securitizations  with  government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.\n\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded  on  a  secured  basis  through  securities  lending  and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and  market conditions. We  believe  funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured  financing. Repurchase  agreements  are  generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing",

        "page_content": "markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a  diverse  group  of counterparties, providing  a range  of securities  collateral  and  pursuing  longer durations, when  appropriate. For more  information  on  secured  financing agreements, see Note  10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements, Short-term  Borrowings,  Collateral  and  Restricted  Cash to  the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nTotal  long-term debt increased  $26.2  billion  to  $302.2 billion  during  2023, primarily due  to  debt issuances  and valuation  adjustments, partially offset by debt maturities  and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and  other factors. Our other regulated entities  may also  make  markets  in  our debt instruments  to provide liquidity for investors.\n\nDuring  2023, we  issued  $62.0  billion  of long-term debt consisting of $24.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, substantially all  of which  were  TLAC  compliant, $25.1  billion  of notes  issued  by Bank  of America, N.A. and $12.9  billion  of other debt. During  2022, we  issued  $66.0 billion  of long-term debt consisting  of $44.2  billion  of notes issued  by Bank  of America  Corporation, substantially all  of which  were  TLAC  compliant, $10.0  billion of notes  issued  by Bank of America, N.A. and $11.8 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring  2023, we  had  total  long-term debt maturities  and redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of $42.7  billion  consisting  of $25.3 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.5 billion for Bank  of America, N.A. and  $6.9  billion  of other debt. During 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.3 billion consisting of $19.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $9.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other debt.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Bank  of America  Corporation's senior notes  of $208.4  billion included  $187.7  billion of outstanding  notes  that are  both  TLAC  eligible  and  callable  at least one  year before  their stated  maturities. Of these  senior notes, $22.1 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible during 2024, and $22.0 billion, $21.4 billion, $25.0 billion and $19.9  billion  will  do  so  during  each  of 2025  through  2028, respectively, and $77.3 billion thereafter.\n\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured  funding  may be  negatively impacted  by general market conditions  or by matters  specific to  the  financial services  industry or the  Corporation, we  seek  to  mitigate refinancing  risk  by actively managing  the  amount of our borrowings  that we  anticipate  will  mature  within  any month or quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes  for client purposes, certain  of which  qualify as  TLACe ligible debt. During 2023, we issued $15.7 billion of structured notes, which  are  debt obligations  that pay investors  returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on  these  liabilities  with  derivatives  and/or investments  in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the  cost is  similar to  our other unsecured long-term debt. We could  be  required  to  settle  certain  structured  note  obligations for cash  or other securities  prior to  maturity under certain circumstances, which we  consider for liquidity planning purposes. We  believe, however, that a  portion  of such\n\nborrowings  will  remain  outstanding  beyond  the  earliest put or redemption date.\n\nSubstantially all of our senior and  subordinated  debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in  changes  to  terms, accelerate  maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in  our credit ratings, financial  ratios, earnings, cash  flows  or stock  price. For more  information  on  long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note 11 - Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\nWe  use  derivative  transactions  to  manage  the  duration, interest rate  and  currency risks  of our borrowings, considering the  characteristics  of the  assets  they are  funding. For more information  on  our ALM activities, see  Interest Rate  Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 131.\n\n## Uninsured Deposits\n\nThe  FDIC  insures  the  Corporation's  U.S. deposits  up  to $250,000  per depositor, per insured  bank  for each  account ownership  category, and  various  country-specific funds  insure non-U.S. deposits up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed insurance  limits  are  uninsured. At December 31, 2023, the Corporation's  deposits  totaled  $1.92  trillion, of which  total estimated  uninsured  U.S. and  non-U.S. deposits  were  $606.8 billion and  $116.6  billion. At December 31, 2022, the Corporation's  deposits  totaled  $1.93  trillion, of which  total estimated  uninsured  U.S. and  non-U.S. deposits  were  $617.6 billion  and  $102.8  billion. Deposit balances  exclude  $14.8 billion  and  $15.2  billion  of collateral  received  on  certain derivative contracts that are netted against the derivative asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Estimated uninsured deposits presented in this section reflect amounts disclosed in our regulatory reports, adjusted to exclude  related  accrued  interest and  intercompany deposit balances.\n\nTable 17 presents information about the Corporation's total estimated uninsured time deposits.

Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries  have  access  to  central  bank  facilities  in  the jurisdictions  in  which  they operate. While  we  do  not rely on these  sources  in  our liquidity modeling, we  maintain  the policies, procedures  and  governance  processes  that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers  or counterparties  when  we  compete  in  certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including  over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is  our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.\n\nCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including  long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospect s and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies  could  make  adjustments  to  our ratings  at any time, and  they provide  no  assurances  that they will  maintain  our ratings at current levels.\n\nOther factors  that influence  our credit ratings  include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various  risk  exposures  and  risk  management policies  and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail  risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of\n\nfunding  sources  and  funding  costs; the  current and  expected level  and  volatility of our earnings; our capital  position  and capital  management practices; our corporate  governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies' views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.\n\nOn  May 3, 2023, Moody's  Investors  Service  (Moody's) upgraded its long-term senior debt ratings of the Corporation by one  notch  to  A1  from A2, and  also  upgraded  the  long-term senior debt ratings  of BANA  to  Aa1  from Aa2. Moody's concurrently affirmed  its  Prime-1  short-term ratings  of the Corporation  and  BANA. Moody's  cited  the  Corporation's strengthened  capital, improved  earnings  profile  and  ongoing commitment to  maintaining  a  restrained  risk  appetite  as rationale  for the  upgrade. These actions  concluded  the  review for upgrade  that Moody's  initiated  on  January 23, 2023. Separately, on November 13, 2023, Moody's placed its ratings for BANA  on  negative  outlook, reflecting  the  agency's  recent move to a negative outlook on its ratings for the government of the  United  States  of America  and  the  potentially weaker capacity for the  government to  support systemically important U.S. banks. The Corporation's ratings and stable outlook were not affected by this action.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, Standard & Poor's Global Ratings (S&P) affirmed  the  current ratings  of the  Corporation  and  its subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook to Stable from Positive. S&P concurrently changed its outlooks on three other large U.S. bank holding companies to Stable from Positive, noting  that the  agency has  reduced  its  upside expectations for bank ratings in the near term.\n\nThe  ratings  and  outlooks  from Fitch  Ratings  for the Corporation and its subsidiaries have not changed during 2023.\n\nTable 18 presents the Corporation's current long-term/shortterm senior debt ratings  and  outlooks  expressed by the rating agencies.\n\nTable 18 Senior Debt Ratings\n\n|                                                     | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Moody's Investors Service   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Standard & Poor's Global Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                                                     | Long-term                   | Short-term                  | Outlook                     | Long-term                          | Short-term                         | Outlook                            | Long-term       | Short-term      | Outlook         |\n| Bank of America Corporation                         | A1                          | P-1                         | Stable                      | A-                                 | A-2                                | Stable                             | AA-             | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America, N.A.                               | Aa1                         | P-1                         | Negative                    | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Bank of America Europe Designated  Activity Company | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith  Incorporated | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities, Inc.                               | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| Merrill Lynch International                         | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n| BofA Securities Europe SA                           | NR                          | NR                          | NR                          | A+                                 | A-1                                | Stable                             | AA              | F1+             | Stable          |\n\nNR = not rated\n\nA reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain  asset-backed  securitizations  may have  a  material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the  related  cost of funds, our businesses  and  on certain  revenues, particularly in those  businesses  where counterparty creditworthiness  is  critical. In  addition, under the terms  of certain  OTC  derivative  contracts  and  other trading agreements, in  the  event of downgrades  of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to  sustain  losses  and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings  of our Parent, bank  or broker-dealer\n\nsubsidiaries  were  downgraded  by one  or more  levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.\n\nWhile certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the  full  scope  of the  consequences  of a  credit rating downgrade  to  a  financial  institution  is  inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related  factors  and  assumptions, including  whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades  to  its  short-term credit ratings, and  assumptions about the  potential  behaviors  of various  customers, investors and counterparties.

The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on  demand, of amounts  payable  on  the  Guaranteed Notes  if not paid  by BofA  Finance. In  addition, each  of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts) is a 100 percent owned  finance  subsidiary of the  Corporation  that has issued  and  sold  trust preferred  securities  (the  Trust Preferred Securities) or capital  securities  (the  Capital  Securities  and, together with  the  Guaranteed  Notes  and  the  Trust Preferred Securities, the  Guaranteed  Securities), as  applicable, that remained outstanding at December 31, 2023. The Corporation guarantees  the  payment of amounts  and  distributions  with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities if not paid  by the  Trusts, to  the extent of funds  held  by the Trusts. This  guarantee, together with  the  Corporation's  other obligations  with  respect to  the  Trust Preferred  Securities  and Capital Securities, effectively constitutes a full and unconditional  guarantee  of the  Trusts' payment obligations  on the Trust Preferred Securities or Capital Securities, as applicable. No  other subsidiary of the  Corporation  guarantees the Guaranteed Securities.\n\nBofA Finance and  each  of the Trusts are finance subsidiaries, have  no  independent assets, revenues  or operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the Corporation's  other subsidiaries  to  meet their respective obligations  under the  Guaranteed  Securities  in  the  ordinary course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on their Guaranteed  Securities  in  a  bankruptcy, resolution  or similar proceeding, any recoveries  on  those  claims  will  be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the Corporation, as described above.\n\nThe Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries  for liquidity. Applicable  laws  and  regulations  and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the Corporation's  resolution  plan  could  restrict the  availability of funds  from subsidiaries  to  the  Corporation, which  could adversely affect the  Corporation's  ability to  make  payments under its  guarantees. In  addition, the  obligations  of the Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities will  be  structurally subordinated  to  all  existing  and  future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned\n\nsubsidiaries, under the  indenture  governing  the  Guaranteed Notes, the  subsidiary or subsidiaries  will  not be  required  to assume the Corporation's obligations under its guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes.\n\nFor more information on factors that may affect payments to holders  of the  Guaranteed  Securities, see  Liquidity Risk  -  NB Holdings  Corporation  in  this  section, Item 1.

Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations\n\nFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection  with  the  sale  of mortgage  loans, see Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can  also  arise  from operational  failures  that result in  an erroneous  advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss  potential  arising  from all  product classifications  including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets heldfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan commitments, letters of credit and  financial  guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets heldfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain  loans  and  unfunded  commitments  are accounted  for under the  fair value  option. Credit risk  for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the  allowance  for credit losses  but as  part of the  fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk  is  measured  as  the  net cost in  the  event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value  to  represent credit exposure  without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts  take  into  consideration  the  effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more  information  on  derivatives  and  credit extension commitments, see Note  3  -  Derivatives and Note  12  Commitments  and  Contingencies to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nWe  manage  credit risk  based  on  the  risk  profile  of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the  nature  of underlying  collateral  and  other support given  current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial  and  monitor credit risk  in  each  as discussed below.\n\nWe  refine  our underwriting  and  credit risk  management practices  as  well  as  credit standards  to  meet the  changing economic environment. To  mitigate  losses  and  enhance customer support in  our consumer businesses, we  have  in place  collection  programs  and  loan  modification  and  customer assistance  infrastructures. We  utilize  a  number of actions  to mitigate losses  in  the  commercial  businesses  including increasing  the  frequency and  intensity of portfolio  monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating  commercial  exposures  to  independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.\n\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see the  following: Consumer Portfolio  Credit Risk  Management on",

For more information on the Corporation's credit risks, see the Credit section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDuring  2023, our asset quality remained  relatively stable. Our net charge-off ratio increased primarily driven by credit card loans, as delinquency trends continued to slowly increase off of historic lows. Nonperforming loans increased compared to 2022 driven by the commercial real estate office property type, while commercial  reservable  criticized  exposure  increased  driven  by both office as well as other industries that have been impacted by the  current environment. Uncertainty remains  regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, elevated  rates  and  the  current geopolitical  environment and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.\n\n## Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical  techniques  in  conjunction  with  experiential judgment are  used  in  all  aspects  of portfolio  management including  underwriting, product pricing, risk  appetite, setting\n\ncredit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using  detailed  behavioral  information  from external sources, such  as  credit bureaus, and/or internal  historical experience  and  are  a  component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in  making  both  new  and  ongoing  credit decisions  as  well  as portfolio  management strategies, including  authorizations  and line  management, collection  practices  and  strategies, and determination  of the  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses  and allocated capital for credit risk.\n\n## Consumer Credit Portfolio\n\nDuring  2023, the  U.S. unemployment rate  remained  relatively stable  and  home  prices  increased  compared  to  2022. Net charge-offs  increased  $1.2  billion  to  $3.1  billion  in  2023 primarily due to late-stage delinquent credit card loans that were charged off.\n\nThe consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $1.3 billion during 2023 to $8.5 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 125.\n\nFor more  information  on  our accounting  policies  regarding delinquencies, nonperforming  status, charge-offs  and  loan modifications for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant  Accounting  Principles and Note  5  -  Outstanding Loans  and  Leases  and  Allowance  for Credit  Losses to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTable  19 presents  our outstanding  consumer loans  and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more.\n\nTable 19 Consumer Credit Quality\n\n|                                                                           | Outstandings   | Outstandings   | Nonperforming   | Nonperforming   | Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More   | Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                                                           | December 31    | December 31    | December 31     | December 31     | December 31                         | December 31                         |\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                     | 2023           | 2022           | 2023            | 2022            | 2023                                | 2022                                |\n| Residential mortgage  (1)                                                 | $ 228,403      | $  229,670     | $ 2,114         | $  2,167        | $ 252                               | $  368                              |\n| Home equity                                                               | 25,527         | 26,563         | 450             | 510             | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Credit card                                                               | 102,200        | 93,421         | n/a             | n/a             | 1,224                               | 717                                 |\n| Direct/Indirect consumer (2)                                              | 103,468        | 106,236        | 148             | 77              | 2                                   | 2                                   |\n| Other consumer                                                            | 124            | 156            | -               | -               | -                                   | -                                   |\n| Consumer loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair  value option | $ 459,722      | $  456,046     | $ 2,712         | $  2,754        | $ 1,478                             | $  1,087                            |\n| Loans accounted for under the fair value option  (3)                      | 243            | 339            |                 |                 |                                     |                                     |\n| Total consumer loans and leases                                           | $ 459,965      | $  456,385     |                 |                 |                                     |                                     |\n| Percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases  (4)                  | n/a            | n/a            | 0.59 %          | 0.60 %          | 0.32 %                              | 0.24 %                              |\n| Percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases, (4)                  |                |                |                 |                 |                                     |                                     |\n| excluding fully-insured loan portfolios                                   | n/a            | n/a            | 0.60            | 0.62            | 0.27                                | 0.16                                |\n\nn/a = not applicable",

Approximately 51 percent of the residential  mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 46 percent was in GWIM and the remaining portion was in All Other .\n\nOutstanding  balances  in  the  residential  mortgage  portfolio decreased  $1.3  billion  in  2023, as  paydowns  and  payoffs outpaced new originations.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the residential mortgage portfolio included $11.0 billion and $11.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured  loans, of which  $2.2  billion  for both  periods  had FHA  insurance, with  the  remainder protected  by Fannie  Mae long-term standby agreements.\n\nTable  21 presents  certain  residential  mortgage  key credit statistics  on  both  a  reported  basis  and  excluding  the  fullyinsured  loan  portfolio.

Of the  nonperforming  residential mortgage  loans  at December 31, 2023, $1.3  billion, or 62 percent, were current on contractual payments. Excluding fullyinsured  loans, loans  accruing  past due  30  days  or more increased $142 million.\n\nOf the  $217.4  billion  in  total  residential  mortgage  loans outstanding  at December 31, 2023, $63.1  billion, or 29 percent, of loans were  originated as  interest-only. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.6 billion, or six percent, at December 31, 2023. Residential  mortgage  loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate  of early stage  delinquencies  and  nonperforming status   compared  to  the  residential  mortgage  portfolio  as  a\n\nwhole. At December 31, 2023, $80 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared  to  $986  million, or less  than  one  percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2023, $180  million, or five percent, of outstanding  interest-only residential  mortgage  loans  that had entered  the  amortization  period  were  nonperforming, of which $61 million were  contractually current. Loans that have  yet to enter the  amortization  period  in  our interest-only residential mortgage  portfolio  are  primarily well-collateralized  loans  to  our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three  years  to  10  years. Substantially all  of these  loans  that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.",

HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to  15-  or 20-year amortizing  loans. We  no  longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, 84  percent of the  home  equity portfolio  was  in Consumer Banking , seven  percent was  in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding  balances  in  the  home  equity portfolio  decreased $1.0 billion in 2023 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws\n\non existing lines and new originations. Of the total home equity portfolio  at December 31, 2023 and 2022, $10.1  billion  and $11.1 billion, or 39 percent and  42  percent, were  in  first-lien positions. At December 31, 2023, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more juniorlien  position  and  where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.4 billion, or 17 percent, of our total home equity portfolio.\n\nUnused  HELOCs  totaled  $45.1  billion  and  $42.4  billion  at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The HELOC utilization rate was 35 percent and 38 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nTable  23  presents  certain  home  equity portfolio  key credit statistics.\n\n|                                                              | December 31   | December 31   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                        | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Outstandings                                                 | $ 25,527      | $  26,563     |\n| Accruing past due 30 days or more                            | 95            | 96            |\n| Nonperforming loans  (2)                                     | 450           | 510           |\n| Percent of portfolio                                         |               |               |\n| Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 | -%            | - %           |\n| Refreshed CLTV greater than 100                              | -             | -             |\n| Refreshed FICO below 620                                     | 3             | 2             |\n\nNonperforming  outstanding  balances  in  the  home  equity portfolio decreased $60 million to $450 million at December 31, 2023, primarily driven by loan sales, payoffs and returns  to  performing  status  outpacing  new  additions. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2023, $256 million, or 57 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $113 million, or 25 percent, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due remained relatively unchanged in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nOf the $25.5  billion in total home  equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2023, as shown in Table 23, 11 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $4.0 billion at\n\nDecember 31, 2023. The  HELOCs  that have  entered  the amortization  period  have  experienced  a  higher percentage  of early stage  delinquencies  and  nonperforming  status  when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2023, $41 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2023, $283 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming.\n\nFor our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can  infer some  of this  information  through  a  review  of our HELOC  portfolio  that we  service  and  is  still  in  its  revolving period. During  2023, 13  percent of these  customers  with  an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.",

As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted  to  reflect changes  in  the  financial condition, cash  flow, risk  profile  or outlook  of a  borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while  also  balancing  these  considerations  with  the  total borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to  measure  and  evaluate  concentrations  within  portfolios. In addition, risk  ratings  are  a  factor in  determining  the  level  of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to  work  with  clients  experiencing  financial  difficulty to  modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial  portfolio, see Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Management of Commercial Credit Risk\n\n## Concentrations\n\nCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations  of credit exposure  continue  to  be  aligned with  our risk  appetite. We  review, measure  and  manage\n\nconcentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure  and  manage  commercial  real  estate  loans  by geographic location  and  property type. In  addition, within  our non-U.S. portfolio, we  evaluate  exposures  by region  and  by country. Tables 32, 34 and 37 summarize our concentrations. We also  utilize  syndications  of exposure  to  third  parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Table 34 and  Commercial  Portfolio  Credit Risk  Management -  Industry Concentrations on page 120.\n\nWe  account for certain  large  corporate  loans  and  loan commitments, including  issued  but unfunded  letters  of credit which  are  considered  utilized  for credit risk  management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines  under the  fair value  option. Lending  commitments, both funded and  unfunded, are actively managed  and monitored, and  as  appropriate, credit risk  for these  lending relationships  may be  mitigated  through  the  use  of credit derivatives, with  our credit view  and  market perspectives determining  the  size  and  timing  of the  hedging  activity. In addition, we  purchase  credit protection  to  cover the  funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain  other credit exposures. To  lessen  the  cost of obtaining  our desired  credit protection  levels, credit exposure  may be  added  within  an industry, borrower or counterparty group  by selling  protection. These  credit derivatives  do  not meet the  requirements  for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\nIn  addition, we  are  a  member of various  securities  and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and",

During 2023, commercial credit quality deteriorated as nonperforming commercial  loans  and  reservable  criticized  utilized  exposure increased primarily driven  by the commercial real estate office property type; however, the  commercial  net charge-off ratio  of 0.12 percent during 2023 remained low.\n\nWith  the  exception  of the  office  property type, which  is further discussed in the Commercial Real Estate section herein, credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has remained relatively stable  since  December 31, 2022; however, we  are closely monitoring emerging trends and borrower performance in the increased rate environment and challenging capital markets. Recent demand for office space has been stagnant, and future demand  for office space  continues  to  be  uncertain  as\n\ncompanies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.\n\nThe  commercial  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses decreased  $623  million  during  2023  to  $4.8  billion, primarily driven  by improved  macroeconomic conditions. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 125.\n\nTotal  commercial  utilized  credit exposure  decreased  $8.6 billion  during  2023  to  $696.3  billion primarily driven  by lower derivative  assets. The  utilization  rate  for loans  and  leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in  the  aggregate, was 55 percent and 56 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nTable  28 presents  commercial  credit exposure  by type  for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial  utilized  credit exposure  includes  SBLCs  and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been  issued  and  for which  we  are  legally bound  to  advance funds  under prescribed  conditions  during  a  specified  time period, and  excludes  exposure  related  to  trading  account assets. Although  funds  have  not yet been  advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.\n\nTable 28 Commercial Credit Exposure by Type\n\n|                                                    | Commercial Utilized  (1)   | Commercial Utilized  (1)   | Commercial Unfunded  (2, 3, 4) December 31   | Commercial Unfunded  (2, 3, 4) December 31   | Total Commercial Committed   | Total Commercial Committed   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                              | 2023                       | 2022                       | 2023                                         | 2022                                         | 2023                         | 2022                         |\n| Loans and leases                                   | $ 593,767                  | $  589,362                 | $ 507,641                                    | $  487,772                                   | $ 1,101,408                  | $  1,077,134                 |\n| Derivative assets  (5)                             | 39,323                     | 48,642                     | -                                            | -                                            | 39,323                       | 48,642                       |\n| Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees | 31,348                     | 33,376                     | 1,953                                        | 1,266                                        | 33,301                       | 34,642                       |\n| Debt securities and other investments              | 20,422                     | 20,195                     | 3,083                                        | 2,551                                        | 23,505                       | 22,746                       |\n| Loans held-for-sale                                | 4,338                      | 6,112                      | 4,904                                        | 3,729                                        | 9,242                        | 9,841                        |\n| Operating leases                                   | 5,312                      | 5,509                      | -                                            | -                                            | 5,312                        | 5,509                        |\n| Commercial letters of credit                       | 943                        | 973                        | 232                                          | 28                                           | 1,175                        | 1,001                        |\n| Other                                              | 846                        | 698                        | -                                            | -                                            | 846                          | 698                          |\n| Total                                              | $ 696,299                  | $  704,867                 | $ 517,813                                    | $  495,346                                   | $ 1,214,112                  | $  1,200,213                 |\n\nNonperforming commercial loans increased $1.7 billion during 2023, primarily in commercial real estate.

Non-U.S. commercial  loans  remained  largely unchanged during 2023. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased  $878  million, or 33  percent, due  to  upgrades  and sales  of Russian  exposure. For information  on  the  non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 122.\n\n## Commercial Real Estate\n\nCommercial  real  estate  primarily includes  commercial  loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the  sale  or lease  of the  real  estate  as  the  primary source  of repayment. Outstanding  loans  increased  $3.1  billion, or four percent, during  2023  to  $72.9  billion with  increases  across multiple property types. The commercial real estate portfolio is primarily managed  in Global  Banking and  consists  of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real  estate  firms. The  portfolio  remains  diversified  across property types  and  geographic regions. California  represented the largest state concentration at 20 percent and 19 percent of commercial real estate at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nReservable criticized utilized exposure increased $3.5 billion, or 68  percent, during  2023, primarily driven  by office  loans.\n\nOffice loans represented the largest property type concentration at 25  percent of the  commercial  real  estate  portfolio  at December 31, 2023, but only represented  approximately two percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and had an origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent. Although we have seen collateral value declines in this property type, the majority of these loans remained adequately secured as of December 31, 2023.\n\nReservable  criticized  exposure  for the  office  property type was  $5.5  billion  at December 31, 2023, and  approximately $7.6 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2024.\n\nDuring  2023 and 2022, we continued to see relatively low default rates. We  use  a  number of proactive  risk  mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures  for management by independent special  asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.\n\nTable 32 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location  of the collateral, and by property type.\n\nTable 32 Outstanding Commercial Real Estate Loans\n\n|                                                | December 31   | December 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                          | 2023          | 2022          |\n| By Geographic Region                           |               |               |\n| Northeast                                      | $ 15,920      | $  15,601     |\n| California                                     | 14,551        | 13,360        |\n| Southwest                                      | 9,318         | 8,723         |\n| Southeast                                      | 8,368         | 7,713         |\n| Florida                                        | 4,986         | 5,374         |\n| Illinois                                       | 3,361         | 3,327         |\n| Midwest                                        | 3,149         | 3,419         |\n| Midsouth                                       | 2,785         | 2,716         |\n| Northwest                                      | 2,095         | 1,959         |\n| Non-U.S.                                       | 6,052         | 5,518         |\n| Other                                          | 2,293         | 2,056         |\n| Total outstanding commercial real estate loans | $ 72,878      | $  69,766     |\n| By Property Type                               |               |               |\n| Non-residential                                |               |               |\n| Office                                         | $ 17,976      | $  18,230     |\n| Industrial / Warehouse                         | 14,746        | 13,775        |\n| Multi-family rental                            | 10,606        | 10,412        |\n| Shopping centers / Retail                      | 5,756         | 5,830         |\n| Hotel / Motels                                 | 5,665         | 5,696         |\n| Multi-use                                      | 2,681         | 2,403         |\n| Other                                          | 14,201        | 12,241        |\n| Total non-residential                          | 71,631        | 68,587        |\n| Residential                                    | 1,247         | 1,179         |\n| Total outstanding commercial real estate loans | $ 72,878      | $  69,766     |",

PPP  loans decreased $679 million primarily due to repayment of the loans by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the terms of the  program. Excluding  PPP, credit card-related  products  were 54  percent and  53  percent of the  U.S. small  business commercial  portfolio  at December 31, 2023  and  2022  and represented 99 percent of the net charge-offs compared to 100 percent for 2022. Accruing past due 90 days or more decreased $171  million  in  2023  driven  by the  repayment of PPP  loans, which are fully guaranteed by the SBA.\n\n## Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity\n\nTable 33 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and  foreclosed  properties  activity during  2023  and  2022. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the  fair value  option. During  2023, nonperforming  commercial loans  and  leases  increased  $1.7  billion  to  $2.8  billion. At December 31, 2023, 96 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured, and 62 percent were  contractually current. Commercial  nonperforming loans  were  carried  at 89  percent of their unpaid  principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.\n\n## Table 33 Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1, 2)\n\nTable  34  presents  commercial  committed  and  utilized  credit exposure  by industry.

Total  commercial  committed  exposure increased  $13.9  billion  during  2023  to  $1.2  trillion. The increase  in  commercial  committed  exposure  was  concentrated in  Capital goods, Finance companies and Asset managers and funds.\n\nIndustry limits  are  used  internally to  manage  industry concentrations  and  are  based  on  committed  exposure  that is determined on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring.\n\nAsset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration  with  committed  exposure  of $169.3  billion, increased  $4.2  billion, primarily driven  by exposure  to  the Capital markets industry group during 2023.\n\nReal estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed  exposure  of $100.3  billion remained  relatively unchanged  during  2023. For more  information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management - Commercial Real Estate on page 119.\n\nCapital  goods, our third  largest industry concentration  with committed exposure of $97.0 billion, increased $9.7 billion, or 11 percent, during 2023. The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in Trading companies and  distributors  as  well  as  Machinery, partially offset by a decrease in Industrial conglomerates.\n\nThe impact of various macroeconomic challenges, including geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures  and  elevated interest rates, may lead  to  uncertainty in  the  U.S. and  global economies, and may adversely impact a number of industries. We  continue  to  monitor all  industries, particularly higher risk industries  that are  experiencing  or could  experience  a  more significant impact to their financial condition.",

To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we  may add  credit exposure  within  an  industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded  and  unfunded  exposures  for which  we  elected  the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $10.9 billion and $9.0 billion. We recorded net losses of $185 million in 2023 compared to net losses of $37 million in 2022. The gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option  portfolio  information  in  Table  41. For more information, see Trading Risk Management on page 128.\n\nTables  35  and  36  present the  maturity profiles  and  the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n|                                                             | December 31   | December 31   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                             | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Less than or equal to one year                              | 36 %          | 14 %          |\n| Greater than one year and less than or equal  to five years | 64            | 85            |\n| Greater than five years                                     | -             | 1             |\n| Total net credit default protection                         | 100 %         | 100 %         |",

We  execute  the majority of our credit derivative  trades  in  the  OTC  market with large, multinational  financial  institutions, including  brokerdealers  and, to  a  lesser degree, with  a  variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to  credit risk  in  the  event that these  counterparties  fail  to perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased  credit default protection. In  most cases, credit derivative  transactions  are  executed  on  a  daily margin  basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate  rating  level, or a  breach  of credit covenants  would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all\n\ntrades. For more  information  on  credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk  valuation  adjustments, see Note  3  Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n\n## Non-U.S. Portfolio\n\nOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political  conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes  in government policies. A risk management framework  is  in  place  to  measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk  and  exposures. In  addition  to  the  direct risk  of doing  business  in  a  country, we  also  are  exposed  to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured  financing  transactions  or related  to  client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance.\n\nNon-U.S. exposure  is  presented  on  an  internal  risk management basis  and  includes  sovereign  and  non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.\n\nFunded  loans  and  loan  equivalents  include  loans, leases, and  other extensions  of credit and  funds, including  letters  of credit and  due  from placements. Unfunded  commitments  are the  undrawn portion  of legally binding  commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the  fair value  of derivatives, including  the  counterparty risk associated  with  credit default swaps  (CDS), and  secured financing  transactions. Securities  and  other investments  are carried  at fair value  and  long  securities  exposures  are  netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure  represents  country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.",

The  increase  in  the  allowance reflected a reserve build in our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by a reserve  release  in  our commercial  portfolio  primarily driven  by improved macroeconomic conditions applicable to the\n\ncommercial portfolio. The allowance also includes the impact of the accounting change  to  remove  the  recognition  and measurement guidance  on  troubled  debt restructurings, which reduced  the  allowance  for credit losses  by $243  million  on January 1, 2023. For more  information  on  this  change  in accounting  guidance, see Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTable 39 presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Table 39 Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses by Product Type\n\nTable  40 presents  a  rollforward  of the  allowance  for credit losses, including certain loan and allowance ratios for 2023 and 2022.

The  provision  for credit losses increased $1.9 billion to $4.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The provision for credit losses in 2023 was driven by our consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by improved  macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited our commercial portfolio. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending\n\ncommitments, decreased $628 million to a $133 million benefit for 2023 compared to 2022. The decline was due primarily to an improved macroeconomic outlook.",

For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 131.\n\nOur traditional  banking  loan  and  deposit products  are  nontrading  positions  and  are  generally reported  at amortized  cost for assets  or the  amount owed  for liabilities  (historical  cost). However, these  positions  are  still  subject to  changes  in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading  positions  arising  from changes  in  interest rates  is managed  through  our ALM activities. We  have  elected  to account for certain  assets  and  liabilities  under the  fair value option.\n\nOur trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected  in  income. Trading  positions  are  subject to  various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets  and  liabilities  could  change  due  to  market liquidity, correlations across  markets  and  expectations  of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  Trading  Risk  Management section.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk  policy, developing  and  maintaining  quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and  monitoring  position  limits  consistent with  risk  appetite, conducting  daily reviews  and  analysis  of trading  inventory, approving  material  risk  exposures  and  fulfilling  regulatory requirements. Market risks  that impact businesses  outside  of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.\n\nModel  risk  is  the  potential  for adverse  consequences  from decisions  based  on  incorrect or misused  model  outputs  and reports. Given  that models  are  used  across  the  Corporation, model  risk  impacts  all  risk  types  including  credit, market and operational  risks. The  Enterprise  Model  Risk  Policy defines model risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and risk  appetite, prevailing  regulatory guidance  and  industry best practice. All  models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model, independent model  testing  and  ongoing  monitoring through  outcomes  analysis  and  benchmarking. The  Enterprise Model Risk Committee, a subcommittee of the MRC, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate  risk  represents  exposures  to  instruments  whose values  vary with  the  level  or volatility of interest rates. These instruments  include, but are  not limited  to, loans, debt\n\nsecurities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to  mitigate  these  risks  include  derivatives  such  as  options, futures, forwards and swaps.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future  cash  flows  in  foreign  currencies  arising  from foreign exchange  transactions, foreign  currency-denominated  debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging  instruments  used  to  mitigate this  risk  include  foreign  exchange  options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and  foreign  currency-denominated  debt and deposits.\n\n## Mortgage Risk\n\nMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation  and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several  forms. For example, we  trade  and  engage  in  marketmaking  activities  in  a  variety of mortgage  securities  including whole  loans, pass-through  certificates, commercial  mortgages and  collateralized  mortgage  obligations  including  collateralized debt obligations  using  mortgages  as  underlying  collateral. In addition, we  originate  a  variety of MBS, which  involves  the accumulation  of mortgage-related  loans  in  anticipation  of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities  and  residential  mortgage  loans  as  part of the  ALM portfolio. We  also  record  MSRs  as  part of our mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk  include  derivatives  such  as  options, swaps, futures  and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For more  information, see  Mortgage  Banking  Risk Management on page 133.\n\n## Equity Market Risk\n\nEquity market risk  represents  exposures  to  securities  that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and  foreign  common  stock  or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments  that would  lead  to  this  exposure include, but are  not limited  to, the  following: common  stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible  bonds, listed  equity options  (puts  and  calls), OTC equity options, equity total  return  swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.\n\n## Commodity Risk\n\nCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the  petroleum, natural  gas, power and metals markets. These instruments  consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps  and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures  and  swaps  in  the  same  or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.",

        "page_content": "## Issuer Credit Risk\n\nIssuer credit risk  represents  exposures  to  changes  in  the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be  adversely impacted  by changes  in  the  levels  of credit spreads, by credit migration  or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.\n\n## Market Liquidity Risk\n\nMarket liquidity risk  represents  the  risk  that the  level  of expected  market activity changes  dramatically and, in  certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be  able  to  transact business  and  execute  trades  in  an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations  are  compromised  by disproportionate  demand  or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating  techniques  as  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Trading Risk Management.\n\n## Trading Risk Management\n\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and  potential  volatility of revenues  generated  by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and  procedures  are  utilized  to  enable  the  most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in  interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and  hypothetical  market moves, such  as  VaR  and  stress testing. Periods  of extreme  market stress  influence  the reliability of these  techniques  to  varying  degrees. Qualitative evaluations  of market risk  utilize  the  suite  of quantitative  risk measures  while  understanding  each  of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk  managers  independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows  the  aggregation  of market risk  factors, including  the effects  of portfolio  diversification. A  VaR  model  simulates  the value  of a  portfolio  under a  range  of scenarios  in  order to generate  a  distribution  of potential  gains  and  losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical  data. We  use  one  VaR  model  consistently across  the  trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is  equivalent to  a  99  percent confidence  level, which  means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses  in  excess  of VaR, on  average, 99  out of 100  trading days.\n\nWithin  any VaR  model, there  are  significant and  numerous assumptions  that will  differ from company to  company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR  model  may require  additional  modeling  assumptions  for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are  not consistently available. For positions  with  insufficient historical  data  for the  VaR  calculation, the  process  for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and\n\nstatistical  analysis  of the  new  product or less  liquid  position. This  analysis  identifies  reasonable  alternatives  that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\n\nVaR  may not be  indicative  of realized  revenue  volatility as changes  in  market conditions  or in  the  composition  of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical  data  used  for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels  of portfolio  diversification  than  will  be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we  update  the  historical  data  underlying  our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the  model. A  minor portion  of risks  related  to  our trading positions  is  not included  in  VaR. These risks  are  reviewed  as part of our ICAAP. For more  information  regarding  ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 101.\n\nGRM continually reviews, evaluates  and  enhances  our VaR model  so  that it reflects  the  material  risks  in  our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.\n\nTrading  limits  on  quantitative  risk  measures, including  VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed  on  a  regular basis  so  that trading  limits  remain relevant and  within  our overall  risk  appetite  for market risks. Trading  limits  are  reviewed  in  the  context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as  well  as  at aggregated portfolios  to  account for correlations among  risk  factors. All  trading  limits  are  approved  at least annually. Approved  trading  limits  are  stored  and  tracked  in  a centralized  limits  management system. Trading  limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative  market risk  measures  and  corresponding  limits have  been  identified  as  critical  in  the  Corporation's  Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates  daily to  discuss  losses, key risk  positions  and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable  41  presents  the  total  market-based  portfolio  VaR, which  is  the  combination  of the  total  covered  positions  (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered  covered  positions, except for structural  foreign currency positions  that are  excluded  with  prior regulatory approval.\n\nIn  addition, Table  41 presents  the  VaR  for the  fair value option  portfolio, which  includes  substantially all  of the  funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and  their corresponding  hedges. Market risk  VaR  for trading activities, as presented in Table 41, differs from VaR used for regulatory capital  calculations  due  to  the  holding  period  used.",

Both measures utilize  the  same  process and methodology.\n\nThe  total  market-based  portfolio  VaR  results  in  Table  41 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.\n\nTable  41  presents  year-end, average, high  and  low  daily trading VaR for 2023 and 2022 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 41 and Table 42 align to\n\nthe  view  of covered  positions  used  in  the  Basel  3  capital calculations. Foreign  exchange  and  commodity positions  are always  considered  covered  positions, regardless  of trading  or banking  treatment for the  trade, except for structural  foreign currency positions  that are  excluded  with  prior regulatory approval.\n\nThe annual average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for 2023 decreased compared to 2022, primarily due  to  the  roll  off of March  2020  market volatility from the  window  of historical  data  used  in  the calibration of the VaR model.\n\nTable 41 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities\n\n|                                                                     | 2023     | 2023    | 2023      | 2023     | 2022     | 2022    | 2022     | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|----------|---------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                               | Year End | Average | High  (1) | Low  (1) | Year End | Average | High (1) | Low (1) |\n| Foreign exchange                                                    | $  29    | $  29   | $  43     | $  12    | $  38    | $  21   | $  39    | $  12   |\n| Interest rate                                                       | 51       | 48      | 86        | 32       | 36       | 36      | 56       | 24      |\n| Credit                                                              | 53       | 60      | 108       | 43       | 76       | 71      | 106      | 52      |\n| Equity                                                              | 9        | 18      | 56        | 9        | 18       | 20      | 33       | 12      |\n| Commodities                                                         | 9        | 9       | 14        | 6        | 8        | 13      | 27       | 7       |\n| Portfolio diversification                                           | (90)     | (100)   | n/a       | n/a      | (81)     | (91)    | n/a      | n/a     |\n| Total covered positions portfolio                                   | 61       | 64      | 92        | 41       | 95       | 70      | 140      | 42      |\n| Impact from less liquid exposures  (2)                              | 12       | 20      | n/a       | n/a      | 35       | 38      | n/a      | n/a     |\n| Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio | 73       | 84      | 149       | 52       | 130      | 108     | 236      | 61      |\n| Fair value option loans                                             | 16       | 25      | 49        | 14       | 48       | 51      | 65       | 37      |\n| Fair value option hedges                                            | 11       | 14      | 20        | 9        | 16       | 17      | 24       | 13      |\n| Fair value option portfolio diversification                         | (12)     | (23)    | n/a       | n/a      | (38)     | (36)    | n/a      | n/a     |\n| Total fair value option portfolio                                   | 15       | 16      | 30        | 10       | 26       | 32      | 44       | 23      |\n| Portfolio diversification                                           | (9)      | (8)     | n/a       | n/a      | 9        | (11)    | n/a      | n/a     |\n| Total market-based portfolio                                        | $  79    | $  92   | 173       | 58       | $  165   | $  129  | 287      | 70      |\n\nThe following graph presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for 2023, corresponding to the data in Table 41.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A  backtesting  excess  occurs  when  a  trading  loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the VaR  methodology accurately represents  those  losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting  excesses  observed  can  differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed  during  the  three  years  of historical  data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nThe  trading  revenue  used  for backtesting  is  defined  by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the  regulatory capital  calculation. This  revenue differs  from total  trading-related  revenue  in  that it excludes revenue  from trading  activities  that either do  not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues.\n\nWe  conduct daily backtesting  on  the  VaR  results  used  for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions  and  risk  factors. These  results  are\n\nreported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews  and  evaluates  the  results  of these tests.\n\nDuring  2023, there  were  no  days  where  this  subset of trading  revenue  had  losses  that exceeded  our total  covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.\n\n## Total Trading-related Revenue\n\nTotal  trading-related  revenue, excluding  brokerage  fees, and CVA, DVA  and  funding  valuation  adjustment gains  (losses), represents  the  total  amount earned  from trading  positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more information on fair value, see Note 20  -  Fair Value Measurements to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, tradingrelated  revenue  is  dependent on  the  volume  and  type  of transactions, the  level  of risk  assumed, and  the  volatility of price  and  rate  movements  at any given  time  within  the  everchanging  market environment. Significant daily revenue  by business  is  monitored  and  the  primary drivers  of these  are reviewed.\n\nThe  following  histogram is  a  graphic depiction  of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2023  and  2022. During  2023, positive  trading-related revenue  was  recorded  for 100 percent of the  trading  days, of which 93 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This  compares  to  2022  where  positive  trading-related  revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the  trading  days, of which  90 percent were  daily trading  gains  of over $25  million, and  the largest loss was $9 million.",

This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal  market movements.\n\nA  set of scenarios, categorized  as  either historical  or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and  individual  businesses. These  scenarios  include  shocks  to underlying  market risk  factors  that may be  well  beyond  the shocks  found  in  the  historical  data  used  to  calculate  VaR. Historical  scenarios  simulate  the  impact of the  market moves that occurred  during  a  period  of extended  historical  market stress. Generally, a  multi-week  period  representing  the  most severe  point during  a  crisis  is  selected  for each  historical scenario. Hypothetical  scenarios  provide  estimated  portfolio impacts from potential  future  market stress  events. Scenarios are  reviewed  and  updated  in  response  to  changing  positions and new economic or political  information. In  addition, new or ad  hoc scenarios  are  developed  to  address  specific potential market events  or particular vulnerabilities  in  the  portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.\n\nStress  testing  for the  trading  portfolio  is  integrated  with enterprise-wide  stress  testing  and  incorporated  into  the  limits framework. The  macroeconomic scenarios  used  for enterprisewide  stress  testing  purposes  differ from the  typical  trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the  results  are  forecasted  over multiple  periods  for use  in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 98.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book\n\nThe  following  discussion  presents  net interest income  for banking book activities.\n\nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is  measured  as  the  potential  change  in  net interest income caused  by movements  in  market interest rates. Client-facing\n\nactivities, primarily lending  and  deposit-taking, create  interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business  growth, ALM positioning  and  the  future  direction  of interest rate  movements  as  implied  by market-based  forward curves.\n\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income  forecast is  frequently updated  for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our banking  book  balance  sheet position  in  order to maintain  an  acceptable  level  of exposure  to  interest rate changes.\n\nThe  interest rate  scenarios  that we  analyze  incorporate balance  sheet assumptions  such  as  loan  and  deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall  goal  is  to  manage  interest rate  risk  so  that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.\n\nTable  43 presents  the  spot and  12-month  forward  rates used  in  our baseline  forecasts  at December 31, 2023  and 2022.\n\n## Table 43 Forward Rates\n\nTable 44 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2023 and\n\n|                        | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                        | Federal Funds       | SOFR  (1)           | 10-Year SOFR  (1)   |\n| Spot rates             | 5.50 %              | 5.38 %              | 3.47 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 3.89                | 3.93                | 3.32                |\n|                        | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|                        | Federal Funds       | Three-month LIBOR   | 10-Year Swap        |\n| Spot rates             | 4.50 %              | 4.77 %              | 3.84 %              |\n| 12-month forward rates | 4.75                | 4.78                | 3.62                |",

Periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the  context of the  current rate  environment. The  interest rate scenarios also assume U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at zero.\n\nDuring 2023, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to higher and lower rate scenarios was primarily due  to  changes  in  deposit product mix and  ALM portfolio activity. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the  short end  of the  yield  curve. Additionally, higher interest rates  negatively impact the  fair value  of our debt securities  classified  as  available  for sale  and  adversely affect accumulated  OCI and  thus  capital  levels  under the  Basel  3 capital  rules. Under instantaneous  upward  parallel  shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities.

As  part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate  and  foreign  exchange  derivatives  in  managing interest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis  in  Table  44  assumes  no  change  in  deposit portfolio size  or mix from the  baseline  forecast in  alternate  rate environments. In  higher rate  scenarios, the  increase  in  net interest income  would  be  impacted  by any customer activity resulting  in  the  replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding, as our benefit in those scenarios would be reduced. Conversely, in lower-rate scenarios, any customer activity that results in the replacement of higher yielding deposits or market-based funding with  low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits would reduce our exposure in those scenarios.\n\nFor interest rate scenarios larger than 100 bps shifts, it is expected  that the  interest rate  sensitivity will  illustrate  nonlinear behaviors  as  there  are  numerous  estimates  and\n\nassumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated, that could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed  securities  and  residential  mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would  generally be  an  increase  in  customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income, noting  that the  extent of changes  in  customer prepayment activity can  be  impacted  by multiple  factors  and  is  not necessarily limited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if longend  interest rates  were  to  significantly increase  over the  next twelve months, for example, over 200  bps, customer prepayments  would  likely modestly decrease  and  result in  an incremental increase to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing  will  have  non-linear impacts  to  larger short-end  rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios, and particularly where  interest rates  have  decreased  to  small amounts, the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates  near zero. In  higher short-end  rate  scenarios, deposit pricing  will  likely increase  at a  faster rate, leading  to incremental  interest expense  and  reducing  asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis  can  provide  directional  analysis  on how  net interest income  will  be  impacted  in  changing environments, the  ultimate  impact is  dependent upon  the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios.\n\n## Interest Rate  and  Foreign  Exchange  Derivative Contracts\n\nWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in  our ALM activities  to  manage  our interest rate  and  foreign exchange  risks. Specifically, we  use  those  derivatives  to manage both  the  variability in  cash  flows  and  changes  in  fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps  tied  to  various  benchmark  interest rates  and  foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign  exchange  contracts  include  cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign  currency futures  contracts, foreign  currency forward contracts and options.\n\nThe derivatives used in our ALM activities  can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk  management derivatives. Designated  accounting  hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 44. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange  risk  of our foreign  operations, the  Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\n\nRisk  management derivatives  are  predominantly used  to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated  assets  and  liabilities  and  eliminate  substantially all foreign  currency exposures  in  the  cash  flows  of the Corporation's non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk  exposures  such  as  cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are not a significant component of these  foreign  exchange derivatives, the  market risk  related  to  this  exposure  is  not significant. For more  information  on  the  accounting  for derivatives, see Note  3  -  Derivatives to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Mortgage Banking Risk Management\n\nWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to  credit, liquidity and  interest rate  risks, among  others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks  by selling  or securitizing  a  portion  of the  loans  we originate.\n\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates  also  impact the  value  of interest rate  lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale between the date of the IRLC and the date the  loans  are  sold  to  the  secondary market. An  increase  in mortgage  interest rates  typically leads  to  a  decrease  in  the value  of these  instruments. Conversely, when  there  is  an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one  overall  hedged  item with  one  combined  economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.\n\nDuring 2023, 2022, and 2021 we recorded gains of $127 million, $78  million  and  $39  million. For more  information  on MSRs, see Note  20  -  Fair Value  Measurements to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Compliance and Operational Risk Management\n\nCompliance  risk  is  the  risk  of legal  or regulatory sanctions, material  financial  loss  or damage  to  the  reputation  of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal  policies  and  procedures  (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). We are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the  U.S. and the laws of the  various  jurisdictions  in  which  we operate, including  those  related  to  financial  crimes  and  antimoney laundering, market conduct, trading  activities, fair lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and includes legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces a number of key operational  risks  including  third-party risk, model  risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. Operational  risk  can  result in financial  losses  and reputational  impacts  and  is  a  component in  the  calculation  of total  RWA  used  in  the  Basel  3  capital  calculation. For more information  on  Basel  3  calculations, see  Capital  Management on page 101.\n\nFLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible  for managing  all  aspects  of their businesses, including  their compliance  and  operational  risk. FLUs  and control  functions  are  required  to  understand  their business processes  and  related  risks  and  controls, including  third-party dependencies  and  the  related  regulatory requirements, and monitor and  report on  the  effectiveness  of the  control environment. In  order to  actively monitor and  assess  the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance  activities  and  identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere  to  compliance  and operational  risk  appetite  limits  to  meet strategic, capital  and\n\nfinancial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions are  responsible  for the  proactive  identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the Corporation. Collectively, these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption.\n\nGlobal Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business  activities  and  processes  and  evaluate  FLUs  and control  functions  for adherence  to  applicable  laws, rules  and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting on  the  state  of the  control  environment. Corporate  Audit provides  an  independent assessment and  validation  through testing  of key compliance  and  operational  risk  processes  and controls across the Corporation.\n\nThe Corporation's Global Compliance - Enterprise Policy and Operational  Risk  Management -  Enterprise  Policy set the requirements  for reporting  compliance  and  operational  risk information  to  executive  management as  well  as  the  Board  or appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global Compliance and Operational Risk's responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the Corporation's compliance  and  operational  risk  management activities. The Board  provides  oversight of compliance  risk  through  its  Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\n## Risk Management and Strategy\n\nCybersecurity is  a  key operational  risk  facing  the  Corporation. We, our employees, customers, regulators and third parties are ongoing targets of an increasing number of cybersecurity threats and  cyberattacks  and, accordingly, the  Corporation  devotes considerable resources to the establishment and maintenance of processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risk  through  its  global  workforce  and  24/7  cyber operations  centers  around  the  world. The  Corporation  takes  a cross-functional approach to addressing cybersecurity risk, with our Global  Technology, Global  Risk  Management, Legal  and Corporate  Audit functions  playing  key roles. In  addition, the Corporation's  processes  related  to  cybersecurity risk  are  an element of and integrated with the Corporation's comprehensive risk program, including our risk framework. For more information on  the  Corporation's  Cybersecurity risk, see  Item 1A. Risk Factors  of our 2023  Annual  Report on  Form 10-K. For more information on our approach to risk management, including our risk management governance framework, see Managing Risk on page 98.\n\nAs  part of the  Corporation's  overall  risk  management program, the  Corporation's  Global  Information  Security (GIS) Program is supported by three lines of defense. As the first line of defense, the  GIS  team is  responsible  for the  day-to-day management of the  GIS  Program, which  includes  defining policies and procedures designed to safeguard the Corporation's  information  systems  and  the  information  those systems  collect, process, maintain, use, share, disseminate and  dispose  of. As  the  second  line  of defense, Global Compliance  and  Operational  Risk  independently assesses, monitors and tests cybersecurity risk across the Corporation, as well as the effectiveness of the GIS Program. As the third line of defense, Corporate  Audit conducts  additional  independent review and validation of the first-line and second-line processes and functions.\n\nThe  Corporation  seeks  to  mitigate  cybersecurity risk  and associated  legal, financial, reputational, operational  and/or regulatory risks  by employing  a  multi-faceted  GIS  Program,",

        "page_content": "through  various  policies, procedures  and  playbooks, that are focused  on  governing, preparing  for, identifying, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding  to  and  recovering  from cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity incidents suffered by the Corporation  and  its  third-party service  providers, as  well  as effectively operating the Corporation's processes. Our business continuity policy, standards  and  procedures  are  designed  to maintain  the  availability of business  functions  and  enable impacted units within the Corporation and its third-party service providers  to  achieve  strategic objectives  in  the  event of a cybersecurity incident. In  accordance  with  the  Corporation's cyber incident response  framework, GIS, including  its  incident response  team, tracks, documents, responds  to  and  analyzes cybersecurity threats  and  cybersecurity incidents, including those  experienced  by the  Corporation's  third-party service providers  that may impact the  Corporation. Additionally, the Corporation  has  a  process  for assembling  multi-stakeholder executive  response  teams  to  monitor and  coordinate  crossfunctional responses to certain cybersecurity incidents.\n\nAs part of the GIS Program, the Corporation leverages both internal  and  external  assessments  and  partnerships  with industry leaders. The Corporation engages third-party assessors, consultants, auditors  and  other third-party professionals  to evaluate  and  test its cybersecurity program and  provide guidance on operating and improving the GIS Program, including the  design  and  operational  effectiveness  of the  security and resiliency of our information systems.\n\nThe Corporation focuses on and has processes to oversee cybersecurity risk associated with its third-party service providers. As  part of its cybersecurity risk management processes, the Corporation maintains an enterprise-wide program that defines  standards  for the  planning, sourcing, management, and  oversight of third-party relationships  and third-party access  to  its  information  system, facilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data. The Corporation has established security requirements applicable to third-party service providers, and  where  permitted  by contract, cybersecurity diligence  is conducted  to  assess  the  alignment of third-party service providers' cybersecurity programs  with the Corporation's cybersecurity requirements.\n\nWhile we and our third parties have experienced cybersecurity incidents, as well  as  adverse  impacts  from such incidents, we  have  not experienced  material  losses  or other material  consequences  relating  to  cybersecurity incidents experienced by us  or our third  parties. However, we expect to continue  to  experience  cybersecurity incidents  resulting  in adverse  impacts  with  increased  frequency and  severity due  to the evolving threat environment, and there can be no assurance that future cybersecurity incidents, including incidents experienced  by our third  parties, will  not have  a  material adverse  impact on  the  Corporation, including  its  business strategy, results of operations and/or financial condition.\n\n## Governance\n\nThrough established governance structures, the Corporation has policies, processes and practices to help facilitate oversight of cybersecurity risk. In accordance with these policies, processes and  practices, the  Corporation's  three  lines  of defense, and management, strive  to  prepare  for, identify, prevent, detect, mitigate, respond to and recover from cybersecurity threats and incidents, monitor performance, and  escalate  to  executive management, the committees of the Corporation's Board and/ or to  the  Board, as  appropriate. Additionally, GIS  reports cybersecurity incidents  that meet certain  criteria  to  the  Legal Department for further escalation and evaluation for materiality\n\nand  potential  disclosure, which  includes  the  consideration  of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\nThe  Board  is  actively engaged  in  the  oversight of the  GIS Program and  devotes  considerable  time  and  attention  to  the oversight and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. The Board, which includes members with technology and cybersecurity experience, oversees  management's  approach  to  staffing, policies, processes and practices to address cybersecurity risk. The  Board  and  its  ERC, which  is  responsible  for reviewing cybersecurity risk, each receive regular presentations, memoranda  and  reports  throughout the  year from our Chief Technology and  Information  Officer (CTIO) and  our Chief Information  Security Officer (CISO) on  internal  and  external cybersecurity developments, threats  and  risks. On  a  quarterly basis, GIS sends the Board a memorandum highlighting relevant cybersecurity developments  and  a  document detailing  the performance metrics for the GIS Program.\n\nThe  Board  receives  prompt and  timely information  from management on cybersecurity incidents, including cybersecurity incidents  experienced  by the  Corporation's  third-party service providers, that may pose significant risk to the Corporation, and continues to receive regular reports on any such incidents until their conclusion. Additionally, the  Board  receives  quarterly reports  on  the  performance  of the  Corporation's  cybersecurity risk  appetite  metrics, including  metrics  on  vulnerabilities  and third-party cybersecurity risks  and  incidents  and  is  notified promptly if a Board-level cybersecurity risk limit is breached.\n\nOur ERC  also  annually reviews  and  approves  our GIS Program and  our Information  Security Policy, which  establish administrative, technical, and  physical  safeguards  designed  to protect the  security, confidentiality and  integrity of customer records  and  information  in  accordance  with  the  Gramm-LeachBliley Act and the interagency guidelines issued thereunder, and applicable laws globally.\n\nUnder the Board's oversight, management works closely with key stakeholders, including  regulators, government agencies, law  enforcement, peer institutions  and  industry groups, and develops  and  invests  in  talent and  innovative  technology in order to better manage cybersecurity risk.\n\nOur most senior cybersecurity employees are the CTIO and CISO, who are primarily responsible for managing and assessing cybersecurity risk. The  CISO  oversees  a  team of more  than 3,000  information  security professionals  spanning  the  globe. The CISO and the GIS senior leadership team of ten individuals have  deep  cybersecurity expertise, with  over 100  years  of collective experience working in the cybersecurity field, both at the  Corporation  and  other companies  in  various  industries. Additionally, certain  members of the GIS leadership team hold leadership roles in sector-specific information and infrastructure security organizations, including the Financial Services Information  Sharing  and  Analysis  Center and  the  Financial Services  Sector Coordinating  Council. Employees  across  the Corporation also play a role in protecting the Corporation from cybersecurity threats and receive periodic training and education on cybersecurity-related topics.\n\n## Reputational Risk Management\n\nReputational  risk  is  the  risk  that negative  perception  of the Corporation  may adversely impact profitability or operations. Reputational  risk  may result from many of the  Corporation's activities, including  those  related  to  the  management of strategic, operational, compliance, liquidity, market (price  and interest rate) and credit risks.\n\nThe Corporation manages reputational risk through established  policies  and  controls  embedded  throughout its",

        "page_content": "business  and  risk  management processes. We  proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner. If reputational  risk  events  occur, we  focus  on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage  to  the  Corporation's  reputation. The  Corporation  has processes  and  procedures  in  place  to  respond  to  events  that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations  that influence  public opinion, and  implementing communication strategies to mitigate the risk. The Corporation's organization  and  governance  structure  provides  oversight of reputational  risks. Reputational  risk  reporting  is  provided regularly and directly to senior management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Legal and  Risk, that is  responsible  for the  oversight of reputational risk, including  approval  for business  activities  that present elevated levels of reputational risks.\n\n## Climate Risk\n\n## Climate Risk Management\n\nClimate risk is the risk that climate change or actions taken to mitigate  climate  change  expose  the  Corporation  to  economic, operational  or reputational  harm. Climate-related  risks  are divided into two major categories, both of which span across the seven key risk  types  discussed in Managing Risk on page 98: (1) Physical Risk: risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven  by extreme  weather events  such  as  hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) Transition Risk: risks  related  to  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes.\n\nPhysical risks of climate change, such as more frequent and severe extreme weather events, can increase the Corporation's risks, including credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or collateral values, and operational risk by negatively impacting  the  Corporation's  facilities, employees, or vendors. Transition  risks  of climate  change  may amplify credit risks through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or our counterparties. Unanticipated  market changes  can  lead  to  sudden  price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk. Reputational risk can arise if we do not meet our climate-related commitments and/or goals, or are perceived to be inadequately responsive to climate change or otherwise.\n\nOur approach to managing climate risk is consistent with our risk management governance structure, from senior management to  our Board  and  its  committees, including  the ERC  and  the  Corporate  Governance, ESG  and  Sustainability Committee  (CGESC) of the  Board, which  regularly discuss climate-related  topics. The  ERC  oversees  climate  risk  as  set forth  in  our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement. The CGESC  is  responsible for overseeing the Corporation's environmental  and  social  sustainability-related  activities  and practices, and regularly reviews the Corporation's climate-related work and policies. The Climate Risk Council consists of leaders across  risk, FLU and control  functions, and meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks.\n\nOur climate  risk  management efforts  are  overseen  by an officer who reports to the CRO. The Corporation  has a Climate and Environmental Risk Management function that is responsible  for overseeing  climate  risk  management. They are responsible  for establishing  the  Climate  Risk  Framework  and\n\ngovernance  structure, and  providing  independent assessment and challenge of enterprise-wide climate risks.\n\nBased  on  the  Corporation's  Risk  Framework, in  2023  we created our internal  Climate  Risk  Framework, which addresses how the Corporation identifies, measures, monitors and controls climate risk by enhancing existing risk management processes and  also  includes  examples  of how  it manifests  across  the seven  risk  types. It details  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for climate risk management across our three lines of defense as noted above.\n\nFor more  information  on  our governance  framework, see Managing  Risk  on  page  98. For more  information  on  climate risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Climate-related Goals and Targets\n\nIn  2021, the  Corporation  committed  to  achieving  net zero greenhouse  gas  emissions  before  2050  in  our financing activities, operations  and  supply chain  (Net Zero  goal), and in 2022, we released our Approach to Zero TM , a framework for how we plan to achieve our Net Zero goal. In line with this approach, we have set interim 2030 targets across our financing activities (2030  Financing  Activity Emissions  Targets), operations  and supply chain, all of which are further supported and complemented  by our $1.5  trillion  sustainable  finance  goal (which  is  aligned  with  the  17  UN  Sustainable  Development Goals) of which  $1  trillion  is  dedicated  to  supporting  the transition  toward  a  low-carbon  economy, including  capital mobilized  across  clean  energy sectors  and  tailored  financial solutions  for emerging  areas  of the  low-carbon  economy. In particular, we  announced  2030  Financing  Activity Emissions Targets  for auto  manufacturing, aviation, cement, energy, and power generation sectors and expect to continue to set targets for other sectors  that are  significant contributors  to  global greenhouse gas emissions and therefore prioritized by us.\n\nAchieving  our climate--related  goals  and  targets, including our Net Zero  goal  and  2030  Financing  Activity Emissions Targets, may require  technological  advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, better emissions data reporting, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as  strong  and  active  engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders. Given  the  extended  period  of these  and  other climate-related  goals  we  have  established, our initiatives  have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein.\n\nFor more  information  on  climate-related  matters  and  the Corporation's climate-related goals and commitments, including plans to achieve its Net Zero goal and 2030 Financing Activity Emissions  Targets  and  progress  on  its  sustainable  finance goals, see  the  Corporation's  website, including  its  2023  Task Force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD) Report. The contents of the Corporation's website, including the 2023 TCFD Report is  not incorporated  by reference  into  this  Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe  foregoing  discussion  and the  statements  on  the Corporations' website, including  in  the  2023  TCFD  Report regarding  its  goals  and  commitments  with  respect to  climate risk management, such as environmental transition considerations, contain 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These  statements  are  not guarantees  of future  results  or performance  and  involve  certain  known  and  unknown  risks, uncertainties  and  assumptions that are  difficult to  predict and",

Actual  outcomes and  results  may differ materially from those  expressed  in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.\n\n## Complex Accounting Estimates\n\nOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting  principles  require  complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have  procedures  and  processes  in  place  to  facilitate  making these judgments.\n\nThe  more  judgmental  estimates  are  summarized  in  the following  discussion. We  have  identified  and  described  the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes  that involve  mathematical  models  to  derive  the estimates. In  many cases, there  are  numerous  alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs  to  the  models. Where alternatives  exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in  developing  the  inputs. Actual  performance  that differs  from our estimates of the  key variables  could  materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value  of our lending  portfolio  and  market-sensitive  assets  and liabilities  may change  subsequent to  the  balance  sheet date, often  significantly, due  to  the  nature  and  magnitude  of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and  in  unforeseen  ways  and  the  resulting volatility could  have  a  significant, negative  effect on  future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and  lease  losses  and  the  reserve  for unfunded  lending commitments. Our process  for determining  the  allowance  for credit losses  is  discussed  in Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant Accounting  Principles and Note  5  -  Outstanding  Loans  and Leases  and  Allowance  for Credit  Losses to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  determination  of the  allowance  for credit losses  is based  on numerous estimates  and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios  that are  incorporated  into  our quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation uses  multiple macroeconomic scenarios  in its ECL calculation, which have included a baseline\n\nscenario  derived  from consensus  estimates, an  adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate  recession, a downside  scenario  reflecting  persistent inflation  and  interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the  severely adverse  scenario  used  in  stress  testing  and  an upside  scenario  that considers  the  potential  for improvement above  the  baseline  scenario. The  overall  economic outlook  is weighted towards a recessionary environment in the first half of 2024, with  lower gross  domestic product (GDP) growth  and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to what we experienced  in  the  prior year. Generally, as  the  consensus estimates  improve  or deteriorate, the  allowance  for credit losses  will  change  in  a  similar direction. There  are  multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, U.S. GDP  and unemployment rates. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.6 percent, 5.0 percent and 4.5 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, and the  weighted  macroeconomic outlook  for U.S. GDP  was forecasted  to  contract 0.4  percent and  grow  1.2  percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the  latest consensus estimates for the  U.S. average  unemployment rate for the  fourth  quarter of 2023 was 3.9 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 2.6 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting  a  tighter labor market and  healthy growth  compared  to  our macroeconomic outlook as  of December 31, 2022, and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of December 31, 2023. In  addition, as  of December 31, 2023, the  weighted  macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 4.9 percent in  the  fourth  quarters  of both 2024 and 2025, and  the  weighted  macroeconomic outlook  for U.S. GDP  was forecasted to grow 0.3 percent and 1.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2025.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  above  judgments  and  estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted  by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial  portfolio, improvement or deterioration  in borrower delinquencies  or credit scores  in  our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which  have  some  degree  of uncertainty. The  allowance  for credit losses  increased  to  $14.6  billion  from $14.2  billion  at December 31, 2022, primarily due  to  a  reserve  build  in  our",

        "page_content": "consumer portfolio driven by credit card loan growth and asset quality, partially offset by a  reserve  release  in  our commercial portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions applicable to the commercial portfolio.\n\nTo provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios  and  other assumptions  on  the estimate  of our allowance  for credit losses, the  Corporation compared  the  December 31, 2023  modeled  ECL  from the baseline  scenario  and  our adverse  scenario. Relative  to  the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak U.S. unemployment rate  of over two  percentage  points  higher than the  baseline  scenario, a  decline  in  U.S. GDP  followed  by a prolonged  recovery and  a  lower home  price  outlook  with  a difference  of approximately 16  percent at the  trough. This sensitivity analysis  resulted  in  a  hypothetical  increase  in  the allowance for credit losses of approximately $3.8 billion.\n\nWhile  the  sensitivity analysis  may be  useful  to  understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the  analysis  does  not incorporate  a  variety of factors, including  qualitative  reserves and  the  weighting  of alternate  scenarios, which  could  have offsetting  effects  on  the  estimate. Considering  the  variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks  such  as  recent economic events, leading  economic indicators, views  of internal  and  third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 is appropriate.\n\n## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder applicable  accounting  standards, we  are  required  to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable  inputs  in  measuring  fair value. We  classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on  the  three-level  fair value  hierarchy in the  accounting standards.\n\nThe  fair values  of assets  and  liabilities  may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations  of products  using  models  or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where  market data  is  available, the  inputs  used  for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to  valuation  models  are  considered  unobservable  if they are supported  by little  or no market activity. In periods of extreme\n\nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value  of assets  and  liabilities, we  have  in  place  various processes and controls that include: a  model  validation  policy that requires  review  and  approval  of quantitative  models  used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk  quantification; a  trading  product valuation  policy that requires  verification  of all  traded  product valuations; and  a periodic review  and  substantiation  of daily profit and  loss reporting  for all  traded  products. Primarily through  validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can  and  do  include  both  market-observable  and  internallymodeled  values  and/or valuation  inputs. Our reliance  on  this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance  applied  to  those  developed  through  their own internal  modeling. For example, broker quotes  in  less  active markets  may only be  indicative  and  therefore  less  reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the  business. For more information, see Note  20  -  Fair Value Measurements and Note  21  -  Fair Value  Option to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\n\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities, and  MSRs, where  values  are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable  and  are  significant to  the  overall  fair value measurement are  classified  as  Level  3  under the  fair value hierarchy established  in  applicable  accounting  standards. The fair value  of these  Level  3  financial  assets  and  liabilities  and MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value  requires  significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with  Level  3  financial  instruments  may be  offset by gains  or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded  in  earnings  did  not have  a  significant impact on  our liquidity or capital. We  conduct a  review  of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3  are  made  if the  significant inputs used in the",

For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2023, 2022 and 2021, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets  or accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities  on  the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, represent the  net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing  jurisdictions  attributable  to  our operations  to  date. We currently file  income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and  consider many factors, including  statutory, judicial  and regulatory guidance, in  estimating  the  appropriate  accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.\n\nNet deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, represent the  net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating  loss  (NOL) and  tax credit carryforwards  and because  of future  reversals  of temporary differences  in  the bases  of assets  and  liabilities  as  measured  by tax laws  and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and  many of these  attributes  can  expire  if not utilized  within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to  reduce  net deferred  tax assets  to  the  amounts  that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nConsistent with  the  applicable  accounting  guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities  and  change  our estimates  of accrued  income  taxes  and/or net deferred  tax assets  due  to changes  in  income  tax laws  and  their interpretation  by the courts  and  regulatory authorities. These  revisions  of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and  from the  resolution  of income  tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.\n\nSee Note 19 - Income Taxes to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements  for a  table  of significant tax attributes  and additional information.

Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are  discussed  in Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant  Accounting Principles and Note  7  -  Goodwill  and  Intangible  Assets to  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Corporation tests its goodwill for impairment on June 30 of each  year or more  frequently if events  or circumstances indicate  a  potential  impairment. We  completed  our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2023, by performing a quantitative  assessment to  compare  the  fair value  of each reporting  unit to  its  carrying  value  as  measured  by allocated equity. Based  on  our assessment, we  have  concluded  that goodwill was not impaired.\n\nThe Corporation chose to perform the quantitative assessment as compared to a qualitative assessment that was performed in the prior year due to the level of interest rates and other market conditions  existing  at June  30, 2023. The quantitative  assessment used  a  combination  of an  income approach  (which  utilizes  the  present value  of cash  flows  to estimate  fair value) and  a  market multiplier approach  (which utilizes observable market prices and  metrics of peer companies to estimate fair value). The main assumptions used in the income approach are the Corporation's three-year internal forecasts along with long-term terminal growth values. The main assumptions  used  in  the  market multiplier approach  are primarily enterprise value and equity multiples from comparable publicly traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit.\n\n## Certain Contingent Liabilities\n\nFor more information on the complex judgments associated with certain  contingent liabilities, see Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The  Corporation's  internal  control  over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to  the  maintenance  of records  that, in  reasonable  detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded  as  necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are  being  made  only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation's  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect on  the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of its  inherent limitations, internal  control  over financial  reporting  may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections  of any evaluation  of effectiveness  to  future periods  are  subject to  the  risk  that controls  may become inadequate  because  of changes  in  conditions, or that the degree  of compliance  with  the  policies  or procedures  may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2023 based on the framework set forth  by the Committee  of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the  Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the  Corporation's  internal  control  over financial reporting is effective.\n\nThe Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting  firm, as  stated  in  their accompanying  report which expresses  an  unqualified  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of the Corporation's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2023.\n\nBrian T.

We also have audited the Corporation's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2023, based  on  criteria  established  in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations  of the  Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the  consolidated  financial  statements referred  to  above  present fairly, in  all  material  respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023  in  conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the  Corporation  maintained, in  all  material  respects, effective internal  control  over financial  reporting  as  of December 31, 2023, based  on  criteria  established  in Internal  Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe  Corporation's  management is responsible  for these consolidated  financial  statements, for maintaining  effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial  reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with  the  Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board  (United States) (PCAOB) and  are  required  to  be  independent with respect to  the  Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the  PCAOB. Those  standards  require  that we  plan  and perform the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the  consolidated  financial  statements  are  free  of material  misstatement, whether due  to  error or fraud, and whether effective  internal  control  over financial  reporting  was maintained  in  all  material  respects. Our audits  of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated  financial  statements, whether due  to  error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  consolidated financial  statements. Our audits  also  included  evaluating  the accounting  principles  used  and  significant estimates  made  by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of\n\nthe  consolidated  financial  statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding  of internal  control  over financial  reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk. Our audits  also included  performing  such  other procedures  as  we  considered necessary in  the  circumstances. We  believe  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over financial  reporting  is  a process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding the  reliability of financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of financial  statements  for external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control  over financial  reporting  includes  those  policies  and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions  of the  assets  of the  company; (ii) provide reasonable  assurance  that transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to  permit preparation  of financial  statements  in accordance  with  generally accepted  accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition  of the  company's  assets  that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause  of its  inherent limitations, internal  control  over financial  reporting  may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections  of any evaluation  of effectiveness  to  future periods  are  subject to  the  risk  that controls  may become inadequate  because  of changes  in  conditions, or that the degree  of compliance  with  the  policies  or procedures  may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe  critical  audit matters  communicated  below  are  matters arising  from the  current period  audit of the  consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated  to  the  audit committee  and  that (i) relate  to accounts  or disclosures  that are  material  to  the  consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters  does  not alter in  any way our opinion  on  the consolidated  financial  statements, taken  as  a  whole, and  we are  not, by communicating  the  critical  audit matters  below, providing  separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance  for Loan and  Lease  Losses -  Commercial  and Consumer Card Loans\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  5  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management's  estimate  of the  expected  credit losses  in  the Corporation's  loan  and  lease  portfolio, excluding  loans  and unfunded  lending  commitments  accounted  for under the  fair value option. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $13.3 billion on total loans and leases of $1,050.2 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the fair value option.

        "page_content": "expected  credit loss  is  typically estimated  using  quantitative methods  that consider a  variety of factors  such  as  historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as  an  economic outlook  over the  life  of the  loan. In  its  loss forecasting  framework, the  Corporation  incorporates  forward looking information through the use of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been  key drivers  of increases  and  decreases  in credit losses. These  variables  include, but are  not limited  to, unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels  and  corporate  bond  spreads. The  scenarios  that are chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors  including  recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views  of internal  as  well  as  third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan  and  lease  losses  are  qualitative  reserves  to  cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the  economic assumptions. Factors  that the  Corporation considers  include  changes  in  lending  policies  and  procedures, business  conditions, the  nature  and  size  of the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations, the  volume  and  severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition, and legal  and  regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in  quantitative  models  that are  built on  historical data.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for our determination  that performing  procedures  relating  to  the  allowance  for loan  and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a  critical  audit matter are  (i) the  significant judgment and estimation  by management in  developing  lifetime  economic forecast scenarios  and  related  weightings  to  each  scenario, which  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment, subjectivity and  effort in performing  procedures  and  in evaluating  audit evidence  obtained, and  (ii) the  audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing  the  matter involved  performing  procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of controls relating  to  the  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses, including controls  over the  evaluation  and  approval  of models, forecast scenarios  and  related  weightings, and  qualitative  reserves. These  procedures  also  included, among  others, testing management's  process  for estimating  the  allowance  for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the  loss  forecast models  and  methodology, (ii) evaluating  the reasonableness  of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management's development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data  used  in  the  estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of certain  loss  forecast\n\nmodels, the  reasonableness  of economic forecast scenarios and  related  weightings  and  the  reasonableness  of certain qualitative reserves.\n\n## Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  20  to  the  consolidated  financial statements, the Corporation carries certain financial instruments at fair value, which includes $9.3 billion of assets and  $6.6  billion  of liabilities  classified  as  Level  3  fair value measurements that are  valued  on  a  recurring  basis  and  $3.9 billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements that are  valued  on  a  nonrecurring  basis, for which  the determination  of fair value  requires  significant management judgment or estimation. The  Corporation  determines  the  fair value  of Level  3  financial  instruments  using  pricing  models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such as  volatility or implied  yield, may be  determined  using quantitative-based  extrapolations, pricing models  or other internal methodologies which incorporate management estimates and available market information.\n\nThe  principal  considerations  for our determination  that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3  financial  instruments  is  a  critical  audit matter are  the significant judgment and  estimation  used  by management to determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, including  the  involvement of professionals  with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing  the  matter involved  performing  procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of controls relating  to  the  valuation  of financial  instruments, including controls  related  to  valuation  models, significant unobservable inputs, and  data. These  procedures  also  included, among others, the  involvement of professionals with  specialized  skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments and comparison of management's estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and accuracy of data  provided  by management and  evaluating  the reasonableness  of management's  significant unobservable inputs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina February 20, 2024\n\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1958.",

        "page_content": "## Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n\nBank  of America  Corporation, a  bank  holding  company and  a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services  and  products  throughout the  U.S. and  in  certain international  markets. The  term 'the  Corporation' as  used herein  may refer to  Bank  of America  Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the  Corporation  and  its  majority-owned  subsidiaries  and  those variable  interest entities  (VIEs) where  the  Corporation  is  the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts  and  transactions have  been  eliminated. Results  of operations  of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for VIEs, from the  dates  that the  Corporation  became the primary beneficiary. Assets  held  in  an  agency or fiduciary capacity are not included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence  over operating  and  financing  decisions using  the  equity method  of accounting. These  investments, which include the Corporation's interests in affordable housing and  renewable  energy partnerships, are  recorded  in  other assets. Equity method  investments  are  subject to  impairment testing, and the Corporation's proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States  of America  requires  management to  make estimates  and  assumptions  that affect reported  amounts  and disclosures. Actual  results  could  materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\n## New Accounting Standards Issued\n\n## Segment Reporting\n\nThe FASB amended the segment reporting requirements to add disclosures  of incremental  segment expense  categories. The amended disclosures are effective for the fiscal year December 31, 2024, and  interim periods  thereafter, on  a  retrospective basis.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe  FASB  expanded  the  income  tax disclosure  requirements related  to  the  rate  reconciliation  and  income  taxes  paid information. The amended disclosures are effective January 1, 2025, on a prospective basis.\n\n## New Accounting Standard Adopted\n\n## Financial Instruments -Credit Losses\n\nOn  January 1, 2023, the  Corporation  adopted  the  new accounting  and  disclosure  requirements  for expected  credit losses  (ECL) that removed  the  recognition  and  measurement guidance  on  troubled  debt restructurings  (TDRs) and  added disclosures on the financial effect and subsequent performance of certain types of modifications made  to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nUpon adoption of the standard, the Corporation recorded a reduction of $243 million in the allowance for credit losses for the impact of changes in the methodology used to estimate the allowance  for credit losses  for non-collateral dependent consumer and  commercial  TDRs. There  was  no  impact to  the valuation  of loans previously classified  as  collateral-dependent TDRs. After adjusting  for deferred  taxes, the  Corporation recorded  an  increase  of $184  million  in  retained  earnings through a cumulative-effect adjustment.\n\nThe  additional  disclosures  are  included  in Note  5  Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit  Losses on a prospective basis and include loan modifications where the contractual  payment terms  of the  borrower's  loan  agreement were modified through a refinancing or restructuring.\n\n## Significant Accounting Principles\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the  process  of collection, cash  segregated  under federal  and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  and  certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSecurities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to  resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities  financing  agreements) are  treated  as  collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these  agreements  are  recorded  at acquisition  or sale  price  plus  accrued  interest. In  instances where  the  interest is  negative, the  Corporation's  policy is  to present negative interest on financial assets as interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense. For securities  financing  agreements  that are  accounted  for under the  fair value  option, the  changes  in  the  fair value  of these  securities  financing  agreements  are  recorded  in  market making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe  Corporation's  policy is  to  monitor the  market value  of the  principal  amount loaned  under resale  agreements  and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements  do  not create  material  credit risk  due  to  these collateral provisions; therefore, any allowance for loan losses is insignificant.\n\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities  lending  agreement and  receives  securities  that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated  Balance  Sheet at fair value, representing  the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.\n\n## Trading Instruments\n\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the  same  or similar assets  and  liabilities. If these  market prices  are  not available, fair values  are  estimated  based  on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques  where  the  determination of fair value  may require  significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-",

        "page_content": "date  basis. Realized  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are recognized in market making and similar activities.\n\n## Derivatives and Hedging Activities\n\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to  support risk  management activities. Derivatives  used  in risk  management activities  include  derivatives  that are  both designated  in  qualifying  accounting  hedge  relationships  and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated  in  qualifying  accounting  hedge  relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages  interest rate and  foreign currency exchange  rate  sensitivity predominantly through  the  use  of derivatives. Derivatives  utilized  by the  Corporation  include swaps, futures  and  forward  settlement contracts, and  option contracts.\n\nAll  derivatives  are  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet at fair value, taking  into  consideration  the  effects  of legally enforceable  master netting  agreements  that allow  the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded  contracts, fair value  is  based  on  quoted market prices  in  active  or inactive  markets  or is  derived  from observable  market-based  pricing  parameters, similar to  those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value  is  based  on  dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted  cash  flow  methodologies  or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\nValuations  of derivative  assets  and  liabilities  reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values  also  take  into  account the  Corporation's  own  credit standing.\n\n## Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\n\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets  or derivative  liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and similar activities.\n\nDerivatives  used  for other risk  management activities  are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used  in  other risk  management activities  have  not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is  reported  at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes  in  the  fair value  of derivatives  that serve  to  mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate  lock  commitments  (IRLCs) and first-lien  mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are  recorded  in  other income. Changes  in  the  fair value  of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk  are  included  in  market making  and  similar activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes  in  the  fair value  of these  derivatives  are  included  in market making and similar activities and other income.\n\n## Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)\n\nFor accounting hedges, the  Corporation  formally documents at inception  all  relationships  between  hedging  instruments  and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and\n\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the  inception  of a  hedge  and  for each  reporting  period thereafter to  assess  whether the  derivative  used  in  an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective  in  offsetting  changes  in  the  fair value  or cash flows  of a  hedged  item or forecasted  transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined  that a  derivative  is  not expected  to  be  or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge.\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value  of the  Corporation's  assets  and  liabilities  that are attributable  to  interest rate  or foreign  exchange  volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges  are  recorded  in  earnings, together and  in  the  same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related  hedged  item. If a  derivative  instrument in  a  fair value hedge  is  terminated  or the  hedge  designation  removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as  other components  of the  carrying  value  of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\n\nCash  flow  hedges  are  used  primarily to  minimize  the variability in  cash  flows  of assets  and  liabilities  or forecasted transactions  caused  by interest rate  or foreign  exchange  rate fluctuations. The  Corporation  also  uses  cash  flow  hedges  to hedge  the  price  risk  associated  with  deferred  compensation. Changes  in  the  fair value  of derivatives  used  in  cash  flow hedges  are  recorded  in  accumulated  other comprehensive income  (OCI) and  are  reclassified  into  the  line  item in  the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are  recorded  in  the  same  income  statement line  item as  the hedged item.\n\nNet investment hedges  are  used  to  manage  the  foreign exchange  rate  sensitivity arising  from a  net investment in  a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are  recorded  as  a  component of accumulated  OCI. The remaining  components  of these  derivatives  are  excluded  in assessing  hedge  effectiveness  and  are  recorded  in  market making and similar activities.\n\n## Securities\n\nDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade  date. Their classification  is  dependent on  the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased  for use  in  the  Corporation's  trading  activities  are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains  and  losses  included  in  market making  and  similar activities. Substantially all  other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation's asset and liability management (ALM) activities  and  are  reported  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet as  either debt securities  carried  at fair value  or as  held-tomaturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities  carried  at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried  at fair value  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses reported  in  market making  and  similar activities. HTM debt securities are debt securities that management has the intent and  ability to  hold  to  maturity and  are  reported  at amortized cost. If more than 85 percent of the principal has been collected",

        "page_content": "on  level-payment mortgage-backed  HTM debt securities  since their acquisition, the debt securities, if disposed, are treated as matured for classification purposes.\n\nThe Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through earnings. For AFS  debt securities  the  Corporation  intends  to hold, the  Corporation  evaluates  the  debt securities  for ECL, except for debt securities  that are  guaranteed  by the  U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or sovereign entities of high credit quality where  the  Corporation  applies  a  zero  credit loss assumption. For the  remaining  AFS  debt securities, the Corporation  considers  qualitative  parameters  such  as  internal and external credit ratings and the value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of the qualitative parameters, a discounted  cash  flow  analysis  is  used  by the  Corporation  to determine  if a  portion  of the  unrealized  loss  is  a  result of an ECL. The  Corporation  will  then  recognize  either credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the  amount necessary to  adjust the  debt securities  valuation allowance  to  its  current estimate  of expected  credit losses. Cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected  are  estimated  using  all relevant information  available  such  as  remaining  payment terms, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the  credit loss  may exceed  the  total  decline  in  fair value, in which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.\n\nThe Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities for any credit losses, of which  substantially all  qualify for the zero  loss  assumption. For the  remaining  securities, the Corporation  performs  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  to estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on  debt securities, including amortization of premiums  and  accretion  of discounts, is  included  in  interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales or dispositions  of debt securities  are  determined  using  the specific identification method.\n\nEquity securities  with  readily determinable  fair values  that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized  gains  and  losses  included  in  other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are recorded  at cost less  impairment, if any, plus  or minus qualifying  observable  price  changes. These  securities  are reported in other assets.\n\n## Loans and Leases\n\nLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value  option, are  measured  at historical  cost and  reported  at their outstanding  principal  balances  net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized  deferred  fees  and  costs  on originated loans, and  for purchased  loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain  direct origination  costs  are  deferred  and  recognized  as adjustments  to  interest income  over the  lives  of the  related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums  are amortized  to  interest income  using  a  level  yield  methodology. The  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  consumer and commercial  loans  under the  fair value  option  with  interest\n\nreported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in market making and similar activities or other income.\n\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within  each  portfolio  segment, by class  of financing receivable. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which  an  entity develops  and  documents  a  systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class  of financing  receivable  is  defined  as  the  level  of disaggregation  of portfolio  segments  based  on  the  initial measurement attribute, risk  characteristics  and  methods  for assessing risk. The Corporation's three portfolio segments are Consumer Real  Estate, Credit Card  and  Other Consumer, and Commercial. The  classes  within  the  Consumer Real  Estate portfolio  segment are  residential  mortgage  and  home  equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are  credit card, direct/indirect consumer and  other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are  U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial  real estate, commercial  lease  financing  and  U.S. small  business commercial.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through  a  variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing leases  and  sales-type  leases  are  carried  at the  aggregate  of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to interest income  over the  lease  terms  using  methods  that approximate  the  interest method. Operating  lease  income  is recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis. The  Corporation's  lease arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe ECL on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reported  separately as  a  contra-asset to  loans  and  leases  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including  home  equity lines  of credit (HELOCs), standby letters  of credit (SBLCs) and  binding  unfunded  loan commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses  related  to  the  loan  and  lease  portfolio  and  unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the current estimate of ECL.\n\nFor loans  and  leases, the  ECL  is  typically estimated  using quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical  loss  experience, the  current credit quality of the portfolio  as  well  as  an  economic outlook  over the  life  of the loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on the  contractual  maturity of the  loan  adjusted  for any expected prepayments. The  contractual  maturity includes  any extension options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For openended  products  (e.g., lines  of credit), the  ECL  is  determined based on the maximum repayment term associated with future draws  from credit lines  unless  those  lines  of credit are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the Corporation does not record any allowance.\n\nIn its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates  forward-looking  information  through  the  use  of macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in credit losses. These  variables  include, but are  not limited  to,",

        "page_content": "unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels  and  corporate  bond  spreads. As  any one  economic outlook  is  inherently uncertain, the  Corporation  leverages multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors  including  recent economic events, leading  economic indicators, views  of internal  and  third-party economists  and industry trends.\n\nThe estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead, expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal balance immediately prior to the charge-off.\n\nIncluded  in  the  allowance  for loan  and  lease  losses  are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected  in the quantitative methods  or the economic assumptions described  above. For example, factors  that the  Corporation considers  include  changes  in  lending  policies  and  procedures, business  conditions, the  nature  and  size  of the  portfolio, portfolio  concentrations, the  volume  and  severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as  competition, and legal  and  regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in  quantitative  models  that are  built on  historical data.\n\nWith the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio, the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable in  the  measurement of the  allowance  for credit losses  as  the Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as nonperforming  at 90  days past due  and  reverses  interest income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the Corporation  reserves  for interest and  fees  as  part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income against the income statement line  item where it was originally recorded.\n\nThe  Corporation  has  identified  the  following  three  portfolio segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using the following methods.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nTo estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default over the  life  of the  existing  portfolio, after factoring  in estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling methodologies. The  attributes  that are  most significant in estimating the Corporation's ECL include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and geography, all  of which  are  further broken  down  by present collection  status  (whether the  loan  is  current, delinquent, in default, or in  bankruptcy). The  estimates  are  based  on  the Corporation's  historical  experience  with  the  loan  portfolio, adjusted  to  reflect the  economic outlook. The  outlook  on  the unemployment rate  and  consumer real  estate  prices  are  key factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates. The  Corporation  does  not reserve  for credit losses  on  the unpaid  principal  balance  of loans  insured  by the  Federal Housing  Administration  (FHA) and  long-term standby loans, as these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with the  undrawn  portion  of the  Corporation's  HELOCs, which  can only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met.\n\nThe ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted above  and  incorporate  utilization  assumptions  at time  of default.\n\nFor loans  that are  more  than  180  days  past due, the Corporation bases the allowance on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the reporting date less costs to sell. The  fair value  of the  collateral  securing  these  loans  is generally determined using an automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates  the  value  of a  property by reference  to  market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to  the  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  in  which  the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses  appraisals  or broker price  opinions  to  estimate  the  fair value  of the  collateral. While  there  is  inherent imprecision  in these  valuations, the  Corporation  believes  that they are representative of this portfolio in the aggregate.\n\nFor loans  that are  more  than  180  days past due, with  the exception  of the  Corporation's  fully insured  portfolio, the outstanding balance of loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off; however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to  the  charge-off, the  Corporation  will  adjust the allowance to account for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge-off amount.\n\n## Credit Cards and Other Consumer\n\nCredit cards  are  revolving  lines  of credit without a  defined maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is determined  by estimating  the  amount and  timing  of expected future payments  (e.g., borrowers  making  full  payments, minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will  take for a  receivable  balance  to  pay off. The  ECL  on  the  future payments  incorporates  the  spending  behavior of a  borrower through  time  using  key borrower-specific factors  and  the economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all expected  payments  in  accordance  with  the  Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and  Disclosure  Act of 2009  (i.e., paying  down  the  highest interest rate  bucket first). Then forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest balance  until  it is  brought to  zero  or an  expected  charge-off amount. Unemployment rate  outlook, borrower credit score, delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all  key inputs  into  the  credit card  receivable  loss  forecasting  model. Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL as they are unconditionally cancellable.\n\nThe  ECL  for the  consumer vehicle  lending  portfolio  is  also determined  using  quantitative  methods  supplemented  with qualitative  analysis. The  quantitative  model  estimates  ECL giving  consideration  to  key borrower and  loan  characteristics such  as  delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV  ratio, underlying collateral type and collateral value.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that estimate  credit losses  over the  loan's  contractual  life  at an individual  loan  level. The models use the contractual terms to forecast future  principal  cash  flows  while  also  considering expected  prepayments. For open-ended  commitments  such  as revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured by forecasting a borrower's draw and payment behavior over the",

        "page_content": "remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the primary source  of repayment, the  loss  forecasting  models consider key loan  and  customer attributes  such  as  LTV  ratio, net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures variations in behavior according to property type and region. The outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators such  as  rent levels  and  vacancy rates, which  impact the  ECL estimate. For all  other commercial loans and leases, the  loss forecasting  model  determines  the  probabilities  of transition  to different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life of the asset based on the borrower's current credit risk rating, industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market. The  severity of loss  is  determined  based  on  the  type  of collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the borrower's  industry sector, any guarantors  and  the  geographic market. Assumptions  of expected  loss  are  conditioned  to  the economic outlook, and  the  model  considers  key economic variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product, corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and equity market returns.\n\nIn  addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation  also  estimates  ECL  related  to  unfunded  lending commitments  such  as  letters  of credit, financial  guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding  commitments  accounted  for under the  fair value option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using the  same  models  and  methodologies  as  the  funded  exposure and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending commitments.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and Delinquencies\n\nNonperforming  loans  and  leases  generally include  loans  and leases  that have  been  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Loans accounted  for under the  fair value  option  and  LHFS  are  not reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed uncollectible, it is  charged  off against the  allowance  for credit losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount is  reversed  through  the  allowance  for credit losses  at the recovery date. Charge-offs  are  reported  net of recoveries  (net charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than chargeoffs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.\n\nIn accordance with the Corporation's policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are  generally placed  on  nonaccrual  status  and classified  as  nonperforming  at 90  days  past due  unless repayment of the  loan  is  insured  by the  FHA  or through individually insured  long-term standby agreements  with  Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien  home  equity loans  are  placed  on nonaccrual  status  and  classified  as  nonperforming  when  the underlying  first-lien  mortgage  loan  becomes  90  days  past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real  estate-secured  loans  that is  in  excess  of the  estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60  days  of receipt of notification  of filing, with  the  remaining balance classified as nonperforming.\n\nCredit card  and  other unsecured  consumer loans  are charged off when the loan becomes 180 days past due, within\n\n60 days after receipt of notification  of death  or bankruptcy or upon  confirmation  of fraud. These  loans  continue  to  accrue interest until  they are  charged  off and, therefore, are  not reported  as  nonperforming  loans. Consumer vehicle  loans  are placed  on  nonaccrual  status  when  they become 90 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death  or upon confirmation  of fraud. These loans are charged off to their collateral values when the loans become 120 days past due, upon repossession of the  collateral, within  60  days after receipt of notification  of bankruptcy or death  or upon confirmation  of fraud. If repossession  of the  collateral  is  not expected, the loans are fully charged off.\n\nCommercial  loans  and  leases, excluding  business  card loans, that are  past due  90  days  or more  as  to  principal  or interest, or where  reasonable  doubt exists  as  to  timely collection, including  loans  that are  individually identified  as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified  as  nonperforming  unless  well-secured  and  in  the process of collection.\n\nBusiness card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.\n\nThe entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received  by the  specified  due  date  on  the  customer's  billing statement. Interest and  fees  continue  to  accrue  on  past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued  interest receivable  is  reversed when  loans  and  leases  are  placed  on  nonaccrual  status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income  when  received. Loans  and  leases  may be  restored  to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nLoans  that the  Corporation  intends  to  sell  in  the  foreseeable future, including  residential  mortgages, loan  syndications, and to  a  lesser degree, commercial  real  estate, consumer finance and  other loans, are  reported  as  LHFS  and  are  carried  at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are on  nonaccrual  status  and  are  reported  as  nonperforming, as defined  in  the  policy herein, are  reported  separately from nonperforming loans and leases.\n\n## Premises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  and  amortization. Depreciation  and  amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture  and  equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nFor the  Corporation's  financial  assets  that are  measured  at amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans",

        "page_content": "and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation evaluates  these  assets  for ECL  using  various  techniques. For assets  that are  subject to  collateral  maintenance  provisions, including  federal  funds  sold  and  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements  to  resell, where  the  collateral consists  of daily margining  of liquid  and  marketable  assets where  the  margining  is  expected  to  be  maintained  into  the foreseeable  future, the  expected  losses  are  assumed  to  be zero. For all  other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative analyses, including  consideration  of historical  losses  and current economic conditions, to  estimate  any ECL  which  are then  included  in  a  valuation  account that is  recorded  as  a contra-asset against the  amortized  cost basis  of the  financial asset.\n\n## Lessee Arrangements\n\nSubstantially all  of the  Corporation's  lessee  arrangements  are operating  leases. Under these  arrangements, the  Corporation records  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  at lease commencement. Right-of-use  assets  are  reported  in  other assets  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet, and  the  related lease  liabilities  are  reported  in  accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for which  the  Corporation  made  the  short-term lease  election. Lease  expense  is  recognized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over the lease  term and  is  recorded  in  occupancy and  equipment expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe  Corporation  made  an  accounting  policy election  not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As such, lease  payments  represent payments  on  both  lease  and non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease liabilities  are  recognized  based  on  the  present value  of the remaining lease payments and discounted using the Corporation's  incremental  borrowing  rate. Right-of-use  assets initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made  prior to  lease  commencement and  for any lease incentives.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill  is  the  purchase  premium after adjusting  for the  fair value  of net assets acquired. Goodwill is  not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting  unit level. A  reporting  unit is  a  business  segment or one level below a business segment.\n\nThe  Corporation  assesses  the  fair value  of each  reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the  Corporation  utilizes  allocated  equity as  a  proxy for the carrying  value  of its  reporting  units. Allocated  equity in  the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill  and  intangibles  specifically assigned to the reporting unit.\n\nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation  first assesses  qualitative  factors  to  determine whether it is  more  likely than  not that the  fair value  of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among  other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and  market considerations, financial  performance  of the  respective  reporting  unit and  other relevant entity-  and reporting-unit specific considerations.\n\nIf the  Corporation  concludes  it is  more  likely than  not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a\n\nquantitative assessment is  performed. The Corporation has an unconditional  option  to  bypass  the  qualitative  assessment for any reporting  unit in  any period  and  proceed  directly to performing  the  quantitative  goodwill  impairment test. The Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.\n\nWhen  performing  the  quantitative  assessment, if the  fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the  reporting  unit would  not be  considered  impaired. If the carrying  value  of the  reporting  unit exceeds  its  fair value, a goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's allocated equity exceeds its fair value. An  impairment loss  recognized  cannot exceed  the  amount of goodwill  assigned  to  a  reporting  unit. An  impairment loss establishes  a  new  basis  in  the  goodwill, and  subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.\n\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the  asset. Intangible  assets  deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nA  VIE  is  an  entity that lacks  equity investors  or whose  equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and  an  obligation  to  absorb  losses  or the  right to  receive benefits  that could  potentially be  significant to  the  VIE. On  a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the  VIE  and  evaluates  the  impact of changes  in  governing documents  and  its  financial  interests  in  the  VIE. The consolidation  status  of the  VIEs  with  which  the  Corporation  is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.\n\nThe  Corporation  primarily uses  VIEs  for its  securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the  servicer of whole  loans  held  in  a  securitization  trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The  power to  direct the  most significant activities  of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special  servicer or by the  party holding  specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation  consolidates a  whole-loan  securitization  trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds  securities  issued  by the  trust or has  other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and  AFS  securities  into  municipal  bond  or resecuritization trusts. The  Corporation  consolidates  a  municipal  bond  or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust's liabilities or, if",

The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one  or a  limited  number of third-party investors  share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities  of the  trust through  liquidation  or other substantive rights.\n\nOther VIEs  used  by the  Corporation  include  collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers  and  other investment vehicles. The  Corporation does  not routinely serve  as  collateral  manager for CDOs and, therefore, does  not typically have  the  power to  direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a  CDO  and  acquires  the  power to  manage  its  assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.\n\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the  vehicle, derivative  contracts  or other arrangements. The Corporation  does  not consolidate  an  investment vehicle  if a single  investor controlled  the  initial  design  of the  vehicle  or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.\n\nRetained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In  addition, the  Corporation  may invest in  debt securities  issued  by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices  for retained  residual  interests are  not available; therefore, the  Corporation  estimates  fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nThe  Corporation  measures  the  fair values  of its  assets  and liabilities, where  applicable, in  accordance  with  accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable  inputs  and  minimize  the  use  of unobservable inputs  in  measuring  fair value. Under applicable  accounting standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets  and  the  lowest priority given  to  unobservable  inputs. The  Corporation  categorizes  its  fair value  measurements  of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.\n\nLevel 1 Unadjusted  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for identical  assets  or liabilities. Level  1  assets  and liabilities include  debt and  equity securities  and derivative  contracts  that are  traded  in  an  active exchange  market, as  well  as  certain  U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, quoted  prices  for similar assets  or liabilities, prices  in  markets  that are  not active, or other\n\nsuch as quoted inputs\n\nLevel 3\n\nthat are  observable  or can  be  corroborated  by observable market data for substantially the  full  term of the  assets  or liabilities. Level  2  assets  and liabilities  include  debt securities  with  quoted  prices that are  traded  less  frequently than  exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes  U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed  (MBS) and  asset-backed securities  (ABS), corporate  debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS.\n\nUnobservable inputs that are supported by little  or no market activity and  that are  significant to  the  overall fair value  of the  assets  or liabilities. Level  3  assets and  liabilities  include  financial  instruments  for which the  determination  of fair value  requires  significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such  assets  and  liabilities  is  generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  that incorporate the  assumptions  a  market participant would  use  in pricing  the  asset or liability. This  category generally includes  retained  residual  interests  in  securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated  derivative  contracts, certain loans  and  LHFS, IRLCs  and  certain  CDOs  where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results  from changes  in  deferred  tax assets  and  liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the  future  because  of future  reversals  of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws  and  their bases  as  reported  in  the  financial statements. Deferred  tax assets  are  also  recognized  for tax attributes  such  as  net operating  loss  carryforwards  and  tax credit carryforwards. Valuation  allowances  are  recorded  to reduce  deferred  tax assets  to  the  amounts  management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.\n\nIncome  tax benefits  are  recognized  and  measured  based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to  be  sustained  upon  settlement. The  difference  between the  benefit recognized  and  the  tax benefit claimed  on  a  tax return  is  referred  to  as  an  unrecognized  tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe following summarizes the Corporation's revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.\n\n## Card Income\n\nCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as interchange, cash  advances  and  other miscellaneous  items from credit and  debit card  transactions  and  from processing card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net",

Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the  credit and  debit card  payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and  fixed rates for debit cards based  on  the corresponding  payment network's  rates. Substantially all  card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12  months. Fees  charged  to  cardholders  and  merchants  that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan  and  lease  losses. Included in  direct cost are  rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are  related  to  points  earned  by the  cardholder that can  be redeemed  for a  broad  range  of rewards  including  cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on  past redemption  behavior, card  product type, account transaction  activity and  other historical  card  performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the  revenue-sharing  agreements, the  credit card  partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card  partner's  members  or customers  on  behalf of the Corporation.\n\n## Service Charges\n\nService  charges  include  deposit and  lending-related  fees. Deposit-related  fees  consist of fees  earned  on  consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees  are  earned  on  consumer deposit accounts  for account maintenance  and  various  transaction-based  services, such  as ATM transactions, wire  transfer activities, check  and  money order processing  and  insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial  deposit-related  fees  are  from the  Corporation's Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and  treasury management services, including  account maintenance  and  other services, such  as  payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\n\n## Investment and Brokerage Services\n\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned  from the  management of client assets  under advisory agreements or the full  discretion  of the Corporation's financial advisors (collectively referred  to  as  assets  under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client's AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client's investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\nBrokerage  fees  include  income  earned  from transactionbased  services  that are  performed  as  part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also  include  distribution  fees  and  sales  commissions  that are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global  Markets segment, brokerage  fees  are  earned  when  the Corporation  fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial\n\nproducts  or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles  and  clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate  clearing  broker. Certain  customers  pay brokerage, clearing  and/or exchange  fees  imposed  by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected  in  the  transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\n## Investment Banking Income\n\nInvestment banking  income  includes  underwriting  income  and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees earned  for the  placement of a  customer's  debt or equity securities. The  revenue  is  generally earned  based  on  a percentage  of the  fixed  number of shares  or principal  placed. Once  the  number of shares  or notes  is  determined  and  the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in  performing  these  services. These  expenses  are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees  represent fees  earned  as  the  agent or lead  lender responsible for structuring, arranging  and  administering  a  loan syndication.\n\nFinancial  advisory services  consist of fees  earned  for assisting  clients  with  transactions  related  to  mergers  and acquisitions and  financial restructurings. Revenue  varies depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services performed and is generally contingent on successful completion of the  transaction. Revenue  is  typically recognized  once  the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\n\n## Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies\n\nThe  Corporation  did  not disclose  the  value  of any open performance  obligations  at December 31, 2023, as  its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\n\n## Earnings Per Common Share\n\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is  computed by dividing net income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  by the  weightedaverage  common  shares  outstanding, excluding  unvested common  shares  subject to  repurchase  or cancellation. Net income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  is  net income adjusted  for preferred  stock  dividends  including  dividends declared, accretion  of discounts  on  preferred  stock  including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income  allocated  to  common  shareholders  plus  dividends  on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be  tendered  to  exercise  warrants, by the  weighted-average common  shares  outstanding  plus  amounts  representing  the dilutive  effect of stock  options  outstanding, restricted  stock, restricted  stock  units  (RSUs), outstanding  warrants  and  the dilution  resulting  from the  conversion  of convertible  preferred stock, if applicable.",

When the functional currency of a foreign operation is  the  local  currency, the assets, liabilities  and  operations  are translated, for consolidation  purposes, from the  local  currency to  the  U.S. dollar reporting  currency at period-end  rates  for\n\nassets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The  resulting  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the  foreign  entity's  functional  currency is  the  U.S. dollar, the resulting  remeasurement gains  or losses  on  foreign  currencydenominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.\n\n## NOTE 2 Net Interest Income and Noninterest Income\n\nThe table below presents the Corporation's net interest income and noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for 2023, 2022  and  2021.

(ISDA) master netting  agreements  or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to  liquidate  securities  held  as  collateral and  to  offset receivables  and  payables  with  the  same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\n\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance\n\nSheet at December 31, 2023 and 2022 by primary risk  (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross  basis, prior to  the  application  of counterparty and  cash collateral  netting. Total  gross  derivative  assets  and  liabilities are  adjusted  on  an  aggregate  basis  to  take  into  consideration the  effects  of legally enforceable  master netting  agreements, which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.\n\nFor more  information  on  offsetting  of securities  financing agreements, see Note  10  -  Securities  Financing  Agreements, Short-term Borrowings, Collateral and Restricted Cash .",

Derivatives\n\nThe Corporation's ALM and risk management activities  include the  use  of derivatives  to  mitigate  risk  to  the  Corporation including  derivatives  designated  in  qualifying  hedge  accounting relationships  and  derivatives  used  in  other risk  management activities. Interest rate, foreign  exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts  are  utilized  in  the  Corporation's  ALM and risk management activities.\n\nThe  Corporation  maintains  an  overall  interest rate  risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which  are  generally non-leveraged  generic interest rate  and  basis  swaps, options, futures  and  forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate  fluctuations, hedged  fixed-rate  assets  and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on  the  derivative  instruments  that are  linked  to  the  hedged fixed-rate  assets  and  liabilities  are  expected  to  substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\n\nMarket risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the  risk  that values  of mortgage  assets  or revenues  will  be adversely affected  by changes  in  market conditions  such  as interest rate  movements. To  mitigate  the  interest rate  risk  in mortgage  banking  production  income, the  Corporation  utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative\n\ninstruments, including  purchased  options, and  certain  debt securities. The  Corporation  also  utilizes  derivatives  such  as interest rate  options, interest rate  swaps, forward  settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs.\n\nThe Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  certain  foreign currency-denominated  assets  and  liabilities, as  well  as  the Corporation's investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to loss  on  these  contracts  will  increase  or decrease  over their respective  lives  as  currency exchange  and  interest rates fluctuate.\n\nThe  Corporation  purchases  credit derivatives  to  manage credit risk  related  to  certain  funded  and  unfunded  credit exposures. Credit derivatives  include  credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.\n\n## Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges\n\nThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value  of its  assets  and  liabilities  due  to  fluctuations  in interest rates  and  foreign  exchange  rates  (fair value  hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts  to  protect against changes in the cash flows of its  assets and liabilities, and  other forecasted  transactions  (cash  flow  hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S.",

Of the  $8.0  billion  after-tax net loss  ($10.7  billion pretax) on  derivatives  in  accumulated  OCI at December 31, 2023, losses  of $3.4  billion  after-tax ($4.6  billion  pretax) related  to  both  open  and  terminated  cash  flow  hedges  are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These  net losses  reclassified  into  earnings  are  expected  to primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time  over which  forecasted  transactions  are  hedged  is approximately ten years. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time   period  over which  the  forecasted  transactions  will   be\n\nrecognized  in  interest income is approximately five  years, with the aggregated  amount beyond  this  time  period  being insignificant.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, Bloomberg Index Services Limited announced  the  permanent cessation  of the  Bloomberg  ShortTerm Bank Yield Index (BSBY) and all its tenors effective after final  publication  on  November 15, 2024. The  Corporation determined  that certain forecasted  BSBY-indexed  interest payments, which  had  been  designated  in  cash  flow  hedges, were no longer expected to occur beyond November 15, 2024 as  they will  transition  to  a  new  reference  rate. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation reclassified $2.0  billion  of pretax loss  from accumulated  OCI into  market making  and  similar activities for the  amount related  to  these forecasted transactions.",

The  table  below  presents  gains (losses) on these derivatives for 2023, 2022 and 2021. These gains  (losses) are  largely offset by the  income  or expense recorded on the hedged item.\n\n## Gains and Losses on Other Risk Management Derivatives\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                      | 2023   | 2022     | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Interest rate risk on mortgage activities  (1, 2)                                          | $ 16   | $  (326) | $  (18) |\n| Credit risk on loans  (2)                                                                  | (70)   | (37)     | (25)    |\n| Interest rate and foreign currency risk on  asset and liability management activities  (3) | 777    | 4,713    | 1,757   |\n| Price risk on certain compensation plans  (4)                                              | 584    | (1,073)  | 917     |\n\n## Transfers  of  Financial  Assets  with  Risk  Retained through Derivatives\n\nThe  Corporation  enters  into  certain  transactions  involving  the transfer of financial  assets  that are  accounted  for as  sales where  substantially all of the  economic exposure  to  the transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g., interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the  Corporation  had  transferred  $4.1  billion  and  $4.8 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed  mortgage-backed securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to  the  transferred  assets  through  derivative  contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash  proceeds  of $4.2  billion and  $4.9  billion at the  transfer dates. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the transferred securities was $4.1 billion and $4.7 billion.\n\n## Sales and Trading Revenue\n\nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets  and  liabilities. It is  the  Corporation's  policy to include  these  derivative  instruments  in  its  trading  activities,\n\nwhich  include  derivatives  and  non-derivative  cash  instruments. The  resulting  risk  from these  derivatives  is  managed  on  a portfolio  basis  as  part of the  Corporation's Global  Markets business  segment. The  related  sales  and  trading  revenue generated within Global Markets is  recorded  in  various  income statement line  items, including  market making  and  similar activities  and  net interest income  as  well  as  other revenue categories.\n\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which  the  trading  desk  can  execute  the  trade  in  the  dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the 'Other' column in the Sales and Trading  Revenue  table. Changes  in  the  fair value  of these securities are included in market making and similar activities. For debt securities, revenue, with  the  exception  of interest associated  with  the  debt securities, is  typically included  in market making  and  similar activities. Unlike  commissions  for equity securities, the  initial  revenue  related  to  broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this  revenue  is  recorded  in  market making and similar activities  as  part of the  initial  mark  to  fair value. For derivatives, the  majority of revenue  is  included  in market making and similar activities. In transactions where the Corporation  acts  as  agent, which  include  exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income .\n\nThe following table, which includes both derivatives and nonderivative  cash  instruments, identifies  the  amounts in  the respective  income  statement line  items  attributable  to  the Corporation's  sales  and  trading  revenue  in Global  Markets , categorized  by primary risk, for 2023, 2022  and  2021. This table  includes  debit valuation  adjustment (DVA) and  funding valuation  adjustment (FVA) gains  (losses). Global  Markets results  in Note  23  -  Business  Segment  Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The following table is not presented on an FTE basis.",

Credit derivatives  derive  value  based  on  an underlying  third-party referenced  obligation  or a  portfolio  of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the  seller of credit protection, to  make  payments  to  a  buyer upon  the  occurrence  of a  predefined  credit event. Such credit events  generally include  bankruptcy of the  referenced  credit entity and  failure  to  pay under the  obligation, as  well  as acceleration  of indebtedness  and  payment repudiation  or moratorium. For credit derivatives  based  on  a  portfolio  of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.\n\nCredit derivatives  are  classified  as  investment and  noninvestment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBBor higher as  investment grade. Non-investment grade  includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and noninvestment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.\n\nCredit derivative  instruments  where  the  Corporation  is  the seller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in the following table.",

However, the  Corporation  does  not monitor its exposure  to  credit derivatives  based  solely on  the  notional  amount because  this measure  does  not take  into  consideration  the  probability of occurrence. As  such, the  notional  amount is  not a  reliable indicator of the  Corporation's  exposure  to  these  contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish  limits  so  that certain  credit risk-related  losses  occur within acceptable, predefined limits.\n\nCredit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily\n\nclassified  as  trading  securities. The  carrying  value  of these instruments  equals  the  Corporation's  maximum exposure  to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.\n\n## Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\n\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of nonfinancial  companies. A  significant majority of the derivative  transactions  are  executed  on  a  daily margin  basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on  the  ultimate  rating  level) or a  breach  of credit covenants would  typically require  an  increase  in  the  amount of collateral",

Further, as previously discussed on  page  158, the  Corporation  enters  into  legally enforceable master netting  agreements  that reduce  risk  by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nCertain  of the  Corporation's  derivative  contracts  contain credit risk-related  contingent features, primarily in  the  form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation  that enhance  the  creditworthiness  of these instruments  compared  to  other obligations  of the  respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well  as  its  counterparties  with  respect to  changes  in  the Corporation's creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the  derivative  transactions. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the  Corporation  held  cash  and  securities  collateral  of $104.1  billion and  $101.3  billion and  posted  cash  and securities  collateral  of $93.4  billion  and  $81.2  billion  in  the normal  course  of business  under derivative  agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted  to  margin  on  a  net basis  for both  derivative  and secured financing arrangements.\n\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional  collateral  or to  terminate  transactions  with  certain counterparties in the event of a  downgrade of the  senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional  collateral  required  depends  on  the  contract and  is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had  not yet posted  to  counterparties  was  $2.5  billion, including $1.1 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).\n\nSome  counterparties  are  currently able  to  unilaterally terminate  certain  contracts, or the  Corporation  or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable  replacement or obtain  a  guarantee. At December 31, 2023  and  2022, the  liability recorded  for these  derivative contracts was not significant.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  amount of additional collateral  that would  have  been  contractually required  by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2023 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings  for the  Corporation  or certain subsidiaries  by one  incremental  notch  and  by an  additional second  incremental  notch. The  table  also  presents  derivative liabilities  that would  be  subject to  unilateral  termination  by counterparties  upon  downgrade of the  Corporation's  or certain subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.\n\nAdditional Collateral Required to be Posted and Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade at December 31, 2023\n\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                    | One Incremental  Notch   | Second Incremental  Notch   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Additional collateral required to be posted  upon downgrade              |                          |                             |\n| Bank of America Corporation                                              | $  134                   | $  902                      |\n| Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries  (1)                              | 45                       | 729                         |\n| Derivative liabilities subject to unilateral  termination upon downgrade |                          |                             |\n| Derivative liabilities                                                   | $  7                     | $  36                       |\n| Collateral posted                                                        | 6                        | 23                          |\n\n(1)\n\n## Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives\n\nThe  Corporation  records  credit risk  valuation  adjustments  on derivatives  in  order to  properly reflect the  credit quality of the counterparties  and  its  own  credit quality. The  Corporation calculates  valuation  adjustments  on  derivatives  based  on  a modeled  expected  exposure  that incorporates  current market risk  factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting  agreements and collateral. CDS  spread  data  is  used  to  estimate  the  default probabilities  and  severities  that are  applied  to  the  exposures. Where  no  observable  credit default data  is  available  for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.\n\nThe table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect of any related  hedge  activities), which  are  recorded  in  market making and similar activities, for 2023, 2022 and 2021. CVA gains  reduce  the  cumulative  CVA  thereby increasing  the derivative  assets  balance. DVA  gains  increase  the  cumulative DVA  thereby decreasing  the  derivative  liabilities  balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the  derivative  assets  balance. FVA  gains  related  to  derivative liabilities  increase  the  cumulative  FVA  thereby decreasing  the derivative  liabilities  balance. FVA  losses  have  the  opposite impact.\n\n## Valuation Adjustments Gains (Losses) on Derivatives (1)\n\n| (Dollars in millions)               | 2023   | 2022    | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Derivative assets (CVA)             | $ 159  | $  (80) | $  208 |\n| Derivative assets/liabilities (FVA) | (33)   | 125     | (2)    |\n| Derivative liabilities (DVA)        | (207)  | 194     | 3      |",

entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $8.7 billion and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, providing full credit protection  on  residential  mortgage  loans  that become severely delinquent. All  of these loans are individually insured, and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.\n\n## Nonperforming Loans and Leases\n\nCommercial  nonperforming  loans  increased  to  $2.8  billion  at December 31, 2023 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2022, driven  by the  commercial  real  estate  property type. Consumer\n\nnonperforming  loans  remained  relatively unchanged  at $2.7 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents the Corporation's nonperforming loans and leases and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2023  and  2022. Nonperforming  LHFS  are excluded  from nonperforming  loans  and  leases  as  they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 Summary  of Significant Accounting  Principles. Within the Consumer Real  Estate  portfolio  segment, the  primary credit quality indicators  are  refreshed  LTV  and  refreshed  Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing  the  loan, refreshed  quarterly. Home equity loans  are evaluated using CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation's loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO  score  measures  the  creditworthiness  of the  borrower based  on  the  financial  obligations  of the  borrower and  the borrower's  credit history. FICO  scores  are  typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have  their FICO  scores  updated. FICO  scores  are  also  a\n\nprimary credit quality indicator for the  Credit Card  and  Other Consumer portfolio  segment and  the  business  card  portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio  segment, loans  are  evaluated  using  the  internal classifications  of pass  rated  or reservable  criticized  as  the primary credit quality indicators. The  term reservable  criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed  by the  Corporation  as  Special  Mention, Substandard  or Doubtful, which  are  asset quality categories  defined  by regulatory authorities. These  assets  have  an  elevated  level  of risk  and  may have  a  high  probability of default or total  loss. Pass  rated  refers  to  all  loans  not considered  reservable criticized. In  addition  to  these  primary credit quality indicators, the  Corporation  uses  other credit quality indicators  for certain types of loans.\n\nThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators and  gross  charge-offs  for the  Corporation's  Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card  and  Other Consumer, and  Commercial portfolio  segments  by year of origination, except for revolving loans  and  revolving  loans  that were  modified  into  term loans, which are shown on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2023.",

        "page_content": "During  2023, commercial  reservable  criticized  utilized exposure increased to $23.3 billion at December 31, 2023 from $19.3  billion (to  3.74  percent from 3.12  percent of total commercial  reservable  utilized  exposure) at December 31, 2022, primarily driven  by commercial  real  estate  and  U.S. commercial.\n\n## Loan Modifications to Borrowers in Financial Difficulty\n\nAs  part of its  credit risk  management, the  Corporation  may modify a loan agreement with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties through  a  refinancing  or restructuring of the borrower's loan agreement (modification programs).\n\nThe Corporation uses various indicators to identify borrowers in  financial  difficulty. Generally, consumer loan  borrowers  that are delinquent and commercial loan borrowers that are currently nonperforming or are more-likely-than-not to become nonperforming in the next six months at the modification date are  the  primary criteria  used  to  identify borrowers  who  are experiencing financial difficulty.\n\nIf a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and their loan is modified, and they are current at the time of modification, the loan  generally remains  a  performing  loan  as  long  as  there  is demonstrated  performance  prior to the  modification  and payment in full under the  modified  terms  is  expected. Otherwise, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, excluding fully-insured  consumer real  estate loans, until  there  is  sustained  repayment performance  for a reasonable period.\n\nModifications  that do  not impact the  contractual  payment terms, such  as  covenant waivers, insignificant payment deferrals, and  any modifications  made  to  loans  carried  at fair value, LHFS and leases are not included in the disclosures.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nThe  following  modification  programs  are  offered  for consumer real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications represented 0.26 percent and 0.34 percent of outstanding  residential  mortgage  and  home  equity loans  at December 31, 2023.\n\nForbearance  and  Other Payment  Plans: Forbearance  plans generally consist of the Corporation suspending the borrower's payments for a defined period with those payments then due at the conclusion of the forbearance period. The aging status of a loan is generally frozen when it enters into a forbearance plan. Alternatively, the Corporation may offer the borrower a payment plan, which  allows  the  borrower to  repay past due  amounts through  payments  over a  defined  period. At December 31, 2023, the  amortized  cost of residential  mortgage  loans  that were  modified  through  these  plans  was  $429  million. The amortized cost of home equity loans that were modified through these  plans  during  the  same  periods  was  $57  million. The weighted-average duration of residential mortgage loan modifications  was  approximately 8  months  for 2023. The weighted-average  duration  for home  equity loan  modifications was  approximately 9  months. The  total  forborne  payments  for residential  mortgage  loan  modifications  was  $19  million  for 2023. For the  same  period, the  total  forborne  payments  for home  equity modifications  was  $6  million. If a  borrower is unable  to  fulfill  their obligations  under the  forbearance  plans, they may be offered a trial or permanent modification.\n\nTrial  Modifications : Trial  modification plans generally consist of the  Corporation  offering  a  borrower modified  loan  terms  that\n\nreduce  their contractual  payments  temporarily over a  three-tofour-month trial period. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during the trial period and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become permanent. At December 31, 2023, the  amortized  cost of residential  mortgage  loans  entering  trial  modifications  was $116 million. The amortized cost of home equity loans entering trial modifications during the same period was $34 million.\n\nPermanent  Modifications : Permanent modifications include borrowers that have completed a trial modification and have had their contractual payment terms permanently modified, as well as borrowers that proceed directly to a permanent modification without a  trial  period. In a  permanent modification, the borrower's  payment terms  are  typically modified  in  more  than one  manner but generally include  a  term extension  and  an interest rate  reduction. At times, the  permanent modification may also include principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest amounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the terms that give  the  borrower an  improved  ability to  meet the  contractual obligations. At December 31, 2023, the  amortized  cost of residential  mortgage  loans  that were  granted  a  permanent modification  was  $154  million. The  amortized  cost of home equity loans  that were  granted  a  permanent modification  was $31  million. The  term extensions  granted  for residential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and can be up to 30 years, but are mostly in the range of 1 to 20 years for both residential mortgage and home equity loans. The weighted-average term extension of permanent modifications for residential  mortgage loans was 9.9 years for 2023, while  the  weighted-average  interest rate  reduction  was 1.41 percent. For the same period, the weighted-average term extension  of permanent modifications  for home  equity loans was  17.7  years, while  the  weighted-average  interest rate reduction was 2.74 percent. Principal forgiveness and payment deferrals were insignificant during 2023.\n\nFor consumer real estate borrowers in financial difficulty that received  a  forbearance, trial  or permanent modification, there were no commitments to lend additional funds at December 31, 2023. Borrowers with a home equity line of credit that received a  forbearance  plan  could  have  all  or a  portion  of their lines reinstated  in  the  future  if they cure  their payment default and meet certain Bank conditions.\n\nChapter 7  Discharges: If a  borrower's  consumer real  estate obligation is discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, the  contractual  payment terms  of the  loan  are  not modified, although they can no longer be enforced against the individual borrower. The  Corporation's  ability to  collect amounts  due  on the loan is limited to enforcement against the property through the foreclosure and sale of the collateral. The Corporation will only pursue  foreclosure  upon  default by the  borrower, and otherwise will recover pursuant to the loan terms or at the time of a  sale. Residential  mortgage  and  home  equity loans  that were granted a Chapter 7 discharge were insignificant for 2023.\n\nThe Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess  effectiveness  of modification  programs. Defaults  of modified  residential  mortgage  and  home  equity loans  since January 1, 2023  totaled  $287  million  during  2023.

The carrying  value  of consumer real  estate  loans, including  fullyinsured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process  at December 31, 2023  and  2022  was  $633  million and  $871  million. During  2023  and  2022, the  Corporation reclassified  $106  million  and  $190  million  of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon  foreclosure  of certain government-guaranteed  loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications  represent non-cash  investing  activities  and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Credit Card and Other Consumer\n\nCredit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6 months to 72  months. As  of December 31, 2023, substantially all payment plans provided to customers had a 60-month term. In certain  circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as  well  as  through  third-party renegotiation  agencies  that provide solutions to customers' entire unsecured debt structures  (external  programs). The  December 31, 2023 amortized  cost of credit card  and  other consumer loans  that were modified through these programs during 2023 was $598 million. The  weighted-average  interest rate  reduction  for the modifications was 19.02 percent, and principal forgiveness was $61 million during 2023.\n\nThe Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess  effectiveness  of modification  programs. During  2023, defaults of modified credit card and other consumer loans since January 1, 2023  were  insignificant. Of the  $598  million in modified  credit card  and  other consumer loans  to  borrowers experiencing  financial  difficulty as  of December 31, 2023, $491 million were  current, $59  million were  30-89  days  past due, and  $48  million  were  greater than  90  days  past due. These  modifications  represented  0.29  percent of outstanding credit card and other consumer loans at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Commercial Loans\n\nModifications  of loans  to  commercial  borrowers  experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation's loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work through  financial  difficulties, often  to  avoid  foreclosure  or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower's individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while  mitigating  the  Corporation's  risk  exposure. Commercial modifications  are  primarily term extensions  and  payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Bank forbearing its  contractual  right to  collect certain  payments  or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a  defined  period  of time. Reductions  in  interest rates  and  principal  forgiveness  occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in  connection  with  foreclosure, short sales  or other settlement agreements, leading  to  termination  or sale  of the loan. The  table  below  provides  the  ending  amortized  cost of commercial loans modified during 2023.\n\n## Commercial Loans - Modifications to Borrowers in Financial Difficulty\n\n|                        | Term Extension               | Forbearances                 | Interest Rate Reduction      | Total                        |\n|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in Millions)  | Year ended December 31, 2023 | Year ended December 31, 2023 | Year ended December 31, 2023 | Year ended December 31, 2023 |\n| U.S. commercial        | $ 1,016                      | $ 30                         | $ -                          | $ 1,046                      |\n| Non-U.S. commercial    | 136                          | -                            | 24                           | $ 160                        |\n| Commercial real estate | 1,656                        | 416                          | -                            | $ 2,072                      |\n| Total                  | $ 2,808                      | $ 446                        | $ 24                         | $ 3,278                      |\n\nTerm extensions granted increased the weighted-average life of the  impacted  loans  by 1.6  years  during  2023. The deferral period for loan payments can vary, but are mostly in the range of 8  months  to  24  months. The  weighted-average  interest rate reduction was 0.57 percent in 2023. Modifications of loans to troubled  borrowers  for Commercial  Lease  Financing  and  U.S. Small Business Commercial were not significant during 2023.\n\nThe Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess  effectiveness  of modification  programs. Defaults  of Commercial  loans  modified  in  2023  were  $159  million. The following  table  provides  aging  information  as  of December 31, 2023 for commercial loans modified in 2023.",

The  following discussion  reflects  loans  that were  considered  TDRs  prior to January 1, 2023. For more  information  on  TDR  accounting policies, see Note  1  -  Summary  of Significant  Accounting Principles.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate\n\nThe  table  below  presents  the  December 31, 2022  unpaid principal  balance, carrying  value, and  average  pre-  and  postmodification  interest rates  of consumer real  estate  loans  that were  modified  in  TDRs  during  2022  and  2021. The  following Consumer Real  Estate  portfolio  segment tables  include  loans that were initially classified as TDRs during the period and also loans  that had  previously been  classified  as  TDRs  and  were modified again during the period. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, remaining  commitments  to  lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate - TDRs Entered into During 2022 and 2021\n\n|                       | Unpaid  Principal  Balance   | Carrying  Value   | Pre- Modification  Interest Rate   | Post- Modification  Interest Rate (1)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions) | December 31, 2022            | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2022                  | December 31, 2022                       |\n| Residential mortgage  | $  1,144                     | $  1,015          | 3.52 %                             | 3.40 %                                  |\n| Home equity           | 238                          | 191               | 4.61                               | 4.65                                    |\n| Total                 | $  1,382                     | $  1,206          | 3.71                               | 3.62                                    |\n|                       | December 31, 2021            | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2021                  | December 31, 2021                       |\n| Residential mortgage  | $  891                       | $  788            | 3.48 %                             | 3.38 %                                  |\n| Home equity           | 107                          | 77                | 3.60                               | 3.59                                    |\n| Total                 | $  998                       | $  865            | 3.49                               | 3.41                                    |\n\nThe table below presents the December 31, 2022 and 2021 carrying value for consumer real estate loans that were modified in a TDR during 2022 and 2021, by type of modification.\n\n## Consumer Real Estate - Modification Programs\n\n|                                              | TDRs Entered into During   | TDRs Entered into During   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                        | 2022                       | 2021                       |\n| Modifications under government programs      | $  2                       | $  4                       |\n| Modifications under proprietary programs     | 1,100                      | 774                        |\n| Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1) | 14                         | 33                         |\n| Trial modifications                          | 90                         | 54                         |\n| Total modifications                          | $  1,206                   | $  865                     |\n\nThe table below presents the carrying value of consumer real estate loans that entered into payment default during 2022 and 2021 that were modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default.

Cash  and  non-cash  proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were  $16.3  billion, $32.0  billion and  $43.6  billion for 2023, 2022  and  2021, respectively. Cash  used  for originations  and purchases  of LHFS  totaled  $15.6  billion, $24.9  billion and $37.3  billion for 2023, 2022 and  2021, respectively. Also included were non-cash net transfers into LHFS of $632 million during  2023, $1.9  billion during  2022, primarily driven  by the transfer of a $1.6 billion affinity card loan portfolio to held for sale  that was  sold  in  October 2022, and  $808  million during 2021.\n\n## Accrued Interest Receivable\n\nAccrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans heldfor-sale at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOutstanding  credit card  loan  balances  include  unpaid principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within  60  days  after receipt of notification  of death  or bankruptcy, or upon  confirmation  of fraud. During  2023  and 2022, the Corporation reversed $584 million and $332 million of interest and  fee  income  against the  income  statement line item in  which  it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the principal balance of the loan.\n\nFor the  outstanding  residential  mortgage, home  equity, direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances classified as nonperforming during 2023 and 2022, interest and fee  income  reversed  at the  time  the  loans  were  classified  as nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the Corporation's  nonperforming  loan  policies, see Note  1  Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is estimated using quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of factors, such as  historical  loss  experience, the  current credit quality of the portfolio  and  an  economic outlook  over the  life  of the  loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected  in the  quantitative  methods  or the  economic assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking information through the use  of several  macroeconomic scenarios  in  determining  the",

        "page_content": "weighted  economic outlook  over the  forecasted  life  of the assets. These scenarios include  key macroeconomic variables such  as  gross  domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are  chosen  each  quarter and  the  weighting  given  to  each scenario  depend  on  a  variety of factors  including  recent economic events, leading  economic indicators, internal  and third-party economist views, and  industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles .\n\nThe  December 31, 2023  estimate  for allowance  for credit losses  was  based  on  various  economic scenarios, including  a baseline  scenario  derived  from consensus  estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside  scenario  reflecting  persistent inflation  and  interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the  severely adverse  scenario  used  in  stress  testing  and  an upside  scenario  that considers  the  potential  for improvement above  the  baseline  scenario. The  overall  weighted  economic outlook of the above scenarios has improved compared to the weighted  economic outlook  estimated  as  of December 31, 2022. The  weighted  economic outlook  assumes  that the  U.S. average  unemployment rate  will  be  just below  five  percent by the  fourth  quarter of 2024  and  will  remain  near this  level through  the  fourth  quarter of 2025. The  weighted  economic outlook assumes a mild recession in the first half of 2024 with U.S. real  gross  domestic product forecasted  to  grow  at 0.3 percent and at 1.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses increased $329 million from December 31, 2022 to  $14.6  billion  at December 31, 2023, which  included  a  $1.3  billion  reserve  increase  related  to  the consumer portfolio and a $942 million reserve decrease related\n\nto  the  commercial  portfolio. The  increase  in  the  allowance reflected a reserve build in the Corporation's consumer portfolio primarily due  to  credit card  loan  growth  and  asset quality, partially offset by a  reserve  release  in  the  Corporation's commercial portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions applicable to the commercial portfolio. The  allowance  also  includes  the  impact of the accounting change to remove the recognition and measurement guidance  on  TDRs, which  reduced  the  allowance  for credit losses by $243 million on January 1, 2023. The change in the allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of $660 million in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a decrease  of $331  million  in  the  reserve  for unfunded  lending commitments. The  provision  for credit losses  increased  $1.9 billion  to  an  expense  of $4.4  billion  in  2023  compared  to  an expense of $2.5 billion in 2022 and to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021. The increase in provision for credit losses in 2023 was driven by the Corporation's consumer portfolio primarily due to credit card  loan  growth  and  asset quality, partially offset by improved macroeconomic conditions that primarily benefited the Corporation's commercial  portfolio. The  increase  in the provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties.\n\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the  fair value  option  increased  $10.2  billion  in  2023 driven by consumer loans, which increased $3.7 billion driven by credit card, partially offset by declines  in  securities-based lending. Commercial  loans  increased  $6.5  billion  driven  by broad-based growth.\n\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed in the following table.",

The  Corporation  routinely securitizes  loans  and  debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization  vehicle  such  that the  assets  are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available  to  satisfy its  obligations. These  assets  can  only be used  to  settle  obligations  of the  trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in  other VIEs  including  CDOs, investment vehicles  and  other entities. For more information on the Corporation's use of VIEs, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.\n\nThe tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated  and  unconsolidated  VIEs  at December 31, 2023 and  2022  in  situations  where  the  Corporation  has  a  loan  or security interest and  involvement with  transferred  assets  or if the Corporation otherwise has an additional interest in the VIE. The  tables  also  present the  Corporation's  maximum loss exposure  at December 31, 2023 and 2022 resulting  from its\n\ninvolvement with  consolidated  VIEs  and  unconsolidated  VIEs. The  Corporation's  maximum loss  exposure  is  based  on  the unlikely event that all  of the  assets  in  the  VIEs  become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with  assets  recorded  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet but also potential losses associated  with  off-balance sheet commitments, such  as  unfunded  liquidity commitments  and other contractual  arrangements. The  Corporation's  maximum loss  exposure  does  not include  losses  previously recognized through write-downs of assets.\n\nThe  Corporation  invests  in  ABS, CLOs  and  other similar investments issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement other than a loan or debt security issued by the  VIE. In  addition, the  Corporation  also  enters  into  certain commercial  lending  arrangements  that may utilize  VIEs  for activities secondary to the lending arrangement, for example to hold  collateral. The  Corporation's  maximum loss  exposure  to these  VIEs  is  the  investment balances. These  securities  and loans are included in Note 4 - Securities or Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses and are not included in the following tables.\n\nThe  Corporation  did  not provide  financial  support to consolidated  or unconsolidated  VIEs  during  2023, 2022  and",

Securitization  usually occurs  in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation  may also  securitize  loans  held  in  its  residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to  time, securitize  commercial  mortgages  it originates  or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the  loans  it securitizes. Further, the  Corporation  may retain beneficial  interests  in  the  securitization  trusts  including  senior and  subordinate  securities  and  equity tranches  issued  by the trusts. Except as  described  in Note  12  -  Commitments  and Contingencies , the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse  to  the  securitization  trusts  other than  standard representations and warranties.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  select information  related  to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## First-lien Mortgage Securitizations\n\n|                                             | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Residential Mortgage - Agency   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   | Commercial Mortgage   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                       | 2023                            | 2022                            | 2021                            | 2023                  | 2022                  | 2021                  |\n| Proceeds from loan sales  (1)               | $ 4,513                         | $  8,084                        | $  6,664                        | $ 2,132               | $  5,853              | $  10,874             |\n| Gains (losses) on securitizations  (2)      | (15)                            | 8                               | 9                               | 44                    | 46                    | 156                   |\n| Repurchases from securitization trusts  (3) | 33                              | 53                              | 756                             | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n\nThe Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization  of consumer real  estate  loans. The  unpaid principal  balance  of loans  serviced  for investors, including residential  mortgage  and  home  equity loans, totaled  $92.7 billion  and  $100.1  billion at December 31, 2023 and  2022. Servicing  fee  and  ancillary fee  income  on  serviced  loans  was $248 million, $274 million and $392 million during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans  serviced  for others  and  loans  held  for investment, were $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements .\n\n## Home Equity Loans\n\nThe Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in home equity securitization  trusts  to  which  it transferred  home equity loans. In  addition, the  Corporation  may be  obligated  to\n\nprovide  subordinate  funding  to  the  trusts  during  a  rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss  exposure  in  the  preceding  table. The  charges  that will ultimately be  recorded  as  a  result of the  rapid  amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.\n\n## Mortgage and Home Equity Securitizations\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential  mortgage  securitization  trusts  with  total  assets  of $685 million and $784 million, with no significant deconsolidations in 2021.\n\nThe following table summarizes select information related to mortgage  and  home  equity securitization  trusts  in  which  the Corporation  held  a  variable  interest  and  had  continuing involvement at December 31, 2023 and 2022.",

The loans are sold  on  a  non-recourse  basis  to  consolidated  trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or proceeds from securities  issued  to  third  parties, depending  on  the securitization structure. The Corporation's continuing involvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various subordinated interests, including  an  undivided  seller's  interest in  the  credit card receivables and owning certain retained interests.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $16.6 billion and $14.6 billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities  that were  issued  to  third-party investors  from the  trusts  totaled  $7.8  billion and $4.2 billion, which are included in long-term debt.\n\n## Resecuritization Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  transfers  securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization  VIEs  generally at the  request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization  trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.\n\nThe Corporation resecuritized $8.6 billion, $21.8 billion and $28.9  billion  of securities  during  2023, 2022  and  2021, respectively. Securities  transferred  into  resecuritization  VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded\n\nin market making and similar activities prior to the resecuritization  and, accordingly, no  gain  or loss  on  sale  was recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were recognized  at their fair value  of $2.4  billion, $2.4  billion  and $2.2  billion  during  2023, 2022  and  2021, respectively. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, substantially all  of the securities were classified  as  trading  account assets. Substantially all  of the trading account securities carried at fair value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Customer VIEs\n\nCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked  note  VIEs, repackaging  VIEs  and  asset acquisition  VIEs, which  are  typically created  on  behalf of customers  who  wish  to  obtain  market or credit exposure  to  a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.\n\nThe Corporation's involvement in the VIE is limited to its loss exposure. The  Corporation's  maximum loss exposure  to consolidated  and  unconsolidated  customer VIEs  totaled  $952 million  and  $914  million  at December 31, 2023  and  2022, including  the  notional  amount of derivatives  to  which  the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation's investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs.\n\n## Municipal Bond Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation  administers  municipal  bond  trusts  that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate  municipal  bonds. The  trusts obtain  financing  by issuing  floating-rate  trust certificates  that reprice  on  a  weekly or other short-term basis  to  third-party investors.\n\nThe  Corporation's  liquidity commitments  to  unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was  transferor, totaled  $1.7  billion and  $2.5  billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

        "page_content": "life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2023 was 12.2 years. There were no significant write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  receives  fees  for structuring  CDO  VIEs, which hold  diversified  pools  of fixed-income  securities, typically corporate  debt or ABS, which  the  CDO  VIEs  fund  by issuing multiple  tranches  of debt and  equity securities. CDOs  are generally managed  by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation  typically transfers  assets  to  these  CDOs, holds securities  issued  by the  CDOs  and  may be  a  derivative counterparty to  the  CDOs. The  Corporation  maximum loss exposure  to  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  CDOs  totaled $80 million and $197 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Investment VIEs\n\nThe  Corporation  sponsors, invests  in  or provides  financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired  investment profile  to  investors  or the  Corporation. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation's consolidated investment VIEs  had  total  assets  of $472  million  and  $854\n\nmillion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated  VIEs  with  total  assets  of $18.4  billion  and $14.8  billion at December 31, 2023  and  2022. The Corporation's  maximum loss  exposure  associated  with  both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.6 billion  and  $3.0  billion  at December 31, 2023  and  2022 comprised  primarily of on-balance  sheet assets  less  nonrecourse liabilities.\n\n## Leveraged Lease Trusts\n\nThe  Corporation's  net investment in  consolidated  leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and  2022. The  trusts  hold  long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the  trusts  and  holds  a  significant residual  interest. The  net investment represents the Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease  investments  become  worthless. Debt issued  by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maximum loss  exposure and assets held by the Corporation that related to other assetbacked VIEs at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Other Asset-backed VIEs\n\n|                                       | Credit Card and Automobile  (1)   | Credit Card and Automobile  (1)   | Resecuritization Trusts and Customer VIEs   | Resecuritization Trusts and Customer VIEs   | Municipal Bond Trusts  and CDOs   | Municipal Bond Trusts  and CDOs   | Investment VIEs and Leveraged Lease Trusts   | Investment VIEs and Leveraged Lease Trusts   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                       | December 31                       | December 31                       | December 31                                 | December 31                                 | December 31                       | December 31                       | December 31                                  | December 31                                  |\n| (Dollars in millions)                 | 2023                              | 2022                              | 2023                                        | 2022                                        | 2023                              | 2022                              | 2023                                         | 2022                                         |\n| Unconsolidated VIEs                   |                                   |                                   |                                             |                                             |                                   |                                   |                                              |                                              |\n| Maximum loss exposure                 | $  -

The  total  assets  of these  unconsolidated  tax credit VIEs were $84.1 billion and $74.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing  member and  has  control  over the significant activities  of the  VIE. As  an  investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are allocated\n\nto  the  Corporation, as  provided  by the  U.S. Internal  Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the Corporation's Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which varies based on the type of investments. Tax credits from investments in affordable housing are  recognized  ratably over a  term of up to 10 years, and tax credits from renewable energy investments are recognized either at inception  for transactions  electing  Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) or as  energy is  produced  for transactions  electing Production Tax Credits (PTCs), which is generally up to a 10-year",

The volume and types of investments held by the Corporation will influence the amount of tax credits recognized each period.\n\nThe  Corporation's  equity investments  in  affordable  housing and  other projects  totaled  $15.8  billion  and  $14.7  billion  at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which included unfunded capital contributions of $7.2 billion and $6.9 billion that are probable to  be  paid  over the  next five  years. The  Corporation  may be asked  to  invest additional  amounts  to  support a  troubled affordable  housing  project. Such  additional  investments  have not been and are not expected to be significant. During 2023, 2022  and  2021, the  Corporation  recognized  tax credits  and other tax benefits  related  to  affordable  housing  and  other tax credit equity investments of $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, and  reported  pretax losses  in  other income  of $1.5 billion, $1.2  billion  and  $1.1  billion. The  Corporation's  equity investments  in  renewable  energy totaled  $14.2  billion and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition, the Corporation  had  unfunded  capital  contributions  for renewable energy investments  of $6.2  billion  and  $1.9  billion  at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which are contingent on various conditions  precedent to  funding  over the  next two  years. The Corporation's  risk  of loss  is  generally mitigated  by policies requiring the project to qualify for the expected tax credits prior to  making  its  investment. During  2023, 2022  and  2021, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits related to  renewable  energy equity investments  of $4.0  billion, $2.9 billion  and  $3.1  billion and  reported  pretax losses  in  other income  of $3.1  billion, $2.1  billion  and  $2.2  billion. The Corporation  may also  enter into  power purchase  agreements with renewable energy tax credit entities.\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  select information  related  to unconsolidated tax credit VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Unconsolidated Tax Credit VIEs\n\n|                              | December 31   | December 31   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)        | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Maximum loss exposure        | $ 30,040      | $  28,277     |\n| On-balance sheet assets      |               |               |\n| All other assets             | 30,040        | $  28,277     |\n| Total                        | $ 30,040      | $  28,277     |\n| On-balance sheet liabilities |               |               |\n| All other liabilities        | 7,254         | $  6,907      |\n| Total                        | $ 7,254       | $  6,907      |\n| Total assets of VIEs         | $ 84,148      | $  74,791     |\n\n## NOTE 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe  table  below  presents  goodwill  balances  by business segment at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

These  financing  agreements  (also referred to as 'matched-book transactions') are to accommodate  customers, obtain  securities  to  cover short positions  and  finance  inventory positions. The  Corporation elects  to  account for certain  securities  financing  agreements under the  fair value  option. For more  information  on  the  fair value option, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option .\n\n## Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements\n\nSubstantially all of the  Corporation's  securities  financing activities  are  transacted  under legally enforceable  master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending  agreements  that give  the  Corporation, in  the  event of\n\ndefault by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and  to  offset receivables  and  payables  with  the  same counterparty. The  Corporation  offsets  securities  financing transactions  with  the  same  counterparty on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.\n\nThe Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities  financing  agreements  included  on  the  Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased  under agreements  to  resell, and  in  federal  funds purchased and securities  loaned  or sold  under agreements to repurchase  at December 31, 2023  and  2022. Balances  are presented  on  a  gross  basis, prior to  the  application  of counterparty netting. Gross  assets  and  liabilities  are  adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable  master netting  agreements.

For securities  loaned  transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To  determine  whether the  market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional  collateral  or may receive  or return  collateral pledged when  appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities  loaned  transactions  are  generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding  from a  diverse  group  of counterparties, providing  a range  of securities  collateral  and  pursuing  longer durations, when appropriate.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nThe Corporation classifies borrowings with an original maturity of less than one year as short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the majority of short-term borrowings consisted of Federal Home Loan  Bank  advances, which totaled $13.2  billion and $9.2 billion, and commercial paper, which totaled $13.1 billion and $9.9 billion.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is  permitted  by contract or practice  to  sell  or repledge. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of this collateral was $911.3 billion and $827.6 billion, of which $870.9 billion and $764.1 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this  collateral  is  securities  borrowed  or purchased  under agreements to resell.\n\nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans  as  collateral  in  transactions  that include  repurchase agreements, securities  loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and  loan  notes, and  short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties  to  the  transactions, is  parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nIn  certain  cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated  VIEs  where  those  restricted  assets  serve  as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet in  Assets  of Consolidated VIEs.\n\nIn addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with  its  derivative  contracts. Required  collateral  levels  vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the  Corporation  accepts  collateral  in  the  form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based  on  provisions  contained  in  master netting  agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets. The  Corporation  also  pledges  collateral  on  its  own derivative  positions  which  can  be  applied  against derivative liabilities. For more information on the collateral of derivatives, see Note 3 - Derivatives.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nAt December 31, 2023  and  2022, the  Corporation  held restricted  cash  included  within  cash  and  cash  equivalents  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $5.6 billion and $7.6 billion, predominantly related  to  cash  segregated  in  compliance  with securities  regulations  and  cash  held  on  deposit with  central banks to meet reserve requirements.",

During 2022, the Corporation issued $66.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $44.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America Corporation, $10.0  billion  of notes  issued  by Bank  of America, N.A. and $11.8 billion of other debt.\n\nDuring  2023, the  Corporation  had  total  long-term debt maturities  and  redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of $42.7  billion consisting  of $25.3  billion  for Bank  of America  Corporation, $10.5 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.9 billion of other debt. During  2022, the  Corporation  had  total  long-term debt maturities  and  redemptions  in  the  aggregate  of $33.3  billion consisting  of $19.8  billion  for Bank  of America  Corporation, $9.9 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.6 billion of other debt.\n\nBank  of America  Corporation  and  Bank  of America, N.A. maintain various U.S. and non-U.S. debt programs to offer both senior and subordinated notes. The notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the  amount of foreign currency-denominated  debt translated into U.S. dollars included in total long-term debt was $49.8 billion and $46.7 billion. Foreign currency contracts may be  used  to  convert certain  foreign  currency-denominated  debt into U.S. dollars.\n\nThe  weighted-average  effective  interest rates  for total  longterm debt (excluding  senior structured  notes), total  fixed-rate\n\ndebt and  total  floating-rate  debt were  3.70  percent, 3.55 percent and 5.21 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023, and 3.27 percent, 3.23 percent and 4.14 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2022. The  Corporation's  ALM activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates  the  use  of interest rate  contracts  to  manage fluctuations  in  earnings  caused  by interest rate  volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the impacts of derivative transactions.\n\nThe  following  table  shows  the  carrying  value  for aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of December 31, 2023. Included in the table are certain structured notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put options) at specified  dates  prior to  maturity. Other structured notes  have  coupon  or repayment terms  linked  to  the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the value  of a  referenced  index or security. In  both  cases, the Corporation  or a  subsidiary may be  required  to  settle  the obligation  for cash  or other securities  prior to  the  contractual maturity date. These  borrowings  are  reflected  in  the  table  as maturing at their contractual maturity date.",

These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk  and  are  subject to  the  same  credit and  market risk limitation  reviews  as  those  instruments  recorded  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Credit Extension Commitments\n\nThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to  meet the  financing  needs  of its  customers. The  following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments  net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated  or participated) to  other financial  institutions. The distributed  amounts  were  $10.3  billion  and  $10.4  billion  at December 31, 2023  and  2022. The  carrying  value  of the Corporation's  credit extension  commitments  at December 31, 2023  and  2022, excluding  commitments  accounted  for under\n\nthe  fair value  option, was  $1.2  billion and  $1.6  billion, which predominantly related  to  the  reserve  for unfunded  lending commitments. The  carrying  value  of these  commitments  is classified  in  accrued  expenses  and  other liabilities  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified  rates  and  maturities. Certain  of these  commitments have  adverse  change  clauses  that help  to  protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower's ability to pay.\n\nThe  following  table  includes  the  notional  amount of commitments of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2023  and  2022  that are  accounted  for under the  fair value option. However, the  table  excludes  the  cumulative  net fair value for these commitments of $67 million and $110 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, which is classified  in  accrued expenses  and  other liabilities. For more  information  regarding the  Corporation's  loan  commitments  accounted  for under the fair value option, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option.",

A  significant portion  of these  commitments  will  expire within the next 12 months.\n\nAt December 31, 2023  and  2022, the  Corporation  had  a commitment to  originate  or purchase  up  to  $4.0  billion  and $3.7  billion  on  a  rolling  12-month  basis, of auto  loans  and leases  from a  strategic partner. This  commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice.\n\nAt December 31, 2023  and  2022, the  Corporation  had unfunded equity investment commitments of $477 million and $571 million.\n\nAs  a  Federal  Reserve  member bank, the  Corporation  is required to subscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal  Reserve  district bank, which  pays  cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. At both December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation paid $5.4 billion for half of its subscribed shares, with  the  remaining  half subject to  call  by the  Federal Reserve district bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\n## Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection\n\nThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to  insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2023  and 2022, the  notional  amount of these  guarantees  totaled  $3.8 billion and $4.3 billion. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation's  maximum exposure  related  to  these  guarantees totaled $577 million and $632 million, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2037.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various  agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon  payment may become  due  if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification  clauses  are  often  standard  contractual  terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements  typically contain  an  early termination  clause  that permits  the  Corporation  to  exit the  agreement upon  these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification  agreements  is  difficult to  assess  for several reasons, including  the  occurrence  of an  external  event, the inability to  predict future  changes  in  tax and  other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language  and  the  timing  of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made  under these guarantees  have  been  de  minimis. The  Corporation  has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.",

        "page_content": "## Merchant Services\n\nThe Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any reversed charges  that cannot be  collected  from the  merchants  due  to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the  merchants  or merchant acquirers, the  Corporation may be  held  liable  for these  reversed  charges. The  ability to reverse  a  charge  is  primarily governed  by the  applicable payment network rules and regulations, which include, but are not limited  to, the  type  of charge, type  of payment used  and time limits. The total amount of transactions subject to reversal under payment network rules and regulations processed for the preceding  six-month  period, which  was  approximately $395 billion, is  an  estimate  of the  Corporation's  maximum potential exposure as of December 31, 2023. The Corporation's risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has  purchased  goods  or services  for future  delivery. The Corporation  mitigates  this  risk  by requiring  cash  deposits, guarantees, letters  of credit or other types  of collateral  from certain  merchants. The  Corporation's  reserves  for contingent losses, and  the  losses  incurred  related  to  the  merchant processing activity were not significant.\n\n## Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges  and  clearinghouses, both  in  the  U.S. and  other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a  pro-rata  share  of the  losses  incurred  by some  of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss  scenarios. The  Corporation's  potential  obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and  clearinghouses, to  the  amount (or multiple) of the Corporation's  contribution  to  the  guarantee  fund  or, in  limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying  the  guarantee  fund. The  Corporation's  maximum potential  exposure  under these  membership  agreements  is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote.\n\n## Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services\n\nIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the  Corporation  performs  securities  clearance  and  settlement services  with  other brokerage  firms  and  clearinghouses  on behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation's obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients' accounts and the  accounts  of their customers, as  well  as  by any proceeds received  from the  transactions  cleared  and  settled  by the Corporation  on  behalf of clients  or their customers. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the  Corporation  to  incur material  losses  pursuant to  these arrangements is remote.\n\n## Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation  Sponsored  Member Repo Program\n\nThe  Corporation  acts  as  a  sponsoring  member in  a  repo program whereby the  Corporation  clears  certain  eligible  resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division  of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients  that are  sponsored  members  in  accordance  with  the Fixed  Income  Clearing  Corporation's  rules. As  part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and\n\nperformance  of its  sponsored  members  to  the  Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation's guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the  potential  for the  Corporation  to  incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation's maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $132.5 billion and $59.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Other Guarantees\n\nIn  the  normal  course  of business, the  Corporation  periodically guarantees  the  obligations  of its  affiliates  in  a  variety of transactions  including  ISDA-related  transactions  and  non-ISDA related  transactions  such  as  commodities  trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.\n\n## Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees  the  securities  issued  by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities and capital securities issued  by certain  statutory trust companies  that are  100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.\n\n## Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees\n\nThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in  the  form of RMBS guaranteed  by the  GSEs  or by GNMA  in  the  case  of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed  and  Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In  addition, in  prior years, legacy companies  and  certain subsidiaries  sold  pools  of first-lien  residential  mortgage  loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation  or certain  of its  subsidiaries  or legacy companies make and have made various representations  and  warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage  loans  or to  otherwise  make  whole  or provide indemnification  or other remedies  to  sponsors, investors, securitization  trusts, guarantors, insurers  or other parties (collectively, repurchases).\n\n## Unresolved Repurchase Claims\n\nUnresolved  representations  and  warranties  repurchase  claims represent the  notional  amount of repurchase  claims  made  by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In  the  case  of first-lien  mortgages, the  claim amount is  often  significantly greater than  the  expected  loss  amount due  to  the  benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments.\n\nThe  notional  amount of unresolved  repurchase  claims  at December 31, 2023  and  2022  was  $5.4  billion  and  $5.5 billion. These balances included $2.2 billion at both December 31, 2023  and  2022 of claims  related  to  loans  in  specific private-label securitization groups  or tranches  where  the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will  otherwise  realize  the  benefit of any repurchase  claims paid.",

        "page_content": "During  2023, the  Corporation  received  $254  million  in  new repurchase  claims  that were  not time-barred. During  2023, $269 million in claims were resolved.\n\n## Reserve and Related Provision\n\nThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate  guarantees  was  $604  million  and  $612  million  at December 31, 2023 and  2022  and  is  included  in  accrued expenses  and  other liabilities  on  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties  reserve  represents  the  Corporation's  best estimate of probable  incurred  losses, is  based  on  its  experience  in previous negotiations, and is subject to  judgment, a  variety of assumptions  and  known  or unknown  uncertainties. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in  excess  of the  amounts  recorded  for these  exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range of possible  loss  in  excess  of the  reserve  for representations and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.\n\n## Other Contingencies\n\nOn  November 16, 2023, the  Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) issued  its  final  rule  to  impose  a  special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) resulting  from the  closure  of Silicon  Valley Bank  and Signature Bank. The special assessment is based on uninsured deposits  as  of December 31, 2022, adjusted  to  exclude  the first $5 billion. Accordingly, in  the  fourth  quarter of 2023, the Corporation  recorded  noninterest expense  of $2.1  billion in other general operating expenses for its estimated assessment amount. The FDIC will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods. The  special  assessment is subject to  change  for any updates  made  by the  FDIC  to  the estimated loss to the DIF, or if the assessments collected from insured  depository institutions  change  due  to  amendments made to their uninsured deposits reported for the December 31, 2022 period. In  the  event of any such  change  resulting  in  an increased assessment, the Corporation could recognize further expense in future periods.\n\n## Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nIn  the  ordinary course  of business, the  Corporation  and  its subsidiaries  are  routinely defendants  in  or parties  to  many pending  and  threatened  legal, regulatory and  governmental actions  and  proceedings. In  view  of the  inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants  seek  very large  or indeterminate  damages  or where the  matters  present novel  legal  theories  or involve  a  large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\n\nAs  a  matter develops, the  Corporation, in  conjunction  with any outside  counsel  handling  the  matter, evaluates  whether such matter presents  a  loss  contingency that is  probable  and estimable, and, for the matters below, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation  continues  to  monitor the  matter for further developments  that could  affect the  amount of the  accrued\n\nliability that has  been  previously established. Excluding expenses  of internal  and  external  legal  service  providers, litigation  and  regulatory investigation-related  expense  of $519 million and $1.2 billion was recognized in 2023 and 2022.\n\nFor any matter disclosed  in  this  Note  for which  a  loss  in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess  of an  accrued  liability or where  there  is  no  accrued liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the Corporation's  estimated  range  of possible  loss  is  $0  to  $0.8 billion in excess  of the  accrued  liability, if any, as  of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  accrued  liability and  estimated  range  of possible  loss are  based  upon  currently available  information  and  subject to significant judgment, a  variety of assumptions and known and unknown  uncertainties. The  matters  underlying  the  accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the  current estimate  and  accrual. The estimated  range  of possible  loss  does  not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure.\n\nInformation  is  provided  below  regarding  the  nature  of the litigation  and, where  specified, associated  claimed  damages. Based on current knowledge, and  taking  into  account accrued liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising  from pending  matters, including  the  matters  described below  will  have  a  material  adverse  effect on  the  consolidated financial  condition  or liquidity of the  Corporation. However, in light of the  significant judgment, variety of assumptions  and uncertainties  involved  in  those  matters, some  of which  are beyond  the  Corporation's  control, and  the  very large  or indeterminate  damages  sought in  some  of those  matters, an adverse  outcome  in  one  or more  of those  matters  could  be material to the Corporation's business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause  significant reputational harm.\n\n## Deposit Insurance Assessment\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (District Court) alleging failure  to  pay a  December 15, 2016  invoice  for additional deposit insurance assessments and interest in  the  amount of $542  million  for the  quarters  ending  June  30, 2013  through December 31, 2014. On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to  add  a  claim for additional  deposit insurance  and interest in  the  amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March  31, 2012  through  March  31, 2013. The  FDIC  asserts these  claims  based  on  BANA's  alleged  underreporting  of counterparty exposures  that resulted  in  underpayment of assessments for those quarters, and its Enforcement Section is also  conducting  a  parallel  investigation  related  to  the  same alleged  reporting  error. BANA  disagrees  with  the  FDIC's interpretation  of the  regulations  as  they existed  during  the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC's claims. Pending  final  resolution, BANA  has  pledged  security satisfactory to  the  FDIC  related  to  the  disputed  additional assessment amounts. On  March  27, 2018, the  District Court denied BANA's partial motion to dismiss certain of the  FDIC's claims.\n\nOn April 10, 2023, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation  (Report) for resolving  the  parties' pending summary judgment motions. The  Report recommends granting the  FDIC's  motion  for summary judgment on  BANA's  statutory liability for the unpaid assessments, subject to BANA's statute of limitations defenses to assessments for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013, on which the Report",

The  Report also  recommends  denying  BANA's  counterclaims challenging the adoption of the relevant assessment regulations and  granting  BANA's  motion  for summary judgment on  the FDIC's  claims  for unjust enrichment and  disgorgement. The Report has  been  submitted  to  the  District Court judge  for consideration, and  the  parties  have  filed  objections  to  the recommendations in the Report.\n\n## LIBOR\n\nThe  Corporation, BANA and certain  Merrill  Lynch  entities  have been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons  alleging  that they sustained  losses  on  U.S. dollar LIBOR-based  financial  instruments  as  a  result of collusion  or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs  assert a  variety of claims, including  antitrust, Commodity Exchange  Act, Racketeer Influenced  and  Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble  and  punitive  damages, and  injunctive relief. All  but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates  relating  to  U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court for the  Southern  District of New  York  (District Court). The  District Court has  dismissed  all  RICO  claims, and dismissed  all  manipulation  claims  against Bank  of America entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has also  substantially limited  the  scope  of antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing in  their entirety certain  individual and putative class plaintiffs'\n\nantitrust claims  for lack  of standing. On December 30, 2021, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the  Second  Circuit affirmed  the dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain individual and putative class actions remain pending against the Corporation, BANA  and  certain  Merrill  Lynch  entities. On February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a class  of persons  that purchased  OTC  swaps  and  notes  that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.\n\n## Unemployment Insurance Prepaid Cards\n\nBANA has been named as a defendant in a number of putative class  action, mass  action, and  individual  lawsuits  in  multiple states  related  to  its  administration  of prepaid  debit cards  to distribute  unemployment and  other state  benefits. These lawsuits  generally assert claims  for monetary damages  and injunctive relief.\n\nClass  action  and  mass  action  lawsuits  related  to  the California  program, the  largest program administered  by BANA measured  by total  benefits  and  number of participants, have been consolidated into a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. On May 25, 2023, the  court dismissed  certain  of the  claims  in  the  MDL while  allowing  others  to  proceed, and  plaintiffs  subsequently filed  an  amended  complaint. BANA  filed  a  partial  motion  to dismiss  certain  of the  remaining  claims  in  the  amended complaint in the MDL, which is currently pending.",

The  holders  of the  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  and Series  1  through  5  Preferred  Stock  have  general  voting  rights and vote  together with  the  common  stock. The  holders  of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation's common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation's assets  in  the  event of a  liquidation  or dissolution. With  the exception  of the  Series  B, F and  G  Preferred  Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more semi-annual  or six or more  quarterly dividend  periods, as applicable  (whether consecutive  or not), the  holders  of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a  single  class) will  be  entitled  to  vote  for the  election  of two additional  directors. These  voting  rights  terminate  when  the Corporation  has  paid  in  full  dividends  on  these  series  for at least two  semi-annual  or four quarterly dividend  periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.\n\nThe  7.25%  Non-Cumulative  Perpetual  Convertible  Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call  rights. Each  share  of the  Series  L  Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20 shares of the Corporation's common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of common  stock  exceeds  130  percent of the  then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the  Corporation  will  still  pay any accrued dividends payable.",

As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to  capital  adequacy rules  issued  by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation's banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.\n\nThe  Corporation  and  its  primary banking  entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced  approaches  institutions, the  Corporation  and  its\n\nbanking  entity affiliates  are  required  to  report regulatory riskbased  capital  ratios  and  risk-weighted  assets  under both  the Standardized  and  Advanced  approaches. The  approach  that yields  the  lower ratio  is  used  to  assess  capital  adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.\n\nThe  Corporation  is  required  to  maintain  a  minimum supplementary leverage  ratio  (SLR) of 3.0  percent plus  a leverage  buffer of 2.0  percent in  order to  avoid  certain restrictions  on  capital  distributions  and  discretionary bonus payments  to  executive  officers. The  Corporation's  insured depository institution  subsidiaries  are  required  to  maintain  a minimum 6.0  percent SLR  to  be  considered  well  capitalized under the PCA framework.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  capital  ratios  and  related information  in  accordance  with  Basel  3  Standardized  and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2023 and 2022 for the Corporation and BANA.",

above. Failure  to  meet the minimum requirements  can  lead  to  certain  mandatory and discretionary actions  by regulators  that could  have  a  material adverse  impact on  the  Corporation's  financial  position. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were well capitalized.\n\n## Other Regulatory Matters\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and  2022, the  Corporation  had  cash and  cash  equivalents  in  the  amount of $3.6  billion  and  $5.6 billion, and  securities  with  a  fair value  of $18.0  billion  and $16.6 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations. Cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance  with  securities  regulations  are  a  component of restricted cash. For more information, see Note 10 - Securities Financing  Agreements,  Short-term  Borrowings,  Collateral  and Restricted Cash . In addition, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $23.7  billion  and  $20.7  billion  primarily recorded  in  other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Bank Subsidiary Distributions\n\nThe  primary sources  of funds  for cash  distributions  by the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its bank  subsidiaries, BANA  and  Bank  of America California, N.A. In  2023, the Corporation received dividends of $22.2 billion from BANA and $199 million from Bank of America California, N.A.\n\nThe amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank's net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. In  2024, BANA  can  declare  and  pay dividends  of approximately $12.0 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2024 up to the date of any such  dividend  declaration. Bank  of America  California, N.A. can pay dividends of $66 million in 2024 plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2024 up to the date of any such dividend declaration.",

Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices.\n\nThe Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances  with  participant-selected  investments, applied  at the  time  a  benefit payment is  made  from the  plan that effectively provides  principal  protection  for participant balances  transferred  and  certain  compensation  credits. The Corporation  is  responsible  for funding  any shortfall  on  the guarantee feature.\n\nBenefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits  or interest credits  in  accordance  with  the terms of the plan document.\n\nThe Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits  vested  under a  terminated  U.S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from actual  experience  and  investment performance  of the  annuity assets. The  Corporation  made  no  contribution  under this agreement in  2023 or 2022. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.\n\nThe  Corporation's  noncontributory, nonqualified  pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plans (1)\n\n|                                                  | Qualified Pension Plan   | Qualified Pension Plan   | Non-U.S. Pension Plans   | Non-U.S. Pension Plans   | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans   | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans   | Postretirement Health and Life Plans   | Postretirement Health and Life Plans   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                            | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023                     | 2022                     | 2023                                   | 2022                                   | 2023                                   | 2022                                   |\n| Fair value, January 1                            | $  17,258                | $  22,078                | $  1,728                 | $  3,031                 | $  1,886                               | $  2,585                               | $  107                                 | $  117                                 |\n| Actual return on plan assets                     | 1,436                    | (3,896)                  | 17                       | (898)                    | 103                                    | (332)                                  | 5                                      | 2                                      |\n| Company contributions (withdrawals)              | -

These  plans  are  referred  to  as  the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.\n\nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes  in  the  fair value  of plan  assets, changes  in  the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated  benefit obligation  (ABO) and  the  PBO, and  the weighted-average  assumptions  used  to  determine  benefit obligations  for the  pension  plans  and  postretirement plans  at December 31, 2023  and  2022. The  estimate  of the Corporation's  PBO  associated  with  these  plans  considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions  for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes  rates  that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the  plans. The  decreases  in  the  weighted-average  discount rates  in  2023  resulted  in  an  increase  to  the  PBO  of $511 million at December 31, 2023. The increases in the weightedaverage discount rates  in  2022  resulted  in  a  decrease  to  the PBO  of approximately $5.3  billion  at December 31, 2022. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2023 and 2022 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.",

Net periodic postretirement health  and  life  expense  was determined using the 'projected  unit credit' actuarial  method. For the U.S. Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is  recognized  on  a  level  basis during the year.\n\nAssumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation  and  benefit cost reported  for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care  cost trend  rate  used  to  measure  the  expected  cost of benefits  covered  by the  U.S. Postretirement Health  and  Life Plans  is  6.50  percent for 2024, reducing  in  steps  to  5.00 percent in 2028 and later years.\n\nThe Corporation's net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized  for the  plans  is  sensitive  to  the  discount rate  and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bps decline in discount rates  and  expected  return  on  assets  would  not have had  a  significant impact on  the  net periodic benefit cost for 2023.",

The  Corporation's  policy is  to  invest the  trust assets  in  a  prudent manner for the  exclusive  purpose  of providing  benefits  to  participants  and  defraying  reasonable expenses  of administration. The  Corporation's  investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases  the  ratio  of assets  to  liabilities. The  strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with  ERISA  and  any applicable  regulations  and  laws. The investment strategy utilizes  asset allocation  as  a  principal determinant for establishing  the  risk/return  profile  of the assets. Asset allocation  ranges  are  established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching  the  exposure  of participant-selected investment measures.\n\nThe  assets  of the  Non-U.S. Pension  Plans  are  primarily attributable  to  a  U.K. pension  plan. This  U.K. pension  plan's assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members  are  provided  with  consideration  given  to  the  nature and  the  duration  of the  plans' liabilities. The  selected  asset\n\nallocation strategy is  designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy.\n\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed  through  analysis  of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds' past experience and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using  the  calculated  market-related  value  for the  Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The  expected  return  on  plan  assets  assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets  in  the  Qualified  Pension  Plan, the  Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the  Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health  and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities  structured  such  that asset maturities  match  the duration of the plan's obligations.\n\nThe  target allocations  for 2024  by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table below. Equity securities  for the  Qualified  Pension  Plan  include common  stock  of the  Corporation  in  the  amounts  of $299 million  (1.69  percent of total  plan  assets) and  $296  million (1.72 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## 2024 Target Allocation\n\n|                   | Percentage             | Percentage             | Percentage                           |\n|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Asset Category    | Qualified Pension Plan | Non-U.S. Pension Plans | Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans |\n| Equity securities | 15 - 45%               | 0 - 20%                | 0 - 5%                               |\n| Debt securities   | 40 - 80%               | 40 - 75%               | 95 - 100%                            |\n| Real estate       | 0 - 10%                | 0 - 15%                | 0 - 5%                               |\n| Other             | 0 - 10%                | 10 - 40%               | 0 - 5%                               |\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements .

        "page_content": "## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe  Corporation  maintains  qualified  and  nonqualified  defined contribution retirement plans. The Corporation recorded expense of $1.2 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021 related to the qualified defined  contribution  plans. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, 178  million and  179  million  shares  of the  Corporation's common stock were held by these plans. Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were $166 million, $153 million and $139 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nCertain  non-U.S. employees  are  covered  under defined contribution  pension  plans  that are  separately administered in accordance with local laws.\n\n## NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans\n\nThe Corporation administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of America  Corporation  Equity Plan  (BACEP). Under this  plan, 790  million  shares  of the  Corporation's  common  stock  are authorized to be used for grants of awards.\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, the Corporation granted 115 million and 102 million RSUs to certain employees under the BACEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in  shares of common  stock  of the  Corporation. Certain  RSUs  will  be settled  in  cash  or contain  settlement provisions  that subject these  awards  to  variable  accounting  whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. The RSUs granted in 2023 and 2022 predominantly vest over four years in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries  of the  grant date, provided  that the  employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated  forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible  employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Of the RSUs granted  in  2023  and  2022, 42  million  and  39  million  do  not include  retirement eligibility. For all  other RSUs  granted  to employees  who  are  retirement eligible, they are  deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. The compensation cost for the stockbased plans was $3.1 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, and the related income tax benefit was $733 million, $697 million and  $723  million for 2023, 2022  and  2021, respectively. At December 31, 2023, there  was  an  estimated  $4.0  billion of total  unrecognized compensation cost related to certain sharebased compensation awards that is expected to be recognized generally over a  period  of up  to  four years, with  a  weightedaverage period of 2.5 years.\n\n## Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2.6 billion, $3.4 billion and  $2.3  billion, respectively. The  table  below  presents  the status  at December 31, 2023 of the  share-settled  restricted stock and restricted stock units and changes during 2023.\n\n## Stock-settled Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\n\n|                                  | Shares/Units   | Weighted- average Grant  Date Fair Value   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at January 1, 2023   | 202,559,798    | $  38.60                                   |\n| Granted                          | 112,616,369    | 33.88                                      |\n| Vested                           | (72,958,812)   | 35.94                                      |\n| Canceled                         | (8,707,200)    | 38.30                                      |\n| Outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 233,510,155    | 37.17                                      |\n\n## NOTE 19 Income Taxes\n\nThe  components  of income  tax expense  for 2023, 2022  and 2021 are presented in the table below.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\n| (Dollars in millions)       | 2023    | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Current income tax expense  |         |          |          |\n| U.S. federal                | $ 1,361 | $  1,157 | $  1,076 |\n| U.S. state and local        | 559     | 389      | 775      |\n| Non-U.S.                    | 1,918   | 1,156    | 985      |\n| Total current expense       | 3,838   | 2,702    | 2,836    |\n| Deferred income tax expense |         |          |          |\n| U.S. federal                | (2,241) | 110      | 962      |\n| U.S. state and local        | (53)    | 254      | 491      |\n| Non-U.S.                    | 283     | 375      | (2,291)  |\n| Total deferred expense      | (2,011) | 739      | (838)    |\n| Total income tax expense    | $ 1,827 | $  3,441 | $  1,998 |\n\nTotal income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of items  that are  included  in  OCI each  period. For more information, see Note  14  -  Accumulated  Other Comprehensive Income  (Loss) . Other tax effects  included  in  OCI each  period resulted in an expense of $892 million in 2023 and a benefit of $4.9 billion and $877 million in 2022 and  2021. The increase in  the  federal  deferred  tax benefit was  primarily driven  by increased tax attribute carryforwards related to the Corporation's tax-advantaged investments.\n\nIncome tax expense for 2023, 2022 and 2021 varied from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to  income  before  income  taxes. The  Corporation's  federal statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2023, 2022 and 2021. A reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense, calculated  by applying  the  federal  statutory tax rate, to  the Corporation's actual income tax expense, and the effective tax rates for 2023, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the following table.",

The U.K. net deferred tax assets are primarily net operating losses (NOLs), incurred by the Corporation's U.K. broker-dealer entity in historical  periods, which do not expire  under U.K. tax law  and are  assessed  regularly for impairment. If further U.K. tax law changes  are  enacted, a  corresponding  income  tax adjustment will be made based on the amount of available net deferred tax assets and applicable tax rate changes.\n\nTax credits originate from investments in affordable housing and  renewable  energy partnerships  and  similar entities. Significant increases in the tax credits recognized over the last three  annual  periods  have  been  primarily driven  by the Corporation's continued growth in the volume of investments in wind and solar energy production facilities, consistent with the Corporation's commitment to  support the  transition  to  a  lower carbon  economy.

Included in the UTB balance are some  items  the  recognition  of which  would  not affect the effective  tax rate, such  as  the  tax effect of certain  temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion  of gross  non-U.S. UTBs  that would  be  offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.\n\nIt is reasonably possible that the UTB balance may decrease by as much as $109 million during the next 12 months, since resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition.\n\nThe  Corporation  recognized  an  interest expense  of $35 million in 2023 and interest benefit of $50 million in 2022 and interest expense of $32 million in 2021. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation's accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was $134 million and $107 million.\n\nThe  Corporation  files  income  tax returns  in  more  than  100 states and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax authorities in countries and states in which the Corporation has  significant business  operations  examine  tax returns periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions).

The majority of the Corporation's U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management's conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the  relevant entities  and  the  indefinite  period  to  carry forward NOLs. However, a  material  change  in  those  estimates  could lead  management to reassess  such  valuation  allowance conclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, U.S. federal income taxes had not been  provided  on  approximately $5.0  billion  of temporary differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries  that are  essentially permanent in  duration. If the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.\n\n## NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to  transfer a  liability (an  exit price) in  the  principal  or most advantageous  market for the  asset or liability in  an  orderly transaction  between  market participants  on  the  measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used  in  the  financial  models  measuring  the  fair values  of the assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more  information  regarding  the  fair value  hierarchy and  how  the  Corporation  measures  fair value, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 - Fair Value Option.\n\n## Valuation Techniques\n\nThe  following  sections  outline  the  valuation  methodologies  for the  Corporation's  assets  and  liabilities. While  the  Corporation believes  its  valuation  methods  are  appropriate  and  consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies  or assumptions  to  determine  the  fair value  of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDuring 2023, there were no significant changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material  impact on  the  Corporation's  consolidated  financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\n\nThe  fair values  of trading  account assets  and  liabilities  are primarily based  on  actively traded  markets  where  prices  are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in  the  determination  of the  fair values  of trading  account assets  and  liabilities  and  debt securities. Market price  quotes  may not be  readily available  for some positions  such  as  positions  within  a  market sector where trading  activity has  slowed  significantly or ceased. Some  of these  instruments  are  valued  using  a  discounted  cash  flow model, which  estimates  the  fair value  of the  securities  using internal  credit risk, and  interest rate  and  prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions  such  as  default rates, loss  severity and prepayment rates. Principal  and  interest cash  flows  are discounted  using  an  observable  discount rate  for similar instruments  with  adjustments  that management believes  a market participant would consider in  determining  fair value  for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value  approach  which  considers  the  value  of the underlying  securities. Underlying  assets  are  valued  using external  pricing  services, where  available, or matrix pricing based  on  the  vintages  and  ratings. Situations  of illiquidity generally are  triggered  by the  market's  perception  of credit uncertainty regarding  a  single  company or a  specific market sector. In  these  instances, fair value  is  determined  based  on limited available market information and other factors,",

        "page_content": "principally from reviewing the issuer's financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.\n\n## Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC  market are  determined  using  quantitative  models  that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices  to  generate  continuous  yield  or pricing  curves  and volatility factors  to  value  the  position. The  majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including  brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods  and  assumptions  are  reviewed  by the  Corporation. Estimation  risk  is  greater for derivative  asset and  liability positions  that are  either option-based  or have  longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations  of rate, price  or index scenarios  are  used  in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities  include  adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and  other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value  measurements  of OTC  derivatives  a  valuation adjustment to  reflect the  credit risk  associated  with  the  net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the  fair value  for net short exposures  is  adjusted  for the Corporation's own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on  uncollateralized  derivatives  and  derivatives  where  the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.\n\n## Loans and Loan Commitments\n\nThe  fair values  of loans  and  loan  commitments  are  based  on market prices, where  available, or discounted  cash  flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments  or credit derivatives  of the  specific borrower or comparable  borrowers. Results  of discounted  cash  flow analyses  may be  adjusted, as  appropriate, to  reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\n\n## Mortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe  fair values  of MSRs  are  primarily determined  using  an option-adjusted  spread  valuation  approach, which  factors  in prepayment risk  to  determine  the  fair value  of MSRs. This approach  consists  of projecting  servicing  cash  flows  under multiple  interest rate  scenarios  and  discounting  these  cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe  fair values  of LHFS  are  based  on  quoted  market prices, where  available, or are  determined  by discounting  estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation's current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The  borrower-specific credit risk is embedded  within  the  quoted  market prices  or is  implied  by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, interest rates, indices, currencies  or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative  models  for the  combined  derivative  and  debt portions  of the  notes. These  models  incorporate  observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate  yield  curves, option  volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The  Corporation  also  considers  the  impact of its  own  credit spread  in  determining  the  discount rate  used  to  value  these liabilities. The  credit spread  is  determined  by reference  to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe  fair values  of certain  reverse  repurchase  agreements, repurchase  agreements  and  securities  borrowed  transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including  interest rates  and  spreads  to  generate  continuous yield  or pricing  curves, and  volatility factors. The  majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external  sources, including  brokers, market transactions  and third-party pricing services.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe  fair values  of deposits  are  determined  using  quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use  of multiple  market inputs  including  interest rates  and spreads  to  generate  continuous  yield  or pricing  curves, and volatility factors. The  majority of market inputs  are  actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions  and  third-party pricing  services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference  to  observable  credit spreads  in  the  secondary cash market.\n\n## Asset-backed Secured Financings\n\nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external  broker bids, where  available, or are  determined  by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating  the  Corporation's  current origination  rates  for similar loans, adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.",

Commercial  loans, debt securities  and  other include  corporate  CLOs  and  CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate  assets. Structured  liabilities  primarily include  equitylinked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\n\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a  given  product, such  as  corporate  debt securities, market comparables  may be used to estimate some  of the unobservable  inputs, and  then  these  inputs  are  incorporated into  a  discounted  cash  flow  model. Therefore, the  balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.\n\nThe  levels  of aggregation  and  diversity within  the  products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide  and  unevenly distributed  across  asset and  liability categories.\n\n## Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements  from Unobservable Inputs\n\n## Loans and Securities\n\nA  significant increase  in  market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value  for long  positions. Short positions  would  have  been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments  can  be  reinvested. A  significant increase  in  price  would  have  resulted  in  a  significantly higher fair value  for long  positions, and  short positions  would  have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\n## Structured Liabilities and Derivatives\n\nFor credit derivatives, a  significant increase  in  market yield, upfront points  (i.e., a  single  upfront payment made  by a\n\n## Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n\n|                               | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)         | Level 2             | Level 3             | Level 2             | Level 3             |\n| Assets                        |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Loans held-for-sale           | $ 77                | $ 2,793             | $  1,979            | $  3,079            |\n| Loans and leases  (1)         | -                   | 153                 | -                   | 166                 |\n| Foreclosed properties  (2, 3) | -                   | 48                  | -                   | 7                   |\n| Other assets  (4)             | 31                  | 898                 | 88                  | 165                 |\n\n|                       | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   | Gains (Losses)   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                       | 2023             | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Assets                |                  |                  |                  |\n| Loans held-for-sale   | $ (246)          | $  (387)         | $  (44)          |\n| Loans and leases  (1) | (45)             | (48)             | (60)             |\n| Foreclosed properties | (6)              | (6)              | (2)              |\n| Other assets          | (252)            | (91)             | (492)            |\n\nprotection  buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates  or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection  sellers  and  higher fair value for protection buyers. The  impact of changes  in  prepayment speeds  would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.\n\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio  that underlies  a  credit derivative  instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level  of subordination  of the  tranche. For senior tranches  that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation  would  have  resulted  in  a  significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.\n\nFor equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives  and  structured  liabilities, a  significant change  in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between  two  different commodities, between  two  different interest rates, or between interest rates  and  foreign  exchange rates) would  have  resulted  in  a  significant impact to  the  fair value; however, the  magnitude  and  direction  of the  impact depend  on  whether the  Corporation  is  long  or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value.\n\n## Nonrecurring Fair Value\n\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value  only in  certain  situations  (e.g., the  impairment of an asset), and  these  measurements  are  referred  to  herein  as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the  reporting  date  for which  a  nonrecurring  fair value adjustment was recorded during 2023, 2022 and 2021.",

Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk  for these  lending  relationships  may be mitigated  through  the  use  of credit derivatives, with  the Corporation's  public side  credit view  and  market perspectives determining  the  size  and  timing  of the  hedging  activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as  accounting  hedges  and  are  carried  at fair value. The  fair value  option  allows  the  Corporation  to  carry these  loans  and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management's  view  of the  underlying  economics  and  the manner in  which  they are  managed. In  addition, the  fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would  otherwise  result from the  asymmetry created  by accounting  for the  financial  instruments  at historical  cost and the credit derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Loans Held-for-sale\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for residential  mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the  fair value  option. These  loans  are  actively managed  and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be  mitigated  through  the  use  of derivatives. The Corporation  has  elected  not to  designate  the  derivatives  as qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at fair value. The  changes  in  fair value  of the  loans  are  largely offset by changes in  the  fair value  of the  derivatives. The  fair value  option  allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value  and  the  derivatives  at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value  option  primarily because  these  loans  are  floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.\n\n## Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option.\n\n## Other Assets\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin  loans  that are  hedged  with  derivatives  under the  fair value  option. Election  of the  fair value  option  allows  the Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting  volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.\n\n## Securities Financing Agreements\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option. These elections include certain  agreements  collateralized  by the  U.S. government and its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal interest rate risk.\n\n## Long-term Deposits\n\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option allows  the  Corporation  to  reduce  the  accounting  volatility that would  otherwise  result from the asymmetry created  by accounting  for the  financial  instruments  at historical  cost and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives.\n\n## Short-term Borrowings\n\nThe  Corporation  elects  to  account for certain  short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value  option  because  this  debt is  risk-managed  on  a  fair value basis.",

This\n\nlong-term debt is  either risk-managed  on  a  fair value  basis  or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n\n## Fair Value Option Elections\n\nThe  following  tables  provide  information  about the  fair value carrying  amount and  the  contractual  principal  outstanding  of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the  fair value  option  are  included  in  the  Consolidated Statement of Income for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Option Elections\n\n|                                                                                       | December 31, 2023            | December 31, 2023                   | December 31, 2023                                  | December 31, 2022            | December 31, 2022                 | December 31, 2022                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| (Dollars in millions)                                                                 | Fair Value  Carrying  Amount | Contractual  Principal  Outstanding | Fair Value Carrying  Amount Less  Unpaid Principal | Fair Value  Carrying  Amount | Contractual Principal Outstanding | Fair Value  Carrying   Amount Less Unpaid Principal |\n| Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell    | $ 133,053                    | $ 133,001                           | $ 52                                               | $  146,999                   | $  147,158                        | $  (159)                                            |\n| Loans reported as trading account assets  (1)                                         | 8,377                        | 15,580                              | (7,203)                                            | 10,143                       | 17,682                            | (7,539)                                             |\n| Trading inventory -

Certain  loans, deposits, long-term debt, unfunded lending commitments and other financial instruments are  accounted  for under the  fair value  option. For more information, see Note  21  -  Fair Value  Option . The  following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Short-term Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash  and  cash  equivalents, certain  time  deposits  placed  and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain  resale  and  repurchase  agreements  and  short-term borrowings, approximates  the  fair value  of these  instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm maturities  and  carry interest rates  that approximate market. The  Corporation  accounts  for certain  resale  and repurchase agreements under the fair value option.",

Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional  savings  accounts, money market savings  accounts, CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and products, as  well  as  credit and  debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to  consumers  and  small  businesses  in  the  U.S. Consumer Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans.\n\n## Global Wealth & Investment Management\n\nGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total  investable  assets, including  tailored  solutions  to  meet clients' needs  through  a  full  set of investment management, brokerage, banking  and  retirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to  high  net worth  and  ultra  high  net worth  clients, as  well  as customized  solutions  to  meet clients' wealth  structuring, investment management, trust and  banking  needs, including specialty asset management services.\n\n## Global Banking\n\nGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and  services, integrated  working  capital  management and treasury solutions, and  underwriting  and  advisory services through  the  Corporation's  network  of offices and  client relationship  teams. Global  Banking also  provides  investment banking  products  to  clients. The  economics  of certain investment banking  and  underwriting  activities  are  shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal  revenue-sharing  arrangement. Global  Banking clients generally include  middle-market companies, commercial  real estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial  institutions, leasing  clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nGlobal  Markets offers  sales  and  trading  services  and  research services  to  institutional  clients  across  fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and  equity businesses. Global  Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets product coverage  includes  securities  and  derivative products  in  both  the  primary and  secondary markets.

As  a  result of marketmaking  activities, Global  Markets may be  required  to  manage risk  in  a  broad  range  of financial  products. In  addition, the economics  of certain  investment banking  and  underwriting activities  are  shared  primarily between Global  Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\n## All Other\n\nAll Other primarily consists  of ALM activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all  of the  results  are  allocated  to  the  business segments.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe  management accounting  and  reporting  process  derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies  for revenue  and  expense. The  net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.\n\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income  on  an  FTE  basis  and  noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding  increase  in  income  tax expense. The  segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies",

The  net interest income  of the  businesses  includes  the  results  of a  funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate  sensitivity and  maturity characteristics. In segments  where  the  total  of liabilities  and  equity exceeds assets, which  are  generally deposit-taking  segments, the Corporation  allocates  assets  to  match  liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income  generated  by certain  of the  Corporation's ALM activities.\n\nThe Corporation's ALM activities  include  an  overall  interest rate  risk  management strategy that incorporates  the  use  of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so  that movements  in  interest rates  do  not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of\n\na  majority of the  Corporation's  ALM activities  are  allocated  to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the  ALM activities. ALM activities  include  external  product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation's internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.\n\nCertain  expenses  not directly attributable  to  a  specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of certain  centralized  or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  net income  (loss) and  the components thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis for the business segments, All Other and the total Corporation) for 2023, 2022 and 2021, and total assets at December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 for each

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAlt-A  Mortgage -A  type  of U.S. mortgage  that is  considered riskier than A-paper, or 'prime,' and less risky than 'subprime,' the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized  by borrowers  with  less  than  full  documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.\n\nAssets  Under  Management  (AUM) -  The  total  market value  of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the  assets' market values. AUM reflects  assets  that are generally managed  for institutional, high  net worth  and  retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.\n\nBanking  Book -  All on-  and  off-balance  sheet financial instruments of the  Corporation  except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.\n\nBrokerage  and  Other  Assets -  Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.\n\nCommitted Credit Exposure - Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound  to  advance  funds  during  a  specified  period  under prescribed conditions.\n\nCredit Derivatives -Contractual  agreements  that provide protection  against a  specified  credit event on  one  or more referenced obligations.\n\nCredit  Valuation  Adjustment  (CVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.\n\nDebit  Valuation  Adjustment  (DVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required  to  properly reflect the  Corporation's  own  credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/ or structured liabilities.\n\nFunding  Valuation  Adjustment  (FVA) -  A  portfolio  adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives  where  the  Corporation  is  not permitted  to  use the collateral it receives.\n\nInterest  Rate  Lock  Commitment  (IRLC) -  Commitment with  a loan  applicant in  which  the  loan  terms  are  guaranteed  for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.\n\nLetter of Credit - A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer.\n\nLoan-to-value (LTV) - A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is  calculated  as  the  outstanding  carrying  value  of the  loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.\n\nMacro Products -  Include  currencies, interest rates  and commodities products.\n\nMargin Receivable -An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.\n\nMatched  Book -  Repurchase  and  resale  agreements  or securities  borrowed  and  loaned  transactions  where  the  overall asset and  liability position  is  similar in  size  and/or maturity. Generally, these  are  entered  into  to  accommodate  customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.\n\nMortgage  Servicing  Right  (MSR) -  The  right to  service  a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments  from borrowers  and  accounting  for and  remitting principal and interest payments to investors.\n\nNonperforming Loans and Leases -  Includes  loans  and  leases that have  been  placed  on  nonaccrual  status, including nonaccruing loans whose  contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) - A framework established by the U.S. banking  regulators  requiring  banks  to  maintain  certain levels  of regulatory capital  ratios, comprised of five  categories of capitalization: 'well  capitalized,' 'adequately capitalized,' 'undercapitalized,' 'significantly undercapitalized' and 'critically undercapitalized.' Insured depository institutions that fail  to  meet certain  of these  capital  levels  are  subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to  make  capital  distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions.\n\nSubprime  Loans -  Although  a  standard  industry definition  for subprime  loans  (including  subprime  mortgage  loans) does  not exist, the  Corporation  defines  subprime  loans  as  specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers.\n\nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) - Loans whose contractual terms  have  been  restructured  in  a  manner that grants  a concession  to  a  borrower experiencing  financial  difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs.\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) - VaR is a model that simulates the value of a  portfolio  under a  range  of hypothetical  scenarios  in  order to generate  a  distribution  of potential  gains  and  losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.",
