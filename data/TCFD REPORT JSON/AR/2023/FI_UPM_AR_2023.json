In the near term, our focus will be on performance, delivery of our investments, preparing for the future growth and building on our values.\n\n2023 showed that our operating model is solid and that we can perform well even in exceptionally challenging circumstances. For building this strong foundation, I would like to thank my predecessor, Jussi Pesonen, who has had a long, very distinguished and successful career at the helm of UPM. Under his leadership, the company has undergone a bold and determined transformation and its shareholder value has increased significantly. The results of years of systematic work have benefited all our stakeholders and society as a whole.\n\nI have taken up the role of CEO at the beginning of 2024 with both enthusiasm and determination. UPM is an excellent company that I am honoured to lead, and I thank the Board of Directors for the trust they have placed in me. I would also like to thank UPM's employees, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders for their valued cooperation, which has put us in an excellent position to continue our success. The world needs responsible solutions and we have the ability to deliver them. Together, we create a future beyond fossils!\n\n## Massimo Reynaudo\n\nPresident and CEO\n\n## A SOLID BASIS FOR GROWTH\n\nUPM had a solid year in 2023 despite an exceptionally challenging operating environment. We completed two significant investments that will create long-term value for our stakeholders.\n\nThe year 2023 was marked by strong geopolitical uncertainty and exceptional economic cycles. For UPM, the year was twofold. During the first half of the year, we experienced a particularly sharp downturn, especially in European markets. Unprecedented destocking significantly affected market deliveries and was combined with falling pulp and energy prices. As the year progressed, there were signs of a gradual recovery in many product markets.\n\nOur sales decreased by 11% and comparable EBIT was down 52% on the previous year's record levels. However, our performance was solid in the challenging operating environment with comparable EBIT of EUR 1,013 million and an EBIT margin of 9.7%. We succeeded well in margin management and took decisive action to reduce variable and fixed costs and to adjust our capacity to the low demand. Cash flow was at record levels and our financial position remained strong. We are well positioned to take advantage of further market improvements.\n\nUPM's Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 1.50 (1.50) per share for 2023, reflecting UPM's strong financial position and the Board's confidence in the company's future success.\n\n## Investments set to deliver\n\nUPM has a clear strategy and we are aiming for growth. Global megatrends support demand for many of our products, and both our customers and consumers want to make sustainable choices. We have accelerated growth through significant investments, two of which were completed in 2023 and are set to deliver in 2024.\n\nThe largest investment project in the company's history was completed in Uruguay, increasing our pulp production capacity by more than 50% to around 5.8 million tonnes per year. Once production is fully optimised, UPM Paso de los Toros mill will have a cash cost per tonne of pulp delivered of around 280 US dollars, making it one of the most competitive pulp mills in the world.\n\nFurthermore, the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit was commissioned in 2023, increasing UPM Energy's CO 2 -free electricity production by almost 50%. The investment also has a societal impact by improving Finland's energy self-sufficiency and providing CO 2 -free energy for society's needs.\n\nUPM's biochemical refinery project in Leuna, Germany is progressing at full speed. The biorefinery is unique as it is the world's first refinery to produce wood-based biochemicals. Numerous new partnerships demonstrate the demand for its products. In addition, a detailed commercial and basic engineering phase of the potential Rotterdam biorefinery continues.\n\n## Responsibility at the core of our operations\n\nUPM's purpose is to create a future beyond fossils. We offer our customers renewable and recyclable materials and low-emission energy. We also innovate new solutions and invest in sustainable growth.\n\nResponsibility is at the core of our strategy and operations. We have ambitious, science-based targets and a strong track record of concrete action to both mitigate climate change and enhance biodiversity.",

We make good use of commercial strategies, tight cost control, materials and energy efficiency, effective capital allocation and efficient use of assets. We capture opportunities provided by our agile operating model, while capitalising on corporate synergies.\n\n## Value-enhancing growth\n\nConsumer megatrends drive the demand growth for most of our products. This is further supported by the rapidly increasing need for sustainable alternatives to fossil-based materials and energy. We grow businesses with strong long-term demand fundamentals, where we have a clear competitive advantage. This underpins attractive returns on invested capital.\n\nWe are in an intensive growth phase. The UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill is growing UPM's pulp production capacity by more than 50% at low costs; the OL3 nuclear power plant unit is increasing UPM Energy's carbon-free electricity generation by nearly 50% at an opportune time, and the UPM Leuna biorefinery, due to start by the end of 2024, will open a completely new growth business in biochemicals.\n\n## Responsibility is good business\n\nFor us, sustainability is an important driver for growth and competitiveness. We capture the opportunities presented by increasingly responsible consumer choices and tightening regulations for mitigating climate change and answering the plastics challenge, for example.

We supply sustainable materials for everyday consumer needs, reliable carbon-free energy to electrify society, and renewable alternatives to fossil materials and fuels.\n\nThe Biofore strategy drives our growth and transformation as a frontrunner in biomaterials.  The COP28 UN Climate Change Conference highlighted the obvious - that the world needs to transition away from fossil fuels and raw materials. This goes hand-in-hand with our purpose: We create a future beyond fossils.\n\n## Focus on performance\n\nAt UPM, we foster a culture of high performance. 2023 saw many markets experience an unusually strong slowdown, particularly those in Europe. Geopolitical tensions also remained high. Despite such a challenging operating environment, we achieved a solid performance thanks to our agile operating model, competitive businesses and continuous improvement mindset.\n\nThrough effective capital allocation, we aim to grow our earnings and improve our business portfolio while maintaining a strong balance sheet.\n\n## Transformative growth and innovation\n\nImplementing the Biofore strategy continued at full speed in 2023, with production starting on two transformative growth projects. In the first instance, the new and highly competitive UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill will supply sustainable fibres suitable for a wide range of daily consumer needs, growing our pulp production capacity by more than 50%. Secondly, as a shareholder of the OL3 nuclear power plant unit, we will supply carbon-free electricity to electrify society, growing our energy business by nearly 50%.\n\nAt the same time, we are developing new innovation-driven growth businesses. Construction continued at our first-of-itskind biochemicals refinery in Germany, as did basic engineering of a potential new biofuels refinery in the Netherlands. With our customers also having their own ambitious sustainability targets, such innovations are in high demand.\n\n## Leader in responsibility\n\nWe are one of the world-leading companies in responsibility. Our visionary purpose and values guide and inspire us to create a positive impact on society and value for our shareholders.\n\nOur renewable and recyclable products meet the everyday needs of consumers while addressing many global challenges, such as climate change and resource scarcity.\n\nMany of our products offer sustainable alternatives to fossil raw materials and energy - for example by replacing fossil plastics in consumer products, steel and cement in construction, or fossil fuels in traffic, aviation and electricity markets.

The requirements for competitive greenfield pulp operations, such as highly productive plantation operations, good mill location and efficient logistics, are difficult to meet and thus provide a lasting competitive advantage.\n\nProduction in our world-class pulp mill in UPM Paso de los Toros in Uruguay started in April 2023 and customer deliveries began in May. The production reached about 850,000 tonnes in 2023 and this is expected to more than double in 2024. The mill was EBITDA positive in H2 2023, and is expected\n\nto turn EBIT positive during H1 2024. The new pulp deliveries have been well received by our customers.\n\nThe mill has an annual capacity of 2.1 million tonnes of eucalyptus market pulp. The USD 3.47 billion investment has raised our pulp production capacity by more than 50%. Given the highly competitive cash costs expected and the large scale of the mill, the investment is expected to significantly contribute to our future earnings, and the competitive business platform in Uruguay will offer further growth opportunities in the future.\n\nUPM Pulp on page 38\n\n- UPM Paso de los Toros on page 24\n\nelectricity generation by nearly 50%.

UPM Biofuels initiated proceedings to qualify its renewable fuels as sustainable aviation fuel. What's more, we are currently in the basic engineering phase of a potentially larger next-generation biorefinery, located in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which would scale up the business.\n\nUPM Biochemicals on page 54 UPM Biofuels on page 52\n\nIn 2023, UPM Raflatac successfully integrated AMC AG, a German self-adhesive label materials company, to speed up its growth strategy. The acquisition opens up new attractive product segments and further strengthens UPM Raflatac's position in the filmic products segment in Central Europe. UPM Specialty Papers has also made further progress with its barrier paper products, which provide a sustainable and recyclable alternative for flexible packaging applications, for example.\n\nUPM Raflatac on page 44 UPM Specialty Papers on page 46\n\n## NEARLY 50% GROWTH IN CO 2 /uniF6BAFREE ELECTRICITY GENERATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TRANSFORMATIVE NEW BUSINESSES BEYOND FOSSILS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GROWTH AND PRODUCT INNOVATION IN SPECIALTY PACKAGING MATERIALS\n\nClimate change mitigation requires the further electrification of society and the rapid reduction of the use of fossil-based fuels. Russia's war in Ukraine and the resulting turbulence in the European energy markets also emphasised the importance of supply security and energy competitiveness.\n\nUPM is a shareholder in the new OL3 nuclear power plant unit, which started regular commercial production in May 2023.

Access to sustainable feedstocks, proprietary technology concepts and providing high-quality products to demanding customer segments are expected to provide a lasting competitive advantage for UPM.\n\nUPM Biochemicals is preparing for a commercial-scale market entry. Our next generation biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany is due to start production by the end of 2024. The EUR 1,180 million investment will provide a first-ofits-kind biorefinery with an annual capacity of 220,000 tonnes of wood-based biochemicals.

The mill began its operations in April 2023 and the first customer deliveries were shipped in May. The focus is now on increasing the overall stability and production output on a continuous basis.\n\nThe new mill will grow UPM's pulp capacity by more than 50% and places UPM among the leading eucalyptus pulp suppliers in the world. The outlook for long-term pulp demand is positive and supported by global megatrends like urbanisation, population growth and the need for renewable materials. With the new capacity and stronger global customer reach, UPM is well positioned to capture the opportunities of growing end-use markets in a competitive\n\nway. The targeted cash cost level of USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp enables the mill to make attractive returns for the investment in various market scenarios.\n\n## Making an impact\n\nThe new mill is estimated to increase Uruguay's GDP by about 2%. The central and north-eastern regions of Uruguay represent the relatively less developed regions in the country considering the number of households below the poverty line, regional competitiveness, social and financial measurements as well as road network and infrastructure.\n\nThe pulp mill, together with forestry, wood and pulp logistics and other related activities, is creating around 10,000 new permanent jobs, of which 4,000 are direct\n\ncontracts with UPM and its subcontractors. More than 600 small and medium-sized companies are estimated to be working in the value chain, spreading from tree seedling nurseries to pulp logistics. In addition, regional development will improve wellbeing in central Uruguay through improved infrastructure generating new opportunities for education, employment and entrepreneurship as well as improved access to services.\n\nThe mill is a key milestone in the development of the sustainable Uruguayan forest industry and at present, pulp is Uruguay's largest export sector. Alongside UPM's investment in the new pulp mill, the Uruguayan government has invested in logistics infrastructure, including a renovated railway connection from Paso de los Toros to UPM's\n\nport terminal in Montevideo. Public infrastructure investments improve the competitiveness of all export sectors in Uruguay.\n\nThe mill generates an annual surplus of around one TWh of renewable wood-based electricity. It provides a stable source of revenue and strengthens Uruguay's energy balance.\n\nThe mill meets strict Uruguayan environmental regulations, international standards and recommendations for modern mills. Our extensive environmental monitoring programme covers water and biota, air, soil, noise and socio-economic aspects. Despite our high standards of process control, sodium hydroxide, a chemical commonly used in pulp production, leaked from the chemical storage area to the environment in August (page 93).\n\n## Sustainable plantations\n\nOur eucalyptus plantations in Uruguay have established a new renewable raw material base for growing global fibre needs. Eucalyptus availability for the mill is secured through plantations owned or leased by UPM, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. Plantations are a significant carbon sink, the size of which is calculated annually by the Natural Resources Institute Finland. They do not compete with food production or affect natural forests.\n\nOur world-class tree nursery operations with three nurseries in Uruguay are producing more than 40 million eucalyptus seedlings a year. The third nursery in Sarand\u00ed del Y\u00ed began its operations in Q1 2022 and ensures the required annual planting capacity to supply the new mill.\n\nR&D plays a crucial role in optimising our plantation operations in Uruguay but also selecting materials with the best characteristics for pulp production and fibre properties for our customers. Our forestry research centre in Paysand\u00fa, which has been operating since May 2022, focuses on developing the best possible genetic materials for tree plantations. The centre is also part of several research streams related to the sustainability of eucalyptus production including, for example, water usage on plantations and biodiversity surveys.\n\nEnhancing biodiversity on page 84\n\n- Railroad safety programme on page 73\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY IN URUGUAY\n\nThe three kilometres of footpaths on two trails in the Esteros y Algarrobales del R\u00edo Uruguay (EARU) biodiversity reserve allow you to see many native plant and animal species and ecosystems. More than 900 species have been identified in the area during the monitoring sessions UPM carries out annually.\n\nAs the landowner of this reserve and the surrounding forest plantations, UPM actively promotes the protection of the wildlife living in this area. This reserve located in the R\u00edo Negro province has four different environments: the Chaco open forest, sandbanks, wetlands and the riverine forest, each with its unique group of species generating a considerable biodiversity richness.\n\nWe aim to protect the most important species and ecosystems in the areas through the global biodiversity programme. In Uruguay, we have a network of 33 biodiversity reserves aimed at preserving sensitive ecosystems including grasslands, native forests, wetlands and other natural ecosystems. These areas cover 14,500 hectares. Each reserve has its own management and monitoring plan, drawn up in collaboration with the Uruguayan NGO Vida Silvestre.\n\nIn 2023, we opened a new visitor centre in the biodiversity reserve, including facilities and equipment for researchers. The visitor centre plays a major role in teaching children and young people about Uruguayan nature.\n\nwww.upm.uy/earu (esp)",

We have more nearly 3,600 patents and patent applications, and more than 1,700 trademarks globally. Licensing innovations and technologies provides an excellent basis for value creation with customers and technology partners.\n\n## Extensive partner network\n\nOur close-knit global partner network includes customers, universities, research organisations, suppliers and start-up companies. Collaboration speeds up the development and launch of new business solutions.\n\nOur network includes the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU), the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) and the Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI). We are a member of the 4evergreen alliance, an initiative created by the Confederation of European Paper Industries (Cepi) to raise the overall recycling rate of fibre-based packaging to 90% by 2030. We are also a member of EUROPEN, the European association that strives towards achieving carbon neutrality in the packaging value chain.\n\nWe want to take part in the developments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2023, we actively participated in Hydrogen Cluster Finland to create new technologies, business opportunities and climate benefits throughout the network.\n\n- What the world needs on page 10\n- Sustainable product lifecycle on page 98\n\nThe step from mainly fossil-based plastic packaging to biomaterials requires R&D in numerous areas. Our work focused on packaging paper and pulp value chains, including pulp side streams such as lignin. We led a collaboration project on finding alternatives for fossil-based binders and coatings.\n\nWe are examining new ways to utilise renewable biomaterials for textiles, nonwovens, hygiene products and labels for example. We are also looking into the opportunities provided by green hydrogen and biogenic CO 2 (page 91).\n\nR&D and piloting in several of our laboratories in connection with the upcoming biochemicals refinery, supported by the acquisition of Suncoal Industries (page 54).\n\nIn Finland, we expanded our research centre in Lappeenranta with the main focus on developing biomolecular businesses. In Uruguay, we focused on piloting future pulp end-uses in close collaboration with our forestry research centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations. UPM Biomedicals opened a new cell laboratory in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nproduct reuse with UPM Biocomposites and UPM Raflatac.\n\nOur approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both of which are incorporated in sustainable product design practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint are key tools in our concept. They provide credible environmental data over the lifecycle of products under development and for products already available on the market. We also continued to conduct biodegradability and recyclability testing.\n\nWe focused especially on chemical safety and behavioural safety at work, noting both safe and at-risk behaviours. Our R&D and piloting teams have also become more international thanks to successful recruitments and onboarding. In addition to internal competence development, we collaborate with universities and vocational schools to enhance mutual learning.\n\n## OUR FOCUS IN 2023\n\n## INNOVATING CLIMATE/uniF6BA POSITIVE PRODUCTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXPANDING R&D INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT DESIGN CONCEPT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DEVELOPING R&D COMPETENCES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany, will enable us to switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based alternatives in textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and pharma. To accelerate product development, UPM Biochemicals announced several partnerships in 2023.\n\nCo-creating products with customers and technology partners continued.  For example, we introduced the world's first fleece jacket containing 30% of wood-based polyester as well as fully fibre-based heat-sealable packaging and a bio-attributed jar for a moisturiser.\n\nUPM's three Biofore Base research centres accelerate the development of bio-based products. The centres focus on research, piloting and analytics, enabling seamless collaboration with customers, value chain partners and research organisations such as universities. They work closely with UPM's mills, businesses and business-specific research centres in various countries.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to strengthen our infrastructure in Germany, Finland, Switzerland and Uruguay.

We are committed to creating value from renewable and recyclable materials, reducing our environmental footprint, and enhancing our positive social impact.\n\nWe have linked our financing to our sustainability performance. Our revolving credit facility is linked to our long-term biodiversity and climate targets, and we have issued three green bonds since 2020. In 2023, we updated our Green Finance Framework, which received the highest rating of 'Dark Green' from S&P Global Ratings, in line with the framework we established in 2020.\n\nResponsibility-related measures are included in our management remuneration. They cover the reduction of fossil CO 2 emissions from our on-site combustion and purchased energy, the achievement of a net positive impact on biodiversity in our own forests in Finland, and the achievement of gender pay equity globally. These measures account for 20% of all performance measures.\n\n- Our responsibility targets and how we did in 2023 on pages 32 -33\n- Our responsible way of operating on pages 58 -101\n- Committed to compliance on page 74\n- Managing responsibility on page 138\n- www.upm.com/responsibility\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable raw materials and recyclable products advance the transformation to a circular bioeconomy\n- \u00b7 Our solutions respond to global challenges, such as climate change and resource scarcity\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Create value for our stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Wide set of 2030 responsibility targets\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## FORWARD FASTER /uniF6BB TOWARDS GENDER EQUALITY, LIVING WAGES AND NET/uniF6BAZERO EMISSIONS\n\nIn September, we joined the UN Global Compact Forward Faster Initiative together with 138 other companies. This ambitious undertaking calls for global business leaders to take tangible actions to accelerate the progress of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our commitment encompasses three focus areas: promoting gender equality, ensuring living wages and aligning our operations with an ambitious net-zero emission target.\n\nOur pledge on gender equality signifies our commitment to fostering equal gender\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 We respect international agreements, such as the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n- \u00b7 Our purpose, values, UPM Code of Conduct, and UPM Supplier and ThirdParty Code provide a solid foundation for decision-making, management and operations\n- \u00b7 Responsibility is managed by the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team, as well as by businesses and functions\n- \u00b7 Responsible business conduct in all our operations\n\nrepresentation, participation and leadership at all levels of management by 2030 and to guaranteeing equal pay for equal work for all our employees.\n\nCompanies committed to the living wage must ensure that their employees earn a living wage by 2030. The climate commitment challenges companies to set a science-based net-zero emissions target in line with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway and to achieve it by 2050 at the latest.\n\nCompanies in this initiative will report on their progress to the Global Compact annually. The first official year of reporting year is 2025, but the relevant topics are already covered in our public reports.\n\nUPM and NGOs have different views on how to address climate change and loss of biodiversity, but the goal is the same. We think that active and timely forest management maintains carbon sinks and ensures the positive development of biodiversity while society needs to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and raw materials.\n\nWe responded to stakeholders' concerns at local, national and international level, participated in the public debate and met with representatives of NGOs.\n\nWe tested the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Land Sector and Removals Guidance documentation and carried out a feasibility study to deepen our understanding of the Science Based Target initiative's (SBTi) Net-Zero methodology. We also committed to setting a net-zero target based on the SBTi (page 86). We also reviewed and updated our Scope 3 reporting (page 91). We continued the -30 by 30 programme to reduce CO 2 emissions of purchased goods and services and logistics.\n\ndevelop process safety and implemented a UPM-wide process safety standard that sets minimum requirements for process safety (page 70).\n\nWe are committed to developing an organisational culture and local conditions that ensure a diverse and inclusive working environment. In 2023, we introduced our first Employee Resource Group, BeU, which is specifically focused on creating a welcoming and inclusive workplace for members of the LGBTIQ+ community worldwide (page 69).\n\nmade product level information readily available. As part of the development, the assurance for our fossil CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) was changed from limited to reasonable assurance.\n\nWe started a project to re-evaluate our way of managing ESG matters and the scope of related policies to clarify our approach and ensure better alignment with future requirements.\n\nIn 2023, we included the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) in the reporting framework (page 142).\n\n## OUR FOCUS IN 2023\n\n## DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENHANCING BIODIVERSITY AND CLIMATE ACTIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRENGTHENING SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS WORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DEVELOPING REPORTING AND GOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe received criticism of our operations in Finland and Uruguay from some stakeholders. The discussion in Finland was primarily about harvesting levels, the use of pulp in single-use products and pulp colonialism in Uruguay. There have been calls for significant restrictions in logging volumes to preserve carbon sinks and protect biodiversity. Some stakeholders were concerned about UPM's operations in Uruguay and their possible link to the water scarcity in the Montevideo region in the summer and the sodium hydroxide leak at the pulp mill (page 93).\n\nOur collaboration continued with the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) (page 85). We also explored the potential of utilising environmental DNA methodology through several pilot projects, to assess its suitability for biodiversity measurement and reporting. All quantitative indicators showed a positive trend in relation to our target of net-positive impact on biodiversity in our own forests in Finland. This was also the case in Uruguay with the chosen key performance indicators.\n\nWe continued to develop our human rights risk assessment approach related to our supply chains and investments and reviewed our corporate salient human rights issues in connection to our materiality assessment. As part of our human rights due diligence development work, we started a forward-looking human rights impact assessment related to our operations in Uruguay with an external partner (page 72).\n\nWe launched a global safety project with the aim to develop safety practices further and engage people more in safety. We also continued our work to\n\nThe EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will broaden the requirements for sustainability reporting. In order to be well prepared, we launched a cross-functional project to improve reporting controls and data availability, for example. UPM's reporting framework was comprehensive even before the new directive. We have used integrated corporate reporting since 2007 and limited assurance since 2011, according to the GRI; our pulp and paper mills have been registered with the EU's EMAS since the 1990s and we have",

        "page_content": "## RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe operating environment exposes UPM to a number of risks and opportunities. Many of them arise from general political and economic activity and global megatrends.\n\n- Risks in the report of Board of Directors on page 133\n- Sensitivity to carbon pricing is presented on page 142\n- Main earnings sensitivities are presented on page 178\n\n## CYCLICAL AND COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM's current product offering competes in markets where there are competing alternatives for customers and where the shifts in supply and demand continuously influence prices. Changes in production capacity, supply chain shifts, new product or raw material development, and competitor and consumer behaviour may impact the price levels for our products and main inputs, and cause demand fluctuations. Rapid acceleration in digitalisation and e-commerce may expedite the decline in demand for graphic papers and simultaneously increase demand for sustainable packaging products.\n\nManagement: Industry-leading balance sheet. Continuous improvement in competitiveness, resource efficiency and customer offering. Responsible operations. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Growing need and consumer preference for renewable and recyclable solutions create business opportunities and drive demand growth.\n\nGEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRussia's war in Ukraine, the conflict in Gaza, continuing high inflation and interest rate environment, energy price volatility in Europe, rivalry between the US and China, as well as political uncertainties in several countries continue to cause uncertainty in trade policies, economic growth and the rule of law, and challenge competitiveness and predictability for companies with international value chains and operations in several countries. The testing relationships between businesses, governments and society and the growing international focus on military conflicts may stress the economic and political environment and cause local challenges to our operations or influence demand or input costs for our products.\n\nManagement: Monitoring through international trade associations. Compliance. Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio, geographical presence and responsible business practices may present opportunities for supply chain optimisation or strategic opportunities (incl. M&A) in an economic downturn.\n\n- UPM's cost structure is presented on page 179\n- Main currency exposures are presented on page 210\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy can cause policy changes and shifts in market preferences, standards, and technologies, which in turn may result in changes to cost structures or the commercial opportunities of biomass and change the competitiveness of products, raw materials, industries, and countries. The physical impacts of climate change include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions, which can increase droughts, floods and forest fires and cause uncertainties in business operations. Damage caused by insects and tree diseases can become increasingly common.\n\nManagement: Long-term targets and science-based measures to mitigate global warming through sustainable forestry, emissions reductions and innovating novel products. Enhancing biodiversity.\n\nOpportunity: Transition opportunities include those driven by resource efficiency and the development of new technologies, CO 2 -free electricity, products and services that could bring new markets, customers, sources of funding and competitive advantage for us. Longer forest growing season in northern hemisphere.\n\nCHANGES IN POLICIES, LEGISLATION AND STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe rising concern of the cost-of-living crisis and the strain on natural ecosystems have intensified expectations for companies to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits and complement the actions of governments. Changes in regulation, taxation or subsidies could have an effect on our performance, competitiveness and the costs and availability of raw materials. Unpredictable and rapid changes in EU policies or local legislation may occur. Environmental regulations may continue to become more stringent. As policies, legislation or stakeholder expectations, or the application of them, change, additional costs in complying with more stringent requirements may be imposed on us.\n\nManagement: Responsible operations in the value chain enhance the ability to operate and influence long-term business success, including environmental management systems, sustainable forestry and compliance.\n\nOpportunity: Creating value for society, as a company and through our renewable and responsible solutions, is an integral part of our strategy. The bioeconomy offers new opportunities for value creation and business growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROJECTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe invest in selective strategic projects to enable profitable growth. Investment projects are often large and may take several years to complete. They may also involve strategic, technical and operational risks. Our biochemical refinery project in Germany involves new technology and opens new markets for us. The high inflation and interest rate environment, price uncertainty of construction materials, and availability of skilled labour as well as bottlenecks in the global logistics and supply chains have added new challenges to large investment projects.\n\nManagement: Stringent and continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Environmental, health, safety and social impact assessments and protocols. Stakeholder engagement.\n\nOpportunity: Carefully selected and implemented growth projects improve our earnings and returns and change the positioning of the company.\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND INCREASING CYBERCRIME ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in critical information system services can cause disruptions to the continuity of operations. The information systems may be exposed to a cyber-intrusion that could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, AI-generated misinformation or disinformation, production outages or damage to reputation.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our measures for cybersecurity protection.\n\nOpportunity: Sophisticated IT systems enable efficient operations and optimised performance, as well as new customer services and data security.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EMERGING RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INPUT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE MAIN RAW MATERIALS AND SERVICES\n\nThe main production inputs required in the manufacturing of our products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these inputs have been volatile in recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Ongoing military conflicts, governmental protection, geoeconomic rivalry, climate change, environmental policies and other governmental actions or restrictions, could continue to cause further uncertainty around the prices and availability of these inputs as well as logistics services.\n\nManagement: Continuously improving resource efficiency and supply chain optimisation and diversification. New technologies. Long-term supply contracts and relying on alternative suppliers. Selected ownership of forest land and long-term forest management contracts.\n\nOpportunity: Circular economy, continuous improvement in resource efficiency and supply resilience to withstand price fluctuations offer competitive advantage.\n\n## OPERATIONAL HAZARDS, HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur operations are exposed to risks arising from the environment, fires, natural events, machinery breakdowns, site security and occupational health and safety. A major incident at a UPM site or at a critical part of the supply chain could cause a shutdown or curtail production. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness or liability to employees, contractors or third parties.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our management, safety, security and loss prevention programmes as well as insurance protection and business continuity. Development of process safety.\n\nOpportunity: Industry-leading environmental performance provides competitive advantage. Health and safety performance strengthens engagement, efficiency and productivity.\n\nFinancial risks include foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, challenges in refinancing, counterparty or credit risks or changes in taxes. Changes to the monetary policies of major central banks may significantly impact interest rates and consequently various currencies that directly or indirectly affect UPM. Our foreign exchange rate risk primarily relates to the US dollar, British pound sterling and Japanese yen.\n\nManagement: Continuous hedging of net currency exposure. Hedging the balance sheet. Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio and geographical presence, focus on competitiveness and strong balance sheet may present strategic opportunities in a changing currency environment.\n\nArtificial Intelligent (AI) -generated misinformation, disinformation or other adverse effects of AI technologies could erode trust of democratic processes, deepen polarised views and increase sophisticated cybercrime events.\n\nManagement and opportunity: Strong balance sheet. Maintaining and developing cybersecurity protection. Ensuring AI governance to unlock advantages of AI.\n\nBiodiversity refers to the diversity and variation of species and ecosystems on our planet. According to the UN, and despite ongoing efforts, biodiversity is deteriorating worldwide. Our operations are widely linked with biodiversity, and most significant impacts on biodiversity arise from wood sourcing activities.\n\nManagement and opportunity: Global 2030 Forest Action Programme combines measures on climate, biodiversity, soil, water and social contribution. Biodiversity is instrumental in maintaining healthy forest growth.",

UPM PULP AND UPM TIMBER BUSINESSES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COMPARABLE EBIT\n\nCOMPARABLE ROCE\n\n## PERSONNEL\n\n-80% EURm 116\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM Fibres responds to the growing needs for responsible and renewable products as the global community works to reduce its dependence on fossil materials. Our pulp business serves its customers with sustainably produced eucalyptus, birch and softwood pulp grades for a wide range of end uses such as tissue, specialty and graphic papers, and board. Our timber business offers responsibly produced sawn timber and serves customers in the furniture, joinery, planing, construction and packaging sectors.\n\n## Room to improve\n\nIn 2023, global chemical pulp demand was solid. Destocking impacted pulp demand in China in the first half of the year, but\n\ndemand improved in the second half in line with positive developments in end-use markets. In Europe, pulp demand was weak. Pulp sales prices declined in all markets to the bottom-of-the-cycle levels after all-time highs in the previous year. Prices started to recover in the second half of the year.\n\nIn Uruguay, UPM's transformative growth investment in the new Paso de los Toros pulp mill was concluded successfully and the mill began running in April (page 24). In Finland, scheduled maintenance shutdowns were successfully conducted at the UPM Kymi and UPM Kaukas pulp mills. We continued the product mix development with an increased share of softwood in the Finnish pulp mills.\n\non 31 Dec.\n\n2,775\n\nMore key figures on page 129\n\n## Sustainable demand outlook\n\nGlobal megatrends drive long-term demand growth for pulp. The demand for pulp is driven by the growing Asian middle class, increasing disposable incomes and a rise in the use of tissue and hygiene papers as well as paper and board based packaging materials.\n\nUPM is well positioned for growing pulp markets. The new UPM Paso de los Toros mill will place us among the world's leading pulp producers, serving global pulp markets with nearly six million tonnes of pulp.\n\nOur strong position and sustainability across the forestry value chain in Uruguay and Finland enable our pulp business to grow and be competitive. Over the years, UPM has created in Uruguay a highly competitive industrial platform with two\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Capture the full potential of our Uruguayan operations after the expansion\n- \u00b7 Commercialisation of new pulp volumes from UPM Paso de los Toros\n- \u00b7 Continue to improve cost competitiveness and operational efficiency of our Finnish pulp mills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We are inspired by the limitless opportunities offered by the bioeconomy.\n\nworld-class pulp mills, secure wood-supply from sustainably managed eucalyptus plantations and efficient logistics. The new pulp mill will also improve the competitiveness of the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill.\n\nIn Finland, the increased share of softwood in the mills has strengthened the cost-competitiveness of the pulp product mix.\n\n## Solutions to mitigate climate change\n\nPulp is at the core of the bioeconomy. We are actively seeking new solutions for the full potential of biomass by developing and piloting fibre based and bio-streams growth concepts for our pulp mills in cooperation with research institutes. In doing so, we see clear synergies and advantages in having in-house businesses focusing on replacing fossil materials with renewable solutions, such as lignin based chemicals. Our mills in Finland and Uruguay also produce renewable energy for national grids.\n\nwww.upmpulp.com\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXCELLENT QUALITY\n\nThe new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill has reached high product quality ever since it was put into operation in April. The pulp manufactured at the mill is used by UPM's global customer base to produce tissue, specialty, printing and writing papers. Deliveries to customers started in May.\n\nThe mill reached technical readiness to start operations at the end of March. The actual start-up phase included many sub-processes, with production being gradually ramped up towards full nominal capacity. The Uruguayan environmental authorities approved all mill procedures, systems and technologies -a prerequisite for the mill being allowed to begin operations.\n\nA huge amount of planning, skills and hard work has gone into completing the project, with up to 7,500 people from 60 countries working on the site at its height. The end result is a great achievement for the teams involved, and indeed everyone in the organisation.",

Market demand was weak due to low activity in the construction industry and market prices stood at low levels.\n\nUPM made an investment decision to modernise the Korkeakoski sawmill. In 2025, new split saw technology will be introduced at the sawmill, which will significantly improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the sawmill by using the wood raw material even more efficiently.\n\n## Setting the Standard: moving beyond fossils with sustainable timber.\n\nIn the long term, the demand for sustainable solutions for the construction and furniture industries will drive growth. Despite the challenging market environment in 2023,  we continued to deliver on our customer promise, Setting the Standard, and focused on adding value for our customers in all market situations.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Fossil-free and efficient timber production\n- \u00b7 Global sales and logistics network\n- \u00b7 Securing the growth of forests - we always know the origin of our raw material\n\nUPM Timber's sawmills have been fully powered by renewable energy since 2020. Since the second quarter of 2023, our sawmills' internal logistics have also been fossil-free, as we have started to use only renewable diesel. We have also made our external logistics more environmentally sound, for example by using time charter LNG vessels, switching to renewable diesel for transport between the Seikku sawmill\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Improve profitability of sawn timber business\n- \u00b7 Continue to reduce emissions of the logistics\n- \u00b7 Develop measures in accordance with our customer promise Setting the Standard\n\nand the Port of Rauma, and using longer and larger specialised HCT trucks to transport containers from the Kaukas sawmill to the port. We are also actively promoting the benefits of wood in the construction industry and encouraging the use of wood as a substitute for fossil-based materials.\n\nwww.upmtimber.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN ACTION\n\nJuk\n\nk\n\na Kinnunen\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UPM TIMBER REDUCES EMISSIONS FROM LOGISTICS\n\nIn 2023, UPM Timber's four sawmills switched to using only renewable diesel for forklifts and other heavy machinery in its internal logistics.\n\nEmissions from the transport of sawn timber products have also been reduced. Since the beginning of 2023, trucks using renewable diesel have been transporting sawn timber from the Seikku sawmill in Pori to the Port of Rauma. The use of renewable diesel reduces CO /uniF63A emissions by up to 90%.\n\nIn 2020, the Kaukas sawmill first started using larger special trucks to transport containers from the sawmill to the port. This has significantly reduced CO /uniF63A emissions from transport. In 2023, according to the transport partner's emissions calculator, emissions were reduced by up to 40% compared to the traditional method of transporting one container at a time.",

We are actively exploring opportunities in the energy transformation.\n\nUPM Energy is a major player in the Nordic electricity market. We produce competitive, CO 2 -free hydropower in our own plants and through shareholdings, plus nuclear power through shareholdings. Our hydropower plants meet the growing demand for renewable energy and offer rapid adjustment to an electricity system in which flexibility in other production units is decreasing and weather-dependent solar and wind power are becoming increasingly important. Flexible hydropower balances\n\n-52%\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-6pp\n\nout the system in an increasingly volatile market, while nuclear power ensures reliable baseload capacity for the system.\n\nThe electricity generated is sold to the Nordic power market. We trade directly in physical and financial electricity exchanges. We have also increased our bilateral trade with external counterparties. UPM meets the different demands of the market by optimising our electricity consumption and production, thus balancing the grid.\n\nElectrification will play an important role in moving society away from fossil-based energy sources. Demand for electricity is therefore expected to increase all over Europe. New transmission connections will increasingly link the Nordic electricity market to the continental European\n\non 31 Dec.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n81\n\nMore key figures on page 129\n\nmarket. UPM Energy is in an excellent position in a changing energy market with its CO 2 -free electricity production. In 2023, we grew our capacity to produce emission-free electricity by almost 50% through Olkiluoto 3 (OL3). We are also actively exploring new possibilities arising from the transformation, such as the hydrogen economy.\n\n## Markets calmer, root cause remained\n\nIn 2023, the energy crisis in Europe calmed down but the root cause of the crisis remained. Russia's war in Ukraine is ongoing, and Central Europe is still working on finding ways to replace natural gas as an energy source. Electricity prices were still high in Europe and significant volatility in prices has become the new normal.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Providing nuclear power for base load and hydropower for flexibility\n- \u00b7 Strong track record in physical and financial electricity markets\n- \u00b7 World-class expertise in the optimisation of power production and consumption\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Manage remarkable portfolio growth with OL3 nuclear power plant unit\n- \u00b7 Continue exploring opportunities in Powerto-X and renewable energy\n- \u00b7 New projects for the stream water programme\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TRADITIONAL HYDROPOWER MEETS MODERN METHODS\n\nBack in 2017, a group of UPM Energy hydropower experts brought together concepts under development and named the project Smart River. The project aims to build automated processes to make them work more efficiently.\n\nOver the years, the project has expanded into eight different concepts, all of which involve some form of modern technology, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT) and a lot of long-term development. In 2023, we specifically focused on developing the IoT inflow concept, whereby sensors were added to the nearby streams of hydropower plants to collect data on water inflow. The data is used, for example, to forecast inflows, especially during springtime floods when controlling water levels is difficult.\n\nThese concepts are applied to aspects such as trading, maintaining the hydropower plants, forecasting water flows and operating rivers in an optimal way.\n\nIncreased electricity supply and decreased demand led to significantly lower power prices in Finland. UPM Energy has succeeded in optimising production and creating value in a volatile market, but profits were not at the record highs compared to the exceptional year of 2022. Hydropower production volumes reached a good level and the beginning of commercial production at OL3 provided Finland with a steady base load.\n\nThe extensive renovation and modernisation of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant was completed in the spring. The plant's average annual energy production increased from 180 GWh to 195 GWh, producing more electricity with the same amount of water.\n\n## OL3 provides CO 2 -free electricity\n\nWe are responding to the growing need for CO 2 -free electricity as society electrifies and moves away from fossil fuels. The OL3 nuclear power plant unit by Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) began commercial production succesfully in May 2023.\n\nOur share of the new unit's production is approximately 500 MW through Pohjolan Voima's ownership. OL3 has significantly increased the supply of CO 2 -free electricity\n\n## In 2023, we grew our capacity to produce CO 2 -free electricity by almost 50%.\n\nin Finland and now the Olkiluoto nuclear power plants meet 30% of Finland's electricity demand.\n\n## Research on water course continues\n\nThere are many unnecessary barriers for migratory fish in Finland, such as defunct dams, and biodiversity can be enhanced by removing them. UPM's stream water programme aims to dismantle 500 km of stream waters by 2030.  By the end of 2023, we had dismantled 186 km of that goal.\n\nIn 2023, our programme funded an ongoing migratory fish research project on the Arvaja water course, where we completed a restoration project in 2022. UPM also funded the third and final stage of the Hiitolanjoki project in southeastern Finland, dismantling the dam of the Ritakoski rapid and restoring the area (page 84).\n\nwww.upmenergy.com",

The new certification lends credibility to the process of generating LCAs on a large scale, thus supporting customers and brands with greater assurance when making decisions and communicating about sustainability. With the EU currently developing a digital product passport (DPP) for all products on the market, UPM Raflatac has designed its very own product passport prototype (PPP), an environmental declaration based on existing standards and validated by DEKRA. It includes several metrics that are broken down into life cycle stages: cradle-to-gate, transport-to-customer, printing, and end of life.\n\nLabel Life is available for over 90% of our commercial portfolio.\n\npart of the packaging, but they can play a significant role in reducing a package's environmental footprint and optimising its recyclability.\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our wash-off portfolio with new paper label materials that enhance the recycling of PET and HDPE plastics. Our CarbonNeutral \u00ae certified products now cover the entire lifecycle of the label and enable our customers to prove that their printed and converted labels are carbon neutral. The development builds on our Life Cycle Assessment service, Label Life, which received a new certificate of validity from leading international assurance service provider DEKRA (on the left).\n\nOur innovative Ocean Action label won the Sustainability Award at the Label Industry Global Awards 2023. The award recognises companies demonstrating progress towards a sustainable future for the global labels industry.

Fresh food products such as these have traditionally been packaged using plastics or paper-plastic laminates.\n\nWe have worked closely with partners from across the packaging value network to develop new fibre-based solutions. We have collaborated with chemical suppliers as well as packaging and printing machine suppliers, for example, to test and optimise our materials for existing machinery. Our long-standing relationship with the German company Henkel has resulted in a concept for recyclable, heat-sealable, grease-resistant packaging material.\n\nOneBARRIER FibreCycle solution was announced as one of the winners of Packaging Europe's Sustainability Awards 2023. It is a ground-breaking paper-based high barrier solution for foods for a long shelf-life, providing an alternative to multi-layer plastic packaging that is difficult to recycle.\n\n## Our packaging papers offer fibre-based alternatives for a future beyond fossils.\n\n## Advancing a circular bioeconomy\n\nUPM has set ambitious responsibility targets for 2030 (page 32). All of our products are designed to be recycled, helping brand owners and converters adapt to regulatory changes and meet their targets of prioritising sustainable materials.

Our updated vehicle flooring panel WISA-Trans Mk2 with a new surface pattern is a great example of a product from this new overlaying line.\n\nGrowing market demand continues to represent a growth potential far into the future in other demanding industrial applications, such as the insulation elements of LNG tankers carrying liquefied natural gas, which plays an increasingly important role in the global energy mix. As a global market leader, more than 50% of all LNG ships around the world today are already insulated with WISA plywood. Drewry forecasts that the LNG fleet will expand at a CAGR of 8.5% between 2023 and 2028, driven by a buoyant trade outlook, increasing investments and boosting demand for modern\n\ntonnage. Tight shipbuilding capacity will strengthen the price of newbuilds, which will restrain fleet growth.\n\n## Tangible decarbonisation\n\nThe environmental impact of products is an increasingly important selection criterion in construction and industry. The Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) for WISA birch plywood products provide researched information on the environmental impact of product manufacture and estimates of the environmental impact of the entire lifecycle of the product in the construction industry. EPDs are currently voluntary for product manufacturers, but their importance is growing as construction requirements become stricter. UPM Plywood has published product-specific EPDs for WISA plywood since 2019. This information can be used to calculate the carbon footprint of buildings.\n\nWe have continuously taken active steps to reduce CO 2 emissions in our plywood production. In purchased electricity, our aim is to achieve zero CO 2 emissions in our plywood mills by 2024.\n\nwww.wisaplywood.com\n\nImports of birch plywood from T\u00fcrkiye and Kazakhstan have surged since anti-dumping duties and EU sanctions against Russian products came into force. The European Commission is investigating the suspected evasion of EU anti-dumping regulations regarding imports of Russian birch plywood. The Commission aims to determine whether imports to the EU truly originate from these countries, neither of which has been recognised as a significant producer of birch plywood.\n\nIllegal imports distort the market by damaging ethical European plywood manufacturers, retailers and end users. UPM Plywood is collaborating with the Woodstock Consortium, a platform of leading European birch plywood producers, to support the EU authorities in their investigation.\n\nDespite the sanctions, Russian and possibly Belarusian birch plywood is still being imported into the EU using various techniques. The EU takes a strong stance on breaches of sanctions orders and all imports of birch plywood must now be registered upon entering EU borders. The best way to fight illegal imports and unfair competition is to stay vigilant and react strongly to illegal use.",

Advanced biofuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% compared to fossil fuels. In addition to decarbonising road transportation, we help to defossilise various other industries by offering woodbased naphtha.\n\nNaphtha is the major raw material for most chemicals and plastics. UPM BioVerno\u2122 naphtha is a drop-in solution for replacing fossil-based naphtha allowing the production of sustainable chemicals and plastics. Our strategy is based on proprietary technology and UPM's integrated feedstocks.\n\n## Focus on market fundamentals\n\nIn 2023, demand for advanced biofuels was good and markets continued to benefit from a dedicated and compulsory mandate for advanced biofuels based on EU-wide rules. Simultaneously, European biofuels markets faced uncertainties due to economic slowdown and increased imports of biofuels labelled as advanced from China.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Established producer of renewable diesel and naphtha\n- \u00b7 Sustainable bio-based alternative to fossil feedstock in the petrochemical industry\n- \u00b7  Advanced biofuels belong to the highest sustainability class of biofuels\n\nThe longer term effect of Chinese imports remains uncertain.\n\nInput costs remained at a high level. Crude tall oil (CTO) markets continued to tighten due to the increased replacement of fossil fuels and stronger competition. In the first half of the year, the turnaround shutdown impacted production rates at the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery. In the second half of the year, production levels were good and production efficiency improved after the shutdown.\n\n## Green growth opportunities\n\nUPM aims to become a major European player in the production of advanced biofuels. Markets continue to grow and be driven by climate targets. According to estimates, around 30% of fossil-derived fuels used for transportation in the EU could be replaced with advanced biofuels by 2050.\n\nFurther growth in advanced biofuels plays an important role in UPM's Biofore strategy (page 23). We are currently conducting the commercial and basic engineering study for a next-generation biofuels\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Continue the basic engineering of a planned next-generation biorefinery in Rotterdam\n- \u00b7 Assess the growth opportunities and new sustainable feedstocks\n\nrefinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The new potential biorefinery would produce high quality renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuels, and raw materials for the petrochemical sector, for example in bioplastic applications. In 2023, UPM Biofuels initiated proceedings to qualify its renewable fuels as sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nOur current feedstock for biofuels in the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery is crude tall oil, which is a residue from pulp production. In our plans to increase production of advanced biofuels, we are also considering other residue streams and by-products of the forest industry. The planned biorefinery in Rotterdam would enhance material efficiency without compromising global food production.\n\nIn the future, the path to defossilisation in different transport sectors will increasingly rely on renewable synthetic fuels. Our extensive know-how and experience in biorefinery operations not only gives us a competitive edge but also opens up growth opportunities in the realm of green hydrogen solutions (page 91).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Towards 2030\n\nUPM's advanced biofuels belong to the most demanding sustainability category of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II and forthcoming RED III), which includes residues from agricultural and forestry activities. Our UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery, with an annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes, is the largest advanced biofuels-only refinery in the EU.\n\nThe newly adopted RED III Directive includes an increased target for advanced biofuels in the transport energy mix in\n\n## Our wood-based advanced biofuels mitigate climate change.\n\nEurope by 2030, reflecting a considerable increase on today's production capacity and creating significant opportunities for new investments.\n\nwww.upmbiofuels.com\n\n## TRANSFORMATION STORY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BEAUTY INSIDE OUT\n\nFinnish cosmetics company Lumene has launched a moisturiser packaged in a bio-attributed* jar. The jar utilises a wood-based plastic raw material made from crude tall oil, a residue from pulp production. It is reportedly the first cosmetics jar that contains renewable materials in both the packaging and the label.\n\nThe new jar reduces the use of fossil-based plastics by more than 60 tonnes a year and lowers the product's CO 2 emissions. The 50 ml jar is the company's most used packaging, with 1.5 million units sold annually.\n\nLUMENE's recyclable moisturiser jars contain wood-residue-based UPM BioVerno\u2122 naphtha, which is further processed by the chemical company SABIC. The labels are made from UPM Raflatac Forest Film\u2122 label material. All parties in the supply chain have ISCC PLUS sustainability certification.\n\nOne of the best ways to reduce the use of fossil materials is to work together in the value chain. The new 97% bio-attributed LUMENE jar, based on a mass balance approach*, is one way to reduce the use of fossil-based plastics.\n\n* Mass balance accounting is used to trace the flow of materials through a complex value chain. It provides a set of rules for allocating the bio-based content to different products in order to claim the content as \"bio-attributed\".",

UPM Biochemicals will be well positioned to provide renewable chemicals made from sustainable wood with a CO 2 - product footprint that is considerably below that of fossil-based chemical products and credibly documented by our third-party-reviewed LCA. Our proposition to help brands defossilise their products has gained further traction in the market and has triggered widespread support across our key markets.\n\nThe main civil works of the world's first industrial-scale wood-to-chemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany were completed in 2023 and commissioning will be gradually concluded during 2024. The relevant German authorities granted the preliminary licence to operate in 2023 - a big milestone towards start-up. The total cost of the biochemicals investment project is estimated at EUR 1,180 million.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Unique and innovative technology concept\n- \u00b7 Sustainable, certified feedstock\n- \u00b7 High-quality products for plastics, textile and rubber applications, as well as industrial liquids, with a sustainability focus that sets us apart\n- \u00b7 Very positive brand image for many consumer products in packaging, automotive, textiles and other industrial segments\n- \u00b7 A robust, scalable business platform\n\nThe biorefinery will convert solid wood into next-generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF). The biorefinery will also produce bio-monopropylene glycols (BioMPG) and industrial sugars. The total annual capacity of the biorefinery will be 220,000 tonnes.\n\nThe feedstock sourcing network has grown further, and we are continuing to close strategic partnerships to secure a stable flow of certified sustainable beechwood. Our active role in shaping the German and European policies on biomass-based materials has triggered government endorsement and is actively enabling commercial opportunities.\n\n## Positive market response and first product sales\n\nMarkets are responding very positively to our new products as we have further stepped up our sales and marketing. This shows in proactive endorsement through global consumer brands and a series of\n\n## PLANNED ACTIONS FOR 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Site completion and gradual start-up of the biorefinery\n- \u00b7 Complete team set-up and training to ensure a safe and effective start-up\n- \u00b7 Close commercial agreements to sell production\n- \u00b7 Develop additional RFF product applications and build commercial pipeline\n- \u00b7 Optimise the sustainability performance of the product portfolio\n- \u00b7 Further strengthen feedstock sustainability\n\ndevelopment partnerships in globally lead markets for sustainable chemicals.\n\nWe finalised distribution agreements for our lignin-based Renewable Functional Filler (RFF) and advanced application development to qualify RFF for applications in the automotive, fashion, building and plastics industry.\n\nWith the acquisition of German-based SunCoal Industries, we strengthened our technology portfolio for lignin-based rubber solutions and increased our process and product know-how by adding an innovative team of experts.\n\nEuropean Rubber Journal renewed their endorsement of UPM BioMotion\u2122 Renewable Functional Fillers as the most important sustainability project in the elastomers and rubber industry.\n\nFor our renewable bio-monoethylene glycols (BioMEG), UPM BioPura\u2122, we extended our development partnership with Dongsung, the leading glycols manufacturer and seller in the Korean market and one of the region's biggest materials suppliers of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM Biochemicals and German outdoor apparel supplier VAUDE will produce outerwear made from biobased chemicals.\n\nThe textile industry has long been looking for more sustainable solutions for producing polyester and polyurethane, as around 60% of all materials used in the fashion industry are made from fossil-based polymers. Polyester is the world's most widely used fibre. Yet only 15% is currently derived from recycled feedstock.\n\nIn the partnership, the fossil-based MEG component of the resin used to make polyester is replaced with UPM BioPura\u2122 bio-monoethylene glycol. The material can be used directly in the existing production process.\n\nSustainable innovations require collaboration across the value chain. In Germany, chemical company Indorama Ventures first polymerises and spins the polyester yarn, then in Prato, Italy, textile manufacturer Pontetorto processes the yarn into a new polyester fabric that VAUDE uses to make the final garment.\n\nglobal footwear brands. We also realised the first product sales with Dongsung and Brenntag, the world's leading chemicals distributor, confirming the value expectations in our BioMEG.\n\nA successful co-operation partnership with the German outdoor and performance wear brand VAUDE was met with significant public and consumer interest. We jointly launched the world's first polyester fleece jacket, containing 30% renewable content with our BioPura\u2122 BioMEG (on the left).\n\nThe transformative character of our investment was highlighted by UPM Biochemicals winning the prestigious Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS) Best Process Innovation from a Large Company Award and the International Textile Manufacturers Forum's (ITMF) Sustainability and Innovation Award.\n\n## Towards production start and commercial ramp-up\n\nThe building site is busy with more than 1,400 contractors finalising the project,\n\n## We accelerate the transition to a circular bioeconomy with our products.\n\nwith a heavy focus on piping and electrification and automation. The future operations team is trained and starts taking ownership of the processes, actively driving commissioning and start-up preparations.\n\nWith all critical materials sourced, contractor relationships tested and proven, and a firm grip on the timeline, we are confident to start up the first units of the Leuna biorefinery. To support a ramp-up from 2025 onwards, we put in place efficient sourcing and supply chain operations and agreed the relevant partnerships to enable efficient production and distribution of our products.\n\nwww.upmbiochemicals.com",

The main component in our products is nanocellulose, refined from birch wood. All products are animal-free.\n\nWe actively collaborate with universities, research centres and key industrial partners in the fields of high-throughput drug screening, personalised medicine, cell therapies, 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering and advanced wound care.\n\nIn life sciences , our main products are GrowDex \u00ae , a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing, GrowInk\u2122 a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting and GrowDase\u2122, an enzyme to release living cells from the gel. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility with even the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patient-derived cells. We also continued to study the use of GrowDex \u00ae in a cell-based model of a liver. Liver models are used to test the toxicity of almost every new pharmaceutical candidate. The mini-livers and other mini-organs are grown in our own cell laboratory in Helsinki. In 2023, we opened a new sales office and cell laboratory in Basel, Switzerland. In 2023, we continued to supply nanocellulose\n\nto Cellink and signed a distribution agreement for GrowInk\u2122 bioinks with Brinter.\n\nGrowInk\u2122 is a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting used in areas such as cancer research, where models of tumours can be printed to test their response to different treatments. The ultimate goal is to print organs or tissues that could, in the future, be transplanted into patients.\n\nIn the clinical field , many Finnish healthcare professionals and hospitals in the Nordic countries already use our CEmarked FibDex \u00ae wound dressings for skin graft donor sites. The one-time applicable products were also successfully piloted with good wound healing results in selected university hospitals in Germany. In 2023, we started the clinical investigation for superficial dermal burns at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden.\n\nwww.upmbiomedicals.com\n\nUPM BIOREFINING /uniF6BA UPM BIOCOMPOSITES\n\n## BEST IN CLASS\n\nUPM Biocomposites is creating circular economy solutions through the manufacture of innovative composite materials and decking products.

The label production side streams come from UPM Raflatac and its customers, with the waste being collected and delivered\n\nto Germany where the composite decking is manufactured.\n\nThe UPM ProFi Piazza product range is made with up to 75% recycled materials and offers best-in-class performance. We are a member of the EU Circular Plastics Alliance, which aims to increase the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nDemand for UPM ProFi products declined in 2023, with consumer and renovation/construction uncertainty being reflected in sales. At the same time, competition in the main markets intensified owing to imports from outside Europe. A storm in August broke the roof of the Bruchsal mill, and production did not restart until November.\n\nUPM Formi creates and manufactures wood-based biocomposites, enabling the carbon footprint of the end product to be reduced by up to 80% compared with similar products made from fossil-based mate-\n\nrials. The composite materials are suitable for various end uses, including kitchenware, personal care and acoustic devices. Products comply with food safety standards and other similar quality requirements.\n\nIn 2023, the new organ's facade pipes are made of wood-based UPM Formi 3D biocomposite at the Helsinki Music Centre (page 61).\n\nAs an example of material efficiency, we introduced new trays made of UPM Formi composite to Finnish ABC service stations (page 98). In 2023, the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluated the safety of wood-based fibres in contact with food and made its criteria more stringent.

We aim to provide a fact-based, balanced view of the economic, environmental and social aspects of our business activities. Active and open dialogue with our stakeholders provides valuable input for our development efforts.\n\n## Providing stakeholders with a clear picture of our future\n\nOur goal is to provide our stakeholders with a clear picture of what our future course is, how we implement our Biofore strategy and how we create long-term value for our stakeholders. We disclose relevant and accurate information in accordance with market regulations.\n\nMany stakeholder events were organised in 2023. Because many of our stakeholders view UPM primarily as an economic operator, financial success, stability, good governance, future outlook and growth were the key themes discussed. Numerous discussions were focused on forests and the current energy crisis in Europe.\n\nStakeholder mapping, active dialogue and the systematic gathering of feedback play an essential role in our stakeholder relations work. We analyse feedback carefully to understand the expectations of our stakeholders. We then take these expectations into consideration during our development work and decision-making. We received approximately 350 (300) enquiries or concerns from the general public in 2023.\n\nEvery year, we conduct a materiality analysis (page 63) that highlights the topics on which UPM has a significant impact or which have a significant impact on the\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder engagement provides predictability and a competitive advantage\n- \u00b7 Continuous dialogue improves the understanding of key risks, challenges and opportunities in the operating environment\n\n## TARGET\n\n- \u00b7 We understand stakeholders' need for information and expectations for UPM, and consider stakeholders in strategic development and decision-making processes\n\ncompany. The analysis is based on internal assessments as well as the interests and concerns of stakeholders.\n\n## Green transition high on the policy agenda\n\nThrough public affairs work, we aim to foster the necessary prerequisites for our operations, particularly in our main operating countries Finland, Uruguay, Germany and China. Active influencing at the EU level is also important.\n\nOur public affairs activities are based on our Biofore strategy and complement our Beyond fossils purpose. They are also aligned with the Paris Agreement. Public affairs are led  by EVP, Stakeholder relations, who is a member of the Group Executive Team. We also have topic specific steering groups where our public affairs activities are steered, and these topics are reviewed in the Group Executive Team regularly.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 We engage in active dialogue with our stakeholders to discuss our operations and targets\n- \u00b7 The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards for responsible behaviour and collaboration\n- \u00b7 We measure stakeholder engagement by several indicators\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder relations are coordinated globally at Group level, while businesses are responsible for continuous dialogue with customers and business partners, as well as local communities\n\nWe cooperate with a number of trade associations, the most important being the Finnish Forest Industries Federation (FFIF) and the Confederation of European Paper Industries (Cepi).\n\nAs we enter into new businesses, we also need to find new ways and forums for cooperation. For example, UPM is a founding member of the Advanced Biofuels Coalition in the EU and also a member of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).\n\nOur company is also represented in several trade associations decision-making bodies, so we can influence and monitor the positions for being aligned with our strategy. Basic requirement for membership in any trade association is the principal alignment with UPM's strategic positions. 2023 continued to be challenging for decision-makers and politicians as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine. The impact on the supply and price of energy especially\n\nchanges to ensure that the EU climate and energy legislation is in line with the EU's climate targets.\n\nWe actively promote the cost-competitive and consistent implementation of climate change policies. UPM calls for predictable regulations that enable green growth investments and further transformation beyond fossils. Therefore, EU policies must ensure sustainable forest use and the availability of wood as a key resource for the circular bioeconomy and green growth.\n\n## Responsibility at the core\n\nOur steadfast commitment to sustainability was recognised with the highest possible platinum score in the EcoVadis responsibility assessment. We continued active participation in the UN Global Compact initiatives and also chaired the Global Compact Finland Network. We also joined the UN Global Compact Forward Faster initiative which aims to accelerate the progress of UN's Sustainable Development Goals. UPM's Faster Forward commitment is related to gender\n\nduring the autumn of 2022 led to decisions on temporary market measures, which were implemented in 2023. As UPM is an active energy market participant, both as an energy intensive consumer and as an energy producer, we reminded decision-makers of the importance of functioning energy markets.\n\nClimate change mitigation and our commitment to the UN's 1.5-degree agenda continued to garner a lot of interest among our stakeholders. Discussions were held with environmental organisations, certification bodies, authorities and decision-makers. The climate impact on forests is linked to policies on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). We have highlighted the importance of sustainable forest management and manufacturing products from renewable raw materials that replace fossils as effective ways to mitigate climate change.\n\nThe EU's Fit for 55 package proposal was published in 2021 and during 2023 both the European Parliament and the EU member states continued to finalise the\n\n## OUR MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS\n\nOur Biofore strategy forms the foundation of our stakeholder dialogue. The key focus areas and activities vary locally and according to stake holder needs. Key stakeholders are defined on the basis of materiality: UPM's operations have a significant impact on stakeholders and/or vice versa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A NEW ORGAN AT THE HELSINKI MUSIC CENTRE\n\nIn autumn 2023, the Helsinki Music Centre concert hall received a new modern organ, one of the largest in the world. The handbuilt Rieger concert hall organ weighs 40 tonnes and consists of around 10,000 handmade metal and wooden pipes. Some of the wind lines that traditionally run inside the organ have been made visible. The curved elements of the fa\u00e7ade consist of both sounding pipes and wind lines.\n\nThe facade's sounding pipes and wind lines are made of wood-based UPM Formi 3D biocomposite. The material developed by UPM is suitable for end-use applications that require acoustic, sound-absorbing properties. Altogether, the organ has some 260 metres of 3D biocomposite pipes.\n\nThe project, which began in 2021, was also funded through a fundraising campaign by the Helsinki Music Centre Foundation. UPM is one of the donors through the company's Biofore Share and Care programme.\n\nThe money from the campaign will be used to produce organ music, organ repertoires and events. The instrument, which cost EUR 4.4 million, was inaugurated at a celebration concert on 1 January 2024.",

We also received criticism of our operations in Finland and Uruguay from some stakeholders (page 31).\n\nOur Forest Action Programme, published in 2022, will run until 2030 (page 82). As part of the programme, we collaborated with the Finnish Osprey Foundation and Vida Silvestre in Uruguay.\n\nWe were an active international stakeholder member of the PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, PEFC/02-44-41) and participated in the development of the PEFC forest certification system, reflecting our aim to promote sustainable forest management globally. In Finland, we participated in updating the forest management standards in both the FSC\u2122 (Forest Stewardship Council\u2122, FSC\u2122 N003385) and the PEFC schemes.\n\nResponsibility issues were also raised in customer enquiries, with product safety, sustainable forest management and climate change as key themes.

By the end of 2023, 1,366 teachers in the inner agricultural areas of Uruguay had received training in a project supported by the Foundation that began in 2015. The courses are organised by partner organisations such as the Catholic University of Uruguay, the University of Montevideo and various organisations and foundations.\n\nThe UPM Foundation has also supported the Ronda project in Paso de los Toros.

In Uruguay, we built a second pulp mill in 2019-2023. The UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill began its operations in central Uruguay in mid-April and the mill opening ceremony, attended by many stakeholders, took place in June 2023. Stakeholder engagement around the project has been active throughout the entire project.\n\nWe aim to engage and hold open dialogue with local communities. For example, the UPM Fray Bentos mill arranges regular visits of the mill, and our Kymi and Kaukas mills have their own forums for local dialogue. We also cooperate with local schools and education networks, organising events and excursions, for example. In addition, it is crucial for us to engage in active dialogue with local forest owners, neighbours of harvesting sites and other individuals involved in forest management.\n\nIn Uruguay, UPM transferred 60 family houses used as temporary housing during the Paso de los Toros mill construction phase to the Ministry of Housing and Territorial Planning. The houses were awarded by the authorities to families in the area. In addition, UPM transferred 640 housing modules that will be converted into 132 permanent houses and two properties with the\n\nto new alternative learning environments where children can have fun and learn together. Ronda's 13 modules are designed for a variety of uses, from workstations and traditional seating to climbing areas and a specially designed quiet space for children. The soft shapes and colours aim to create a warm and comfortable environment.\n\nThe modules are currently installed in four schools in Paso de los Toros, with a total of 650 pupils and 46 teachers. The project promotes educational inclusion and diversity and encourages teachers and students to move from traditional classrooms to a space where each child can choose their way of interacting and learning.\n\nwww.upm.uy/fundacion/(esp)\n\nEUR 0.9 million (EUR 0.9 million).

In 2023, we changed our approach to a double-materiality assessment to prepare for the upcoming EU CSRD regulation. Double refers to considering both impact materiality, such as UPM's impacts on people and environment and financial materiality, i.e. sustainability-related risks and opportunities likely to have financial implications to UPM. The analysis covers negative and positive as well as actual and potential impacts on economy, environment and people, including impacts on their human rights.\n\nImpacts are identified through internal assessments, audits and reviews, as well as by following up the interests and concerns of various stakeholder\n\nImpact materialit y\n\nnecessary infrastructure to develop further housing projects.\n\nIn Uruguay, we increased safety awareness in cooperation with the government of Uruguay, in preparation for railway operations due to begin in 2024 (page 73).\n\nOur EMAS (EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) statements cover societal impacts in addition to environmental performance, providing more detailed information on the local impacts of our pulp and paper mills. The EMAS statements also include information on cooperation with local stakeholders, such as the sponsorship of local organisations and the cooperation with educational institutions. These mill-specific statements complement UPM's corporate EMAS reporting. They are compiled annually and published on the UPM website www.upm.com/responsibility.\n\n2023 marked the 150th anniversary of the beginning of UPM operations in Kaukas, Finland. The anniversary celebrations included events for both employees and stakeholders, as well as the publication of a book on the history of the mills.\n\nIn 2023, we assessed our local community engagement practices. The results indicate that we would benefit from a clarified and more consistent approach to local community consultation and social monitoring. We will continue to update our company policies and reporting practices in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsalaried employees can spend up to eight hours per year on local volunteering work during their working hours. In 2023, UPMers engaged in various volunteering initiatives in many of our operating countries including Finland, Poland, Germany, China, Malaysia and the United States. The activities included house-building projects for those in need, visiting elderly residents in retirement homes and providing Christmas gifts to children in need. Furthermore, multiple UPM sites took part in environmental clean-up activities.

Our values-Trust and be trusted, Achieve together and Renew with courage-guide us along the way.\n\nWe are determined to be a responsible and attractive employer now and in the future. We want to strengthen employees' sense of belonging and the feeling that they are doing meaningful work. This promotes productivity, engagement and wellbeing.\n\nWe measure our progress regularly. The annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES) has invited all employees to evaluate different aspects of their work every year since 2007. The high participation rate of 81% (79%) indicates that UPMers are keen to improve their workplace. The overall engagement score is 70 (70). According to the EES results, UPMers have the resources they need to do their job well and they feel comfortable being themselves at work. Also, they are able to successfully balance their work and private life. These three aspects - resources, authenticity, and work life balance - are our strengths.\n\nOur values lay the foundation of who we are. Building a culture of Aiming Higher is essential to our success in today's rapidly changing world. We are accountable, performance-driven, human-centric and eager to learn and grow. Our aim is to increase employee motivation further and make growth opportunities more visible and accessible.\n\n## We work together to create a more innovative tomorrow.\n\n## Encouraging learning\n\nIn an increasingly complex business environment, enhancing employees' skills and wellbeing is important for both\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthened sense of meaningful work and belonging among all UPMers\n- \u00b7 Higher performance\n- \u00b7 Happier and healthier work environment\n- \u00b7 Passionate and purposeful leadership\n- \u00b7 Create the future beyond fossils\n- \u00b7 Improved safety performance\n\n## TARGET\n\n- \u00b7 Improved performance, engagement and professional growth\n\nbusiness success and sustained employability. Our long-term goal is to ensure high performance and continuous professional development.\n\nWe invest in the growth of our people and expect individuals to be eager to learn and develop. All employees are encouraged to create an individual development plan and keep it up to date. In 2023, 81% of employees had documented development plans. In the EES, the result from the question about good opportunities to learn and grow at UPM was 64 (64).\n\nWe apply the 70-20-10 learning and development framework: 70% of the learning takes place on the job; 20% comes from sharing with and learning from colleagues; and 10% comes from training.\n\nExpert communities have an important role in sharing and learning across the\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Lead according to our values and with integrity\n- \u00b7 Lead change in a human-centred way\n- \u00b7 Develop an inclusive and diverse working environment\n- \u00b7 Engage employees to create the future beyond fossils\n- \u00b7 Develop future ways of working and collaborating\n- \u00b7 Enable performance with agile goal setting and feedback\n- \u00b7 Invest in the growth of our people and build new capabilities\n- \u00b7 Provide a safe and healthy working environment and foster the wellbeing of employees and contractors\n- \u00b7 Ensure fair, equitable and competitive rewarding for all employees\n\ncompany. In addition to the existing expert communities, new ones were set up around topics such as sustainability and AI in 2023.\n\nAs part of our UPM Experience programme, the Digi-enabled operator project enabled smooth access to relevant learning content and activities in 2023. The aim is to develop digital solutions to help shop floor employees with learning and sharing in the workflow.\n\nWe have introduced new digital learning content and online programmes on a continuous basis. They encourage individuals to strengthen their self-leadership and resilience and support leaders in enabling their teams to perform and grow. We offer e-learning content to develop skills in commerce, finance, compliance, safety, leadership, design thinking and citizen development, for example.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developing employee experience and enabling renewal\n\nDeveloping employee experience is a key aspect of developing UPM as a workplace. To strengthen our work community, we started a dialogue on our purpose and values in 2021, which we continued in 2022-2023.\n\nAll UPMers are given the opportunity to create a personal and team-based connection to our purpose, values and Aiming Higher mindset. Managers have been provided with support to facilitate discussions in their teams. The EES results show that we need to continue the dialogue to maintain our employees' excitement about UPM's future and their sense of belonging.\n\nWe have launched projects to develop future ways of working and digital capabilities, and to create global health and wellbe-\n\ning concepts as part of our UPM Experience programme. We are committed to caring for our employees to feel physically energetic, mentally balanced, included and proud to work at UPM.\n\nDigital work is an important part of the experience. We are continuously developing our collaboration tools and intranet, Griffin Forum, which was launched at the end of 2022. It connects and engages employees globally. Human centricity and design thinking guide us in content creation. In 2023, we trained nearly 10% of our employees to Power Platform citizen development tools. Employees can create applications and automate work flows to support their daily work.\n\nWe have continued to develop our employees' career experience.

Managers ensure that the plans are relevant. The aim is to support employees to keep their passion and expertise fresh for current and future jobs through continuous development.\n\nWe encourage and enable employees to contribute to projects such as gigs (on the right). These are a good way to contribute, learn new skills and network. We have developed our project approach to support the project way of working and enable success\n\n## IN ACTION\n\n## PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WITH STUDENTS\n\nThe Sustainable Design Studio course organised by LAB University of Applied Sciences and UPM offered students the opportunity to delve into the world of sustainable design. During the course, students were familiarised with UPM's packaging materials and then developed innovative concepts from renewable materials.\n\nThe course introduced the characteristics of UPM's packaging materials and practical\n\nin different development projects.\n\nBeing the employer of choice has become crucial when recruiting new employees, especially younger professionals. We have been able to retain and attract employees despite the heated labour market.\n\nWe have organised several successful graduate programmes in recent years. Our apprenticeship programmes are a way to ensure the required level of expertise for future employees. The programmes typically focus on shop floor production or maintenance work and are run together with vocational training partners. In 2023,\n\nexamples of how they can be used to replace fossil-based materials. The students focused on using either UPM's specialty papers and label materials, UPM's biocomposites or alternatives incorporating several materials.\n\nThe winning concept blends an interesting idea with a near-ready commercialisation concept. The Hangry Boy frozen pizza packaging made from recyclable materials combines the imaginative use of packaging paper with ease of use. The packaging is also designed to meet the needs of consumers in many ways. The course is a continuation of the long-standing collaboration between the Lahti Centre of Design Expertise and UPM.\n\nEach employee belongs to a unified annual Short-Term Incentive (STI) scheme. The scheme covers Group and business-level targets, personal and team performance targets and individual performance evaluation to differentiate and reward high performance.\n\nThe annual incentives paid in 2023 for the 2022 STI plan amounted to EUR 58.8 million, and the estimated amount of annual incentives for the 2023 plan is EUR 47.9 million. We recognise significant individual or team success with a separate Achievement Award system. It is designed to support UPM's high-performance culture and recognise individuals and teams for outstanding contribution, significant achievements and exceptional performance.\n\nIn addition to the Short-Term Incentive scheme, we provide two long-term incentive plans: the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees. These annual plans cover approximately 400 participants in total.\n\n## Promoting cooperation\n\nWe are committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations. We offer various forums to facilitate continuous dialogue between employees and business management.\n\nThe UPM European Forum is a cooperative body that focuses on issues related to our business environment and changes within the company. The forum organises regular meetings for employee representatives from business units in Europe. Our other cooperative bodies in Finland and Germany aim to promote employee participation and dialogue, both between the business areas and country-level management and between employee representatives and employees on a national level.\n\nand teams empowered by inspiring and inclusive leaders. In the long term, we aim to strengthen the leadership culture based on UPM's values and the Aiming Higher mindset which enables everyone to grow, perform and achieve business results. We continuously invest in developing leadership capabilities to ensure that leaders throughout UPM have the capabilities they need to lead themselves, people and business and drive the transformation journey toward a future beyond fossils.\n\nOur leadership development programmes are designed to achieve those long-term goals. In recent years, the key areas of development have been inclusive and purposeful leadership, high-performing teams, building success on strengths, self-leadership and coaching. In 2023, we introduced a new programme on psychological safety and emotional intelligence to strengthen human-centric skills and included a strengths assessment into our portfolio of assessments for development.\n\n## Rewarding and recognising high performance\n\nWe reward and recognise high performance. Our approach to rewarding and recognising employees consists of both tangible and intangible components. Tangible remuneration and recognition consists of base salary, benefits and incentives, which are determined by UPM's global rules, local legislation, general agreements, local market practices, the level of the position and individual performance. Gender, age, ethnic origin and nationality play no role in determining salaries and wages.\n\nIntangible remuneration and recognition consists of, for instance, a safe and healthy working environment, interesting and meaningful work, and good leadership and career opportunities. We have designed our reward policy to increase employee commitment to, and motivation for, high performance.\n\n| UPM PERSONNEL IN FIGURES   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees                  | 16,573 | 17,236 | 16,966 |\n| Turnover, %                | 11 . 1 | 14.7   | 14.5   |\n| Turnover, % (voluntary)    | 5.1    | 6.8    | 5.6    |\n| Average age                | 44.3   | 44.1   | 44.3   |\n\n## UPM's personnel by business area 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull time 97% Permanent 92%\n\nPart time 3% Fixed term 8%\n\napproximately 500 people had participated in the apprenticeship programmes.\n\nWe are working on our employer brand both internally and in the countries where we operate.

We also finalised our exit from Russia, with the largest impact on our plywood business. Temporary layoffs were carried out in nearly all businesses.\n\nThe closures and restructuring significantly decreased the number of personnel. To alleviate the impact of the closures on our employees, together with the employee representatives, we implemented active measures that promote employment and retraining. At the same time, we recruited new people in our growth businesses in Uruguay and in Germany.\n\nA diverse and inclusive working culture on page 68 Advancing human rights across our businesses on page 72\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## EXPANDING HORIZONS WITH GIGS\n\nGigs, introduced in 2023, are short-term, small, business and individual value-added projects for which employees can use 10-20% of their working time. Gigs support employees' development and enable the dynamic resourcing of smaller projects relevant to the business.\n\nGigs bring benefits to all parties involved: gig hosts, gig members, the business and the members' own line organisation. They contribute to the UPM experience and increase cooperation and learning throughout the Group. We get agility and dynamism into our organisation. The goal is also to lower the threshold for internal rotation.\n\nAll UPM employees can apply for the projects. In 2023, a total of 44 gigs were carried out in the Group, involving 150 people, on topics such as carbon utilisation, AI, customer claim handling and project way of working.",

We respect the privacy of our employees and promote equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development.\n\nAll UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ethnic origin or nationality, for example. We welcome the talent of people with diverse skills and backgrounds in our global team. Promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, but also a prerequisite for our business success and for a healthy work\n\nenvironment. Rich points of view improve decision-making and business success.\n\nDiversity and inclusion are part of our Aiming Higher mindset and thus part of our cultural development plan.

Our EES also measures authenticity (i.e. feeling comfortable being oneself) and fair treatment, which are important strengths for us. We continuously follow up on them.\n\n## Regular monitoring\n\nWe regularly review our diversity status and data. Our management teams conduct self-assessments that address diversity and inclusion. Managers and HR have dashboards with diversity data. Processes such as rewarding and recruitment are followed up on regularly.

We also want to foster a culture of collaboration, where employees share their ideas and learn from each other.\n\nOne of the ways we support diversity and inclusion is through our Employee Resource\n\nincrease female representation. According to our analysis, men and women have equal opportunities to progress at UPM.\n\nWe have carried out a gender pay equity review every year since 2021, closing the gender pay gap that cannot be explained by the factors that typically determine a person's salary and how it develops. We will continue to monitor this development annually and make corrections if needed. In 2023, we committed to the UN Forward Faster Initiative with gender equality.\n\nTo further develop inclusive leadership and culture, we started a dialogue with management teams in 2019 and continued this work across the company in 2023. Approximately 2,600 UPMers have participated in the dialogue since.\n\nWe broadened our understanding on leading diverse teams and developed awareness of LGBTIQ+ diversity and inclusion in the workplace among our top leaders in 2022. We launched e-learning training on this topic for all UPMers. Nearly 700 people have taken the training. To get support in developing our practices, UPM joined as a member to the Workplace Pride in 2023.\n\nWe defined our Employee Resource Group approach in a project with diverse people around UPM and established a network on LGBTIQ+ (BeU) in 2023 (below). The BeU has attracted interest among UPMers.

Safety is incorporated in all our daily operations and in new and ongoing projects, proactive safety forms an integral part of project plans and site practices. The thorough investigation of incidents and effective risk management play an important role in making our operations safer. We also share safety observations and best practices in our business units to improve safety.\n\nWe aim to have zero accidents. Despite our continuous efforts to prevent all accidents, in 2023, we had five serious accidents (three in Finland, one in Germany and one in China). Out of the five accidents,\n\none happened to a contractor and four to UPM employees.\n\nAll accidents were thoroughly investigated in close cooperation with authorities and contractors.

Its aim is to develop safety practices more from an employee perspective and engage people more in safety. Discussions concerning safety were held at mills and other workplaces in the autumn. In addition to obtaining employees' insight, the group discussions and workshops were also aimed at gathering ideas for further development.\n\nThe aim of the discussions was to bring together all employees and gather experiences about safety in their workplace. Employees were asked specific questions, such as how they would describe the best possible scenario and how they would improve safety at the site.\n\nBy the end of 2023, more than 6,500 employees in over 50 sites had taken part in the discussions. Responses will be analysed both locally and globally. In 2024, work to develop of a new safety vision and various development projects will continue.\n\n## the certification.\n\nOur actions to ensure business continuity with regards to COVID-19 continued in 2023 and focus was placed mainly on managing the situation locally as the pandemic and required measures varied significantly in different countries and locations.\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTRIF below 2 for UPM workforce and including contractors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nachieved for total injuries per one million hours worked\n\nAbsenteeism rate below 2 for UPM employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nabsence rate achieved as % of theoretical working hours\n\nsafety risk assessments were incorporated into the investment process and the key elements of process safety were integrated into loss prevention surveys conducted in our mills by an external partner.\n\nWe continued to run training sessions on behavioural-based safety leadership for UPMers in various businesses. The training supports our managers in providing safety leadership so that safety naturally forms part of daily management and ways of working.\n\nAnnual safety audits are an integral part of our OHS management system. Cross-functional auditing provides valuable feedback about selected OHS processes and daily activities. In 2023, our auditing focused on risk management and operating permits.\n\n## Vision for health and wellbeing\n\nWe continued to implement our UPM Health and Wellbeing vision, which takes a holistic approach that is divided into four themes: body, mind, heart and soul.\n\nThe health and wellbeing pulse survey, conducted in May, showed improved results in all questions compared to 2022. During the year, we organised a company-wide virtual health and wellbeing campaign as well as local activities. The psycho-social risks were one of the focus areas in the company-wide safety week. We also piloted virtual support services for mental wellbeing in selected locations.\n\nAll production units have an OHS management system, of which 90% have the ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety management system certification. It means that 74% of our employees are covered by\n\n| UPM WORKFORCE INCLUDING CONTRACTORS                    |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total injuries per one million hours worked, TRIF      |    5.2 |    5.9 |    7.2 |\n| Lost-time accidents per one million hours worked, LTAF |    3.4 |    3.3 |    3.5 |\n| Serious accidents                                      |    5   |    5   |    3   |\n| Fatalities                                             |    0   |    3   |    0   |\n\n| UPM WORKFORCE                                          |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total injuries per one million hours worked, TRIF      |    6.1 |    6.4 |    6.3 |\n| Lost-time accidents per one million hours worked, LTAF |    3.7 |    3.2 |    3.1 |\n| Serious accidents                                      |    4   |    3   |    2   |\n| Fatalities                                             |    0   |    0   |    0   |\n| % absence hours from theoretical working time*         |    4.3 |    4.5 |    4.1 |\n| Occupational diseases*                                 |    5   |    6   |    5   |",

We must not only understand the impacts on people and changes in our business environment, but also use our leverage to respond to these shifts.\n\nIn September, we joined the UN Global Compact Forward Faster initiative (page 30). It recognises the critical role of living wages and gender equality in promoting respect for human rights and tackling inequality.\n\nAs an example, our social responsibility targets aim to increase female representation in professional and managerial roles to 40% by 2030 and ensure gender pay equity among all employees globally. Our living wage assessment is conducted annually in collaboration with an external partner using a proven methodology, process and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'IF THERE'S A TRACK, THERE'S A TRAIN /uniF6BB STOP!'\n\nRebuilding the state-owned railroad from Paso de los Toros to Montevideo is one of the most significant infrastructure projects in Uruguay's history. Along with the 273-kilometre railway, the project also involves the construction of 246 level crossings, 66 railway bridges and 25 stations.\n\nReviving the track requires more than just rebuilding it; it also means reactivating the dormant safety culture and coexistence with the railway. As one of the main future users of the railway, UPM collaborated with the Uruguayan Ministry of Transport and Public Works and the leading traffic safety organisation Autom\u00f3vil Club del Uruguay (Automobile Club of Uruguay) on the launch of a Railway Safety Awareness Programme.\n\nIn the first phase, work was done to inform and mobilise all the communities that live in proximity of the track and included rail safety workshops with local authorities and organisations related to traffic, road safety, emergency, security and health. Later, the scope was broadened to include schools and educational centres.\n\nSo far, the programme has reached more than 250 authorities and key leaders, 6,000 students and teachers in 25 communities and the total reach is even greater. On-site actions are also complemented with media campaigns. The programme will continue throughout 2024.\n\nWith this risk assessment practice, we identify topics that are specific to one country or unit as well as changes in our operating environment that may impact people, particularly those in the most vulnerable positions. Migrant workers, women, young workers and temporary and contractor workers have been identified as groups with a higher risk of potentially experiencing adverse impacts across our value chain.\n\nOverall, contractors perform a significant proportion of our activities, for example in maintenance at our production units, in construction work and in forestry operations. In 2023, we continued our work on contractor management and initiated a project to develop UPM's model to manage contractors' social responsibility performance.\n\n## Responding to stakeholder concerns\n\nEffective management of grievances is an essential part of our due diligence to ensure respect for human rights and environmental protection. We operate grievance mechanisms that allow our employees, stakeholders and other potentially affected individuals to raise concerns or complaints. In 2023, we strengthened our mechanisms and updated our internal procedures for managing and documenting stakeholders' concerns regarding human rights and environmental concerns. Implementation of and training on these procedures will continue in 2024.\n\nOur operations in Uruguay and particularly our new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill, have raised concerns among some of our stakeholders. In 2023, we received a communication via the UN Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council requesting information about UPM's activities and their possible connection to the water scarcity that effected the metropolitan area. Our response is publicly available and details why the allegations are considered unfounded.\n\nWe continue to promote active dialogue with our stakeholders and welcome further discussion and feedback.\n\nWe monitor and work to remediate adverse impacts on human rights that we become aware of and that our activities have contributed to or caused. Remediation is specified case-by-case based on verified impacts.\n\nbenchmarks including estimates for all our countries and cities. An external assurance partner provides verification of our results and methodology.\n\nPromoting human rights requires internal capacity building but also collaborative action. We continued to take part in several collaborative forums such as the Human Rights Business Learning Programme by Shift, Together for Sustainability (TfS) and the UN Global Compact (UNGC).\n\n## Focus on salient issues\n\nIn 2023, we reviewed our salient human rights issues in connection to our materiality analysis and the associated stakeholder input.  We will continue to develop our saliency assessment and further engage the rightsholders and internal and external stakeholders. The review of our global salient issues will be finalised in 2024.\n\nWe focused especially on assessing salient human rights issues in our supply chains and affected communities. We also strengthened our internal capabilities to identify human rights-related risks by organising workshops and trainings. Our saliency assessment highlights topics such as fair terms and conditions of work, occupational safety, forced labour and modern slavery in global supply chains, environmental impacts, biodiversity, land use and community safety.\n\nAcross our salient issues, we acknowledge the importance of collaboration and the continuous development of our due diligence work. In 2023, we strengthened our human rights due diligence practices in investments and business development projects. In Uruguay, we focused on community rail safety (on the right) and started a human rights impact assessment across our operations in collaboration with an external partner. The assessment supports our continuous due diligence activities and strengthens our ability to communicate about our human rights work.\n\n## Identifying actual and potential impacts\n\nOur businesses identify human rights risks and impacts on a regular basis and prioritise focus areas accordingly. This practise is being integrated into their unit-specific management systems to ensure continuity.",

The compliance system is embedded in our governance model and is designed to bolster company performance and a culture of integrity at all levels. We follow how this culture is developing with the help of our annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES). In the EES, the average score about how ethically people at UPM behave was 75 (74), when the external benchmark was 79 (78).\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nWith the support of our compliance team, each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying and managing compliance risks related to its own operations. We use the results of annual risk assessments to guide compliance activities and mitigation actions in businesses and functions.\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Compliant operations and behaviour\n- \u00b7 An engaging work environment where employees feel safe to voice their concerns\n- \u00b7 Responsible value creation\n\nTogether, the compliance team and the businesses update the risk assessments and mitigation actions throughout the year to respond to changes in the risk environment. The progress of mitigation actions is reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and businesses on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Policies and procedures\n\nPolicies and procedures form the basis of our compliance programme. We review their update needs in accordance with our policy management process annually.\n\nThe world around us is in constant movement, our businesses evolve, and the regulatory environment changes.

This ensures that they are committed to the same standards of integrity as we are.\n\nWe complement the e-learning modules with face-to-face and virtual compliance training with specific target groups. The target groups are determined based on risk assessments. The compliance training sessions are supported by active communication. In 2023, amongst other things, we introduced the Code Newsletter highlighting topical compliance content; this is sent to all employees via email on a regular basis.\n\n## UPM COMPLIANCE SYSTEM\n\n## Company performance\n\nCorporate reputation, financial performance, operational excellence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Culture of integrity",

The most important compliance review findings and recommendations are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and businesses. These recommendations are then carried out in collaboration with said businesses.\n\n## The integrity of our people provides a solid foundation for our continued success and growth.\n\nIn 2023, the compliance team conducted compliance reviews in five local units or operations in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. Another example of our compliance team's monitoring activity is the counterparty screening procedures shown in the illustration on the right.\n\n## Voicing concerns\n\nIt is an important part of our culture of integrity that employees feel comfortable voicing any concerns they have and that they can trust UPM to take the appropriate action. If we see or suspect any misconduct or unethical behaviour, we must speak up and report it. We do not tolerate retaliation against any person who, in good faith, reports suspected misconduct or assists with an investigation to resolve suspected misconduct.\n\nIn 2023, we published our third internal Integrity Report, the purpose of which is to communicate to our employees examples of cases of misconduct and how they have been handled within the company. We also further developed our internal procedures for handling misconduct reports.\n\nThe table on the left summarises the number of cases recorded in our misconduct case management system in 2023 and provides examples of cases handled. 21 (8) cases led to disciplinary action, including warnings and terminations of employment. Investigations into misconduct include a root cause analysis that aims to identify whether compliance programme improvements are necessary.",

We buy products, materials, and services from some 20,000 B2B suppliers globally. Our sourcing network includes suppliers from start-up companies to international corporations. We also buy wood from around 15,000 private forest owners.\n\nThe main sourcing categories are fibre, chemicals, other raw materials, indirect purchases, logistics and energy. When selecting suppliers, our most important priorities include reliable long-term deliveries,\n\ncost competitiveness, product and service quality, suppliers' financial stability, social and environmental responsibility, product safety and the product's carbon footprint.\n\nSuppliers also play a significant role in UPM's transformation and business-specific growth projects. Supplier management, together with the required competencies and digitalisation, boost product development and the commercialisation of new products.\n\n## Sustainable supply chain programme\n\nFor the first time in 2023, our responsible sourcing practices and priorities were formulated into a cohesive, over-arching sustainable supply chain programme. Each element entails clear instructions regarding the relevant sourcing and supply chain management practices and implications at UPM, as well as tangible guidance, requirements and expectations for UPM's suppliers. Effective implementation is managed and tracked through our 2030 responsibility targets and performance indicators.\n\n## COMPLIANCE\n\nWe are committed to responsible sourcing practices, as per our Code of Conduct. The minimum requirements for suppliers are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third-Party Code. We expect suppliers to promote the same requirements in their own supply chains. In 2023, 89% (88%) of our total spend was with suppliers who are committed to the Supplier and Third-Party Code.\n\nWe also apply additional, category-specific requirements for example to wood, chemicals, pulp, packaging materials and logistics. The requirements refer to environmental performance, social responsibility and reporting. Contractors working\n\nat our production sites must comply with UPM's safety requirements.\n\n## Strict requirements for wood-based materials\n\nAll the wood we use is legally logged and comes from sustainably managed forests. We don't use wood harvested from tropical rainforests or accept wood from plantations that have been established by converting natural forests. We don't accept wood from regions that do not respect the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nIn addition, we verify that the wood supplied to our mills is compliant with applicable timber and deforestation legislation and other regional requirements.\n\nOur wood, pulp and recovered paper suppliers are continuously evaluated with regard to environmental and social responsibility and their involvement in the local community. These raw materials are either FSC\u2122- (N003385) and PEFC- (PEFC/0244-41) certified or comply with the FSC Controlled Wood standard or Due Diligence requirements for PEFC.\n\nWe source all wood assortments to ensure the optimal utilisation of this valuable raw material. We purchased 25.5 (19.8) million cubic metres of wood worldwide in 2023. We suspended the purchasing of wood in Russia after the start of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n## RISK MITIGATION\n\nWe identify our suppliers with the greatest business relevance and supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts.\n\nIn 2023, we improved risk management in our supply chain. We created risk man-\n\n## SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN PROGRAMME\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| We create a future beyond fossils - Together   | We create a future beyond fossils - Together

All suppliers are screened regularly with our counterparty risk management tool.\n\nIf any non-conformities are identified, the supplier is required to take corrective measures. We monitor the implementation of these measures and provide support to improve the suppliers' operations if needed. Some contracts may have to be discontinued due to insufficient measures or the seriousness of UPM's findings.\n\nIn 2023, we renewed UPM's Responsible Procurement Guidebook to improve supply chain resilience and risk management. By the end of 2023, a total of 420 UPMers had completed the online training.\n\nWe continued our close collaboration with Together for Sustainability (TfS).\n\n## Extensive supplier audits and reviews\n\nIn 2023, our own trained auditors and external auditors carried out 95 (121) audits globally, based on identified risks related to social and environmental topics, including human rights.\n\nWe identified approximately 125 find-\n\nings in these audits in 2023. One of the findings was considered critical with potential significant negative social impacts. Corrective actions and development plans with suppliers are underway. All findings are followed-up with corrective action plans and further audits in close collaboration with our suppliers.\n\nWe also carried out 890 (360) contractor reviews in Uruguay focusing on working conditions. The number increased with the new pulp mill in Uruguay. Around 540 (520) of our suppliers completed sustainability assessments with EcoVadis.\n\n## AMBITION\n\nWe seize sustainability-related opportunities to create business value through supplier development and collaboration. Our sourcing ambitions focus on selected environmental, social and governance topics (above). We use shared development and innovation projects with our suppliers and different sustainability initiatives.\n\nIn 2023, we focused on collaboration in climate action via our Group-wide -30 by 30 programme on CO 2 emission reductions in the supply chain (page 93).\n\nwww.upm.com/about-us/for-suppliers",

These solutions are aiming for a minimum level of taxation of companies in the countries where they operate (the OECD's Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution), as well as standardised public tax reporting by companies (the EU's public country-by-country reporting).\n\nWe have implemented our transparent and responsible Tax Strategy for several years. Therefore, we welcome any initiatives for more standardised global tax reporting by corporations, as well as those for fair and responsible tax payments in the countries where corporations operate. We continue to monitor and prepare for these developments in the global principles of taxation and to assess the impact on UPM.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Based on the standards of the UPM Code of Conduct, the UPM Tax Strategy describes the main principles and guidelines for our taxation\n- \u00b7 Taxes are paid in accordance with local tax laws and regulations that apply to the country in question\n- \u00b7 We pay corporate income taxes in the countries where added value is created and profit is generated\n\nWe will modify our tax reporting accordingly as soon as the final definitions are available.\n\n## Corporate income taxes vary by country\n\nDespite the challenging circumstances, our businesses were able to continue their operations with solid results, resulting in the related tax revenue in various countries. In 2023, UPM's effective tax rate was 15.2% (19.9%) and its cash tax rate was 39.5% (16.2%). The corporate income tax reported in 2023 was EUR 71 million (EUR 388 million) and the corporate income tax paid in 2023 was EUR 183  million (EUR 315 million). In addition to taxes on income, our various production inputs and outputs are also subject to taxation, which is either paid by us (e.g. energy tax or property tax such as taxes on real estate) or collected by us (e.g. VAT, payroll tax and social security\n\ncontributions). We paid  taxes on real estate, equity and similar properties in various countries to the sum of EUR 37 million (EUR 35 million).\n\nThe table on the right displays the corporate income tax and taxes on real estate, equity and similar properties paid in our main countries of operation. Based on our corporate and operational structure, UPM mainly reports and pays its corporate income tax in countries where production and innovating activity takes place.\n\nIn Finland, we have significant production operations across our six business areas, as well as research and development operations. As a result, UPM is typically one of the major taxpayers in Finland. UPM's corporate income tax in Finland in 2023 is estimated to be EUR 112 million (EUR 247 million), which includes taxes reported and paid by UPM-Kymmene Corporation as well as its Finnish subsidiaries.\n\nIn Uruguay, the government has granted several free-trade zone permits for domestic and foreign investments. The Uruguayan government has granted our pulp mills a permit to operate in a free-trade zone. Consequently, taxes in Uruguay mainly consist of taxes on property and equity and annual tax-like charges paid to the Uruguayan government for the development of the zone.\n\nIn China, as a fine paper producer, UPM qualifies as a high-tech enterprise with a reduced corporate income tax rate of 15%. UPM also pays withholding tax on dividends in China.\n\nIn countries where our companies are using tax losses from previous years to offset the tax liability of the year in question, such as Germany, limited corporate income tax is paid.\n\nincluding a temporary profit tax on the electricity sector in Finland for 2023.\n\nEnergy taxation is relevant to us not only as a significant electricity producer but also in our manufacturing processes and the taxation of end products, as well as taxation at various levels of the supply chain.\n\nElectricity produced by us is subject to electricity taxation, regardless of which sources are used. The majority of our electricity production is CO 2 free hydropower and nuclear power.\n\nIn addition, our renewable products (UPM BioVerno diesel and naphtha produced from a residue of pulp production) are subject to the energy taxation charged by fuel distributors to their customers. However, the energy tax rates for transport fuels from renewable and sustainable sources, like UPM BioVerno, are lower than those from fossil fuels.\n\nMost of the energy used in our production processes is subject to energy tax, although there are various tax rates and exemptions depending on the type of use. We also pay a significant amount of energy tax on fuels for logistics costs, especially for road transportation.\n\nWithin the EU, energy taxation laws allow member states to compensate for the taxes paid on, or apply lower tax rates to, industrial production. Many of the main\n\ncountries in which we have production facilities, such as Finland and Germany, offer such tax relief because the level of energy taxation has increased significantly in recent years.\n\n## Our tax governance and tax compliance\n\nThe Board of Directors' Audit Committee is responsible for the supervision of tax risk management as part of our risk management processes. UPM's internal control and risk management operations review tax risks regularly and update the control framework together with the tax function. A more thorough review of the tax practices of customers and suppliers is part of our counterparty risk management processes.\n\nThe UPM Tax Strategy is supported by internal instructions, internal controls, and the benchmark analyses of best practice. Tax matters are managed by our tax function, which is complemented by third-party tax services to comply with local tax reporting and filing, as well as other requirements.\n\nWe aim to cooperate transparently and proactively with tax authorities. We also value dialogue with other important stakeholders concerning taxation. In Finland, UPM co-operates with the Finnish Tax Administration.\n\n## DIRECT ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED BY UPM IN 2023 (EUR MILLION)\n\n| Direct economic value created     |        | Economic value distributed                       |         |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                   |        | Operating costs                                  | -8,023  |\n| Sales                             | 10,460 | Employee wages and benefits                      | -1,287  |\n| Income from sale of assets        | 19     | Payments to providers of loans                   | -160    |\n| Income from financial investments | 40     | Dividend distribution                            | -799    |\n| Other income                      | 220    | Corporate income taxes paid   and property taxes | - 2 21  |\n|                                   |        | Donations                                        | -1      |\n| Total                             | 10,739 |                                                  | -10,491 |\n\n## Economic value retained 248\n\nUPM's economic impact is significant in the surrounding communities. The company's operations contribute to local, regional and national economies by generating economic benefits for different stakeholder groups. The related direct monetary flows indicate the extent of added value globally.\n\nIn accordance with UPM's Tax Strategy, the locations of our companies are driven by commercial rationale and business reasoning. We do not transfer any value created or have any investments in production or service operations in jurisdictions defined by the Council of the European Union as non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, or in any similar secrecy jurisdictions.

At the end of 2023, we owned approximately 903,000 hectares of forest land in Finland, Uruguay and the USA. Most of this land is in Finland, totalling around 523,000 hectares. In Uruguay, we have about 304,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and conservation areas, and in the USA 76,000 hectares of forest. We also lease about 170,000 hectares in Uruguay and manage about 1.5 million hectares of private forests in Finland. We apply the same strict sustainability standards everywhere we operate.\n\nGlobally, about 135,000 hectares (15%) of UPM-owned land is protected or in restricted use. Protected areas include valuable habitats, natural forests and other important areas such as wetlands or culturally important sites.\n\nOf our four modern tree nurseries, three are located in Uruguay and one in Finland. In 2023, our newest nursery in central Uruguay was at full capacity to ensure the required annual planting capacity to supply the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill.\n\nHigh-quality seedlings ensure good growing conditions for the forests. They are important not only for wood raw material production but also for carbon sequestration, restoration of biodiversity and increasing resilience to climate change.\n\n## Forest Action: the global forest responsibility programme\n\nIn 2023, we continued promoting our Forest Action programme that encompasses measurable actions under five focus areas: climate, biodiversity, water, soil, and social contribution.\n\nOur main harvesting approach is to leave untouched buffer zones along watercourses.\n\nOur forest inventory systems are updated annually to include the locations of valuable habitats and waterbodies in relation to wood harvesting activities.\n\nIn Uruguay, an institutional network has studied and monitored the water usage of eucalyptus plantations for decades. Eucalyptus plantations are not irrigated except for the nurseries. Tree plantations reduce rapid run-off through the soil surface, thus minimising soil erosion. Following the worst drought ever recorded in Uruguay in 2021-2023, we developed a procedure to characterise the drought's effect on the plantations using satellite images. Most affected areas are being harvested to minimise productivity losses.\n\nIn Finland, we were one of the funding partners in a national restoration project in 2022-2023 related to small inland waters. In 2023, we identified locations and set restoration targets for our own forests in Finland. In the USA, we continued our efforts in mixed forest restoration covering about 324 hectares. A new research partnership with the University of Minnesota will quantify the productivity and biodiversity benefits of mixed forest management. A new forest inventory collaboration with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will enable a more precise understanding of our forests, including their role as carbon sinks.\n\n## Forests and climate\n\nWe are committed to climate-positive forestry and to enhancing biodiversity in our own forests in Finland. Forests and forest biodiversity are critical for mitigating the effects of climate change. We ensure that our forests continue to act as carbon sinks, remain resilient and diverse in changing climate conditions and grow well for future generations.\n\nUruguay, with which we jointly developed the management plan of the first protected area included in the National System of Protected Areas under the direction of a single private company (page 25).\n\nWe participated in forest and environmental stakeholder forums. In Finland, we took part in biodiversity roundtables coordinated by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. We also continued our active cooperation with FSC\u2122 International and PEFC to promote sustainable forest management globally.\n\n- Enhancing biodiversity on page 84\n- Ensuring a responsible supply chain on page 78\n- Sustainable product lifecycle on page 98\n\n## IN ACTION\n\n## STUDY ON THE BIODIVERSITY OF CLEARCUT AREAS\n\nThe study by the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) aimed to investigate how the amount and quality of retained deadwood and retention trees and the time elapsed since a felling affect the diversity of polypore and saproxylic beetle species in the regeneration areas. The presence of rare and threatened species in the areas was of particular interest.\n\nThe study was carried out in UPM's forests in southern Finland. The study compared fellings carried out in three different periods, as the recommendations and guidelines for retention trees have varied over time.\n\nThe UPM regeneration areas were found to be inhabited by a vast range of polypore and saproxylic beetle species. The study shows that leaving decayed wood and retention trees has a positive effect on forest biodiversity. Regeneration areas can provide habitats for rare and threatened species that depend on decaying wood, and the prevalence of the species can be increased via ecological forest management measures. In UPM-owned forest regeneration areas, the amount of coarse decaying wood has clearly increased in recent decades, supporting the diversity of decaying wood-dependent species.\n\nwww.upm.com/forests\n\nby UPM's FSC\u2122 certification group covered approximately 570,000 hectares in Finland and over 13,000 hectares in Uruguay. Since 2016, CDP has recognised us annually as a Forest A List company for our significant actions to mitigate climate change and prevent deforestation.\n\n## Cooperation with stakeholders\n\nWe have a long history of working with researchers, academic institutions, environmental organisations and other stakeholders to develop sustainable forest management.\n\nIn 2023, we initiated a forest pollinator project with Tapio Group in Finland. The project will provide us with comprehensive and up-to-date research-based working instructions for considering pollinators in final harvesting. Numerous pollinators use clear-cuts as so-called replacement habitats and find many of the resources they need there, but this aspect of biodiversity has not been specifically addressed in practice.\n\nIn the USA, we initiated stakeholder cooperation with local indigenous peoples' communities to learn more about their approach to forest management. We will strive to increase this type of work in the future.\n\nIn Uruguay, we collaborated with stakeholders and NGOs like Vida Silvestre\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                  | 2008   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Forest and plantation land,  own and leased (1,000 ha)           | 1, 012 | 1, 073 |\n| Forest growth (million m 3 )                                     | 4.3    | 11. 5  |\n| Wood harvested from UPM  forests and plantations  (million m 3 ) | 2.2    | 7. 0   |\n| Value of forests and  plantations, including land  (EURm)        | 1,270  | 3,301  |\n\nThe growth needs to exceed harvests for our forests to remain carbon sinks. The annual carbon sink from UPM-owned forests in Finland and the USA and owned and leased plantations in Uruguay has averaged -4.8 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent over the past five years. There is ongoing work to harmonise methodologies and make calculations more accurate. The previous year's figure is therefore not fully comparable.\n\nWe aim to constantly improve our understanding of carbon. In 2022, we started a project with the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) to improve soil carbon models for Uruguay with actual measurements on the ground. Field measurements in eucalyptus plantations began in 2023 and will continue for one year. An improved model for carbon calculations will be used for our 2024 carbon calculations.\n\n## Third-party verified supply chain\n\nWe always know the origin of the wood we use. We do not use wood from illegal sources or from areas where high conservation value forests could be under threat. Our wood procurement does not cause deforestation: forest cover is stable or increasing in all wood sourcing areas. We do not use genetically modified trees. Compliance with these requirements is verified by an independent third party.\n\nAll UPM-owned forests are certified or in the process of being certified if the site is new. In 2023, 91% of own forests were FSC\u2122 and PEFC double-certified and 8% only PEFC (SFI) certified.\n\nWe also promote forest certification for private forest owners and other customers. We have established FSC\u2122 group certification schemes in Finland and in Uruguay, which support small forest owners' access to certification. In 2023, the forest area covered",

The landlocked salmon is a critically endangered species and it is important to enable the species to recover. Improving migratory fish routes and creating suitable spawning and nursery areas, as well as improving the habitats of other endangered species, are important measures for improving the biodiversity of inland waters.\n\nBiodiversity refers to the diversity and variation of species and ecosystems on our planet. According to the UN, and despite ongoing efforts, biodiversity is deteriorating worldwide. This decline is projected to worsen if no action is taken. Mitigating climate change is the single most important action to safeguard biodiversity.\n\nEnhancing biodiversity brings opportunities and reduces risks at the same time. Our operations are widely linked to biodiversity. Our most significant impacts on biodiversity take place in wood sourcing. Biodiversity is instrumental in maintaining healthy forest growth and ensuring that forests adapt to the changing climate.\n\nStreams have been dammed or blocked, which has affected the flows and changed the living conditions of stream fauna. The potential depletion of oxygen caused by wastewater load deteriorates the living conditions in receiving watercourses. We improve local living conditions for fauna and flora at the production sites through removing obstacles in streams and reduced emissions, both to air and water.\n\nThe restoration will allow landlocked salmon to rise to their old spawning waters and improve the status of the aquatic habitat of the river. The first results of the project, which began in 2021, are promising in terms of salmon parr numbers. More detailed results for the whole river will be available in 2024.\n\nThe South Karelia Recreation Foundation (EKVAS) led the project, which was mainly funded by the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Nousu programme. UPM's donation was part of the company's Biofore Share and Care programme. The aim of UPM's stream water programme is to release or restore 500 km of stream water by 2030.\n\nWe want to strengthen the role of biodiversity in our business. In 2020, we linked the margin of a EUR 750 million revolving credit facility to the biodiversity enhancement in UPM-owned forests in Finland. In 2022, we further strengthened this link by including biodiversity as a measure in UPM's management remuneration and in 2023, we implemented the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) reporting framework (page 142).\n\nWe are also testing new scientific methods, such as e-DNA for measuring biodiversity and the impacts of our actions.\n\n## Forestry and biodiversity\n\nWe safeguard biodiversity in our own forests and continue to carry out our biodiversity activities as part of UPM's global Forest Action programme. Forest certification plays a crucial role in managing biodiversity both in our own forests and in other wood sources.\n\nWe are participating in a project led by FSC\u2122 to better understand and quantify the positive impact that forest certification\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nharvest sites are managed so that deadwood is retained at sustainable levels.\n\n## Water and biodiversity\n\nIn Finland, our hydropower plants and other obstacles such as dams impact the environment by altering river or stream flows and their ecosystems. Our stream water programme strives to remove obstacles to fish migration, restore fish stocks throughout Finland and improve the living conditions of all stream fauna.\n\nWe have a target of opening 500 kilometres of obstacle-free streams by 2030 to steer our activities and to measure our impact on biodiversity. By the end of 2023, we managed to open 154 kilometres thanks to our own projects and 32 kilometres in joint projects funded by us. One such example was the restoration of the Hiitolanjoki river in Finland (on the left).\n\nAfter the demolition of the Arvajankoski dam in 2022, our funding enabled research on migratory fish that has been carried out in the upper stream for 40 years to continue.\n\n## Enhancing biodiversity at the mill sites\n\nIn parallel to continuously monitoring our emissions, we also monitor our impact on waters, in particular.\n\nBefore any new mills are built, we conduct a baseline study to measure the level of biodiversity. At the new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill, we monitor the effluent discharge to the surrounding river as well as the quality and biology of the water. We also monitor the emissions to air and the quality of the air and soil. Studies at the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill show that mill operations have had no measurable negative impact on biodiversity since the start-up in 2007.\n\nWith older sites such as UPM Kymi, with a history of over 150 years, the impact of emissions to water close to the mill is compared to the respective impact upstream of the Kymi River. The latest results from 2022 indicate that the environmental impact of the UPM Kymi's wastewater load on the midge communities is low and that the benthic communities indicate a slightly oligotrophic condition of the river i.e. the level of nutrients is low.\n\nMany mills actively enhance local biodiversity. We planted dedicated species in the\n\nsurrounding areas of the UPM Ettringen and the UPM Nordland paper mills in Germany to optimise conditions for birds and insects.  At the UPM Schongau paper mill, we developed a concept to systematically assess and decrease the negative impacts of mill lighting on insects and the surrounding communities. The results and feedback have been positive and it has also reduced energy consumption.\n\nValue from responsibility on page 30 Our 2030 responsibility targets on page 32\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPositive impact on forest biodiversity\n\nOverall positive development measured in Finland and in Uruguay\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## SETTING SCIENCE/uniF6BABASED TARGETS FOR NATURE CONSERVATION\n\nWe participate in the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) Corporate Engagement Programme to develop methods, tools and guidelines for setting science-based targets for nature conservation. The network aims to provide companies and cities with a fivestep framework to verify that their activities are within environmental limits without causing loss of nature. More than 100 companies from 30 countries are participating in the programme.\n\nWe have also been selected for the SBTN's Initial Target Validation Group, where, as the name suggests, UPM and 16 other companies will be the first to test the tools developed in their own operating environment.\n\nThe tools will be used to assess the impact of the company's activities on land use, land use change, water use and pollution and soil contamination. The aim of the assessment is to identify which of the activities have the greatest impact on biodiversity, set targets and develop an action plan for improvement. Participation supports our own biodiversity objectives.\n\nhas on biodiversity. We have also carried out several actions and projects to restore habitats, develop new ecologically sustainable forest management practices and improve ways to monitor and measure our impact on forest ecosystems.\n\nWe have had a target of net-positive impact on biodiversity in our own forests in Finland since 2018 and in Uruguay since 2022 with dedicated key performance indicators to measure the progress. At present, we have nine indicators in Finland: share of broad-leaved trees, amount of deadwood, forest age, forest structure, protected areas, valuable habitats, habitat restoration, species and habitat projects and indicator development.\n\nIn 2023, all the quantitative indicators measured showed a positive trend. The share of broad-leaved trees increased and the protected area continued to grow. New data on the amount of deadwood will be available in 2024 in connection with national forest inventory. The increased amount of deadwood in our forests had a direct link to the increased number of species dependent on deadwood.\n\nIn Uruguay, most plantations grow on The area's biodiversity values are assessed before the plantation is established, and valuable biodiversity hotspots and native\n\ngrasslands formerly used for cattle grazing. forests are protected.\n\nOur work focuses on the active management of protected habitats and the control of invasive species. In Uruguay, the area where we take some form of conservation measures covers altogether 75,000 hectares. This includes a network of 33 biodiversity reserves, covering more than 14,500 hectares. Each biodiversity reserve has specific management and monitoring plans.\n\nThe majority of species indicators from the last five years shows a positive trend of occurrence compared o the last 15 years. Continuous monitoring has allowed us to find 33 new species for Uruguay, and one new species for science as a whole.\n\nIn the US, we have developed a Smart Forestry\u2122 method to use plant communities and ecological principles as a basis for silviculture practices and maintaining biodiversity. This method is based on ecological classification, which optimises both the value and the quality of forests based on the place of growth and tree species. All",

Our purpose is to create a future beyond fossils. Forests, wood-based products and low-carbon energy play a unique role, both in mitigating the effects of climate change and in our strategy. We have set ambitious targets for all these areas as part of our Group-level responsibility targets for 2030.\n\n## Towards net zero emissions\n\nWe are committed to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C in a promise to pursue science-based measures to limit global temperature rise.\n\nOur fossil CO 2 emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to be aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway as outlined in the Paris Agreement: 65% reduction in fossil CO 2 emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) from 2015 levels and 30% reduction of fossil CO 2 emissions from sourced materials and logistics (Scope 3) from 2018 levels by 2030.\n\nWe also have targets for climate-positive land use and developing a climate-positive product portfolio.\n\nAs a signatory to The Climate Pledge, we are committed to achieving net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040. In 2023, as part of the UN Global Compact's Forward Faster initiative, we also committed to setting net-zero targets as defined by the SBTi.\n\nAt the end of 2022, we joined the GHG Protocol's pilot to test and provide feedback on its guidance for the forest and land use sector. Among other things, this guidance aims to define how to include biogenic carbon emissions and removals related to land use, as well as biogenic product-related and technological carbon removals. In 2023, we continued to conduct a feasibility study on our actual steps towards net-zero emissions and setting corresponding SBTi net-zero targets. The net-zero target setting process and the respective transition plan are expected to be completed in 2024.\n\n## TOWARDS NET/uniF6BAZERO EMISSIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe act through forests: Forests and forest biodiversity are critical for mitigating the effects of climate change. We ensure that our forests continue to act as carbon sinks, remain resilient and diverse in changing climate conditions and thrive for future generations.\n\nWe act through emissions: Minimising the use of fossil fuels and raw materials is the most important way to mitigate climate change. We favour renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources and produce CO 2 -free hydro and nuclear power in Finland. We are also committed to reducing the emission levels of our supply chain.\n\n## Climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nThe physical impacts of climate change include more frequent and severe weather conditions which can increase droughts and forest fires. Climate change can lead to societal shifts with increasing social inequality and working poverty. Emissions from our operations and supply chain are contributing to climate change.\n\nBut we also make a positive impact. For example, we are reducing our fossil CO 2 emissions in our own operations and in the supply chain and manage our forests\n\nso that they act as carbon sinks. We also adapt to the changing climate and develop a climate-positive product portfolio. Our targets and actions focus on ensuring these positive developments.\n\nOur position and resilience in different climate scenarios have been evaluated for our businesses and functions from both physical and transitional angles, with the expertise of the scientific community.\n\nGenerally, in low- and medium-emission scenarios the transition impacts play a bigger role and we are well positioned as our business portfolio allows for flexibility re-\n\nWe act through products: Innovating novel products beyond fossils is the core of our Biofore strategy. We develop safe and sustainable products that offer alternatives to fossil materials. Many of our products are already proven to be climate-positive.\n\ngarding recognised risks and opportunities.

The increase is mainly due to our new pulp mill in Uruguay. At some mills, all or part of the required energy is produced by external or co-owned power plants or provided by UPM Energy.\n\nIn 2023, we invested in electric boilers for heat and steam production at our mills in Finland and Germany, mainly to replace the use of natural gas. The boilers will improve security of heat and steam generation and reduce emissions depending on replaced fuels and purchased electricity's CO 2 factors (page 49).\n\nUPM H\u00fcrth's biomass boiler, invested by E.ON, will supply carbon-neutral heat and electricity to the mill and the public power grid from 2024 onwards. The use of biomass, such as residual wood from the region, reduces fossil CO 2 emissions. A new Finnish wind farm has been supplying renewable energy to UPM's paper mills since the beginning of 2023.\n\n## We are contributing to the decarbonisation of the electricity system by growing the supply of reliable, CO 2 -free electricity.\n\nWe are especially looking for ways to improve our energy efficiency across our operations with audits, innovations and investments. Improvements usually lead to a reduction in CO 2 and other air emissions as well.\n\nOur measures in 2023 include new vacuum blowers to replace energy-consuming pump systems and a new efficient grinding stone, which will significantly reduce electricity use and CO 2 emissions at the UPM Caledonian paper mill in the UK.\n\nWe carry out studies to evaluate the use of heat exchangers and heat storage at our paper and pulp mills. UPM Schongau continued with the installation of a new heat exchanger at its TMP plant. The project will be finalised in 2024.\n\nUPM J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski has invested in a high capacity line for its TMP plant, increasing energy efficiency and decreasing the need for electricity. UPM Tervasaari replaced\n\nWe generate significantly more electricity than we consume, and this net selling position increased to over 7 TWh with the new OL3 nuclear power plant unit in Finland and the new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill in Uruguay.\n\n## Exploring possibilities in transformation\n\nEven though getting rid of fossil fuels means intensifying the electrification of society, electrification of the economy as a whole is not possible. We also need other solutions to mitigate climate change. UPM Biofuels is supplying renewable fuels for decarbonising traffic. We are also studying business cases for utilising clean and green hydrogen and biogenic CO 2 to possibly produce synthetic fuels and chemicals in the future (page 91).\n\nThe energy crisis caused energy prices to rise in Europe. It has also increased the risks related to political interventions and changes in energy market regulation and taxation. It is crucial that such measures do not reduce incentives for energy investments that are driving the transition to a low-carbon economy. Regulatory measures should not interfere with the market price signal, which is needed to balance the electricity markets in all circumstances.\n\nWe favour the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. UPM Energy is a major electricity provider in Finland with assets in Finnish hydropower and nuclear power, as well as thermal power to a lesser extent. Hydropower is the most effective and sustainable method of producing balancing power for the increased volatility of the electricity grid. UPM Energy completed the extensive modernisation of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in the spring of 2023.\n\nNuclear power provides reliable baseload generation of electricity; it relies on Finland's unique and safe solution for final disposal of spent fuel. 99% of UPM Energy's electricity is CO 2 -free. The start of operations at OL3 in May 2023 increased UPM Energy's CO 2 -free electricity generation by nearly 50%.\n\n## Energy action at our production sites\n\nThe majority of our energy consumption is due to production processes at the paper and pulp mills, where electricity and heat are needed for mechanical pulping, pumping and drying. We generate steam and electricity through combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Biomass-based fuels\n\nOne year closer to the climate targets of 2030 and fossil fuels consumption is yet to reach its peak, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The global energy sector accounts for the majority of all greenhouse gas emissions. To cut these emissions, more renewable and CO 2 -free energy is required. Investments in green energy are on the rise and a new record was set for global wind power capacity built in 2023.\n\nHowever, wind and solar power production are dependent on weather conditions. This increases volatility in both electricity supply and prices. The transforming energy system needs nuclear power for stability, hydropower and thermal power plants for balance, and innovations for efficiency and electricity storage capability.\n\nThe energy crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine has eased, but the roots of the crisis remain. Europe is still looking for ways to replace natural gas formerly imported from Russia and the use of fossil fuels is high, especially in Central Europe. To mitigate climate change, fossil-based emissions need to be cut. This will accelerate the electrification of society and drive the demand for low-emission electricity.\n\n## Expertise in flexibility\n\nUPM is the second largest electricity producer in Finland but also the largest consumer of electricity. Being both a producer and consumer has brought us valuable expertise now that price and supply volatility has become the new normal on electricity markets. We contribute to maintaining the balance of the electricity system by helping when there is a risk of electricity shortages, either by reducing consumption at our paper mills or by increasing production at our hydropower plants.\n\nThis is also good business for us, as we optimise both our electricity production and consumption according to the price and demand of electricity, i.e. to meet the needs of the electricity system.\n\nWe are consistently developing our energy portfolio, managing our CO 2 -free electricity generation assets in UPM Energy and switching our energy-consuming businesses to lower-emission energy sources. We are contributing to the decarbonisation of the electricity system by growing the supply of reliable, CO 2 -free electricity.",

The UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay invested in a lime kiln so that it can burn hydrogen, a by-product from a neighbouring company, reducing the use of fuel oil.\n\nUPM Plywood launched projects to reduce steam consumption and air emissions by preheating and improved heat recovery at the UPM Pellos plywood mill. These measures and investments are expected to lead to an annual reduction in fossil CO 2 emissions of around 40,000 tonnes.\n\nUPM Timber installed a new heat pump system at the UPM Korkeakoski sawmill.\n\nThe system will use the waste heat from the sawn timber drying instead of heat from the mill's own power plant. This will decrease SO 2 and NO x emissions as well as energy use.\n\nAs a result of our energy-saving investments and actions taken in 2023, we reduced our energy costs by EUR 4.0 million (8.5 million), avoided emitting 18,900 (34,900) tonnes of CO 2 and achieved a 66,000 (114,000) MWh reduction in energy consumption. The annual savings were EUR 4.6 million (9.5 million), 28,900 (40,500) tonnes of CO 2 and 94,000 (126,000) MWh of energy.\n\n## Follow-up on our energy and CO 2 targets\n\nIn 2023, we decreased our fossil CO 2 emissions from energy generation (Scope 1) and purchased energy (Scope 2) by 17% compared to the previous year, which is in line with our 65% reduction target for 2030. In addition to capacity adjustments, the main reason for the reduction was a decrease in CO 2 emissions related to electricity purchases.\n\nCoal and peat usage decreased by 13% compared to 2022. Our target is to stop using coal and peat for on-site energy generation by 2030. Currently, coal is the main fuel at the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FUEL AND HEAT RESOURCES USED\n\n| TWh                                 |   2023 | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Black liquor                        |   24.5 | 14.3   |\n| Bark and other biomass              |    5.2 | 5.2    |\n| Heat recovered from  TMP production |    0.7 | 0.6    |\n| Renewable fuels total               |   30.4 | 20.1   |\n| Peat                                |    0.2 | 0.6    |\n| Purchased heat                      |    0.3 | 0.4    |\n| Natural gas                         |    4.9 | 6.3    |\n| Oil                                 |    1.5 | 0.9    |\n| Coal                                |    2.4 | 2.5    |\n| Fossil recovered fuel               |    0.2 | 0.2    |\n| Total                               |   39.9 | 31. 0  |\n\n## TRANSFORMATION STORY\n\n## LONG/uniF6BATERM FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe see future business opportunities in carbon removal, storage, and utilisation. Wood-based products store CO 2 and replace fossil products. In the future, the biogenic CO 2 generated as a by-product of wood-based processes can serve as a raw material for new carbon-neutral synthetic fuels and materials.\n\nWe have biogenic CO 2 , low-emission hydro and nuclear power, and experience in the use of hydrogen in the Lappeenranta biorefinery. Technically, carbon removal technology is already fairly mature, but long-term storage solutions have only recently started being developed.\n\nHowever, carbon removal, storage and utilisation require huge investments in equipment and logistics infrastructure. The storage potential is outside Finland and recovery requires significant hydrogen production and a large amount of clean and competitively priced electricity, in addition to the investment. From a business perspective, the development of technical carbon sinks requires clear rules and predictable policies, including a link to the carbon pricing mechanism and sufficient R&D funding for the coming years.\n\n## CAPACITY TO GENERATE POWER THROUGH OWN POWER PLANTS AND SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n|                                          | Nominal MW   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Hydropower                               | 729          |\n| Nuclear power                            | 1,089        |\n| Thermal power                            | 133          |\n| UPM Energy in total                      | 1,951        |\n| Mill site combined heat  and power (CHP) | 1,250        |\n| Mill site hydropower                     | 7            |\n| Mill site power  generation in total     | 1,257        |\n| Total UPM                                | 3,208        |\n\nof about 2 million tonnes CO 2 equivalents, mainly due to the expanded reporting scope. In 2023, our total Scope 3 emissions were 7.6 million tonnes, a reduction of 16% compared to 2018.\n\nOur target is to reduce the fossil CO 2 emissions from materials and logistics by 30% by 2030 (from 2018 levels). These account for a significant share of our total Scope 3 emissions. To achieve this, we launched the -30 by 30 programme in 2022. New and existing suppliers are required to provide data on the carbon footprint of the goods and services sold to UPM, including all relevant emissions from the supplier's own upstream supply chain and operations. In 2023, we achieved a reduction of 23% compared to 2018 for the target scope.\n\nAlready 57% of our pigment supplies are covered by primary CO 2 emissions data from suppliers and over 62% of our deliveries are calculated based on supplier data. In 2023, we started to use new dual-fuelled LNG vessels on European sea routes.\n\n## ELECTRICITY GENERATION THROUGH OWN POWER PLANTS AND SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n| TWh           |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Mill CHP      |    5.2 |    4.3 |\n| Hydropower    |    3.3 |    3   |\n| Nuclear power |    8   |    5.4 |\n| Thermal power |    0.1 |    0.5 |\n| Total         |   16.6 |   13.2 |\n\n| ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION   |   ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION |   ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| TWh                       |                    2023   |                    2022   |\n| Total                     |                       9.6 |                       9.7 |\n\n## Sources of UPM's fossil CO /uniF63A emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM Changshu paper mill in China, where alternatives have not been available historically.

We use water in a way that is environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically beneficial.\n\nCDP recognised UPM with an A -score for its significant actions to enhance water stewardship.\n\n## Our water management\n\nPulp and paper production is our most water-intensive operation. Approximately 95% of the water we use in production is internally recirculated, and only a small fraction eventually leaves the process as effluent and needs to be replaced. Less water in processes also means using less energy and fewer chemicals.\n\nAll wastewater from our pulp and paper mills is cleaned in both mechanical and biological effluent treatment processes. Purified water is usually returned to the same watershed from which it was extracted.\n\nAccording to the water risk analysis carried out with the WWF Water Risk Filter in 2021, our production sites are in areas with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SODIUM HYDROXIDE LEAK IN THE CHEMICAL STORAGE AREA OF THE NEW PULP MILL\n\nDespite our high standards of process control, sodium hydroxide, a chemical commonly used in pulp production, leaked into the water basin at the chemical storage area of the Paso de los Toros mill in August.\n\nThe sodium hydroxide mixed with rainwater leaked from a stormwater basin through the soil into a nearby creek, causing the pH level of the water in the creek to temporarily increase. The leak caused mortality in the aquatic animals of the creek during the leak. The creek flows first into a lagoon and then into the R\u00edo Negro river, where the impact of the leak was very limited in quantity and duration.\n\nWe immediately took all of the necessary corrective measures and notified the environmental authorities and the local community about the incident.\n\nWe have investigated the causes of the incident with DINACEA, the Uruguayan environmental authority, and have implemented all the necessary and immediate corrective measures in accordance with the authority's instructions. We take all environmental deviations seriously. Our environmental management processes, controls and monitoring systems are rigorous worldwide and incidents of this type are very rare.\n\nUruguay's Ministry of Environment imposed a sanction of approx. USD 188,000 on UPM for non-compliance with the environmental management plan for the pulp mill.\n\nto improve the monitoring of the effluent treatment process.\n\nThe UPM Augsburg paper mill in Germany successfully tested and installed a new filtration process to replace warm water used in paper machine showers. The technology will allow the mill to reduce water use even further from an already 'best of the class' level.\n\nIn 2023, the UPM Caledonian paper mill in Scotland managed to reduce its freshwater consumption by 525 cubic metres per day through various process improvements such as filtering process water for reuse, optimising tank cleaning, and improving tank level control. Replacing a disc in a filter also yielded water and fibre savings. The installed turbo blowers on the paper machine vacuum system will allow the decommissioning of a cooling tower, saving both energy and water.\n\nWe have a target to use 100% of the nutrients from recycled sources in our effluent treatment by 2030. In 2023, 33% (33%) was achieved, for example by replacing urea with the side stream product ammonia or with reject waters from composting and biogas plants.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders\n\nIn 2021, we joined the project 'Circular economy of water in industrial processes' together with several industrial and academic partners. The project ended in 2023, and, as a result of it, a laboratory measurement method for microplastics in forest industry waters was developed, together with universities, in our research centre in Lappeenranta.\n\nIn Uruguay, we continue to support the Rio Negro Initiative to improve the state of the river.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility/fundamentals/ scenario-work/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## All our water risk scenarios are publicly available on our website.\n\nlow to medium water scarcity.

While the UPM Changshu paper mill near Shanghai is expected to face the highest rise in water risk by 2050, the mill has made substantial improvements in water efficiency in recent years. The latest project in 2023 focused on wastewater recovery and reuse and resulted in estimated water savings of at least 1,000 cubic metres per day.\n\n## Continuous improvement towards 2030 targets\n\nEach pulp and paper mill has a dedicated plan to reach its reduction targets related to water use and effluent load by 2030.\n\nSeveral mills have started to use advanced process controls and predictive analytic models to optimise their wastewater treatment plant operations.

During 2023, our Raflatac business also participated in the Circular Design training program to get new ideas, tools and partnerships to drive circular labelling solutions.\n\nWe are also participating in the ISO standardisation of Circular Economy and are actively collaborating with various stakeholders\n\n## FROM PULP PRODUCTION WASTE TO RAW MATERIAL\n\nUPM Fray Bentos pulp mill and Cementos Artigas, a Uruguayan company specialising in the production and commercialisation of cements, concretes, and derivatives, are redefining industrial waste management.\n\nThe collaboration project, which started in September 2023, transforms waste from pulp pro-\n\nto enhance circularity. For example, we are collaborating with our paper machine clothing suppliers to find ways to recycle these fabrics after their use at the paper machine.\n\nIn autumn 2023, we carried out a LinkedIn campaign to find potential new recycled nutrient suppliers for our mills. The campaign identified some partners with whom we are continuing discussions.\n\nInnovation for the future on page 28\n\n- Sustainable product lifecycle on page 98\n\nduction, in particular a mix of biological sludge from effluent treatment with phosphorus precipitation sludge, into valuable resources. Cementos Artigas will efficiently use all the dry mixed sludge as a non-fossil fuel source and turn the inorganic part of the sludge into a raw material for a cement product.\n\nIn addition to reuse, the process will reduce fossil carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 20,000 tonnes per year.",

Our target is to provide products that improve our customers' business processes and performance, creating mutual benefit and societal value.\n\nOur innovative and sustainable woodbased biomedical products, as well as our pharmaceutical and healthcare labelling solutions, are examples of where we create direct societal impact. In the future, our wood-based biochemicals will offer renewable alternatives for many consumer products in packaging, automotive, textiles and various industrial segments. Many of our products are made from side streams and residues or from materials recovered after product use, thus supporting a circular bioeconomy.\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND FUNCTIONALITY AT ITS BEST\n\nNew serving trays made of UPM Formi composite are being brought into use at ABC service stations in Finland. The material is made from renewable raw materials and forest industry side streams.\n\nWhen the trays reach the end of their lifecycle, they will be washed and crushed into recycled pellets that will then be reused\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Bio-based and recyclable raw materials and products reduce the world's dependency on fossil-based raw materials and contribute to climate change mitigation\n- \u00b7 We offer sustainable everyday products to customers and consumers\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Creating innovative renewable and responsible solutions for a future beyond fossils\n- \u00b7 Taking care of the entire lifecycle\n\n## Continuous dialogue and collaboration with customers\n\nUPM's businesses offer a variety of products and services. Each business has its own customer relationship management process\n\nto manufacture new trays. The wood-based biocomposite also significantly reduces the product's carbon footprint compared with virgin plastics. The mass balance approach is used to determine the use of bio-based feedstock in the plastic used for the composite.\n\nThe new trays also have a groove where, for example, users can conveniently place their mobile phone while they take a break.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Use of a sustainable product design concept in product development\n- \u00b7 Improved chemical management to enhance product safety\n- \u00b7 Strong commitment to long-term customer relationships\n- \u00b7 Cooperation across the value chain\n- \u00b7 Open and transparent product communication supported by ecolabels, certificates and product declarations\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\nand way of interacting with customers. A comprehensive understanding of each market, as well as the knowledge of the end uses of products and the needs of our customers, underpins our approach.\n\nWe maintain a continuous dialogue with our customers and we engage in various product-related development projects with them. Our businesses conduct regular customer-satisfaction surveys. The surveys also help us to define our areas of improvement.\n\nBased on these results, overall satisfaction with UPM as a supplier is 85% (84%). Actions to mitigate climate change and enhance biodiversity remain the highest priorities of our customers. Product safety, sustainable forest management, recyclability, circularity and ecolabels are also highly valued.\n\n## Sustainable product design\n\nOur Sustainable Product Design concept implementation continued in 2023. We carried out screenings in the early stages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntransparency and speed up information exchange. The harmonised questionnaire and the tool as a result of this cooperation allows us to ensure that our products comply with laws and requirements, such as EU ecolabel criteria. To support customer communications, we provide product safety profiles and statements of chemical substances that aren't used in our products.\n\nUPM's Chemical Management Standard requires a careful assessment of the chemical hazard properties. All chemicals selected for use are required to have the lowest possible adverse effects on human health, the environment and the safety of UPM's products. The list of restricted chemical substances includes substances with selected hazard classifications, substances on the European Chemicals Agency's (ECHA) list of substances of very high concern (SVHC) or substances with endocrine disrupting effects. At UPM, a similar list has been in place since 2010.\n\n## Ecolabels and product declarations increase transparency\n\nWe provide environmental data and product declarations for most of our products to help customers to make sustainable choices.\n\nMost of our products are certified with widely recognised international and regional ecolabels, such as EU Ecolabel. UPM Biofuels, UPM Formi and UPM pulps also have ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) and four UPM Raflatac factories have ISCC PLUS certification. UPM Biofuels also has Roundtable of Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) certification. All our businesses have FSC\u2122 and/ or PEFC chain of custody certification. It verifies the origin of wood and guarantees that all wood used in our products is legally harvested from sustainably managed forests and does not originate from controversial sources.\n\nIn 2023, we created internal guidelines on how to communicate our sustainability claims (below).\n\n- Innovation for the future on page 28\n- Ensuring responsible supply chain on page 78\n- Climate-positive forestry on page 82\n\n## IN ACTION\n\n## HELPING BUSINESSES IMPLEMENT THEIR SUSTAINABILITY CLAIMS\n\nThe EU and many other countries are gradually implementing stricter regulations on sustainability-related marketing and communications. The aim is to protect consumers with reliable and transparent sustainability claims made by companies.\n\nTo prepare us for future requirements, we have created the UPM Sustainability Claims Guideline with accompanying practical instructions. These will ensure that claims and related marketing and communication materials comply with legislation and do not risk our brand or reputation.\n\nThe global instructions are designed to be used in all businesses and functions. Moreover, businesses need to familiarise themselves with and comply with national legislation and frameworks.\n\nWe are also developing an internal Sustainability Claims Glossary to provide additional guidance on the use of accurate terminology. The mandatory training for selected internal stakeholders and external key business partners will begin in 2024.\n\nof product development using a tool which we developed for mapping impacts on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Based on the feedback, we continued to develop the tool with revision and adaptation of the included questions. The concept was also tested to investigate product reuse with UPM Biocomposites and UPM Raflatac.\n\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint are key tools in our concept. We use LCA for calculating potential environmental impacts of new raw materials or new products. Using LCA supports decision-making in the product development and provides evidence of substantiation for the environmental claims related to products entering or already available on the markets.\n\nCarbon footprint had an important role in the development of lignin-based resin used in the Wisa BioBond adhesive technology, which is used in all WISA spruce plywood products. Other tools used in our concept include biodegradability and recyclability testing.\n\n## Product safety requirements\n\nThe ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 quality and food safety management systems provide a framework for continuously improving our performance. All our production sites are ISO 9001 certified, except for our new UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill in Uruguay which started production in April 2023 and for which the standard application is still in process.\n\nUPM Raflatac sites (excluding two new sites), UPM Specialty Papers production lines in Europe, UPM Kymi paper mill and all UPM pulp mills are ISO 22000 certified, except for the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill in Uruguay for which the standard application is still in process. The UPM Changshu paper machine 3 in China has both a ISO 22000 certified food safety management system and a FSSC 22000 certified food safety management system. This allows us to offer several products that are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\nIn 2023, we communicated our product safety requirements to customers and to suppliers of chemicals and raw materials. We worked with several paper and chemical companies to increase supply chain",

According to the said legislation, virtual general meetings can be held\n\nsition was presented to the AGM as single slate. This is standard market practice in Finland, unlike in many other countries. The Nomination and Governance Committee believes that this practice helps to ensure that the Board works effectively as a whole, whilst comprising sufficiently diverse members with varied experience and versatile areas of expertise that mutually compliment each other.\n\nThe composition of the Board is presented  in the table on the following page. The new director, Pia Aaltonen-Forsell (born 1974), is a Finnish citizen. She holds a Master's degree in Social Sciences (Economics) from the University of Helsinki and a Master's degree in Business and Administration (MBA) from the University of Reading, Henley Business School. Aaltonen-Forsell has been the Chief Financial Officer of Outokumpu Oyj and a member of Outokumpu Leadership team since 2019. Her previous work experience and other biographical details can be found on page 114 and she is presented in the spotlight text on page 110.\n\nFollowing the announcements of the Company's long-standing Board Chair, Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos, that he would not be standing for re-election at the AGM 2023, and of the Company's long-standing President and CEO, Jussi Pesonen, that he will exercise his right to retire from UPM during 2024, the Board carefully assessed the need to ensure continuity. Among other things, the Board considered the status of the ongoing strategic projects at the time of the AGM 2023, growth opportunities and the positive development of the Company. The Board deemed it essential that the new Board Chair be a long-standing member of UPM's Board of Directors, with extensive and versatile experience from the Company's businesses. It considered that Deputy Chair of the Board Henrik Ehrnrooth has such abilities and professional experience and that, together with his knowledge of UPM and its businesses, this provides a solid basis for him to lead the Company's Board and act as the Chair of the Board. Mr Ehrnrooth was appointed Chair of the Board in the Board's constitutive meeting following the AGM 2023.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe overall aim of diversity is for the Board as a whole to have a broad range of skills,\n\nif the Company's Articles of Association are amended to include this possibility and all participating shareholders are able to exercise their full shareholder rights, including the right to vote and to ask questions in real time during the general meeting, irrespective of the chosen general meeting format. The proposed amendment to the Articles of Association would have been passed with the support of two-thirds of all shares and votes participating in the AGM 2023. Based on the voting instructions received in advance and the number of shares represented at the AGM 2023, the conclusion was that the proposal to amend the Articles of Association did not have sufficient support. Consequently, the Articles of Association were not amended as proposed at the AGM 2023 and the Company may not currently arrange virtual general meetings.\n\nThe prevailing market practice in Finland is for the full vote count not to be executed at the general meeting unless it is specifically required by a shareholder attending the meeting. For this reason, a full vote count was not executed on any agenda topic at the AGM 2023.\n\nShareholders were also able to follow the AGM 2023 through a webcast that allowed them to watch the meeting but not exercise shareholder rights such as asking questions, making counterproposals or voting.\n\nThe AGM adopted the Company's Financial Statements and decided to distribute an aggregate dividend of EUR 1.50 per share (EUR 1.30) to be paid in two instalments. Both dividend instalments were EUR 0.75 per share. The first dividend instalment was paid on 21 April 2023 to the shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders on 14 April 2023. The second dividend instalment was paid on 2 November 2023 to the shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders on 26 October 2023. Both dividend instalments totalled EUR 400 million and together they totalled EUR 800 million.\n\nThe AGM released the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2022. UPM's Remuneration Report 2022 for governing bodies was presented to and adopted by the AGM. Information on other decisions made at the AGM can be found later in this section and on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2023.\n\nThe AGM 2024 will be held at the Messukeskus Expo and Convention Centre in Helsinki on 4 April. Detailed instructions for shareholders wishing to attend the meeting are available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2024. For the year 2023, the Board of Directors proposed a dividend of EUR 1.50 per share to be paid in two instalments.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\n- \u00b7  Sets the Company's strategic objectives\n- \u00b7  Reviews and approves financial and other plans relevant to the achievement of these objectives\n- \u00b7  Reviews the management team's performance in terms of meeting these objectives\n\nThe Board's other primary responsibilities relate to the integrity of the Company's financial reporting, the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, and the appointment, remuneration and succession planning of the Company's senior management.\n\n## Board composition\n\nThe composition of the Board changed in the AGM 2023 when Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos, UPM's Chair of the Board since 2008, announced that he would not be standing for re-election. The Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and succession needs of the Board as a whole. This includes whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities. After a careful selection process, the Nomination and Governance Committee proposed that nine members be elected to UPM's Board of Directors for a one-year term.\n\nAs proposed by the Nomination and Governance Committee, Henrik Ehrnrooth, Emma FitzGerald, Jari Gustafsson, Piia-Noora Kauppi, Topi Manner, Marjan Oudeman, Martin \u00e0 Porta and Kim Wahl were re-elected, whilst Pia Aaltonen-Forsell was elected as a new director. All directors are non-executive and their term of office will end upon the closure of the AGM 2024. The proposal concerning the Board compo-",

With regard to other factors relevant to Board diversity, it is the Board's objective to include an appropriate number of directors of different nationalities, ages, genders and lengths of service, as presented in the pie charts on the right. Information on the professional backgrounds of the Board of Directors and their other significant commitments is available on pages 114-115 of this report.\n\nThe Board's diversity principles are included in the Board and Committee Charters and, more specifically, in the Board's Diversity Policy, which is available at www. upm.com/governance. More information on diversity in UPM's Board, related objectives and the results obtained is available in our CG Statement 2023.\n\n## Director independence\n\nWith the assistance of the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors evaluates the independence of its members both annually and on a continuous basis. Director independence is assessed based on the independence criteria of the Finnish CG Code. The majority of the members on the Board of Directors must be independent of the Company and at least two of these independent members must be independent of any significant shareholders.\n\nThe independence evaluation of candidates for Director is one of the key factors in the preparation of the Nomination and Governance Committee's annual proposal for the composition of the Board. The Committee assesses the independence of members of the Board of Directors on a continuous basis. It also reviews a report on any changes in professional engagements and other commitments at every meeting to ensure that members are compliant with the independence criteria.\n\nThe Committee also assesses how such changes may affect the Board members' availability for Board-related work and reports to the Board on the outcome of such assessments. In particular, the Committee assesses Board members' positions in other publicly listed companies to ensure that these members adhere to best practice with regard to overboarding. According to the Nomination and Governance Committee's assessment, all directors are independent of both the Company and the significant shareholders. High attendance rates at the Board and Committee meetings prove the Board members' commitment and availability for Board-related work. The attendance rates at meetings by each member are shown in the table on the following page.\n\nAccording to the evaluation carried out by the Board with the assistance of the Nomination and Governance Committee, all Board members are independent of the Company's significant shareholders, as the Company has no controlling shareholder and none of the Company's shareholders\n\n60%\n\nof shares and votes represented in the AGM 2023\n\nshareholders represented 3,476\n\nin the AGM 2023\n\n## RELEVANT PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial expertise\n\nRelevant industry knowledge\n\nInternational experience\n\nRisk management experience\n\nGovernance and leadership experience\n\nExperience in the planning and implementation of company strategies\n\n## BOARD COMPOSITION, 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\n| DIRECTOR  1)             |   DIRECTOR  SINCE |   NO.

The Board made visits to Paso de los Toros, Uruguay, and Leuna, Germany, sites of the Company's two strategic projects.\n\nThere is no minimum meeting attendance requirement for Board members. Instead, Board members are expected to attend all meetings unless they have a valid reason for not attending. The average attendance of Board members was 100% (100%) at Board meetings and 100% (89.0%) at Committee meetings.

The main focus points of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be growth, performance, innovation, responsibility and portfolio. Read more about our strategy on pages 20-21. An essential part of the Board's annual strategy-related work is to oversee the assessment and management of risks related to the Company's strategy and operations. These risks and opportunities, as well as their impact on operations and strategy, are described on pages 34-35 and 133.\n\nIn 2023, the Board continued to focus on major strategic investments, most notably the biochemicals biorefinery in Germany and completion of the pulp mill project in Uruguay. The Board has been closely monitoring the status and feasibility of the project in Uruguay since 2016 and has conducted several status reviews, including risk assessments, in its meetings since then. The investment will increase UPM's pulp production capacity by more than 50% and is consequently expected to contribute future earnings. Read more about this strategic investment on pages 24-25.\n\nThe Board has regularly reviewed the status and feasibility of the new biorefinery project in Germany. The biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals that will enable switching from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end uses. Read more about this strategic investment on pages 54-55 and on the corporate website at www.upmbiochemicals.com/ biorefinery.\n\nThe Board has also reviewed commercial and basic engineering studies of the possible biofuels refinery in Rotterdam.\n\n## Board performance evaluation\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts an annual evaluation of its performance and working methods, including an evaluation of the performance and working methods of its Committees.\n\nIn 2023, the evaluation was conducted by an external facilitator. The Board evalu-\n\nation included quantitative and qualitative analyses of the Board and Committee work through various methods such as interviews and surveys. The performance of the Board and its Committees was evaluated in relation to their respective duties and responsibilities, their oversight, effectiveness and decision-making process, their support for executing the Company's strategy, their relationship with the Company's operative management, the Board and Committee compositions and structure, the Board culture, the individual performance of Board members and the performance of the Chair of the Board.\n\nThe preliminary results of the 2023 performance evaluation were highly favourable and indicated that the Board, the Chair of the Board and the Board Committees are performing effectively, and that Board members are committed to their Board work. Identified areas for improvement are considered when planning Board-related work, and the Nomination and Governance Committee takes the results into consideration when preparing its proposals for the composition of the Board for the Annual General Meeting. In 2024, the Board will continue to discuss and analyse the results and potential actions thereof.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established the following three Committees to further improve the preparation of matters to be decided by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7  Audit Committee,\n- \u00b7  Remuneration Committee\n- \u00b7  Nomination and Governance Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee assisted the Board in reviewing the composition, qualification criteria and duties of the Board Committees, and made a proposal to the Board for the appointment of Committee members and Chairs. The members were appointed to the Board Committees in the Board's constitutive meeting on 12 April 2023. The composition of the Committees is presented in the table above. Neither the President and CEO nor any other Company executives are allowed to be members of any Board Committees.\n\nThe written Committee Charters approved by the Board of Directors define the purpose, composition, operations\n\n## COMMITTEE MEMBERS 2023\n\n| AUDIT COMMITTEE                        |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| Kim Wahl, Chair                        |\n| Pia Aaltonen Forsell  (as of 12 April) |\n| Marjan Oudeman                         |\n| Jari Gustafsson (until 12 April)       |\n\n| REMUNERATION COMMITTEE   |\n|--------------------------|\n| Martin \u00e0 Porta, Chair    |\n| Emma FitzGerald          |\n| Topi Manner              |\n\n## NOMINATION AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE\n\n| Henrik Ehrnrooth, Chair  (Chair as of 12 April)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Jari Gustafsson  (as of 12 April)                 |\n| Piia-Noora Kauppi                                 |\n| Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos (Chair until 12 April)             |\n\nand duties of each Committee, as well as the prerequisites of Committee membership.

He has held multiple roles in business finance positions in Finland and France and headed up UPM's sawmill business.\n\nHe knows UPM, and especially UPM Fibres, like the back of his hand. The business has evolved significantly since the Paso de los Toros pulp mill started operations. About 60% of pulp capacity is now in Uruguay. With the tightening of the wood market, the business environment in Finland has changed significantly too.\n\n'The business is in a very exciting phase. Transformative growth in Uruguay is now complete. The ramping-up of production, sales and the supply chain is well under way. In Finland, the focus is on ensuring competitiveness in a changed operating environment, covering the entire value chain from wood procurement to sawmilling and pulp production.'\n\nAs a leader, he feels that people make things happen and that teams get results. 'I trust people, share responsibility, and try to offer support. When the strategy and goals are clear, inspiring and demanding, focu sed teams and skilful people get results.'\n\nreports on and discussed cyber security, the preparation of upcoming sustainability reports, ESG, environmental impact and other non-financial matters (together with the review of non-financial reporting).

The Committee's standard procedures also include quarterly sessions with the internal auditor, the lead audit partner, management and some Committee members.\n\nWhen preparing the proposal for the auditor for the financial year 2023, the Committee evaluated the qualifications and independence of the auditor, as well as the audit-related and non-audit-related services provided by the auditor. The evaluation included an assessment of the effectiveness of the audit process, the quality of the audit, the performance of the lead auditor and audit team, and the cooperation with the auditor's international audit network. As a result of the evaluation, the Committee recommended that PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy (PwC) be re-elected as the Company's auditor for the financial year 2023. Following the stipulations of the Audit Regulation, the last financial year that PwC can act as the Company's auditor is 2023.\n\nThe Audit Committee has prepared the Board's proposal for the election and remuneration of the auditor for the financial year 2025, which will be presented at the AGM 2024. Following an audit firm selection procedure conducted in 2022, the Board proposed at the AGM 2023 that Ernst & Young Oy (EY) be elected UPM's auditor for the financial year 2024 based on the Audit Committee's recommendation. Electing an auditor for the financial year 2024 at the AGM 2023 gave the elected auditor time to prepare for the new audit engagement.\n\nWith regard to the proposal for the financial year 2024, the Audit Committee\n\nprepared its recommendation in accordance with the EU Audit Regulation and established a statutory audit firm selection procedure, reviewing potential audit firm candidates which were evaluated against a variety of selection criteria, such as proposed audit plan and methodology, experience and composition of the audit team, and audit quality and price. The selection process included multiple rounds of information submissions, testing of technological capabilities, interviews and presentations by the candidates, and external reference checks. After careful consideration based on the selection criteria, EY became the Committee's preference and recommended audit firm for the financial year 2024 with Deloitte Oy as the secondary option. The Board agreed with these proposals, made corresponding proposals to the AGM 2023 and the AGM 2023 elected the auditors for the financial years 2023 (PwC) and 2024 (EY).\n\nAuthorised Public Accountant Mikko Nieminen continued as the lead audit partner for the financial year 2023. EY has stated that Authorised Public Accountant Heikki Ilkka will act as the lead audit partner for the financial year 2024.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for preparing the Company's remuneration principles and practices, as well as planning the remuneration of the President and CEO and remuneration and and succession of other senior executives    .\n\nIn 2023, the Committee held five meetings. In addition to undertaking the assigned matters and regular reports listed above, the Remuneration Committee also discussed the performance measures of the incentive plans and made recommendations to the Board concerning the terms of remuneration of the President and CEO and other senior executives, concerning a new share based long-term incentive arrangement and Restricted Share Plan 2024-2027 and concerning the terms of Service agreement of the Executive Vice President of UPM Fibres, who was appointed during the year 2023. The Committee reviewed the Remuneration Policy adopted by the AGM 2020 and reviewed the slightly updated Remuneration Policy to be presented to the AGM 2024.",

The Committee also reviews the succession plans for the President and CEO at least annually and reports to the Board on succession planning. In 2023, the Committee held five meetings and focused on succession planning and the candidacy process for the President and CEO, preparing a proposal for the Board to appoint the successor to the Company's long-standing President and CEO, Jussi Pesonen, who announced in October 2022 that he will retire from UPM during 2024. The schedule gave the Committee and the Board sufficient time to implement the succession planning process.\n\nIn addition to undertaking the assigned matters and regular reports and in addition to succession planning for the President and CEO, in 2023 the Nomination and Governance Committee also focused on searching for a director and succession planning for the Board, conducted a performance evaluation of the Board facilitated by the external evaluator, reviewed and proposed certain rotations to the composition of the committees, and reviewed the Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## LEADERSHIP IS ABOUT COLLABORATION\n\nPia Aaltonen-Forsell, CFO of Outokumpu Oyj, was elected to UPM's Board of Directors at the AGM last spring. With a long career in the forest and manufacturing industries, she is now looking at UPM from a strategic perspective.\n\n'UPM is a company with a strong tradition and foundation. The company has implemented the Biofore strategy relentlessly for a long time now and sustainability is truly at the core of this strategy. I have been particularly impressed by\n\nsuccession needs of the Board as a whole. This included whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities.\n\nAfter careful research and selection, the Nomination and Governance Committee has proposed that Melanie Maas-Brunner be elected as a new member of the Board at the AGM 2024. Of the incumbent directors, Emma FitzGerald will not be standing for re-election.

According to his service agreement, Jussi Pesonen was entitled to retire at the age of 60 in 2020. At the request of the Company's Board of Directors, he continued as the President and CEO until the end of 2023, after which he continues at the Company as an advisor to the Company and its management until he retires from UPM on 30 April 2024. In October 2023, the Board resolved to appoint\n\nUPM's innovation mindset and R&D. It's interesting to see what we can do with wood in the hands of innovative people, and how innovations can offer solutions for mitigating climate change without forgetting the strong focus on fostering biodiversity.'\n\nShe expects UPM's solutions to have a big impact. 'The direction is clear with such a strong visionary purpose. But changing the world and the way we do things is never easy.'\n\nPia Aaltonen-Forsell believes strongly in the coaching leadership style.

We do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to UPM-Kymmene Corporation for our work, for this assurance report, or for the conclusions and the opinion that we have reached.\n\n## Management's responsibility\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is responsible for preparing the Selected Indicators and the Selected Emissions in accordance with the Company's\n\nreporting instructions and GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (both together hereinafter 'Reporting Criteria').\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is also responsible for the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and impact as set out in AccountAbility's AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard 2018.\n\nThe Management of UPM-Kymmene Corporation is also responsible for such internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Selected Indicators and the Selected Emissions that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nWhen reading our limited and reasonable assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of corporate responsibility information should be taken into consideration.\n\n## Practitioner's independence and quality management and competence\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Oy applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists possesses the requisite skills and experience within financial and non-financial assurance, corporate responsibility strategy and management, social and environmental issues, as well as the relevant industry knowledge, to undertake this assurance engagement.\n\n## Practitioner's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Selected Indicators and on the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles, and a reasonable assurance opinion on the Selected Emissions based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.\n\nWe conducted our limited assurance engagement and our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410 'Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements' . These standards require that we plan and perform the limited assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Indicators are free from material misstatement, and that we plan and perform the reasonable assurance engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Selected Emissions are free from material misstatement.\n\nIn addition, we have conducted our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance Standard v3. For conducting a Type 2 assurance engagement as agreed with the Company, the AA1000AS v3 requires planning and performing of the assurance engagement to obtain moderate (limited) assurance on whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation\n\nRegarding Inclusivity: UPM-Kymmene Corporation has processes in place for stakeholder inclusivity both at the group and at the business level. We recommend to keep assessing opportunities for extended stakeholder cooperation.\n\nRegarding Materiality: UPM-Kymmene Corporation has a systematic process in place to evaluate and determine the materiality of corporate responsibility topics. We recommend to continue to periodically assess both material topics and the process to determine materiality.\n\n## Regarding Responsiveness:\n\nUPM-Kymmene Corporation has processes in place for responding to stakeholder needs. We recommend to continue using stakeholder inquiries and engaging with the stakeholders as sources of feeding information into the periodical materiality assessment process.\n\n## Regarding Impact: UPM-Kymmene\n\nCorporation has a process in place to monitor and measure the economic, environmental and social impacts of its business activities. Financial impact has been incorporated further into materiality assessment in anticipation for reporting requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (2022/2464/EU).\n\n## Helsinki 16 February 2024 PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nTiina Puukkoniemi\n\nPartner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Sustainability Reporting & Assurance\n\n## Mikko Nieminen\n\nPartner, Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Lead Financial Audit Partner\n\ndoes not adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (2018) and that the Selected Indicators and the Selected Emissions are not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting Criteria.\n\n## Summary of the work performed for limited assurance conclusion\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement, the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. A limited assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other information in the Selected Indicators and Selected Emissions, and about the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Selected Indicators and the Selected Emissions and an assessment of the risks of the Company's material nonadherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\nIn conducting our limited assurance engagement, our work consisted of, amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7  Interviewing of senior management of the Company and employees responsible for collecting and reporting the Selected Indicators and the Selected Emissions at the Group level and at selected sites.\n- \u00b7  Visiting the Company's Head Office as well as two sites in Europe and South-America.\n- \u00b7  Interviewing employees from various organisational levels of the Company with regards to materiality, stakeholder expectations, meeting of those expectations, as well as stakeholder engagement.\n- \u00b7  Assessing stakeholder inclusivity and responsiveness based on employee interviews, company's documentation and internal communication.\n\n- \u00b7  Testing the accuracy and completeness of information from original documents and systems on a sample basis.\n- \u00b7  Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis\n- \u00b7  Considering the presentation and disclosure of the Selected Indicators and the Selected Emissions.\n\n## Limited Assurance Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation's Selected Indicators for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2023 are not properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria, or that the Selected Indicators are not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting Criteria.\n\nFurthermore nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that UPM-Kymmene Corporation's Selected Emissions are not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting Criteria or that UPM-Kymmene Corporation does not adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\n## Reasonable Assurance Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, UPM-Kymmene Corporation's Selected Emissions for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2023 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.\n\n## Observations and recommendations\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, we provide the following observations and recommendations in relation to UPM-Kymmene Corporation's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (2018). These observations and recommendations do not affect the conclusions and the opinion presented above.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Board of Directors\n\n## UPM introduction and business model\n\nAs a biomaterials growth company in forest industry, UPM provides renewable alternatives for fossil-based materials to the growing global consumer demand. UPM's large product range covers pulp, graphic papers and specialty papers, self-adhesive labels, wood-based renewable diesel and naphtha, electricity as well as plywood and timber products.\n\nUPM invests in sustainable growth and innovates for a future beyond fossils across six business areas: UPM Fibres, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Communication Papers and UPM Plywood. The business areas are competitive with strong market positions. At the same time, UPM is developing new innovation-driven and wood-based growth businesses in biochemicals and biofuels, for example.\n\nUPM group creates value to its stakeholders by operating separate businesses with a focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 Competitive and sustainable wood sourcing, forestry and plantation operations\n- \u00b7 Value adding, efficient and responsible global functions\n- \u00b7 Group-wide continuous improvement programmes in commercial strategies, variable costs, working capital, site and maintenance costs, safety and environmental performance\n- \u00b7 Technology development and intellectual property rights\n- \u00b7 A global business platform\n- \u00b7 Disciplined and effective capital allocation\n- \u00b7 Compliance, UPM Code of Conduct and strong UPM brand\n\n## Market environment in 2023\n\nGlobal real GDP growth is projected at 2.7% in 2023. Rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine continued to weigh on economic activity. Global inflation fell to 5.6%, driven by the decline in food and energy prices. However, inflation was still above pre-pandemic levels and core inflation remained persistent, driven by the services sector and labour markets remaining relatively tight. Global trade in goods declined in 2023, while trade in services expanded. Persistent regional conflicts and geopolitical tensions have been increasingly fragmenting the global economy and affecting global trade.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to pose a significant geopolitical risk in 2023 and the international community took proactive measures to prevent escalation. Multiple sectors of the Russian economy are now sanctioned by Western nations, with the oil, financial and technology sectors being the most affected. Furthermore, the conflict in the Middle East increased risks to supply chains and global commodity markets, though the impact of the conflict remained limited in 2023.\n\nFollowing robust post-pandemic expansion in 2022, economic growth in Europe is projected at 0.6%. Private consumption stagnated due to a high cost of living, and nominal wage growth lagged behind inflation. Weak external demand, monetary tightening by the European Central Bank, and inflation, though declining, further limited economic growth. The euro area industry confidence indicator reflected the low levels of manufacturing activity since May. Nevertheless, production expectations improved slightly at the end of the year with signs of recovery in the unprecedented inventory cycle. The EU labour market showed strong performance with low unemployment, despite the slowdown in economic growth.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n122\n\nstill require significant additional finance and collective action to support developing countries in transitioning to clean energy and implementing their national climate plans.\n\nTo enact the focus of halting and reversing biodiversity loss and promoting the recovery of nature by 2030, the UN Climate Conference affirmed the need to implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which was agreed at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in 2022. To ensure that progress is made, it is crucial that adequate methods of implementation are in place, such as financial resources, as well as planning, monitoring, reporting and review mechanisms.\n\nBoth COP processes are influencing regulations globally. Especially in EU also other ESG related regulations have been formulated lately or are expected to come in force in the near future. Various conflicts have highlighted the need to acknowledge human rights everywhere.\n\nIn 2023, the business environment for UPM's products was unprecedented due to low economic activity, especially in Europe. Market deliveries of products were further held back by destocking in most of the product value chains. However, the second half of the year saw gradual recovery in demand for many of UPM's products.  Margin management was successful. Apart from the wood costs in the Nordic region, most input costs declined compared to 2022.\n\nThe global demand for chemical pulp in 2023 was solid. After reaching all-time highs in 2022, the average market prices for both northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) and bleached hardwood kraft pulp (BHKP) fell to bottom-of the-cycle levels in all markets. Market prices started to recover in H2 2023. UPM's new world-class pulp mill in Uruguay, UPM Paso de los Toros, was ramped up since April 2023. The mill, which will have highly competitive cash costs once fully ramped-up and optimised, is set to be profitable in different market scenarios and will grow UPM's pulp business by more than 50%.\n\nThe energy crisis in Europe eased in 2023. Electricity prices were still high in Europe and significant volatility in prices has become the new normal. Increased supply and lower industrial consumption led to lower power prices in Finland. Electricity self-sufficiency improved significantly in Finland with the OL3 nuclear power plant unit beginning commercial production in April 2023.\n\nMarket demand for self-adhesive label materials declined in Europe and North America due to unprecedented destocking and low consumer demand. Subsequent recovery started to be visible only towards the end of the year. Tight margin management continued, with capacity and resources adjusted to reflect lower market demand.\n\nThe global demand growth for label, release and packaging papers was soft and market prices decreased compared to the previous year. Fine paper demand was impacted by the slower than expected recovery of the Chinese economy. Market prices for office papers in the Asia-Pacific region decreased compared to 2022.\n\nDemand for graphic papers in Europe decreased by 24% compared to 2022. Market prices decreased for all paper grades.\n\nDemand for spruce plywood and veneer declined due to low activity in the renovation and construction industry. Demand for birch plywood in panel trading and industrial applications was good in H1 2023 but moderated towards the end of the year. Market prices increased.\n\nIn the timber business, market demand was weak due to low activity\n\nin the construction industry. Market prices were at low level. Demand for advanced biofuels was good and markets benefited from climate targets. The revised RED III Directive came into force at the end of 2023 with the European 2030 target for the share of advanced biofuels in energy used in transport being increased. Prices of advanced biofuels declined towards the end of the year.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n123\n\n## Impact of Russia's war in Ukraine\n\nIn response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, the European Union as well as the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries imposed extensive sanctions on Russia, the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the oblasts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, and Belarus. Since 21 February 2022, these measures have included for example asset freezes and travel restrictions on individuals and entities, economic sanctions targeting sectors of the Russian and Belarusian economies, and diplomatic restrictions. Russia has also implemented several countermeasures affecting especially foreign companies' operations within Russia and with Russian counterparties. While the sanctions primarily target Russia's ability to finance its military operations in Ukraine and cause economic and political costs on the people responsible for them, there are limited signs of a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine. Economic and geopolitical uncertainty and inflation have accelerated around the world.\n\n## Impact on UPM businesses\n\nThe economic sanctions and Russia's countermeasures have rendered it unviable for UPM to continue operations in Russia or trade with Russian counterparties. UPM businesses suspended deliveries to Russia as well as wood sourcing in and from Russia. In Q1 2023 UPM completed a full withdrawal of its businesses from Russia by selling all its Russian operations, including the Chudovo plywood mill.\n\nThe full impact of the current and potential new sanctions, countersanctions and market development will only become known as the situation evolves. UPM has implemented mitigation plans to contain and reduce the negative consequences for its employees, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders as well as for the operations affected by sanctions and the war in Ukraine in general. The potential further impacts for UPM are likely to differ by business and by the pace, scope and duration of sanctions, market price reactions, development of supply chains, and the length of the war in Ukraine and whether there is any geographic escalation of the war. UPM is monitoring the situation closely and preparing plans to adjust its operations in different scenarios accordingly.\n\n## Clear roles and responsibilities\n\n| Group                  | Businesses                |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Portfolio strategy     | Business area             |\n| Capital allocation     | strategies                |\n| Business targets       | Commercial excellence     |\n| Code of Conduct        | Operational excellence    |\n| Responsibility targets | Cost efficiency  measures |\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Outcomes\n\nTop performance Competitive advantage Value creation Stakeholder and societal value License to operate\n\nEach business area is responsible for executing its own strategy and achieving targets. This enables agility in a fast-changing business environment, higher efficiency, differentiated commercial strategies, optimal sourcing, the right incentives, wider product development opportunities and effective capital allocation.\n\nCorporate responsibility is an integral part of all of our operations and a source of competitive advantage and value creation. UPM is committed to continuous improvement in financial, social and environmental performance. UPM promotes responsible practices throughout the value chain and is active in finding sustainable solutions, in co-operation with its customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nWhile a recession was expected at the beginning of the year in the United States, the US economy progressed at a significant pace over the course of 2023, driven by strong consumer spending, a resilient labour market and growing real wages. Manufacturing investment also reached historic highs. Economic growth in the US is projected at 2.4%. Inflation decelerated throughout the year mainly due to supply chains healing. The US dollar appreciated against the euro. On a negative note, trade tensions between the US and China continued to raise concerns regarding geopolitics.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region remained a key driver of global growth in 2023, in spite of tighter monetary policies and global demand rotating from goods to services. The Chinese economy is projected to grow by 5.4%, reflecting a post-pandemic rebound. The Chinese government continued to make investments to meet GDP growth targets and China's debt ratio increased further. The gradual recovery of consumer spending, the weakness in the property sector and subdued external demand continued to hinder growth to some extent.\n\nEnergy and climate change remained politically polarising issues, with notably lacking progress being made globally regarding the climate transition. At the same time, the need to take decisive climate action has never been more critical as the global mean temperature for 2023 was the highest on record. The UN Climate Conference (COP28) set out ambitious targets to keep the aim of limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C within reach and made the historic decision to accelerate climate action with nearly 200 countries pledging to move away from fossil fuels in energy systems. Furthermore, climate finance continued to be at the centre of climate action. However, mitigating climate change and adapting and responding to climate impacts will",

The exchange rate and fair value gains and losses were EUR -74 million (25 million). Items affecting comparability in finance costs totalled EUR -65 million including EUR 71 million exchange rate losses relating to the sale of Russian operations. Income taxes totalled EUR -71 million (-388 million).\n\nProfit for 2023 was EUR 394 million (1,556 million), and comparable profit was EUR 755 million (1,679 million).\n\n## Financing and cash flow\n\nIn 2023 cash flow from operating activities before capital expenditure and financing totalled EUR 2,269 million (508 million). Working capital decreased by EUR 417 million (increased by 687 million). In 2022, the energy futures markets experienced an unprecedented rise in futures prices, followed by a return to lower levels in 2023. As a result, the cash outflow of UPM's unrealised energy hedges totalled EUR -0.9 billion in 2022, whereas cash inflow totalled EUR 1.0 billion in 2023.\n\nNet debt was EUR 2,432 million at the end of 2023 (2,374 million). The gearing ratio as of 31 December 2023 was 21% (18%). The net debt to EBITDA ratio, based on the last 12 month's EBITDA, was 1.55 at the end of the period (0.94).\n\nOn 31 December 2023 UPM's cash funds and unused committed credit facilities totalled EUR 3.6 billion. The total amount of committed credit facilities was EUR 2.9 billion of which EUR 259 million maturing in 2025 and EUR 2.7 billion maturing in 2026 or beyond.\n\nFor the 2022 financial year, the dividend of EUR 1.50 per share was paid in two equal instalments. The first instalment of EUR 0.75 per share (totalling EUR 400 million) was paid on 21 April 2023 and the second instalment of EUR 0.75 per share was paid on 2 November 2023 (totalling EUR 400 million).\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nIn 2023, capital expenditure totalled EUR 1,122 million, which was 10.7% of sales (1,555 million, 13.3% of sales). Capital expenditure does not include additions to leased assets.\n\nIn 2024, UPM's total capital expenditure, excluding investments in shares, is expected to be about EUR 550 million, which includes estimated capital expenditure of approximately EUR 300 million in the biochemicals biorefinery in Germany.\n\nIn January 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in the refurbishment of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in Finland. The average annual production of the Kuusankoski plant is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. The investment was completed in Q1 2023.\n\nIn July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros, central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest in port operations in Montevideo and in local investments outside the mill fence. The mill began its operations on 15 April 2023 after the final authorisation to operate was granted. The total investment was USD 3.47 billion.\n\nIn January 2020, UPM announced that it would invest in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany. The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2024, and the total investment estimate is EUR 1,180 million.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n125\n\nIn December 2021, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 10 million in the development of UPM Plywood's plywood mill in Joensuu, Finland. The investment includes new production lines, new workspaces and 720 square metres of completely new production space. The investment was completed in Q3 2023.\n\n## Personnel\n\nIn 2023, UPM had an average of 17,109 employees (17,176). At the beginning of the year the number of employees was 17,236 and at the end of 2023 it was 16,573.\n\nFurther information about personnel is available in \u00bb Engaging employees section in UPM Annual report 2023.\n\n## Uruguay pulp mill investment\n\nOn 23 July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros, central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM would invest in port operations in Montevideo and in local investments outside the mill fence. The mill began its operations on 15 April 2023 after the final authorisation to operate was granted. The total investment was USD 3.47 billion.\n\nThe investment grows UPM's pulp capacity by more than 50%, resulting in a step change in the scale of UPM's pulp business as well as in UPM's future earnings.\n\nWith a combination of competitive wood supply, scale, best available techniques and efficient logistics, the mill is expected to reach a highly competitive cash cost level of approximately USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp. This figure includes the variable and fixed costs of plantation operations, wood sourcing, mill operations and logistics delivered to the main markets. Furthermore, the safety and sustainability performance of the value chain from plantations to customer delivery is expected to be on an industry-leading level.\n\n## Competitive wood supply\n\nEucalyptus availability for the mill is secured through UPM's own and leased plantations, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. The plantations that UPM owns, leases or manages in Uruguay covers 505,159 hectares. They supply the current UPM Fray Bentos mill and the new UPM Paso de los Toros mill.\n\n## State of the art mill design\n\nThe pulp mill has been designed as an efficient single-line operation. The machines, materials, level of automation and standards enable a high operating rate and maintainability, as well as a high energy output. This ensures excellent safety, high environmental performance, and low operating costs during the long lifecycle of the mill.\n\nThe mill is designed to fully meet strict Uruguayan environmental regulations, as well as international standards and recommendations for modern mills, including the use of the latest and best available technology (BAT). The mill's environmental performance is verified through comprehensive and transparent monitoring.\n\nThe mill's initial annual production capacity is 2.1 million tonnes, and the environmental permits enable further capacity potential. When in full operation, the mill generates more than 110 MW surplus of renewable electricity.\n\n## Efficient logistics set-up\n\nAn efficient logistics chain is secured by the agreed road improvements, extensive railway modernisation and port terminal construction.",

        "page_content": "The Public-Private-Partnership agreement between the government and the construction company for the construction of the central railway was signed in May 2019. The construction of the central railway was completed in December 2023 and the railway will start operations during H1 after mandatory tests have been carried out. UPM has ensured logistics with truck transportation until rail logistics are fully operational.\n\nUPM's new deep-sea pulp terminal at Montevideo port went operational in October 2022. Direct rail access from the mill to the pulp specialised deep-sea port terminal will create an efficient supply chain to world markets. The Montevideo deep-sea port also enables synergies in ocean logistics with UPM's all Uruguayan operations.\n\nUPM entered into a port terminal concession agreement in 2019 and signed an agreement on rail logistics services in October 2020. Both agreements are considered in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. The total amount of such lease payments is expected to be USD 200 million.\n\n## Significant impact on the Uruguayan economy\n\nBased on independent socio-economic impact studies, the mill is estimated to increase Uruguay's gross national product by about 2% and the annual value of Uruguay's exports by approximately 12%. According to June 2023 data from government agency Uruguay XXI, eucalyptus pulp has become the country's main export.\n\nIn the most intensive construction phase, more than 7,000 people have been working on the site. In total, over 20,000 people have been involved in the various construction sites related to the project.\n\nNow that the pulp mill is operational, approximately 10,000 permanent jobs are estimated to be created in the Uruguayan economy of which 4,000 would involve direct employment by UPM and its subcontractors throughout the forestry value chain including logistics. About 600 companies are estimated to be working in the value chain.\n\nThe mill is located in one of Uruguay's many (12) free trade zones and pays a fixed annual tax of USD 7 million. The new mill's value chain is expected to contribute USD 170 million in annual taxes and social security payments and to contribute USD 200 million annually in wages and salaries.\n\n## Project schedule and capital outflow\n\nOn 31 March, UPM announced that it reached technical readiness to begin operations and received approval from the environmental authorities for all the procedures, systems and technologies that are required to fulfil the mill's environmental permit. This acceptance preceded the final operating authorisation that was granted on 14 April. The start-up of the mill commenced immediately. UPM celebrated the inauguration of the pulp mill together with representatives of the State of Uruguay and several other stakeholders who have participated in the successful execution of the growth project. Customer deliveries from UPM's deep sea pulp terminal in the port of Montevideo started in May. The nominal capacity of the mill is expected to be reached within the first year.\n\nThe mill has gone through a comprehensive and thorough permitting process. The Uruguayan environmental authority has monitored the construction of the mill on site throughout the project. The operating authorisation process has included several inspections by the authorities, as well as third party audits by industry experts. UPM has an extensive environmental monitoring programme covering water and biota, air, soil, noise, and socio-economic aspects.\n\nIn connection with reaching the technical readiness to start operations, UPM confirmed the expected cash cost level of approximately USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp. This positions the UPM Paso de los Toros mill among the most competitive pulp mills in the world, with attractive returns on investment in various market scenarios.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n126\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nThe total capital expenditure of USD 3.47 billion took place in 2019-2023, with 2021 and 2022 being the most intensive years. UPM holds 91% ownership and a local long-term partner which has also been involved in UPM Fray Bentos, owns 9%.\n\n## Biochemicals refinery investment\n\nIn January 2020 UPM announced that it would invest in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany. The unit was scheduled to start up by the end of 2023 and its investment estimate was EUR 750 million. In July 2023 UPM updated the project schedule, with estimated start-up by the end of 2024 and gave a revised capital expenditure estimate of EUR 1,180 million.\n\nThe update to the schedule and budget was required as the project has been impacted by the insolvency of one of the key equipment suppliers, an overall scarcity of contractors and the negative impacts of the overall geopolitical situation on material availability and prices. Building a first-of-its-kind biorefinery under these circumstances and making required adjustments has been demanding and caused rescheduling and delays in the project. Mitigating actions have been taken and critical resources are contracted.\n\nThe biorefinery is the first of its kind and the process design as well as some of the technologies used are new to the world. We have full confidence in the technologies used and the viability of the process.\n\nThe biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, which will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses. The investment opens up totally new markets for UPM, with large growth potential for the future.\n\nThe industrial scale biorefinery will convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and renewable functional fillers. In addition, the biorefinery will produce biomonopropylene glycol (BioMPG) and industrial sugars. The ROCE target for the UPM Biochemicals business is 14%.\n\nThe combination of a sustainable wood supply, a unique technology concept, integration into existing infrastructure at Leuna and the proximity to customers will ensure the competitiveness of operations. The safety and sustainability of the value chain will be based on UPM's high standards.\n\nInfraLeuna GmbH, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, offers very competitive conditions for constructing a biorefinery with its logistics arrangements and infrastructure for various services and utilities. In October 2020, UPM entered into service agreements with InfraLeuna GmbH related to wood handling, wastewater treatment and other utilities, which will be recognised as lease assets and liabilities under IFRS 16 Leases upon the commencement date. The total amount of such lease assets and liabilities is estimated to be EUR 130 million.\n\nConstruction at the biorefinery site in Leuna continues with visible progress. The erection of pipe racks, casings, tanks and the substation buildings is nearing completion. Also, large parts of the reactors, furnaces and columns are installed. Currently, focus is on piping and electrification, and with approximately 1,000 workers on site, construction activities have reached their culmination point. The biorefinery obtained the permission to operate according to the German Emission Regulation in May 2023.\n\nThe business foundation has been strengthened further. Business function teams and the future operations team are in place. The research, analytics and application development laboratories are also established in Leuna and the teams are working - an important step towards quality assurance, process optimisation and to define future development options.\n\n## Commercial activities are proceeding\n\nCommercial activities have continued to proceed positively in different product and application areas. We have made strong progress in qualifying our products for key end-uses, successfully launched commercial partnerships both for UPM BioPura\u2122 renewable biomonoethylene glycols (bMEG) and UPM BioMotion\u2122 Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF) products. We have a robust commercial pipeline upon start-up of the UPM Biochemicals business. After the launch of UPM BioMotion\u2122 in 2021, joint product development activities with potential customers in the rubber value chain have progressed further as have discussions with especially automotive OEMs, with good results regarding both the technical and commercial viability of the product.\n\nWe made further progress in taking UPM BioPura\u2122 bMEG, to market, advancing sales capabilities and extending pre-commercial discussions with potential customers, as well as brand owners in the packaging, textile and automotive end-uses. In July 2023 we launched a partnership with the German sustainable outdoor apparel brand VAUDE to produce the world's first polyester fleece jackets containing renewable chemicals made by UPM. In September and October 2023 we closed and announced the first larger scale sales contracts for our UPM BioPura\u2122 with our partners Dongsung and Brenntag.\n\nThe environmental benefits of the biorefinery and the UPM Biochemicals portfolio has been publicly acknowledged with nominations as a finalist in Packaging Europe's 'Renewables, Pre Commercialized' category and first position in the sustainability ranking in the European Rubber Journal.\n\n## Biofuels business development\n\nIn January 2021, UPM announced that it moves forward with biofuels growth plans and starts the basic engineering phase of a next generation biorefinery. The potential biorefinery would have a maximum annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of high-quality renewable fuels including sustainable jet fuel. The products would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of road transport and aviation, as well as replace fossil raw materials with renewable alternatives in chemicals and bioplastics. Feedstock sourcing will focus on UPM integrated feedstocks from the company's own ecosystem and wood-based residues will play a substantial role. In addition, the biorefinery would use sustainable liquid waste and residue raw materials.\n\nUPM is proceeding with a detailed commercial and basic engineering study to define the business case, select an innovative technology option and sustainable feedstock mix and estimate the investment need.\n\nThe site assessment for the potential biofuels refinery was completed in January 2022 and Rotterdam in the Netherlands was selected as the optimal location.\n\nIf all preparations are concluded successfully, UPM would initiate the company's standard procedure of analysing and preparing an investment decision.\n\n## OL3 power plant project\n\nIn 2005, the Finnish Government granted a construction license to Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) for the OL3 EPR nuclear power plant unit (OL3) to be constructed at the Olkiluoto site. The OL3 project was completed in April 2023. The OL3 plant supplier (the Supplier), a consortium consisting of Areva NP SAS, Areva GmbH and Siemens AG constituting the Supplier are jointly and severally liable for the turnkey delivery of OL3 under the plant contract.  UPM participates in OL3 through its shareholding in Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n127\n\nmajority shareholder in TVO. UPM's indirect share of OL3 is approximately 31%.\n\nAccording to TVO, the Supplier is responsible under the plant contract for the design, engineering, equipment procurement, equipment manufacture, construction, erection, testing, commissioning, licensing, initial fuel supply and remedying of defects, as well as project management and schedule of the OL3 EPR on a turnkey basis. Due to the Supplier's turnkey responsibility, TVO is only responsible for a limited scope of work under the plant contract. The plant contract includes contractual securities for TVO, including a contract performance bond, a guarantee period bond and liquidated damages for delays, plant performance and plant availability.\n\nAccording to TVO, under the plant contract, electricity production was scheduled to start at the end of April 2009. However, the completion of the project was delayed.\n\nTVO announced, on 20 April 2023, that TVO submitted to the Supplier the Provisional Takeover Certificate. In addition, TVO confirmed that the commercial operation of OL3 starts at 1 May 2023. The final acceptance of OL3 will take place upon termination of the twoyear warranty period. Even after that, the Supplier's liabilities under the warranty will remain in force to a certain extent for eight years at most. The shareholders' right to electricity generated by OL3 and their liability for the annual costs incurred from electricity generation are determined in accordance with TVO's Articles of Association.\n\nOL3 supplies electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (Mankala-principle), which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle electricity and/or heat is supplied to shareholders in proportion to ownership, and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nOL3 increases UPM Energy's electricity generation capacity significantly. The new power plant unit is highly efficient and meets the highest safety standards. Its power generation is CO2 -free and TVO has a secure solution for the final disposal of used fuel.\n\n## Events during the reporting period\n\nOn 2 February, UPM's Board of Directors revised the Company's dividend policy to be based on earnings instead of cash flow. This aligns the dividend policy with the Company's transformative growth strategy. According to the new policy, UPM aims to pay attractive dividends, targeting at least half of the comparable earnings per share over time.\n\nOn 22 March, UPM announced that it plans to permanently close paper machine 6 at UPM Schongau, Germany, reducing the annual capacity of uncoated publication papers by 165,000 tonnes by the end of Q2 2023. UPM also announced that it accelerates the earlier announced stop of production at its Steyrerm\u00fchl mill by six months. The exit of a total annual capacity of 320,000 tonnes of newsprint took place in Q2 2023.\n\nOn 31 March, UPM announced that the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill had reached technical readiness to start operations. UPM also received approval from the environmental authorities for all the procedures, systems and technologies that are required to fulfil the environmental permit of the mill. This approval precedes the final operating authorisation.\n\nIn March, UPM sold all its business operations in Russia to Gungnir Wooden Products Trading.\n\nOn 12 April, UPM held its Annual General Meeting.",

Demand for many UPM products is expected to continue gradually improving as the destocking seen in 2023 is largely over. The market conditions in Biofuels are expected to be weaker than last year. UPM continues to manage margins and take actions to reduce variable and fixed costs.\n\nIn H1 2024, comparable EBIT is expected to be lower than in H2 2023, due to the timing of the energy-related refunds in Q4 2023 and unusually high maintenance activity in H1 2024.  Planned maintenance shutdowns will take place in UPM Paso de los Toros, UPM Fray Bentos and UPM Pietarsaari pulp mills and all three units of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## UPM Fibres\n\n## UPM Energy\n\nUPM Fibres consists of pulp and timber businesses.

In 2023, this amount includes EUR 86 million decrease in the fair value of forest assets resulting in changes of estimates and increase in discount rate.\n\nBiofuels sales prices decreased, weakening profitability.\n\n## Market environment\n\n- \u00b7 The European market for advanced renewable fuels was soft in 2023, especially in Germany. High GHG reduction was achieved in the market, partly due to imported renewable fuels volumes from Asia.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n132\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n- \u00b7 In 2023, interest in bio-based MEG and renewable functional fillers remained strong in Europe. Strong interest in more sustainable solutions from consumers, brand owners and automotive OEMs, is driving demand for bio-based glycols and renewable functional fillers.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, market demand for biocomposites decreased in Europe, driven by the decreasing volumes in building and construction, as well as price sensitivity in consumer products. Market prices were solid and input costs stable. Long term fundamentals for sustainable and renewable materials remained solid.\n- \u00b7 For life science products, the demand is driven by the need to implement automated 3D cell based models and to replace animal models in drug development. For clinical products, hospitals continue to explore new sustainable advanced wound care dressings.\n\nSource: UPM\n\n## Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on 12 April 2023, the number of members of the Board of Directors was confirmed as nine, and Henrik Ehrnrooth, Emma FitzGerald, Jari Gustafsson, Piia-Noora Kauppi, Topi Manner, Marjan Oudeman, Martin \u00e0 Porta and Kim Wahl were reelected to the Board.

According to the\n\nCommission's press release on 12 October 2021, the Commission had concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. On 15 June 2023 the Commission published a release that it had decided to close its antitrust investigation in the wood pulp sector. According to the Commission's release, it had decided to close the investigation after a thorough analysis and careful assessment of all the evidence gathered.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 9.2 Litigation , of the consolidated financial statements 2023 for information on legal proceedings.\n\n## Risks\n\n## Risk management\n\nUPM regards risk management as a systematic and proactive means to analyse and manage opportunities and threats related to its business operations. This also includes risks that can be avoided through careful planning and evaluation of future projects and business environments.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of UPM's management system as risk taking is a normal part of business operations. While executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and manufacturing units are exposed to a number of risk and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing of risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management function.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee, chaired by the CFO, is responsible for recommending risk tolerances and profile to the President and CEO and the Strategy Team. The Strategy Team is responsible for aligning risk management priorities, business and risk management strategies and policies.\n\nThe Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit Committee, monitors and assesses the effectiveness of the company's risk management systems and oversees the assessment and management of risks related to the company's strategy and operations. The Audit Committee oversees that risk management activities are aligned with the Risk Management Policy, and that risk assessments are used to guide internal audit activities.\n\nUPM seeks to transfer insurable risks through insurance arrangements for any risks that exceed the defined tolerance.\n\nUPM strives to ensure compliance with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. To enhance compliance and mitigate risks, UPM performs risk assessments, training and monitoring at regular intervals.\n\nUPM has developed and implemented a comprehensive internal control system that covers business and financial reporting processes. Internal control is aimed at ensuring that the company's operations are efficient and reliable, and in compliance with statutory requirements, and that the company's financial reporting is accurate and reliable, and reflects operational results. Internal control pertaining to financial reporting is described in the Corporate Governance Statement available in the corporate website.\n\nThe main risk factors that can materially affect the company's business, financial results and non-financial performance are set out below. They have been classified as strategic risks, operational risks, and financial risks. Risks may also arise from legal proceedings incidental to UPM's operations.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n133\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Uncertainties in the economic and political operating environment\n\nThe main short-term uncertainties in UPM's earnings relate to sales prices and delivery volumes of its products, as well as to changes in the main input cost items and currency exchange rates, most of which are affected by uncertainty in the global, regional or local economic and political conditions. Political developments are causing uncertainties to the global economy. Such uncertainties also affect UPM's customers influencing the demand for UPM's products.\n\nExamples of such developments are the trade tensions between the United States, the EU and China, the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK after its exit from the EU as well as increased geopolitical tensions that may lead to military conflicts, such as Russia's war in Ukraine, recent emerging conflicts in the Middle East, or economic sanctions, blockades, or export and/or import restrictions that could limit or prevent UPM's business in a country or area or cause adverse effects on energy, logistics or other main input cost items. UPM is also exposed to the impacts of certain governmental protection and trade protection measures such as foreign direct investment restrictions that safeguard domestic industries and other changes affecting international trade. Restrictions on import and export and other measures protecting national interests may affect the availability or cost of necessary raw materials, and changes in the international trade agreements. Changes in fiscal, monetary and other policies taken to respond to the economic impacts of Russia's war in Ukraine and to reduce dependency on Russian resources may cause unintended price volatility or other adverse effects on UPM. Economic downturn, global pandemics, or global power struggles continue to cause high uncertainty to global trade, geopolitics or trajectories of economies.\n\nUPM is especially exposed to the economic and political conditions in countries in which UPM has significant production operations and ongoing investment projects, such as Finland, Uruguay and Germany. UPM also has significant production operations and sales in and to China where the lack of transparency and predictability of the political, economic and legal systems may lead to an increasing uncertainty and risk level when investing in or operating in the country. UPM's subsidiary and employees in Ukraine are exposed to challenging and unpredictable environment stemming from Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n## Cyclical and highly competitive markets\n\nIn all markets UPM operates in, the price level is determined by a combination of demand and supply and an imbalance between them could cause the prices of UPM's products to fluctuate significantly. Imbalances in demand and supply may be caused by factors such as decreases or increases in the end-use demand, changes in customer preferences, market adjustments to Russia's war in Ukraine, or a new production capacity entering the market or an old production capacity being closed, all of which may affect both the volume and price level of UPM's products.\n\nCompetitor behaviour may also influence the market price development. UPM may, from time to time, experience price pressures from competitors in its main business areas and geographic market areas as well as particularly large fluctuations in operating margins due to this competitive environment.\n\nThe majority of UPM's revenue comes from sales of graphic and specialty papers, pulp and label materials, and UPM principally competes with several large multinational paper and forest product companies as well as with numerous regional or more specialised competitors.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in consumer behaviour\n\nDemand for UPM's products may be affected by the introduction of substitute or alternative products. The demand for graphic papers in the mature markets is forecast to continue to decline. This will likely increase the pressure on UPM's graphic paper deliveries and sales prices as well as the scarcity of recycled fibre. Changes in demand could also cause overcapacity in some of UPM's products, affecting the sales prices and deliveries of such products.\n\nDepending on the product area, the shifts in consumer demand may either have a positive or an adverse effect on the consumption of UPM's products. For example, UPM expects that there will continue to be a growing need for renewable and recyclable solutions, which creates various opportunities for UPM and drive demand growth for most of UPM's products. At the same time digitalisation and e-commerce have changed consumer behaviour and resulted in decline in demand for graphic papers for various end uses.\n\n## Changes in legislation\n\nUPM is exposed to a wide range of laws and regulations globally. The performance of UPM's businesses, for example the paper, energy, and biofuels businesses, are to a high degree dependent on the regulatory framework for these areas. Changes in regulation, direct and indirect taxation or subsidies, aid, grants or allowances could have a direct effect on UPM's performance and its relative competitiveness, and structurally restrict or exacerbate UPM's ability to compete for raw material.\n\nUPM also operates in industries that are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among others, emissions, water quality, energy efficiency, as well as waste handling, recycling and disposal. Environmental laws and regulations have become more stringent and may continue to develop to be even more stringent due to various global, regional and national level regulatory initiatives. As these environmental laws and regulations are amended or as their application or enforcement is changed, additional costs in complying with new and more stringent regulations may be imposed on UPM.\n\nUPM's operations require UPM to obtain multiple environmental permits and other licences from relevant authorities and comply with their terms and conditions. These permits and licences may be subject to modification, renewal or, subject to certain conditions, revocation by the issuing authorities. UPM monitors regulatory changes in order to better adapt to the effects of such changes.\n\n## Shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj\n\nUPM is a shareholder of Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the majority shareholder of Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). TVO owns and operates three nuclear power plant units at the Olkiluoto site (OL). PVO supplies electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (so called 'Mankala-principle') that is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala principle, electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective Articles of Association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned. The newest plant unit, Olkiluoto 3 EPR (OL3), started regular commercial electricity production in 2023 and is expected to increase UPM's electricity generation capacity significantly.\n\nIn Finland, UPM indirectly owns approximately 31% of the new nuclear power plant unit OL3, through its shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj. Pohjolan Voima Oyj is a majority shareholder of Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), holding 58.5% of its shares.\n\nAccording to TVO, OL3 was procured as a fixed price turnkey project from a consortium formed by Areva GmbH, Areva NP SAS and Siemens AG (the Supplier). As stipulated in the plant contract, the\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n134\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nconsortium companies have joint and several liability for the contractual obligations.\n\nAccording to TVO, under the plant contract, electricity production was scheduled to start at the end of April 2009. However, the completion of the project was delayed. On 20 April 2023, TVO announced that it had submitted to the OL3 plant supplier the Provisional Takeover Certificate. In addition, TVO confirmed that the commercial operation of OL3 starts at 1 May 2023. The final acceptance of OL3 will take place upon termination of the two-year warranty period. Even after that, the Supplier's liabilities under the warranty will remain in force to some extent for eight years at most. The shareholders' right to electricity generated by OL3 and their liability for the annual costs incurred from electricity generation are determined in accordance with TVO's Articles of Association.\n\nIn March 2018, TVO announced that it had signed a Global Settlement Agreement (the GSA) with the Supplier and the Areva Group parent company, Areva SA, a company wholly owned by the French state, concerning  the completion of the OL3 project and related disputes. According to TVO's announcement, the GSA was amended with agreements signed in June 2021.\n\nIn the GSA, the Supplier consortium companies committed to ensuring that the funds dedicated to the completion of the OL3 project are sufficient and cover all the applicable guarantee periods. Consequently, a trust mechanism was set up funded by the Areva companies to secure the funds required to cover Areva's costs for the completion of the OL3 project.\n\nTVO announced in its Interim Report Q3 2023 that the final payment of approximately EUR 193 million in delay compensation agreed upon in 2018 was set off against the final payment installment of the Areva companies under the plant contract in May 2023. Long-term receivables include the additional delay compensation of EUR 56.7 million to TVO, agreed upon in 2021, will become due during the final takeover of OL3 in April 2025 at the earliest.\n\nAccording to TVO, all payments related to the settlement compensations have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.\n\nTVO announced in its Interim Report Q3 2023 that total investment in the OL3 project was approximately EUR 5.8 billion. EUR 250.0 million was transferred from the OL3 investment to operating-time fuel (inventories) when the OL3 plant unit entered commercial operation.\n\nAccording to TVO, regular electricity production and commercial operation of the OL3 on 1 May, transferred the responsibility of the plant to TVO. The Supplier retains the responsibilities according to the plant contract for warranty periods and for that unfinished work, which has been agreed to be done later at the Supplier's expense.\n\nAccording to TVO, the company will carefully follow the fulfilment of the conditions according to the 2018 settlement agreement and the amendment agreements signed in June 2021. The Supplier is obligated to complete OL3 in accordance with the plant contract and the amended GSA.\n\nTVO announced in its Interim Report Q3 2023 that Finnish grid operator Fingrid Oyj (Fingrid) has limited OL3's production to a maximum of 1,570 MW. After reporting period on 12 January 2024, the Energy Authority issued a decision (1347/040200/2022) considering TVO's investigation request on the main grid protection system for OL3. The decision states that Fingrid acted in breach of electricity market regulations when transferring obligations related to the maintenance of OL3's operational reliability to TVO and when adopting terms and conditions and determination principles for fees without the Energy Authority's confirmation. The Energy Authority requires that Fingrid submits the determination principles for fees related to system protection or a proposal for another mechanism for confirmation by 11 April 2024.\n\nOn 16 December 2020 TVO announced, that the shareholders of TVO, including PVO, had signed an additional shareholder loan commitment, comprising a total of EUR 400 million in new subordinated shareholder loan agreements. According to TVO, with the new shareholder loan commitment, TVO is preparing to maintain sufficient liquidity buffer and equity ratio to complete OL3. On 30 November 2022, TVO announced that the shareholder loan commitment of EUR 400 million, which was originally agreed in December 2020, had been extended by one year until the end of 2023.\n\nOn 26 April  2023, TVO announced that S&P Global Ratings had upgraded its long-term credit rating from 'BB+' to 'BBB-' and affirmed its stable outlook. On 4 May 2023, TVO announced that Moody's Investors Service had assigned a Baa3 long term issuer rating to TVO with a stable outlook. TVO maintains investment grade ratings from all three major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings Ltd BBB-/Stable, Moody 's Baa3/Stable, S&P Global BBB-/ Stable).\n\nAccording to TVO, there are uncertainties related to the availability of OL3 during the first operating cycle by means of any possible unexpected events. Operational issues in power plants could have an adverse impact on TVO's business and financial position, which could cause adverse impact on the fair value of UPM's energy shareholdings and/or the cost of energy\n\n## Climate change\n\nUPM is exposed to a variety of risks related to climate change. Strategic risks related to climate change include risks concerning competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation, subsidies or EU policies and resulting national legislation in EU countries may distort raw material, energy and final product markets and changing costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM's financial performance. Policies and regulations responding to Russia's war in Ukraine and cutting Russian gas supply to Europe may temporarily emphasize energy supply security over climate targets and thus change the trajectory of climate change or slow down the achievement of emission reductions. UPM believes that forest, woodbased products and low-carbon energy hold significant value creation potential with respect to renewable and recyclable products.\n\nOther risks related to climate change particularly concern UPM's supply chain as well as the availability and price of major inputs, such as wood and electricity. Climate change may cause exceptional weather events, such as severe storms, floods and draughts, which could, for example, result in unpredictable hydropower availability and wood harvesting conditions. Exceptionally mild winter conditions with a reduced period of frozen soil in the Nordics could affect the harvesting and transport of wood, consequently undermining the stability of raw material supply and potentially increasing the cost of wood. These could also increase the risk of production limitations.\n\n## Biodiversity loss\n\nBiodiversity refers to the diversity and variation of species and ecosystems on our planet. According to the UN, and despite ongoing efforts, biodiversity is deteriorating worldwide. Biodiversity loss is projected to worsen if no mitigation actions are taken. Mitigating climate change is in our view the single most important action to safeguard biodiversity.\n\nUPM's operations are widely linked with biodiversity, and most significant impacts on biodiversity arise from wood sourcing activities. Biodiversity is instrumental in maintaining healthy forest growth and ensuring that forests adapt to the changing climate. Mitigating biodiversity loss also plays an important role in our hydropower plants and production units where we aim to improve living conditions for local fauna and flora with dedicated actions. Deteriorating biodiversity may cause significant adverse effect on the availability and\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n135\n\nacceptability of wood raw material needed to produce UPM's products such as pulp, paper, timber and biofuels.\n\n## Loss of major customers and industry consolidation\n\nUPM has several major customers, and the largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 2% of UPM's sales in 2023, and the ten largest customers represented approximately 13% of such sales. Although UPM is not dependent on any specific customer or group of customers, the loss of its major customers, if not replaced on similar terms, could have a material effect on UPM's business. Also, as the size of UPM's customers could increase in connection with industry consolidation, such customers could exert increased bargaining power on all of their suppliers, including UPM. UPM is also exposed to risks related to any deterioration of a major customer group's financial condition.\n\n## Product development, innovation and intellectual property rights\n\nResearch and product development are an important part of UPM's strategy, particularly with regard to new businesses, such as woodbased biofuels, biochemicals and biomedicals. The return on investment of new or enhanced existing products and solutions may not meet targets or improve UPM's competitiveness.\n\nUPM has a broad patent portfolio that provides value creation potential in the future; however, it also exposes UPM to risks related to the protection and management of intellectual property, including patents and trademarks.\n\n## Corporate acquisitions and divestments\n\nUPM's strategy is to grow businesses with strong long-term fundamentals and sustainable competitive advantage. This may result in acquisitions of new businesses or divestments of existing businesses or parts thereof. Carrying out corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestments involves risks relating to the successful implementation of a divestment and the ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses, systems, culture and personnel successfully. In addition, the cost of an acquisition may prove high and/or the anticipated economies of scale or synergies may not materialise. Hidden liabilities of an acquired company (e.g., competition law liabilities) may also constitute a significant risk in relation to potential acquisitions.\n\nUPM may divest operations or assets to focus on strategic areas. Any future divestments may be affected by many factors that are beyond UPM's control, such as the availability of financing to potential buyers, interest rates, acquirers' capacity, and regulatory approval processes, and divestments may also expose UPM to indemnity claims. Furthermore, divestments may involve additional costs due to historical and unaccounted liabilities. The profitability of corporate acquisitions and divestments may differ from UPM's expectations.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Fluctuations in the prices of major inputs as well as changes in their availability\n\nThe main inputs required in the manufacturing of UPM's products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these major production inputs have been volatile in the recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, which may have an effect on the general profitability of the industries in which UPM operates. Climate change may contribute to the increase of the price volatility of UPM's major production inputs. Also, any changes in the current forestry practices and level of harvesting due to negative public opinion or regulatory restrictions towards harvesting could have an effect on the raw material supply and may increase the cost of wood.",

        "page_content": "Governmental protection and trade protection measures, amplified by Russia's war in Ukraine and the economic sanctions imposed as a response, could also have an effect on the price and availability of raw materials as countries may, for example, enact further export ban policies to protect forests or to bolster their domestic industries, which could have a material effect on the cost and availability of raw materials for UPM. It is also uncertain how the EU energy policies may affect the availability and costs of fibre and energy. Significant increases in the prices of UPM's major inputs could increase UPM's operating expenses.\n\n## Supplier and subcontractor network and raw materials procurement\n\nUPM's business operations depend on a large number of suppliers and contractors. The majority of UPM's need of wood is covered by suppliers, and other production inputs, such as chemicals, fillers and recovered paper, are fully obtained from suppliers. Disruptions in the supply of key inputs or transportation services could have a significant effect on manufacturing operations. This could, for example, result in interruption or downscaling of production, change in the product mix or increased costs resulting from price increases for critical inputs or transportation services as well as shifts in the availability and price of wood. Due to Russia's war in Ukraine, the EU has imposed bans on wood exports and imports and transportation operations directly applying to sourcing of wood and other raw materials from Russia. Supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which UPM would be able to source its production inputs and could materially affect the prices paid by UPM for these inputs.\n\nThe UPM Supplier and Third Party Code defines the minimum level of performance that UPM requires from its suppliers and third-party intermediaries. UPM carries out supplier risk assessments on, for example, operational, financial, quality and responsibility perspectives. Based on the risk assessment, selected suppliers' activities are evaluated in more detail through annual surveys, supplier audits and joint development plans. If any non-conformities are discovered, the supplier is required to take corrective measures, which UPM follows up on. Some contracts may also be discontinued due to the seriousness of the finding or insufficient corrective measures.\n\n## Management and execution of large investment projects\n\nInvestment projects in UPM's businesses are often large and take one or more years to complete. Participation in large projects involves risks, such as cost overruns or delays, shortage of labour, financial distress of suppliers, or accidents as well as non-achievement of the economic targets set for the investment. Currently, UPM's largest ongoing investment project is the construction of a new biochemicals refinery in Germany. This project involves the development of new business concepts and technologies.\n\nUPM is responsible for many projects in several of its countries of operation at any given time. All projects involve technical and operational risks, and projects require continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Managing several projects requires that UPM has sufficient resources and efficient processes. Port congestion issues, transportation bottlenecks, accidents in transit, and rising logistics or construction costs, all of which could be resulting from external events or market conditions beyond the control of UPM, may have an effect on the execution or profitability of investment projects. UPM's transformative biochemicals project in Germany is proceeding, but despite efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline of the project may occur due to events affecting project workers, suppliers or infrastructure.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n136\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Unavailability of information systems as well as cybersecurity breaches\n\nUPM's production and business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in UPM's or a supplier's critical information system services, loss of critical, financial or personal data due to reasons beyond UPM's or its suppliers' control, such as power cuts, software or telecommunication errors or other major disasters, such as fires or natural disasters, as well as user errors by UPM's own personnel or suppliers, can potentially cause major damage to UPM's businesses and disruptions to the continuity of operations.\n\nUPM's or its suppliers' information systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks. Malicious cyber intrusion could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages and damage to UPM's reputation.\n\n## Litigation and compliance\n\nUPM operates globally in a large number of jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks. UPM may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings or it could become subject to various claims and actions based on various grounds.\n\nOn a global scale, enforcement activities and jurisdictional reach regarding competition issues and anti-corruption have increased. Also, the recent development of Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) related lawsuits in Germany for alleged non-payment of EEG based surcharges may have an adverse impact on UPM, albeit UPM is not currently a party to any such lawsuits. Russia's war in Ukraine triggered many countries to impose several sanctions packages which may increase the risk of investigations, litigations or claims associated with alleged sanctions violations, or retaliatory litigation in Russia. The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards of responsible behaviour and it covers topics relating to legal compliance and disclosure, anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nUPM's environmental performance and social responsibility play a significant role in UPM's ability to operate and influence the long-term success of its businesses. UPM also measures and publishes information on its environmental, social and governance matters, for which there is an increasing risk of investigation or litigation from activist or other stakeholders on alleged misrepresentation. UPM has significant manufacturing operations or sourcing in several developing countries, some of which are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval. Breaches of applicable laws and regulations or corporate policies by UPM employees may lead to legal processes, sanctions and fines as well as reputational damages effecting UPM's operations.\n\n## Industrial actions\n\nUPM is subject to risk of industrial actions, which could disrupt its business operations or the business operations of its stakeholders. Uncertainty may increase in the Finnish labour market amid the announcement of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation in fall 2020 to transfer collective bargaining to companies. For example, in the beginning of 2022, members of the Paperworkers' Union, the Finnish Electrical Workers' Union and the Trade Union Pro started strikes at UPM mills in J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski, Kouvola, Lappeenranta, Pietarsaari, Rauma, Tampere and Valkeakoski, Finland. Any strike or other industrial action in UPM's business operations or related sectors could have an effect on UPM's business operations. For example, industrial actions in the transport sector or among other stakeholders important to UPM, may disrupt UPM's operations. Additionally, public dissatisfaction with UPM's labour-related decisions may, in extreme cases, lead to unanticipated boycotts or disruptions at its facilities or construction sites.\n\n## A natural disaster, fire, accident or other calamity at UPM's production facilities\n\nUPM operates a significant number of production facilities globally that are exposed to risks related to environment, fires, natural events, machinery breakdowns, site security and occupational health and safety risks. If UPM's production facilities were to experience a major accident or were forced to shut down or curtail production due to such unforeseen events, such as a leak or spill due to malfunction or human error, this could cause major interruptions in UPM's operations and result in significant costs in order to clean up and repair any potential damages to the production plant and the surrounding areas. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness (including pandemics related infection outbreaks) or liability to UPM's employees, contractors or third parties. These risks are managed through established management procedures, health and safety precautions and loss prevention programmes. UPM's insurance programme provides coverage for insurable hazard risks, subject to insurance terms and conditions.\n\n## Forests and plantations\n\nUPM's plantations and forests may be affected by the impacts of climate change, which include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, storms, floods and drought. Climate change is expected to have the biggest physical effect on UPM's forest lands in Finland, where temperatures are expected to rise more significantly and rapidly compared with other countries where UPM owns forest. Although forest growth will likely accelerate, particularly in Finland, due to the longer growing season, extreme weather conditions will intensify, presenting new risks. The increase of droughts and forest fires are estimated to pose the most significant risks for UPM's forests and plantations. Also, damages caused by insects and tree diseases are becoming increasingly common, which could have an effect on the value of UPM's forest assets. Should these risks materialise, they could harm UPM's forest and plantations resulting in production interruption and additional costs.\n\n## Strategic partners\n\nUPM collaborates with many partners. For example, product development in the biofuels, bioenergy or biochemicals increases the importance of partnerships in the search for new products and businesses or higher efficiency. Partnerships may, however, create risks to UPM's profitability, for example, through changes occurring within the partner entity or changes in how the partnership operates. UPM is also subject to the risk that its strategic partners do not comply with UPM's Code of Conduct with anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n137\n\nPartnership arrangements may also be too rigid to enable timely changes required, for example, in connection with changes in the market conditions or the economy. UPM's partners may have different targets with respect to the business of the partnerships. As UPM may not have sole control over strategic direction and operational output of these entities, its partners may have the right to make certain decisions on key business matters with which UPM does not agree. In some cases, strategic partners may choose not to continue partnerships that they have with UPM. Russia's war in Ukraine and the resulting adverse economic conditions may cause financial stress to a strategic partner and trigger unexpected negotiation or other processes causing delays or cost increases for UPM.\n\n## Intellectual property rights of third parties\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. Initiatives within this strategic focus area are technologyintensive and require increasing investments in such technologies either through internal development or through third party licences or technological partnerships. In addition to UPM's own IPR portfolio, UPM licences certain technologies developed by third parties. Evaluating the rights related to the third party technologies UPM uses or intends to use is increasingly challenging. Licensing third party technology exposes UPM to such risks as the increase of overall licensing costs, loss of negotiation power, the validity of such licensing arrangements and potential infringement claims, which could restrict UPM's ability to use certain technologies, prevent the delivery of UPM's products and/or result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Risk related to IPR claims and disputes relating to technological partnerships have been assessed to increase.\n\n## Building capabilities to growth areas\n\nThe success of UPM's business largely depends on the ability to build and retain the necessary new capabilities required for future growth. UPM is continuously developing its employee experience, leadership culture, evaluating its recruitment, compensation policies and career development opportunities and taking measures to attract and retain diversely skilled personnel and individuals with rare and pivotal specialist knowledge for current and future growth areas.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks are described in consolidated financial statements 2023.\n\n| TYPE OF RISK                   | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENT NOTE   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                    | 4.6 Working capital                      |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk | 5.1 Capital management                   |\n| Interest rate risk             | 6.1 Financial risk management            |\n| Foreign exchange risk          | 6.1 Financial risk management            |\n| Electricity price risk         | 6.1 Financial risk management            |\n| Counterparty risk              | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting     |",

        "page_content": "## Non-financial information\n\nTo steer its responsibility activities, UPM has established a set of responsibility focus areas with targets and key performance indicators. They are reviewed every year based on a materiality analysis (page 63). The focus areas cover economic, governance, social and environmental responsibility. Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is one of the most material topics, and it is relevant for UPM throughout the whole value chain: land use, sourcing, production and products. Thus, climate-related targets are established for all of these areas. Further material topics are related to biodiversity and human rights, for example.\n\nUPM's Biofore strategy guides the company in achieving its responsibility targets for 2030 and in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development published by the UN.\n\nConnecting sustainability performance to financing demonstrates the importance of responsible business practices to UPM's long term value creation. UPM's revolving credit facility is linked to the long-term biodiversity and climate targets, and three green bonds have been issued since 2020. Since January 2022, responsibility-related measures are included in UPM's management remuneration.\n\n## Based on international frameworks and commitments\n\nUPM respects international human rights agreements and agreements concerning labour rights, including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nSince 2003, UPM is a signatory of the UN Global Compact initiative, whose ten universal principles are derived from international agreements in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. In 2023, UPM joined the UN Global Compact's Forward Faster initiative.\n\nRegarding climate change UPM committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2017 and received validation of its tightened CO2 targets in 2020. To further strengthen its climate approach, UPM committed to the UN's Business Ambition for the 1.5\u00b0C pledge and joined The Climate Pledge to reach the targets set by the Paris Agreement by 2040. In 2023, as part of the Forward Faster initiative, UPM also committed to set Net Zero targets as defined by SBTi. The work will be finalised during 2024.\n\nUPM follows the Finnish Corporate Governance Code issued by the Securities Market Association and complies with all of its recommendations.\n\n## UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies\n\nUPM's decision making, management and operations are guided by UPM values and the UPM Code of Conduct. Legal compliance and responsible practices are the foundation of all of UPM's businesses and create long-term value for both UPM and its stakeholders. The UPM Code of Conduct emphasises UPM's commitment to business integrity and responsible business operations, manifesting the company's guiding principles.\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct is approved by the Board of Directors as UPM's highest governance body. It is complemented by more detailed policies approved by the Board of Directors and rules, statements and standards approved by the Group Executive Team, business areas or global functions. These policies, rules, statements and standards cover such topics as treasury, taxes, disclosures, insider matters, anticorruption, competition law, confidentiality, human resources, responsibility, forestry, information security and data protection, environment and safety.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n138\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nUPM expects its suppliers, third party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct and to fulfil criteria concerning social and environmental responsibility. These requirements are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code, latest updates effective as of beginning of 2020. The UPM Code of Conduct was last updated in 2022.\n\n## Roles of the group management and functions in leading nonfinancial matters\n\nThe Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, is responsible for monitoring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. The non-financial information in this Report of the Board of Directors is reviewed by the Board as part of the approval process. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews reports on nonfinancial matters and related reporting on a regular cadence. The Audit Committee also oversees procedures for treatment of complaints and concerns received by the company, anonymous or otherwise. As part of the committee's compliance review, the committee is provided with a quarterly report by the company's Chief Compliance Officer, and a report of submissions under the company's Report Misconduct channel by the Head of Internal Audit. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the review, evaluation and preparation of the company's incentive schemes and annually commencing plans for the Board's approval, including their linkage to company's ESG performance. The Nomination and Governance Committee reviews regularly the adequacy of the Board and committee charters also related to ESG topics.\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved UPM's strategic objectives and the strategic plans of the Company and its business areas during its strategy session in May 2023. The main focus areas of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be performance, growth, innovation, responsibility and portfolio development. This strategy is enhanced by the UPM purpose: We create a future beyond fossils (read more on pages 20-21). An essential part of the Board's annual strategy work is to review and assess strategic and operational risks and opportunities (see UPM Corporate Governance Statement 2023). These risks and opportunities and their impact on operations and strategy are described on pages 34-35.\n\nSince 2022, the Board has included measures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes in the Company's performance share plan (PSP), one of its long-term incentive plans. The PSP includes three distinct ESG performance measures and the total weighting of these measures accounts for 20% of all measures.\n\nThe President and CEO's duty is to manage and oversee UPM's dayto-day business operations in accordance with the instructions and orders given by the Board of Directors. In the operative management of the Company, including the management of corporate responsibility, the President and CEO is assisted by the Group Executive Team, the Business Area Boards, the Strategy Team, the Disclosure Committee and the Ethics Advisory Committee.\n\nThe Group Executive Team approves and executes group-level rules, guidelines and procedures relating to amongst others corporate responsibility, including possible impacts on economy, environment and people, determining courses of action and guiding development work. The role of the Business Area Boards is business area level decision making in matters pertaining to amongst others corporate responsibility and they oversee implementation of the group-level rules, guidelines and procedures in the Business Area. The Strategy Team assists the President and CEO in matters pertaining to amongst others the integration of corporate responsibility into group strategies for Boards' approval and\n\npreparation of changes in responsibility focus areas and targets for the Group Executive Team's approval.\n\nThe Ethics Advisory Committee is chaired by the General Counsel and its other members are the EVP of the UPM Human Resources function, the Chief Audit Executive and the Chief Compliance Officer. The Ethics Advisory Committee supports the President and CEO and the Board's Audit Committee in their responsibilities relating to monitoring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and company policies and the effectiveness of UPM's compliance system. The Disclosure Committee monitors, assesses, gives recommendations and guidelines regarding external disclosure pertaining to amongst others corporate responsibility. The Disclosure Committee is chaired by the CFO and its other members are the General Counsel, the EVP of UPM Stakeholder Relations function and the Head of Investor Relations.\n\nIn practice, corporate responsibility work takes place in businesses and functions, and in the group's Responsibility team, which coordinates the projects carried out by businesses and functions.\n\nUPM Legal Function and its Compliance team manage legal compliance programmes and arrange related training at regular intervals for specific target groups, which have been defined based on risk assessments. UPM Sourcing organisations follow clearly defined selection and follow-up processes when evaluating suppliers. Reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, cost competitiveness, financial sustainability of suppliers, social and environmental responsibility and product safety are the key factors when selecting and evaluating suppliers.\n\nWhile executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and production units are exposed to a number of financial and nonfinancial risks and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management Function.\n\n## Management of non-financial matters\n\nUPM's responsible thinking starts with anticipating, mitigating and managing risks, and extends to creating a competitive advantage and long-term value.\n\nUPM continually strives to reduce its risk exposure and improve its performance by using tools such as certified management systems. All production sites have a certified ISO 14001 environmental management system, except the new pulp mill in Uruguay which started production in 2023 and two Raflatac sites in Germany which were acquired at the end of 2022. Certification is expected during 2024. Nearly all production sites and wood sourcing operations implemented integrated management systems for environmental protection, quality management and occupational health and safety in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standards. All pulp and paper mills in the EU, as well as the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay and the UPM Changshu paper mill in China, also adhere to the EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). Many of the sites also have energy management systems certified under ISO 50001 or the Finnish ETJ+ system, and food safety management systems certified under ISO 22000, if relevant.\n\nShould stakeholders have any concerns or suspect misconduct, they are encouraged to contact UPM or to use the UPM Report Misconduct channel. The service is available on the corporate website for both the company's employees and external stakeholders. Operated by an independent external service provider, the channel is accessible in over 40 languages, 24/7. In 2023, 83 (54) cases were reported either through the UPM Report Misconduct channel or directly to Internal Audit or the Compliance team. 10 (9) of these cases related to alleged\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n139\n\ndiscrimination or harassment. 21(8) cases led to disciplinary action including warnings and terminations of employment.\n\n## Reporting framework used\n\nFor its Group-level sustainability reporting UPM follows the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Task Force on Nature-related Disclosures (TNFD) as well as the AA 1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard. The respective information is assured by an independent third-party, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Oy (pages 118-119).\n\n## Committed to anti-corruption\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct underlines the company's zero tolerance attitude towards corruption and bribery in any form. UPM AntiCorruption Rules explain prohibited conduct and expected ethical behaviour in further detail.\n\nUPM performs anti-corruption risk assessment on a regular basis. The 2023 compliance risk-assessment process included a top-down risk discussion (including corruption) with the management of each business area. All UPM group entities were also assessed on the basis of country risk and complexity of operations. UPM operates globally and has significant manufacturing operations in several emerging market countries. Such operations require a number of permits and other licenses from the relevant authorities. Some of the countries where UPM operates are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval.\n\nDue diligence of suppliers and third parties with whom UPM does business is an essential part of UPM's anti-corruption compliance programme. UPM requires that due diligence is performed before entering into or renewing any contract with a third party that meets specified criteria. UPM requires anti-bribery contract terms to be included in agreements with such third parties outlining the third party's commitment to compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and UPM's right to audit the third party to verify compliance with these terms. UPM also has corresponding due diligence procedures for joint ventures, including mergers and acquisitions.\n\nUPM has a dedicated anti-corruption e-learning platform. The anticorruption training covers all white-collar employees. In 2023, the company organised tailored anti-corruption training workshops for selected target groups across the company and performed risk-based compliance reviews in selected jurisdictions and operations.\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\nUPM is committed to respecting and promoting human rights in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. UPM has assessed all its own operations and activities and has identified the potential human rights issues and impacts. When considering both the severity and likelihood of these potential issues and impacts, UPM considers the salient human rights issues in the company's sphere of influence to be environmental pollution, occupational health and safety (OHS), working conditions, protection of children, and forced labour. UPM regularly analyses the saliency of its human rights impacts recognising that impacts on people continue to evolve as business changes and the approach to due diligence develops.\n\nUPM reviews its human rights risks as part of the UPM compliance process quarterly. In 2023, the assessment of human rights issues on a business area level as well as the integration of the process to unit specific management systems continued. UPM also started a human",

        "page_content": "rights impact assessment across its operations in Uruguay in collaboration with an external partner. The focus on strengthening UPM's human rights due diligence practises in investments and business development projects as well as in contractor management also continued.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nUPM requires its suppliers, third party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct including commitment to anti-corruption, environmental and social responsibility, safe products, human rights and occupational health and safety practices.\n\nTransparent supplier requirements are the basis for responsible sourcing. These requirements for suppliers are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code. A number of additional requirements are in place for the sourcing of wood, chemicals, pulp and packaging materials, as well as for safety and logistics. All contractors working on site go through UPM's safety requirements and a web-based safety induction training.\n\nUPM identifies its supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. These responsibility-related high-risk suppliers are determined by the country of origin, sourced material or service, and the UPM supply chain ESG risk register which holds UPM's view on company and business area relevant risks on people and the environment. UPM also uses EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans to carry out more detailed evaluations of suppliers' activities.\n\nFor the first time in 2023, our various responsible sourcing practices and priorities were formulated into a cohesive, over-arching sustainable supply chain programme. Each element entails clear instructions regarding the relevant sourcing and supply chain management practices and implications in UPM, as well as tangible guidance, requirements and expectations for UPM's suppliers. Effective implementation is managed and tracked through our 2030 responsibility targets and performance indicators.\n\nUPM continued its co-operation with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative that promotes and improves sustainability practices within the supply chains. In 2023, UPM conducted some 540 (520) EcoVadis environmental and social assessments and 95 (121) supplier audits. In addition, about 890 (360) contractor reviews with a focus on working conditions were carried out in Uruguay.\n\n## Social and employee-related matters\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in social and employee-related matters are: learning and development, responsible leadership, diversity and inclusion, fair rewarding as well as safe and healthy working environment.\n\nUPM is committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations.\n\nUPM aims to empower and engage employees at all levels through responsible leadership. UPM encourages its employees to pursue professional growth, expects development and supports them in learning skills and developing them further.\n\nUPM respects the privacy of employees and promotes equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development. All UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, etc. Also in 2023, UPM carried out a gender pay equity review process closing the unexplained gender pay gap and a living wage review process to make sure that salaries are sufficient everywhere. To achieve and follow-up the set target of greater\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n140\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nfemale representation in professional and managerial roles has been in focus for different organisations.\n\nIn its People Strategy, UPM focused on leadership and creating a safe, inclusive and diverse working environment, as well as aiming higher in performance and ensuring the growth of our people. The aim is to create a unique, positive UPM experience and to develop future ways of working and collaborating, supported by attractive culture, workspace and technology. In 2023, UPM continued with its programme to develop the UPM experience and ways of working, having digital capabilities in focus for operators and tools for citizen development for UPMers. The enabling performance approach by strengthening feedback culture, agile goal setting and frequent manager-employee discussions is being further strengthened.\n\nDevelopment programmes to support growth and performance were continued and implemented. The key areas of development have been inclusive and purposeful leadership, high-performing teams, selfleadership and coaching. Development planning and related tools were developed and a campaign to support UPMers in their development done. To further develop inclusive leadership and culture, UPM continued to have a dialogue and train UPMers. In 2023, an Employee Resource Group (BeU) was set-up to support the LGBTIQ community, create awareness and develop inclusive culture at UPM.\n\nUPM promotes employees' health and wellbeing. In 2023, UPM continued to implement its health and wellbeing vision, which takes a holistic approach on themes: body, mind, heart and soul. Safety is an essential part of UPM's activities and business management system. Equal safety requirements are applied to all employees, visitors and contractors working at UPM's premises. Proactively thinking about the safety of employees and contractors remained an important focus area in 2023.\n\nThe requirements concerning process safety have been clarified with a new safety standard and process safety has been in focus especially in the new investment projects of the biofuel and biochemicals businesses. In 2023, a new safety project was started with a dialogue with employees to engage UPMers to give input about how does the safety look from employee perspective, what works well and what could be improved.\n\n## Product stewardship\n\nThe majority of UPM's products are made from renewable raw materials and are recyclable. UPM products help to mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based products with bio-based renewable alternatives. Product stewardship covers the entire lifecycle of all UPM products from the development phase to the end-use and beyond.\n\nIn 2023, UPM's Sustainable Product Design concept implementation continued with several projects. The approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both of which are integrated in sustainable product design practices. During the process, the whole raw material chain, production and distribution efficiency, sustainable use and circularity are considered.\n\nUPM provides product declarations to provide customers with easy access to information concerning the products'environmental and product safety aspects or the wood origin. Together with a number of paper and chemical companies the exchange of information in the supply chain was improved. This facilitated a pre-assessment of chemical use and to ensured compliance with legislations and ecolabels.\n\nMost UPM products are certified with widely recognised ecolabels, such as the EU ecolabel and national ecolabels for graphic paper or ISCC and RSB certification for biofuels, biocomposites and labels.\n\nAll UPM pulp mills, UPM Raflatac sites, UPM Specialty Papers' production lines and UPM Kymi paper mill have implemented food\n\nmanagement systems in accordance with ISO 22000. The respective products are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\nIn 2023, UPM developed internal guidance on how to make sustainability claims in its communication and marketing.\n\n## Environment\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in environmental matters are forests, biodiversity, water, waste and climate. UPM uses raw materials, water, energy and nutrients in a responsible manner and continuously improves its energy, resource and cost efficiency.\n\nUPM is committed to sustainable forestry and third-party-verified FSC\u2122 and PEFC chain of custody certification covers all sites using wood raw materials. This ensures that the wood is legally sourced from sustainably managed forests. All UPM-owned forests are certified, or in the process of certification if acquired recently.\n\nAccording to the water risk analysis carried out with the WWF Water Risk Filter in 2021, our production sites are in areas with low to medium water scarcity. A comprehensive water risk analysis has provided 2030 and 2050 scenarios of water risks, based on climate and socio-economic changes to enable us to understand and prepare for future water risks and opportunities. The water withdrawn by UPM plants comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater resources. UPM uses water responsibly in terms of the company's water usage and effluent quality. If the price of raw water were to increase by EUR 0.01 per cubic metre, it would mean additional water costs of approximately EUR 4 million annually. In 2023, wastewater volume decreased by 10% per tonne of pulp and increased by 23% per tonne of paper. The increase for paper is due to temporary market-related shut-downs.\n\nCircular bioeconomy is at the core of our operations. We have developed innovative ways to reduce and recover waste and to use side streams, residues and recovered materials. For example, tall oil is used for the production of UPM BioVerno renewable diesel and naphtha and ash is utilised e.g. in soil stabilisation, cement industry or as raw material for paper filler production. Regulatory changes may have an impact on the options for waste or residue use, either by restricting the end uses and thus causing higher costs for alternative solutions, or by creating new opportunities. In 2023, 87 (90)% of UPM's process waste was recycled or recovered, of which 30 (21)% is energy recovery.\n\nIn 2023, UPM's environmental investments totalled EUR 60 million (11 million). The significant increase compared to previous year was mostly due to investments in electric boilers at eight mills, totalling EUR 35 million. In addition, at UPM Kaukas over EUR 2 million were invested in wastewater management related renewals and upgrades. UPM's environmental costs, which were mainly attributable to effluent treatment and waste management, totalled EUR 121 million (123 million), including depreciation.\n\nThe company-wide Clean Run concept, launched in 2012 and developed since to cover all operations and being holistic environmental management system, aims to improve UPM's environmental performance by bringing environmental issues to the forefront of everyday work and enabling consistent way of working whatever operation in concern. In 2023, UPM strengthened its management of environmental topics by revising and standardizing its Clean Run concept. The new Clean Run standard will be implemented globally during 2024. All sites systematically follow up any deviations, proactively report observations and near misses, carry out walks and discussions, share best practices and compile detailed risk assessments. Approximately 1,500 (1,400) environmental walks were organised and 2,600 (2,100) preventive environmental observations and near misses were reported in 2023.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n141\n\nIn 2023, the number of environmental non-conformances increased to a total of 28 (22) deviations from permit, contractual or other obligations. 5 cases were related to air, 20 to water, 2 to soil and water and 1 to waste. All deviations were reported to the authorities and, where relevant, to local stakeholders. In all cases, appropriate measures were taken to normalise the situation, and will be taken to prevent similar occurrences. In 2023, one major environmental incident occurred at UPM's new Paso de los Toros pulp mill in Uruguay (read more on page 93). In January 2024, Uruguay's Ministry of Environment imposed a sanction of approx. USD 188,000 on the company for noncompliance with the environmental management plan for the UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill. This sanction will be due for payment in 2024. In 2023, UPM was not required to pay any significant fines due to environmental non-conformances.\n\n## Biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nSince 2022, the importance of biodiversity has been reflected in UPM's broader approach towards biodiversity to cover other areas beside forests, e. g. streams and mill sites, and in establishing it as an own focus area.\n\nRelated forestry, UPM continues to carry out biodiversity activities as part of UPM's global Forest Action programme. Targets for net-positive impact on biodiversity in own forests in Finland and for UPM's land in Uruguay have been set with dedicated key performance indicators to measure the progress. UPM's stream water programme strives to remove obstacles to fish migration, restore fish stocks and improve the living conditions of all stream fauna throughout Finland. Possible impacts on biodiversity from industrial emissions are minimised by several measures like using best available techniques, monitoring and continuous improvement processes.\n\nIn 2023, UPM developed and tested tools, methodology and guidance for setting science-based targets for the preservation of nature as part of the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) Corporate Engagement Program.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe management of climate change related issues is integrated into the management of other non-financial issues and is reported to the Board depending on the context and matter. For example: 1) risks are reported to the Board by CFO, 2) related compliance and regulatory issues are briefed quarterly to the Audit Committee (Board) by the Compliance Officer, 3) annual progress on 2030 responsibility targets is reported by EVP Stakeholder Relations or 4) if there are specific climate-related topics, then the responsible topic owner briefs the Board. Additionally, major climate-related issues such as scenario analyses, commitments and UPM's overall approach of acting through forests, emission reductions in production and supply chain and through climatepositive products are reported directly to UPM management bodies led by CEO.\n\nUPM's position and resilience in different climate scenarios (IPCC RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, IEA B2DS, IEA NPS and IEA CPS) have been evaluated for the businesses and functions from both physical and transitional angles, involving expertise from scientific community. Generally, in low- and medium-emission scenarios the transition impacts play a bigger role and UPM is well positioned as its business portfolio allows for flexibility regarding recognised risks and opportunities. In the high-emission scenario physical impacts dominate with severe consequences not only for UPM but for the ecosystems and societies across the globe.\n\nUPM's targets for reduction of fossil CO2 emissions are 65% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 2015 level and 30% reduction of emissions from sourced materials and logistics (Scope 3)",

These targets were validated by the ScienceBased Targets initiative (SBTi) to be aligned with the 1.5\u00b0 C pathway according to the Paris agreement. In 2023, fossil CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) summed up to 3.7 (4.5) million tonnes, which is a decrease of 17% compared to 2022, and a decrease of 45% compared to 2015. The Scope 3 emissions for materials and logistics summed up to 4.7 (4.8) million tonnes CO2, a reduction of 23% compared to 2018. Overall Scope 3 emissions were 7.6 (7.4) million tonnes. In 2023, scope, assumptions and factors used in Scope 3 calculation were reviewed and updated. Detailed information on 2023 data, methodology and assumptions is available in UPM's GHG inventory, published on upm.com. In 2023, UPM committed to set long-term Net\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Zero targets as defined by SBTi. The work will be finalised during 2024.\n\nFurther targets related to climate change are climate-positive land use and developing climate-positive product portfolio. Concerning land use, forestry and product portfolio, UPM has engaged with scientific partners in order to gain credible data and approaches.\n\nUPM favours the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. Biomass-based fuels make up 76% (65%) of fuels used by UPM worldwide. If UPM needed to buy certificates to cover its whole direct fossil CO2 emissions, and if the price of CO2 certificates were to rise by EUR 10 per tonne, it would mean additional costs of approximately EUR 21 million annually.\n\n## UPM climate and nature related disclosures according to TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) and TNFD (Task Force on Nature-related Financial

It represents an important step towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in line with the EU climate goals. The first EU Disclosures Delegated Act on Climate was adopted in 2021 and it required large companies to report the proportion of their economic activities considered Taxonomy-eligible in relation to Climate change adaptation and Climate change mitigation objectives. In financial reporting year 2022, companies were also required to report the taxonomy alignment of their economic activities based on the sustainability requirements defined in the regulation.\n\nIn June 2023, the Commission adopted the Taxonomy Environmental Delegated Act, including a new set of EU taxonomy requirements for economic activities making a substantial contribution to one or more of the non-climate environmental objectives, namely: Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, Transition to a circular economy, Pollution prevention and control and Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The Commission also adopted amendments to the Taxonomy Disclosures Delegated Act and to the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, covering the environmental objectives of Climate change mitigation and adaptation. For the financial year 2023, the KPIs shall cover all six environmental objectives concerning the Taxonomy eligibility. From 2024 onwards, also alignment shall be reported regarding all six objectives.\n\n## Assessment of Taxonomy eligibility and alignmen t\n\nIn 2023, UPM conducted a thorough evaluation of the eligibility of activities with the new sustainability requirements defined in the adopted regulation. The assessments were carried out with the support of several UPM functions and businesses coordinated by UPM's finance and responsibility teams. EU NACE Classification (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) was used as a reference in activity identification. Based on the assessment, UPM identified a potential new activity 1.2. Manufacture of medicinal products for the objective Pollution prevention and control within its Biomedicals business developing and supplying wood-based biomedical products. However, as the reportable amounts for the activity are currently minor and have no impact on the KPIs, UPM considered to report it as non-eligible.\n\nUPM also completed an annual review of all taxonomy-aligned activities recognized contributing to climate objectives. All turnovergenerating activities aim at a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (CCM) and they meet specific technical screening criteria and the criteria for 'do no significant harm' (DNSH) stated for each activity within the relevant Appendix to the delegated act. For all activities contributing to climate change mitigation, a physical climate risk assessment is needed pursuant to Appendix A to the Climate Delegated Act. Technical screening and  'do no significant harm' criteria were reviewed together with the responsibility experts from related UPM's businesses. Audit requirement related to the activities 1.1 Afforestration and 1.3 Forest management is interpreted to be fulfilled based on the FSC, PEFC and (or) SFI audits due to lack of service providers in the market fulfilling Taxonomy specific certifier requirements on Forest management. Data for the separate Climate benefit analysis for the related activities is provided by Natural Resources Institute Finland. UPM's Taxonomy aligned economic activities are the following:\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n145\n\n- 1.1 'Afforestation' relates to transformation of land use from nonforest to forest through planting, deliberate seeding or natural regeneration and consists of UPM's afforestation operations in Uruguay.\n\n1.3 'Forest management' relates to economic activity that influences the ecological, economic or social functions of the forest and mainly consists of UPM's forest management and regeneration activities in Finland, Uruguay and USA.\n\n3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies' relates to technologies and products dedicated to the reduction of GHG emissions and includes construction of UPM's new biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany and intangible rights related to UPM Biochemicals acquisition of SunCoal Industries GmbH.\n\n- 4.13 'Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids' relates to manufacture of biofuels from forest biomass and consists of UPM's biorefinery operations in Lappeenranta, Finland.\n- 4.5 'Electricity generation from hydropower' relates to operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity from hydropower including UPM's own and co-owned hydropower plants.\n- 4.20 'Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from bioenergy' relates to operation of installations used for cogeneration of heat/cool and power exclusively from biomass, biogas or bioliquids and it mainly consists of operation of UPM's own and co-owned biomass-based boilers in Finland and Uruguay.\n\nUPM reports separately information on nuclear and fossil gas related activities according to the Complementary Delegated Act. UPM identifies the activities 4.27 \"Construction and safe operation of new nuclear power plants\" (Olkiluoto 3) and 4.28 \"Electricity generation from nuclear energy in existing installations\" (Olkiluoto 1& 2) through its shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO) which has direct shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings . TVO operates three nuclear power plants in Finland after Olkiluoto 3 started its production phase in Q2 2023. Both nuclear activities 4.27 and 4.28 are Taxonomy aligned based on the comprehensive assessment conducted by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). For 2023, UPM identified a potential new activity, 4.29. 'Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels', related to new Nordland CHP plant in Germany. The plant generates electricity mainly for UPM's internal consumption but in case of excess production electricity can be sold externally to grid operator. The reportable amounts for the activity are currently minor and have no impact on the KPIs, hence, UPM considered to report it as non-eligible.\n\nUPM re-evaluated Taxonomy-eligible activities and made the following change to the eligible scope compared to 2022: UPM reclassified its R&D activities previously reported within the activity 9.1 \"Close to market research, development, and innovation\" to be reported as a part of activities 3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies' and 4.13 'Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids'. Reclassification regarding the activities did not have an impact on the alignment interpretation of the items. The change has also been incorporated into comparison figures.",

All the aligned activities in financial year 2022 were also aligned in 2023 based on the executed annual alignment assessment. Taxonomy aligned turnover KPI increased by 2 percentage points mainly due to higher biofuels sales consisting of renewable diesel and nafta (activity 4.13). In addition, electricity sales volumes related to nuclear power increased compared to previous year due to start of the operational phase of Olkiluoto 3. Simultaneously, this was partly offset by decreased electricity prices (activity 4.27). CapEx KPI increased by 9 percentage points and was notable higher than in previous year due to higher proportion of Leuna biochemicals biorefinery investment out of Total Capex as well as additions to intangible rights (IPR) related to UPM Biochemicals' SunCoal Industries GmbH acquisition (activity 3.6). OpEx KPI increased by 3 percentage points mainly due to planned maintenance work at the biofuels biorefinery in Lappeenranta (activity 4.13) and higher OpEx related to Olkiluoto 3 nuclear plant due to started operations (activity 4.27).\n\nThe Taxonomy regulation is still under development and does not cover all the sustainable economic activities. The majority of UPM's products and services, such as pulp, paper, timber, plywood and label materials contributing to the turnover, are not included in the EU Taxonomy, thus the high proportion of Taxonomy non-eligible activities.\n\n1) The percentages differ from the Annex II templates presented below as they include nuclear activities which are not presented in Annex II templates. Nuclear activities are presented using the Annex XII templates of the amended Disclosures Delegated Act.\n\n## KPIs and accounting policies\n\nThe eligibility and aligned-related financial information to be disclosed pursuant to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation is presented in the following pages in tables Turnover of taxonomy-eligible activities, CapEx of taxonomy-eligible activities, OpEx of taxonomy-eligible activities and Nuclear and fossil gas related templates.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n146\n\n## Turnover of taxonomy-eligible activities (excluding nuclear and fossil gas related

UPM has calculated the KPIs using the financial information presented in group consolidated financial statements 2023. In determining the eligible and aligned turnover any specific fragments of production inputs, such as use of sustainable raw material or energy, have not been included in the eligible turnover if the main activity is not included in the Taxonomy. However, for activities that are used both internally and, to some extent, to generate external turnover, the CapEx and OpEx is not split in relation of internal and external use, but fully allocated to economic activity that leads to revenue. The definitions of CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators are based on definitions set out in the Disclosures Delegated Act. CapEx and OpEx related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities are counted only once. Whenever an individual investment is considered Taxonomy-aligned, this proportion of CapEx is not further allocated to a Taxonomy-aligned economic activity, to avoid double counting. Similarly, OpEx related to purchased outputs that are already considered under OpEx associated with Taxonomy-aligned activities is not further counted. The group has no economic activities contributing to multiple climate or environmental objectives.\n\n## Turnover\n\nUPM has calculated turnover, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, based on the same accounting principles that apply for revenue in IFRS Accounting Standards, i.e., covering all amounts derived from the sale of products and services in the course of ordinary activities. Total turnover corresponds to total sales as reported in group consolidated financial statements. Refer to Accounting policy in consolidated financial statements Note 2.2. Sales. Taxonomy-eligible and -aligned turnover include only revenue from sales of products and services generated from activities that are included in the Taxonomy.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n153\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, the numerator of the turnover KPI is defined as the turnover derived from products and services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities:\n\n- 1.3. 'Forest management' generates turnover from the sale of wood and wood-based biomass such as logs, pulpwood and forest residues from UPM's own and leased forests to third party customers (other sources of wood excluded from the eligible turnover).\n- 4.5. 'Electricity generation from hydropower' generates turnover from the sale of electricity generated by UPM's own or co-owned hydropower plants.\n- 4.13. 'Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport' generates turnover on sale of wood-based renewable diesel and naphtha for transport and petrochemicals.\n\n'4.20. 'Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from bioenergy' generates turnover from the surplus sale of heat and power generated from biomass in combined heat and power plants that is not consumed in own production. Regarding the power plants, the portion of the fossil fuels has been excluded from the turnover.\n\nTurnover from sale of forestry services to private forest owners (1.3. 'Forest management') and sale of logistic services from leased vessels (6.10 'Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for port operations and auxiliary activities') are Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n## CapEx\n\nUPM has included in CapEx, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, additions to tangible and intangible assets, before any depreciations, impairments, amortisation charges and fair valuations during the financial year, as accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 38 Intangible assets, IAS 41 Agriculture and IFRS 16 Leases. CapEx corresponds to cash payments to acquire fixed assets in the Consolidated cash flow statement adjusted with amounts accrued but not paid at the end of reporting period, acquisition of businesses and subsidiaries (intangible rights) and additions to leased",

Leases in UPM consolidated financial statements 2023. Capital expenditure presented in the UPM Annual report within Other financial information differs from Taxonomy-CapEx as it does not include additions to forest assets, acquisition of businesses and subsidiaries and leased assets.\n\n- In 2023 and 2022 1) , the numerator consists of the following categories of Taxonomy-aligned CapEx:\n- 1.1. 'Afforestation' CapEx includes purchased and leased land for afforestation.\n- 1.3. 'Forest management' CapEx includes capitalised forest regeneration costs.\n- 3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies' CapEx relates to investment in new-generation biorefinery in Leuna, Germany and intangible rights related to UPM Biochemicals acquisition of SunCoal Industries GmbH, a German-based company that developed a unique technology portfolio to produce performance products such as functional fillers from renewable raw materials. The group is reporting all CapEx related to ongoing investment in new-generation biorefinery as Taxonomy-aligned CapEx.\n- 4.13. 'Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport' CapEx includes refurbishment of Lappeenranta biorefinery.\n- 4.5. 'Electricity generation from hydropower' CapEx includes refurbishment of hydropower plants.\n- 4.20.

Costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment include direct salaries of maintenance personnel, maintenance materials and maintenance services outsourced. In addition, as UPM owns a significant amount of forest assets, it considers forest management and support services as day-to-day servicing of assets as defined in EU Disclosures Delegated Act. OpEx is included in consolidated income statement line item Costs and expenses, refer Note 2.3. Operating expenses and other operating income.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022 1) , the numerator consists of the following categories of Taxonomy-aligned OpEx:\n\n- 1.3. 'Forest management' OpEx includes forestry infrastructure maintenance, forest fire fighting, protection and environmental activities whereas forest regeneration costs, e.g., planting, growing of seedlings and operation of nurseries, are included in CapEx.\n- 3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies' includes R&D costs related to biochemicals biorefinery.\n- 4.5. 'Electricity generation from hydropower' OpEx includes maintenance costs of hydropower plants.\n- 4.13. 'Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport' OpEx includes maintenance costs of biofuels production facility in Lappeenranta and next generation biofuels refinery R&D costs.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n154\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n- 4.20.

Taxonomy-eligible OpEx in activities 4.27 and 4.28 includes, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, UPM's share of dayto-day servicing costs related to property, plant and equipment in the new and existing nuclear power plants. UPM is not reporting any CapEx related to the nuclear activities as due to the nature of its shareholding ownership in PVO, investments related nuclear are not included in the total UPM's Capital expenditure as presented in the UPM Annual report, refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings . For 2023, UPM identified a potential new activity 4.29. 'Electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels' related to new Nordland CHP plant in Germany. The reportable amounts for the activity are currently minor and have no impact on the KPIs, hence, UPM considered to report it as non-eligible. All the reported nuclear activities and respective KPIs are both Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned.\n\n1) UPM reclassified its R&D activities previously reported within activity 9.1. Close to market research, development, and innovation to be reported as a part of activities 3.6 'Manufacture of other low carbon technologies' and 4.13 'Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in transport and of bioliquids'. Reclassification regarding the activities did not have an impact on the alignment interpretation of the items. The change has also been incorporated into comparison figures.\n\npartners and research organisations such as universities. They work closely with UPM's mills, businesses and business-specific research centres in various countries.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to strengthen our infrastructure in Germany, Finland, Switzerland and Uruguay. In Germany, we intensified biochemical R&D and piloting in several of our laboratories in connection with the upcoming biochemicals refinery, supported by the acquisition of Suncoal Industries.\n\nIn Finland, we expanded our research centre in Lappeenranta with the main focus on developing biomolecular businesses. In Uruguay, we focused on piloting future pulp end-uses in close collaboration with our forestry research centre specialising in eucalyptus plantations. UPM Biomedicals opened a new cell laboratory in Basel, Switzerland.\n\n## Implementing sustainable product design concept\n\nOur 2030 responsibility targets and contribution to the UN SDGs are integrated into our R&D activities and product development. We want our products to create value for our stakeholders during the whole product lifecycle.\n\nWe carried out screenings in the early stages of product development using a tool we developed to map impacts on the SDGs. Based on the feedback we obtained, we continued to develop the tool by reviewing and adapting the questions included in the tool. The concept was also tested to investigate product reuse with UPM Biocomposites and UPM Raflatac.\n\nOur approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both of which are incorporated in sustainable product design practices. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint are key tools in our concept. They provide credible environmental data over the lifecycle of products under development and for products already available on the market. We also continued to conduct biodegradability and recyclability testing.\n\n## Developing R&D competences\n\nR&D supports our growth and responsibility targets globally, enhances technology-triggered business opportunities and protects performance in existing businesses. Strong focus is placed on the growth businesses and close collaboration with customers and production.\n\nWe continuously develop our competences for the future needs of our businesses. Competence development is essential for the entire organisation, including both technical capabilities and ways of working.\n\nWe focused especially on chemical safety and behavioural safety at work, noting both safe and at-risk behaviours. Our R&D and piloting teams have also become more international thanks to successful recruitments and onboarding. In addition to internal competence development, we collaborate with universities and vocational schools to enhance mutual learning.\n\n## UPM Biofuels - Green growth with advances biofuels\n\nOur renewable and sustainable biofuels help to mitigate climate change. Advanced biofuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% compared to fossil fuels. In addition to decarbonising road transportation, we help to defossilise various other industries by offering wood-based naphtha. Naphtha is the major raw material for most chemicals and plastics. UPM BioVerno\u2122 naphtha is a drop-in solution for replacing fossil-based naphtha allowing the production of sustainable chemicals and plastics. Our strategy is based on proprietary technology and UPM's integrated feedstocks.\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Innovating for the future\n\nInnovation and R&D programmes are essential in the development of new products and technologies. Research and development expenses cover the development of new technologies, businesses and processes. In 2023, we spent EUR 538 million (EUR 414) million) on research and development, which accounted for 23.7% (81.5%) of operating cash flow. In addition to direct R&D expenditure of EUR 66 (55) million, the figure includes negative operating cash flow and capital expenditure in developing businesses, transformative business prospects and digitalisation projects.\n\nThe patents, trademarks and intellectual property rights protecting our innovations support the journey from innovation to business. We have nearly 3,600 patents and patent applications, and more than 1,700 trademarks globally. Licensing innovations and technologies provides an excellent basis for value creation with customers and technology partners.\n\n## Extensive partner network\n\nOur close-knit global partner network includes customers, universities, research organisations, suppliers and start-up companies. Collaboration speeds up the development and launch of new business solutions.\n\nOur network includes the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU), the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) and the Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI). We are a member of the 4evergreen alliance, an initiative created by the Confederation of European Paper Industries (Cepi) to raise the overall recycling rate of fibre-based packaging to 90% by 2030. We are also a member of EUROPEN, the European association that strives towards achieving carbon neutrality in the packaging value chain.\n\nWe want to take part in the developments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2023, we actively participated in Hydrogen Cluster Finland to create new technologies, business opportunities and climate benefits throughout the network.\n\n## Our focus in 2023\n\n## Innovating climate-positive products\n\nOur biochemicals refinery under construction in Leuna, Germany, will enable us to switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based alternatives in textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and pharma. To accelerate product development, UPM Biochemicals announced several partnerships in 2023.\n\nCo-creating products with customers and technology partners continued.  For example, we introduced the world's first fleece jacket containing 30% wood-based polyester as well as fully fibre-based heatsealable packaging and a bio-attributed jar for a moisturiser.\n\nThe step from mainly fossil-based plastic packaging to biomaterials requires R&D in numerous areas. Our work focused on packaging paper and pulp value chains, including pulp side streams such as lignin. We led a collaboration project on finding alternatives for fossil-based binders and coatings.\n\nWe are examining new ways to utilise renewable biomaterials for textiles, nonwovens, hygiene products and labels for example. We are also looking into the opportunities provided by green hydrogen and biogenic CO2.\n\n## Expanding R&D infrastructure\n\nUPM's three Biofore Base research centres accelerate the development of bio-based products. The centres focus on research, piloting and analytics, enabling seamless collaboration with customers, value chain\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n155",

        "page_content": "## Focus on market fundamentals\n\nIn 2023, demand for advanced biofuels was good and markets continued to benefit from a dedicated and compulsory mandate for advanced biofuels based on EU-wide rules. Simultaneously, European biofuels markets faced uncertainties due to economic slowdown and increased imports of biofuels labelled as advanced from China. The longer term effect of Chinese imports remains uncertain.\n\nInput costs remained at a high level. Crude tall oil (CTO) markets continued to tighten due to the increased replacement of fossil fuels and stronger competition. In the first half of the year, the turnaround shutdown impacted production rates at the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery. In the second half of the year, production levels were good and production efficiency improved after the shutdown.\n\n## Green growth opportunities\n\nUPM aims to become a major European player in the production of advanced biofuels. Markets con-tinue to grow and be driven by climate targets. According to estimates, around 30% of fossil-derived fuels used for transportation in the EU could be replaced with advanced biofuels by 2050.\n\nFurther growth in advanced biofuels plays an important role in UPM's Biofore strategy. We are currently conducting the commercial and basic engineering study for a next-generation biofuels refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The new potential biorefinery would produce high quality renewable fuels, including sustainable aviation fuels, and raw materials for the petrochemical sector, for example in bioplastic applications. In 2023, UPM Biofuels initiated proceedings to qualify its renewable fuel as sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nOur current feedstock for biofuels in the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery is crude tall oil, which is a residue from pulp production. In our plans to increase production of advanced biofuels, we are also considering other residue streams and by-products of the forest industry. The planned biorefinery would enhance material efficiency without compromising global food production.\n\nIn the future, the path to defossilisation in different transport sectors will increasingly rely on renewable synthetic fuels. Our extensive knowhow and experience in biorefinery operations not only gives us a competitive edge but also opens up growth opportunities in the realm of green hydrogen solutions.\n\n## Towards 2030\n\nUPM's advanced biofuels belong to the most demanding sustainability category of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II and forthcoming RED III), which includes residues from agricultural and forest-ry activities. Our UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery, with an annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes, is the largest advanced biofuels-only refinery in the EU.\n\nThe newly adopted RED III Directive includes an increased target for advanced biofuels in the transport energy mix in Europe by 2030, reflecting a considerable increase on today's production capacity and creating significant opportunities for new investments.\n\n## UPM Biochemicals - Ramping up new business\n\nGlobal brands deepen their sustainability promises to consumers and market CO2-optimised products while embracing increased supply chain sustainability. UPM Biochemicals will be well positioned to provide renewable chemicals made from sustainable wood with a CO2- product footprint that is considerably below that of fossil-based chemical products and credibly documented by our third-party-reviewed LCA. Our proposition to help brands defossilise their products has gained further traction in the market and has triggered wide-spread support across our key markets.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n156\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nThe main civil works of the world's first industrial-scale wood-tochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany were completed in 2023 and commissioning will be gradually concluded during 2024. The relevant German authorities granted the preliminary licence to operate in 2023 - a big milestone towards start-up. The total cost of the biochemicals investment project is estimated at EUR 1,180 million.\n\nThe biorefinery will convert solid wood into next-generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF). The biorefinery will also produce biomonopropylene glycols (BioMPG) and industrial sugars. The total annual capacity of the biorefinery will be 220,000 tonnes.\n\nThe feedstock sourcing network has grown further, and we are continuing to close strategic partnerships to secure a stable flow of certified sustainable beechwood. Our active role in shaping the German and European policies on biomass-based materials has triggered government endorsement and is actively enabling commercial opportunities.\n\n## Positive market response and first product sales\n\nMarkets are responding very positively to our new products as we have further stepped up our sales and marketing. This shows in proactive endorsement through global consumer brands and a series of development partnerships in globally lead markets for sustainable chemicals.\n\nWe finalised distribution agreements for our lignin-based Renewable Functional Filler (RFF) and advanced application development to qualify RFF for applications in the automotive, fashion, building and plastics industry.\n\nWith the acquisition of German-based SunCoal Industries, we strengthened our technology portfolio for lignin-based rubber solutions and increased our process and product know-how by adding an innovative team of experts.\n\nEuropean Rubber Journal renewed their endorsement of UPM BioMotion\u2122 Renewable Functional Fillers as the most important sustainability project in the elastomers and rubber industry.\n\nFor our renewable bio-monoethylene glycols (BioMEG), UPM BioPura\u2122, we extended our development partnership with Dongsung, the leading glycols manufacturer and seller in the Korean market and one of the region's biggest materials suppliers of global footwear brands. We also realised the first product sales with Dongsung and Brenntag, the world's leading chemicals distributor, confirming the value expectations in our BioMEG.\n\nA successful co-operation partnership with the German outdoor and performance wear brand VAUDE was met with significant public and consumer interest. We jointly launched the world's first polyester fleece jacket, containing 30% renewable content with our BioPura\u2122 BioMEG.\n\nThe transformative character of our investment was highlighted by UPM Biochemicals winning the prestigious Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS) Best Process Innovation from a Large Company Award and the International Textile Manufacturers Forum's (ITMF) Sustainability and Innovation Award.\n\n## Towards production start and commercial ramp-up\n\nThe building site is busy with more than 1,400 contractors finalising the project, with a heavy focus on piping and electrification and automation. The future operations team is trained and starts taking ownership of the processes, actively driving commissioning and start-up preparations.\n\nWith all critical materials sourced, contractor relationships tested and proven, and a firm grip on the timeline, we are confident to start up the first units of the Leuna biorefinery. To support a ramp-up from 2025 onwards, we put in place efficient sourcing and supply chain operations\n\nand agreed the relevant partnerships to enable efficient production and distribution of our products.\n\n## UPM Biomedicals - Advancing innovations\n\nUPM Biomedicals develops and supplies innovative and sustainable wood-based products for medical and life science applications. The main component of our products is nanocellulose, refined from birch wood, which encourages the trend to reduce animal-based materials in the field.\n\nWe actively collaborate with universities, research centres and key industrial partners in the fields of high-throughput drug screening, personalised medicine, cell therapies, 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering and advanced wound care.\n\nIn life sciences, our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing, GrowInk\u2122 a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting and GrowDase\u2122, an enzyme to release living cells from the gel. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility with even the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patient-derived cells.\n\nWe continued to study the use of GrowDex\u00aein a cell-based model of a liver. Cell-based liver models (mini-livers) are used to test the toxicity of almost every new pharmaceutical candidate. We continue to develop Grow-Dex based mini-livers and other mini-organs in our own cell laboratory in Helsinki.\n\nIn 2023, we opened a new sales office and cell laboratory in the Switzerland Innovation Park in Basel. This allows us to be close to our customers and support the use of our products in central Europe.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to supply nanocellulose to Cellink and signed a distribution agreement for GrowInk\u2122 bioinks with Brinter.\n\nGrowInk\u2122 is a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting used in areas such as cancer research, where models of tumours can be printed to test their response to different treatments. The ultimate goal is to print organs or tissues that could, in the future, be transplanted into patients.\n\nIn the clinical field, many Finnish healthcare professionals and hospitals in the Nordic countries already use our CE-marked FibDex\u00ae wound dressings for skin graft donor sites. These one-time applicable wound dressings were also successfully piloted with good healing results in selected university hospitals in Germany. In 2023, we started the clinical investigation for superficial dermal burns at Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden.\n\n## UPM Biocomposites - Best in class\n\nUPM ProFi uses European post-consumer plastic waste and postindustrial label waste to manufacture high-quality composite decking. The label production side streams come from UPM Raflatac and its customers, with the waste being collected and delivered to Germany where the composite decking is manufactured.\n\nThe UPM ProFi Piazza product range is made with up to 75% recycled materials and offers best-in-class performance. We are a member of the EU Circular Plastics Alliance, which aims to increase the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nUPM Formi creates and manufactures wood-based biocomposites, enabling the carbon footprint of the end product to be reduced by up to 80% compared with similar products made from fossil-based materials. The composite materials are suitable for various end uses, including kitchenware, personal care and acoustic devices. Products comply with food safety standards and other similar quality requirements.\n\nIn 2023, the new organ's facade pipes are made of wood-based UPM Formi 3D biocomposite at the Helsinki Music Centre (page 63). As an example of material efficiency, we introduced new trays made of UPM Formi composite to Finnish ABC service stations. The trays can be recycled into new trays after use (page 100). In 2023, the European Food Safety Authority re-evaluated the safety of wood-based fibres in\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n157\n\ncontact with food and made its criteria more stringent.

The Board proposes that the dividend be paid in two instalments.\n\nThe first dividend instalment, EUR 0.75 per share, is proposed to be paid to shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date for the first dividend instalment 8 April 2024. The Board proposes that the payment date for the first dividend instalment would be on 16 April 2024.\n\nThe second dividend instalment, EUR 0.75 per share, is proposed to be paid to shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date for the second dividend instalment 31 October 2024. The Board proposes that the payment date for the second dividend instalment would be on 7 November 2024.\n\nIf the payment of the dividend is prevented due to applicable law, regulation or unexpected circumstances, the Board will resolve, as soon as practically possible, on a new record date and payment date.\n\nOn the date of the dividend proposal, 1 February 2024, the registered number of the Company's shares is 533,735,699. The aforementioned number of shares includes 411,653 treasury shares which are not entitled to dividend. As a result, the proposed dividend would total EUR 800.0 million.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the distributable funds of the parent company were EUR 3,289,796,583.55. The profit of the parent company for the period was EUR 1,674,687,361.44. No material changes have taken place in respect of the Company's financial position after the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Board Of Directors, the proposed distribution of profits does not risk the solvency of the Company.\n\nSignatures of the annual accounts and the report of the Board of Directors for the year 2023\n\nHelsinki, 1 February 2024\n\n| Henrik Ehrnrooth Chair   | Kim Wahl        | Pia Aaltonen-Forsell   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Emma FitzGerald          | Jari Gustafsson | Piia-Noora Kauppi      |\n| Topi Manner              | Marjan Oudeman  | Martin \u00e0 Porta         |\n\nMassimo Reynaudo\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n162\n\n## Financial Statements 2023\n\n| Consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income   |   164 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Consolidated balance sheet                                            |   165 |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity                           |   166 |\n| Consolidated cash flow statement                                      |   167 |\n| Notes to the consolidated financial statements                        |   169 |\n\n## 1.

Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by UPM's central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management, under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Financial risks are described in the relevant notes as described below\n\n| FINANCIAL RISK                 | NOTE                                 |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                    | 4.6 Working capital                  |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk | 5.1 Capital management               |\n| Interest rate risk             | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Foreign exchange risk          | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Electricity price risk         | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Financial counterparty risk    | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting |\n\n## 1.3  Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nUPM's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and subsidiaries controlled by UPM. All group entities apply consistently UPM's accounting policies. All intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities and unrealised profits, as well as intragroup profit distributions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is a contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nUPM's share in joint operations is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the group's own assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses in the arrangement together with UPM's proportionate share in the joint assets, liabilities and joint income and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions between UPM and its joint operations is eliminated.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the group has significant influence but no control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions without the power to control or jointly control those policies. Joint ventures are joint arrangements where the group has joint control with other parties and the parties have rights to the arrangement's net assets.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. Associates and joint ventures follow the group accounting policies for consolidation purpose.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n170\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent company and noncontrolling interests is presented on the face of the income statement. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent company.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between consideration paid and the acquired share of the carrying value of the subsidiary's net assets is recorded in equity. Gains or losses of disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity, net of transaction costs.\n\n## 1.4  Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nUPM records foreign exchange differences relating to ordinary business operations within the appropriate line items above operating profit and those relating to financial items are presented separately as a net amount in finance costs.\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from euro are translated into euros at quarterly average exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. All resulting translation differences are recognised as a separate component in other comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of net investment in foreign operations and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign entity is partially disposed of, sold or liquidated, translation differences accrued in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale/liquidation.\n\n## 1.5  Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe group has reviewed IFRS Accounting Standard amendments effective on periods starting 1 January 2023. The amendments effective as of 1 January 2023 did not have any impact on the group's financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance contracts\n\nOn 1 January 2023 the group implemented IFRS 17 Insurance contracts. The group has assessed the impact of the implementation of IFRS 17 and concluded that it has no effect on the group financial statements as of 1 January 2023.\n\n## Narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1\n\nOn 1 January 2023 the group has implemented the narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1, which require entities to disclose their material accounting policy information, instead of significant accounting policies. The group has reviewed its accounting policies and made minor amendments to the disclosures.\n\n## Reclassification of provisions in the balance sheet\n\nEffective from the current reporting period, the group has reclassified current provisions to the current liabilities section. Previously both current and non-current provisions were presented within the non-current liabilities section of the balance sheet.

The revenue comprises also sales of energy, biofuels, sawn timber and plywood products and a very limited amount of services not related to sale of goods.\n\nUPM sells a proportion of its products to several major customers. The largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 2% (3%) of UPM's sales and the ten largest customers represented approximately 13% (15%) of such sales.\n\nThe group disaggregates its external sales by business area, because this depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Sales by UPM business areas are reported consistently with the internal reporting provided to UPM's President and CEO who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the business areas. The goods and services included in sales revenue of each business area are presented in below tables.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 2.1 Business areas for information on UPM products.\n\n## External sales by major products\n\n2\n\n| BUSINESS AREA                    | BUSINESS                                                                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| EUR million                      |                                                                                 |        |        |\n| UPM Fibres                       | UPM Pulp, UPM Timber                                                            | 2,452  | 2,052  |\n| UPM Energy                       | UPM Energy                                                                      | 486    | 343    |\n| UPM Raflatac                     | UPM Raflatac                                                                    | 1,485  | 1,981  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers             | UPM Specialty Papers                                                            | 1,300  | 1,423  |\n| UPM Communication Papers         | UPM Communication Papers                                                        | 3,570  | 4,792  |\n| UPM Plywood                      | UPM Plywood                                                                     | 402    | 518    |\n| Other operations                 | UPM Forest, UPM Biofuels, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals, UPM  Biocomposites | 768    | 608    |\n| Eliminations and reconciliations | Eliminations and reconciliations                                                | -3     |        |\n| Total                            | Total                                                                           | 10,460 | 11,720 |\n\n| BUSINESS                 | PRODUCT RANGE                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Pulp                 | Softwood, birch and eucalyptus pulp                                                                       |\n| UPM Timber               | Standard and special sawn timber                                                                          |\n| UPM Energy               | Electricity and related services                                                                          |\n| UPM Raflatac             | Self-adhesive paper and film label stock                                                                  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | Labelling materials, release base papers, flexible packaging materials, office papers, graphic papers     |\n| UPM Communication Papers | Graphic papers for various end uses                                                                       |\n| UPM Plywood              | Plywood and veneer products                                                                               |\n| UPM Forest               | Wood and wood-based biomass (logs, pulpwood, chips, forest residues etc.), full forestry service offering |\n| UPM Biofuels             | Wood-based renewable diesel for transport and renewable naphtha for transport and petrochemicals          |\n| UPM Biochemicals         | Lignin products for industrial use                                                                        |\n| UPM Biomedicals          | Wood-based products for biomedical applications                                                           |\n| UPM Biocomposites        | UPM ProFi decking products and UPM Formi granules                                                         |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n177\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Sales by business area\n\n| EURm                     | 2023   | 2022   | CHANGE %   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| UPM Fibres               | 3,044  | 2,704  | 13  %      |\n| UPM Energy               | 628    | 734    | -14  %     |\n| UPM Raflatac             | 1,485  | 1,982  | -25  %     |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | 1,485  | 1,677  | -11  %     |\n| UPM Communication Papers | 3,598  | 4,866  | -26  %     |\n| UPM Plywood              | 422    | 539    | -22  %     |\n| Other operations         | 802    | 634    | 26  %      |\n| Eliminations             | -1,003 | -1,415 | -          |\n| Total                    | 10,460 | 11,720 | -11  %     |",

The biggest factor affecting UPM's financial results is the sales price of paper. A change in the volume delivered has less than half of the effect of the same percentage change in sales prices. UPM Paso de los Toros pulp mill was ramped up since April 2023. Had the mill operated for the entire year of 2023, the sensitivity to changes in chemical pulp prices would have increased to EUR 190 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Sales of goods\n\nUPM's performance obligation in the contracts with customers consists of providing the goods specified in the contracts. Revenue from UPM's product sales is recognised when performance obligation is satisfied, which takes place at point in time when control of the good has been transferred to the customer. In UPM's customer contracts the transfer of control and thus timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on delivery terms. Group terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2020, the official rules for interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. Major part of the sales contracts is on delivery terms basis, whereby delivery is not a promised service to the customer, as the control of a good does not transfer to the customer before shipment. Revenue and the corresponding receivable are recorded at the point in time when the product is delivered to the destination point for terms designated Delivered Duty Paid ('DDP') or Delivered at Place ('DAP'). For sales transactions designated free of carriage (FCA), revenue is recorded at the time of shipment. For sales transactions designated as Carriage paid to (CPT) or Carriage and Insurance Paid to (CIP), the portion of revenue relating to goods is recorded at the time of loading and the portion of revenue relating to delivery services over time when the service has been performed.\n\nUPM sells energy to NordPool electricity market. Revenue is recognised when electricity is transmissed over time.\n\n## Sales of services\n\nUPM provides forest expertise and contracting services to woodland and forestry owners and freight services (free space on group's vessels sold as freight services). Revenues from services are recorded over time when the service has been performed. Sales of services is very limited and thus the group does not report it separately.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nThe group recognises revenue as an amount equal to the price specified in the customer contract net of any sales taxes, cash flow hedging results of sales in foreign currency, hedges of energy sales and variable consideration, when applicable. Variable consideration is defined as any variability that may occur between the sales price and the amount\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n178\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nUPM expects to receive. The variable consideration includes mainly cash discounts and volume rebates that encourage the customer to take specific volumes in a given timescale. In addition, the group gives the customers the right for purchase price refund in case the products do not meet the quality as specified in the agreement. The amount of variable consideration is recognised as a refund liability when some of the amount received is expected to be refunded to the customer. Customer rebates payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period and expected quality claims are estimated using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A refund liability is included in trade and other payables.\n\nReceivables are recognised when the goods are delivered, and the consideration is unconditional except for the passage of time. For most of UPM's customer contracts the period between the transfer of goods or services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than 12 months. For these contracts the group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components.\n\nAdvance payments received from customers are recognised as contract liability. UPM does not have any contract assets arising from contracts with customers.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 4.6 Working capital for information on contract liabilities and refund liabilities.\n\n## 2.3  Operating expenses and other operating income\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses excluding forest assets fair value change, wood harvested and share of results of associates and joint ventures are presented below.\n\n| EURm                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs and expenses                        |        |        |\n| Raw materials, consumables and goods      | 6,000  | 6,260  |\n| Employee costs  1)                        | 1,287  | 1,181  |\n| Other operating costs and expenses  2)    | 1,143  | 1,028  |\n| Delivery costs and other external charges | 886    | 1,001  |\n| Total                                     | 9,316  | 9,470  |\n\n- 1) \u00bb Refer Note 3 Employee rewards, for further information.\n\n## 2) Distribution of other operating costs and expenses\n\n| EURm                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rents and lease expenses                     | 23     | 29     |\n| Emission expenses  1)                        | 18     | 70     |\n| Losses on sale of non-current assets         | 6      | 1      |\n| Credit losses                                | 4      | 9      |\n| Maintenance and other operating expenses  2) | 1,092  | 919    |\n| Total                                        | 1,143  | 1,028  |\n\n1) Emission expenses include gains on sales of emission rights EUR 49 million (losses EUR 2 million).\n\n2) Other operating expenses include, among others, energy as well as expenses related to services and group's administration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cost structure 2022 EUR 9,470 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Auditor's fees\n\n| EURm                   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Audit fee              |    4.4 |    4   |\n| Audit related services |    0.2 |    0.2 |\n| Tax services           |    0.3 |    0.3 |\n| Other services         |    0.1 |    0.1 |\n| Total                  |    5   |    4.6 |\n\nIn 2023, auditor's fees include EUR 0.2 (0.2) million related to audit services, EUR 0.0 (0.0) million related tax services and EUR 0.1 (0.1) million related to other services paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nThe research and development costs included in operating expenses were EUR 66 million (55 million) in 2023.

Capitalised development costs are amortised on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives, usually not exceeding five years.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will comply with the attached conditions. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and accordingly directly reduce the annual depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are recognised in the income statement in the period necessary to match",

Such a grant is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which it becomes receivable.\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income mainly includes gains on the disposal of noncurrent assets and rental income. Further, other operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses in respect of UPM's normal business activities. Gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying hedge accounting are also recognised in other operating income.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nThe group participates in the European Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Emission rights received from governments free of charge to emit a fixed tonnage of carbon dioxide in a fixed period of time give rise to an intangible asset for the emission rights, a government grant and a liability for the obligation to deliver emission rights equal to the emissions that have been made during the compliance period.\n\nEmission rights are initially recognised as intangible assets based on market value at the date of initial recognition. Emission rights are not amortised. If the market price of emissions rights at the balance sheet date is less than the recognised costs, any surplus emission rights that are not required to cover actual and estimated emissions during the financial year, are impaired to the market price.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet at the same time as emission rights and are recognised in other operating income in the income statement, systematically, over the compliance period to which the corresponding emission rights relate.\n\nThe liability to deliver emission rights is recognised based on actual emissions. The emissions realised are expensed under other operating costs and expenses in the income statement and presented as a provision in the balance sheet. The liability is settled using emission rights on hand, measured at the carrying amount of those emission rights. Emission rights and associated provisions are derecognised when disposed. Any profit or loss represents the costs of purchasing additional rights to cover excess emissions, the sale of unused rights in the case realised emission are under emission rights received free of charge or the impairment of unused emission rights.\n\n## 2.4  Earnings per share and dividend\n\nOn 2 February 2023, UPM's Board of Directors revised the company's dividend policy to be based on earnings instead of cash flow. According to new dividend policy, the company aims to pay attractive dividends, targeting at least half of the comparable earnings per share over time.\n\nThe dividend paid in 2023 were EUR 800 million (EUR 1.50 per share) which is 158% of the operating cash flow per share and in 2022 EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share). The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 800 million, EUR 1.50 per share, will be paid in respect of 2023. The proposed dividend represents 107% of UPM's comparable earnings per share for the year 2023.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n180\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n| EURm                                                       | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit attributable to owners of the parent  company, EURm | 388     | 1,526   |\n| Weighted average no. of shares (1,000)                     | 533,324 | 533,324 |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                              | 0.73    | 2.86    |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                            | 0.73    | 2.86    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of profit for the period attributable to each share.

The amount of the incentive is linked to the executive's position and achievement of annually set targets. The maximum incentives amount to a total of 110% of the annual base salary to the Business Area Executives and to a total of 90% of annual base salary to the other members of the Group Executive Team. For the President and CEO, the maximum annual incentive amounts to 150% of the annual base salary.\n\nThe expenses recognised in income statement in respect of sharebased payments for the Group Executive Team were EUR 4.3 million (3.6 million).\n\nAccording to the service agreement, the UPM's President and CEO Jussi Pesonen would have been entitled to retire in November 2020 at the age of 60 but at the request of the company's Board of Directors, the President and CEO decided to continue in his position longer. In accordance with the terms of his service contract, President and CEO Jussi Pesonen announced that he will exercise his right to retire from UPM in during 2024. In October 2023, Massimo Reynaudo was appointed to President and CEO of UPM-Kymmene Corporation as of 1 January 2024. Jussi Pesonen continued as the President and CEO until 31 December 2023, after which he will work as an advisor to the Company and its management until he will retire from UPM on 30 April, 2024.\n\nThe President and CEO Jussi Pesonen has a voluntary pension benefit in addition to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The\n\n## 3.3  Share-based payments\n\nUPM offers rewards and recognition with an emphasis on high performance. All UPM's employees belong to a unified annual Short Term Incentive (STI) scheme. In addition, in 2023 and 2022 UPM had two long-term incentive schemes: the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n182\n\nvoluntary pension benefit was arranged through a defined benefit plan until the end of November 2020. The last contribution to the defined benefit plan was made in 2020. Under the defined benefit plan, the target pension was 60% of the average indexed earnings from the last ten full calendar years of employment calculated according to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The income of the President and CEO Jussi Pesonen's defined benefit pension plan in 2023 was EUR 0.7 million (0.5 million in 2022). The plan assets amounted to EUR 10.4 million (10.8 million) and the obligation amounted to EUR 9.7 million (9.6 million). As of December 2020, the voluntary pension benefit is arranged through a defined contribution plan. First contribution to the defined contribution plan took place in 2021.\n\nThe retirement age of other members of the Group Executive Team is 65 or 63 for executives who have become Group Executive Team members before December 2023. They are covered by the statutory pension plan in the country of residence, supplemented by voluntary defined contribution pension plans. For other GET members, the period for severance pay is 12 months, in addition to the six months' salary for the notice period, unless notice is given for reasons that are solely attributable to the executive. Should a GET member give notice of termination to the company, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the notice period.\n\nThe UPM's new President and CEO Massimo Reynaudo's retirement age is 65 years. He has a voluntary pension benefit to supplement the Finnish statutory pension scheme (TyEL). The voluntary pension benefit is arranged through a defined contribution plan. Should the company give notice of termination of the President and CEO Massimo Reynaudo's service agreement, severance pay of 12 months base salary will be paid in addition to the salary for the 12-month notice period. Should the President and CEO give notice of termination to the company, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the notice period.\n\nIf there is a change of control in the company, the President and CEO may terminate his service agreement within three months and each GET member within one month from closing the takeover and shall receive compensation equivalent to 24 months' base salary.\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nThe Performance Share Plan (PSP) is targeted at the President and CEO and other Group Executive Team (GET) members as well as other selected members of the management. Under the PSP 2020-2022 and PSP 2021-2023 UPM shares are awarded based on total shareholder return during a three-year earning period. Total shareholder return takes into account share price appreciation and paid dividends.\n\nThe performance measures for the PSP 2022-2024 and PSP 20232025 comprise the total shareholder return (80% weighting) and selected environmental, social and governance related (ESG) measures. In all plans, the earned shares are delivered after the earning period has ended .\n\n| PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS                 | PSP 2020-2022                    | PSP 2021-2023                    | PSP 2022-2024                                 | PSP 2023-2025                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| No. of participants at 31 December 2023 | 25                               | 22                               | 24                                            | 24                                            |\n| Actual achievement                      | 100 %                            | 34.62 %                          | -                                             | -                                             |\n| Max no. of shares to be delivered  1)   |                                  |                                  |                                               |                                               |\n| to the President and CEO Jussi Pesonen  | 85,589                           | 28,829                           | 80,870                                        | 75,802                                        |\n| to other members of GET                 | 272,500                          | 89,562                           | 279,000                                       | 265,000                                       |\n| to other selected members of management | 160,200                          | 42,272                           | 138,500                                       | 125,500                                       |\n| Total max no. of shares to be delivered | 518,289                          | 160,663                          | 498,370                                       | 466,302                                       |\n| Share delivery (year)                   | 2023                             | 2024                             | 2025                                          | 2026                                          |\n| Earning criteria (weighting)            | Total shareholder  return (100%) | Total shareholder  return (100%) | Total shareholder  return (80%) ESG (20%)  2) | Total shareholder  return (80%) ESG (20%)  3) |\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan\n\nThe Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) is targeted at other selected key employees and it consists of annually commencing plans. Each plan consists of a one-year earning period and a two-year restriction period.\n\nUPM shares are awarded based on achievement of group or group and business area EBITDA targets. Prior to share delivery, the share rewards earned are adjusted with dividends and other capital distributions, if any, paid to all shareholders during the restriction period.\n\n| DEFERRED BONUS PLANS                                            | DBP 2020                    | DBP 2021                    | DBP 2022                    | DBP 2023                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| No. of participants (at grant)                                  | 393                         | 428                         | 451                         | 446                         |\n| No. of participants (at 31 December 2023)                       | 330                         | 350                         | 398                         | 431                         |\n| Max no. of shares to be delivered (at grant)                    | 429,558                     | 459,912                     | 487,130                     | 477,052                     |\n| Estimated no. of shares to be delivered at 31 December 2023  1) | 141,642                     | 355,032                     | 388,173                     | 48,806                      |\n| Share delivery (year)                                           | 2023                        | 2024                        | 2025                        | 2026                        |\n| Earning criteria                                                | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA | Group/Business Area  EBITDA |\n\nThe indicated actuals and estimates of the share rewards under the Performance Share Plan and the Deferred Bonus Plan represent the gross amount of the rewards of which the applicable taxes will be deducted before the shares are delivered to the participants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group's long-term share incentive plans are recognised as equitysettled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions depending on the settlement.

In 2023, net retirement benefit liability of EUR 36 million of UPM-Kymmene Austria GmbH is presented in liabilities related to assets held for sale, \u00bb Refer note  8.4 , and consists of unfunded obligations. In 2022, the most significant defined benefit plan in Finland (UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6) was replaced with defined contribution arrangement. Following the replacement, UPM's most significant defined benefit arrangements are in the UK and in Germany. The group has defined benefit obligations also in Holland, France, Canada and in the US.\n\n## Finland\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). TyEL provides the employee with insurance protection for old age, disability and death.\n\nGroup's Finnish employees are mainly insured with an insurance company and these arrangements qualify as defined contributions plans. Previously part of group's Finnish employees were insured with TyEL foundation (UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6) which was classified as a defined benefit plan. In 2022, TyEL foundation was replaced with\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n184\n\ndefined contribution arrangement. The assets and liabilities of the plan were transferred to the insurance company and the group recognised EUR 69 million settlement loss in the income statement. The cash received on the settlement amounted to EUR 128 million.\n\n## UK\n\nIn the UK, the group operates a legacy defined benefit scheme providing benefits that are linked to the salary level near retirement age or an earlier date of leaving service. The scheme is closed both for new members and future accrual for old members. Part of the scheme is a defined contribution plan and is open to all current employees. The UK pension scheme operates under a single trust which is independent from the group.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn Germany employees within defined benefit arrangements are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on their service and final salary. All significant defined benefit plans are closed for new employees.\n\n## Present value of obligation and fair value of plan assets\n\n|                                                                                       | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2023   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2023   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2023   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2022   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2022   | Pension and other  post-employment benefits 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| EURm                                                                                  | PRESENT  VALUE OF  OBLIGATION                      | FAIR VALUE  OF PLAN  ASSETS                        | NET DEFINED  BENEFIT  LIABILITY/  (ASSET)          | PRESENT VALUE OF  OBLIGATION                       | FAIR VALUE  OF PLAN  ASSETS                        | NET DEFINED  BENEFIT  LIABILITY/  (ASSET)          |\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                                                          | 850                                                | -340                                               | 510                                                | 1,790                                              | -1,214                                             | 576                                                |\n| Current service cost                                                                  | 5                                                  | -

The asset values of UK arrangements constitute 91% of total asset values in defined benefit plans within group.\n\n## Interest risk\n\nDiscount rates used in calculations are based on high-quality corporate bond yield curves in currency in which the benefits are paid. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan liabilities. The maturities of yields are reflecting the durations of the underlying obligations. The weighted average duration of group's defined benefit obligation is 14 years (14 years) at the end of 2023.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nIn the UK, the pensions in payment are tied to Retail Price Index whilst being tied to Consumer Price Index during deferment. An increase of 0.5% in indexes will increase the liabilities by approximately EUR 17 million. In Germany the pensions have to be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n185\n\n## Salary risk\n\nThe present value of the net retirement benefit assets and liabilities is calculated by reference to the expected future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the salary of the plan participants would increase the plan liabilities. In the UK, the changes in salary levels have no impact on the funding position as all defined benefit arrangements in the UK are closed to future accrual. In Germany, an increase of 0.5% in expected future salaries would increase the obligation by EUR 6 million.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nAdjustments in mortality assumption have an impact on group's defined benefit obligation. An increase in life expectancy by one year will increase the obligation in the UK by EUR 12 million and in Germany by EUR 17 million.",

Statistical information used may differ materially from actual results due to, among others,\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nchanging market and economic conditions, or changes in service period of plan participants. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may affect the future amounts of the defined benefit obligation and future expense.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe weighted average principal assumptions used in the valuations of the defined benefit obligations are detailed below:\n\n|                                                           |   FINLAND |   FINLAND | UK   | UK   |   GERMANY |   GERMANY | OTHER COUNTRIES   |   OTHER COUNTRIES |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                           |   2023    |   2022    | 2023 | 2022 |   2023    |   2022    | 2023              |           2022    |\n| Discount rate %                                           |      3.11 |      3.25 | 4.55 | 4.80 |      3.26 |      3.32 | 4.16              |              3.67 |\n| Inflation rate %                                          |      2.13 |      2.53 | 3.10 | 3.25 |      2    |      2    | 2.28              |              2.51 |\n| Rate of salary increase %                                 |      1.89 |      2.23 | -    | -    |      2.5  |      2.5  | 2.50              |              2.87 |\n| Rate of pension increase %                                |      1.44 |      1.77 | 3.00 | 3.15 |      2    |      2    | -                 |              1.13 |\n| Expected average remaining working years of  participants |      1    |      1.9  | 8.8  | 9.5  |      8.1  |      8    | 11.5              |              9    |\n\n| EURm                       |   0.5% INCREASE |   0.5% INCREASE | 0.5% DECREASE   | 0.5% DECREASE   |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                            |            2023 |            2022 | 2023            | 2022            |\n| Discount rate %            |             -50 |             -52 | 54              | 57              |\n| Rate of salary increase %  |               6 |               7 | -6              | -7              |\n| Rate of pension increase % |              40 |              39 | -37             | -38             |\n| Life expectancy +1 year    |              29 |              29 | -               | -               |\n\nA negative change indicates a decrease in the defined benefit obligation.

The defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the term of the related pension liability. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement as employee costs so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees. Changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs and gains or losses on settlement are recognised immediately in income when they occur.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, contributions are paid to pension insurance companies. Once the contributions have been paid, there are no further payment obligations. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.\n\n## Other post-employment obligations\n\nSome group companies provide post-employment medical and other benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to healthcare benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Valuations of these obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n187",

The investment includes new production lines, new workspaces and 720 square metres of completely new production space. The investment was completed in Q3 2023.\n\nIn January 2020, UPM announced that it would invest in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany. The facility is scheduled to start up by the end of 2024, and the total investment estimate is EUR 1,180 million.\n\nIn January 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in the refurbishment of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant in Finland. The average annual production of the Kuusankoski plant is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. The investment was completed in Q1 2023.\n\nIn July 2019, UPM announced that it would invest in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros, central\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n188\n\nUruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest in port operations in Montevideo and in local investments outside the mill fence. The mill began its operations on 15 April 2023 after the final authorisation to operate was granted. The total investment was USD 3.47 billion.\n\n## Capitalised borrowing costs\n\nIn 2023, the borrowing costs capitalised as part of non-current assets amounted to EUR 38 million (20 million). Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs was EUR 2 million (1 million) and the average interest rate used 3.00% (0.79%), which represents the average costs to finance the projects. In 2023, capitalised borrowing costs were mainly related to the construction of the new pulp mill in Uruguay and the biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna.\n\n## Government grants\n\nIn 2023, government grants recognised as deduction of non-current assets totalled to EUR 7 million (15 million). Grants relate mainly to the biochemicals biorefinery investment in Leuna.\n\n## Major capital commitments at 31 December\n\n| EURm                      |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| New biorefinery / Germany |    363 |    257 |\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nIn 2023, impairment charges  mainly relate to the closure of UPM Plattling mill in Germany.\n\nIn 2022, impairment charges relate to property, plant and equipment impacted by Russia's war in Ukraine. Due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, UPM recognised a write off of all property, plant and equipment as well as operating assets and uninsured receivables locating or relating to operations in these countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. Costs of assets of acquired in business combinations are determined at fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment charges, if any. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet represents the cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.\n\nMajor renovations are capitalised and depreciated over the useful lives of the related asset. Ordinary expenses for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively.\n\n| ASSESSED USEFUL LIVES             | NUMBER OF YEARS   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Land, not subject to depreciation | -                 |\n| Buildings                         | 20-50             |\n| Power plants                      | 20-30             |\n| Heavy machinery                   | 15-20             |\n| Light machinery                   | 10-15             |\n| Equipment                         | 5                 |\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nCarrying values of individual items included in property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. The carrying value is written down immediately to the asset's recoverable amount if the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n189\n\nNon-financial assets, other than goodwill, that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount will not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe estimations of useful lives, residual value as well as depreciation and amortisation methods require significant management judgement and are reviewed annually. Management makes estimates on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect valuations.\n\nThe long useful lives of assets, changes in estimated future sales prices of products, changes in product costs and changes in the discount rates used could lead to significant impairment charges.\n\nEstimates are also made in an acquisition when determining the fair values and remaining useful lives of acquired intangible and tangible assets.",

The value of forest assets, i.e. standing trees, amounted to EUR 2,355 million (2,442 million) at the end of 2023.\n\n| EURm                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January   | 2,442  | 2,328  |\n| Additions                      | 50     | 79     |\n| Disposals                      | -10    | -16    |\n| Wood harvested                 | -184   | -143   |\n| Net change in fair value       | 81     | 153    |\n| Translation differences        | -25    | 40     |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December | 2,355  | 2,442  |\n\nChange in fair value, change due to harvesting and gains or losses on sale of forest assets are recognised in the income statement as a net amount amounting to EUR -103 million (12 million) in 2023. In 2023, the change in fair value of forest assets in Finland was impacted by higher discount rate which was partly offset by higher stumpage price estimates.\n\n## Forest assets\n\n| EURm                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Forest assets in Finland       | 1,621  | 1,702  |\n| Forest assets in Uruguay       | 720    | 724    |\n| Forest assets in United States | 13     | 15     |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December | 2,355  | 2,442  |\n\n## Forest land\n\nForest land is included in land and water areas within property, plant and equipment. \u00bb Refer Note 4.1 Property, Plant and equipment. At the end of 2023, carrying value of own forest land amounted to EUR 715 million (EUR 736 million) and leased forest land EUR 231 million (EUR 243 million).\n\nUPM's own and leased forest land areas are summarised in below table.\n\n|                      | PRO-         | PRO-                  | PRO-           |\n|----------------------|--------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n| 1,000 ha             | FOREST  LAND | DUCTIVE  FOREST  LAND | FORESTED  LAND |\n|                      | 523          | 430                   | 421            |\n| Finland Uruguay      | 304          | 182                   | 177            |\n| Uruguay, leased land | 170          | 138                   | 131            |\n| United States        | 76           | 55                    | 55             |\n| Total                | 1,073        | 805                   | 784            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group divides all its forest assets for accounting purposes into growing forests, which are recognised as forest assets at fair value less costs to sell, and land. Own land is stated at cost whereas leased land is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n190\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nAny changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in the operating profit in the income statement. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows considering existing, sustainable harvesting plans and assessments regarding growth, timber prices, harvesting and silviculture costs and selling expenses. The fair value of forest assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation\n\nThe valuation process of forest assets is complex and requires management estimates and judgement on assumptions that have a significant impact on the valuation of the group's forest assets.\n\nMain factors used in the fair valuation of forest assets are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates. Stumpage price forecasts are based on the current prices adjusted by the management's estimates for the full remaining productive lives of the trees, up to 100 years for forests in Finland and in the US and up to 10 years for plantations in Uruguay. The cash flows are adjusted by selling costs and costs related to future risks. Felling revenues and maintenance costs are estimated on the basis of actual costs and prices, taking into account the group's projection of future price and costs development. In addition, calculations take into account future forest growth and environmental restrictions.\n\nThe pre-tax discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Finnish forests in 2023 was 9.5% (8.0%) and for Uruguayan plantations 11.5% (11.0%). A decrease (increase) of one percentage point in discount rate would increase (decrease) the fair value of forest assets by approximately EUR 214 million (257 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.3\n\n## Energy shareholdings\n\nUPM is both a significant purchaser and producer of energy. The majority of electrical and thermal energy is consumed at the group's pulp and paper production. The production is mainly carried out by energy companies in which UPM has energy shareholdings. Energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments. UPM does not have control or joint control of or significant influence in the said energy companies.\n\nThe value of energy shareholdings amounted to EUR 2,283 million (3,652 million) at the end of 2023. These energy companies supply electricity or both electricity and heat to their shareholders on a costprice principle (Mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nIn 2020, UPM issued a shareholder loan of EUR 47 million without a maturity date to PVO. Embedded into the loan terms is a right to issue new shares in the PVO B2 series against the remaining, unpaid nominal of the loan starting from 2021. The loan is valued at fair value and is taken into account as a part of the total fair valuation of the PVO B2 series valuation.\n\n## Energy shareholdings\n\n|                                | Number of shares   | Group holding %   | Carrying value, EURm   | Carrying value, EURm   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                |                    |                   | 2023                   | 2022                   |\n| Pohjolan Voima Oyj, A series   | 8,176,191          | 61.24             | 507                    | 584                    |\n| Pohjolan Voima Oyj, B series   | 4,140,132          | 58.11             | 1,302                  | 2,016                  |\n| Pohjolan Voima Oyj, B2 series  | 2,869,819          | 51.22             | 0                      | 454                    |\n| Kemijoki Oy                    | 179,189            | 7.33              | 345                    | 442                    |\n| L\u00e4nsi-Suomen Voima Oy          | 10,220             | 51.10             | 124                    | 150                    |\n| Other                          | -                  | -                 | 5                      | 5                      |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December |                    |                   | 2,283                  | 3,652                  |\n\nPVO's share capital is divided into different series of shares. The B and B2 series relate to PVO's shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). UPM has no direct shareholdings in TVO. TVO operates three nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1, Olkiluoto 2 and Olkiluoto 3) in Finland. The operation of a nuclear power plant is governed by international, European Union and local nuclear regulatory regimes. Pursuant to the Finnish Nuclear Liability Act, the operator of a nuclear facility has a strict third-party liability in relation to nuclear accidents. Shareholders of power companies that own and operate nuclear power plants are not subject to the liability under the Nuclear Liability Act. In Finland, the future costs of conditioning, storage and final disposal of spent fuel, management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste as well as nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by a state established fund (the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund). The contributions to the Fund are intended to be sufficient to cover estimated future costs. These contributions have been taken into consideration in the fair value of the related energy shareholdings.\n\n## Changes in energy shareholdings\n\n| EURm                                                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                                    | 3,652  | 2,579  |\n| Disposals                                                       | -      | -2     |\n| Changes in fair value recognised in other  comprehensive income | -1,369 | 1,074  |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                                  | 2,283  | 3,652  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group has made an irrevocable election to designate its energy shareholdings as equity instruments where changes in fair value are recognised through OCI. The shareholdings are not held for trading as the group has an intention to hold the investments for the long term. Purchases of energy shareholdings are initially and subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable, with only dividend income recognised through profit and loss. Initial fair value is acquisition cost including transaction costs. Upon disposal of the investment, the accumulated fair value changes in equity are not recycled to the income statement but instead, are reclassified from the fair value reserve to retained earnings.\n\nThe fair value of energy shareholdings is a level 3 measure in the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n191\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation and sensitivity\n\nValuation of energy shareholdings requires management's assumptions and estimates of a number of factors that may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset. Fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis and the main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends and discount rates. Changes in regulatory environment or taxation may also have an impact on the value of the energy generating assets. The valuation process is carried out by UPM Energy and the results are reviewed by management.\n\nThe electricity price estimate is based on future electricity forward prices and a simulation of the Finnish area electricity price. A change of 5% in the electricity price used in the model would change the total value of the assets by EUR 180 (390) million. The discount rate of 8.01% (7.13%) used in the valuation model is determined using the weighted average cost of capital method. A change of 0.5% percentage points in the discount rate would change the estimated fair value of the assets by approximately EUR 100 (230) million.\n\nUPM's indirect share of the capacity of Olkiluoto 3 EPR is approximately 31%, through its PVO B2 shares, and on 16 April 2023 TVO announced that OL3 is ready. Test production has been completed and regular electricity production started on 16 April 2023.\n\nThe decrease in fair value during reporting period was mainly due to the decrease in electricity forward market prices and the increase in discount rate.",

The values of water rights were tested based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydro power plant.\n\nGoodwill impairment tests were carried out for pulp operations in Finland and Uruguay, belonging to UPM Fibres business area, UPM Raflatac business area, UPM Plywood business area and UPM Biochemicals business in Other operations.\n\nThe 2023 impairment tests did not result in a recognition of any impairment.\n\nThe basis for valuation and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing are summarised in below table:\n\n| CASH GENERATING UNIT    | BASIS OF  VALUATION Value in use   | PERIOD OF FORECAST        | PRE-TAX DISCOUNT RATE   | KEY ASSUMPTIONS Pulp price, wood costs   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Pulp operations Finland |                                    | 10 years + terminal value | 10.68% (2022: 10.84%)   |                                          |\n| Pulp operations Uruguay | Value in use                       | 10 years + terminal value | 9.61% (2022: 9.30%)     | Pulp price, wood costs                   |\n| UPM Raflatac            | Value in use                       | 10 years + terminal value | 10.05% (2022: 9.48%)    | Product prices, cost development         |\n| UPM Plywood             | Value in use                       | 10 years + terminal value | 12.06% (2022: 15.77%)   | Product prices, cost development         |\n| UPM Biochemicals        | Value in use                       | 10 years + terminal value | 10.20% (2022: n/a)      | Product prices, cost development         |\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nThe sensitivity analyses of goodwill impairment tests indicate that no reasonable change in key assumptions would result in recognition of impairment loss against goodwill. In pulp operations the recoverable amount is most sensitive to pulp sales prices and the cost of wood raw material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group's assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life assets requires significant judgement.\n\nWhile management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and operational conditions. Actual cash flows could therefore vary from estimated discounted future cash flows and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Future cash flows\n\nThe review of recoverable amount for goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using management projections of future cash flows. The most important assessments and assumptions needed in calculations are forecasts for future growth rates for the business in question, product prices, cost development and the discount rates applied. The group is using ten-year forecasts in calculations as the nature of the group's business is long-term, due to its capital intensity, and is exposed to cyclical changes. In estimates of product prices and cost development, forecasts prepared by management for the next three years and estimates made for the following seven years are taken into consideration. In addition, consideration is given to the investment decisions made by the group as well as the profitability programmes that the group has implemented and the views of knowledgeable industry experts on the long-term development of demand and prices. In the projection of cash flows UPM uses EBITDA adjusted with cash flows not captured within EBITDA, including working capital movements and capital expenditures. An assumed terminal value is based on a EBITDA multiples six times, except for UPM Biochemicals for which perpetuity value is determined using inflation based 2% growth rate.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n193\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate is estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the calculation date adjusted for risks specific to the business in question. The adjusted after-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each cash generating unit (CGU) based on the specific tax rate applicable to where the CGU operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises in connection with business combinations where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment and is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies from the business combination.\n\n## Intangible rights\n\nIntangible rights include water rights of hydropower plants, patents, licences, intellectual property and similar rights. Water rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as the company has a contractual right to exploit water resources in the energy production of power plants.\n\nThe values of water rights are tested annually for impairment based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydropower plant. Other intangible rights are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred in acquiring software that will contribute to future period financial benefit are capitalised to software and systems. Other intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes the group identifies its cash-generating units (CGUs), which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a business area. The carrying amount for the CGU includes goodwill, non-current assets and working capital. If the balance sheet carrying amount of the CGU unit\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nexceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nOther intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount of the asset is less than the carrying amount. The carrying amount of the asset is then reduced to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.\n\n## 4.5  Provisions\n\n-1\n\n| EURm                                | RESTRUCTURING   | TERMINATION   | ENVIRON- MENTAL   | EMISSIONS   | OTHER   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| 2023                                |                 |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 14              | 22            | 29                | 53          | 15      | 134     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 53              | 129           | 2                 | 69          | 5       | 258     |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -6              | -30           | -3                | -65         | -12     | -116    |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -1              | -4            | -2                | -           | -2      | -10     |\n| Reclassifications                   | -1              | -             | 1                 | -1          | -       |         |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 59              | 117           | 27                | 56          | 6       | 266     |\n| Non-current                         |                 |               |                   |             |         | 170     |\n| Current                             |                 |               |                   |             |         | 96      |\n| Total                               |                 |               |                   |             |         | 266     |\n| 2022                                |                 |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 24              | 36            | 30                | 39          | 26      | 155     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 5               | 11            | 11                | 69          | 21      | 117     |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -12             | -23           | -1                | -54         | -30     | -121    |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -3              | -2            | -11               | -           | -2      | -18     |\n| Reclassifications                   | -               | -             | -                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 14              | 22            | 29                | 53          | 15      | 134     |\n| Non-current                         |                 |               |                   |             |         | 64      |\n| Current                             |                 |               |                   |             |         | 70      |\n| Total                               |                 |               |                   |             |         | 134     |\n\nUPM has undergone several restructuring in recent years including mill closures and profit improvement programs. Restructuring provisions recognised include various restructuring activities including dismantling costs. Termination provisions include severance payments, unemployment compensations or other arrangements for employees leaving the company. In Finland termination provisions include also unemployment arrangements and disability pensions. Unemployment provisions in Finland are recognised 2-3 years before the granting and settlement of the compensation.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022, restructuring and termination provisions relate mainly to capacity closures and optimisation of operations in UPM Communication Papers business area. In 2023, additions to restructuring and termination provisions of EUR 143 million relate to closure of UPM Plattling paper mill and paper machine 6 at UPM Schongau paper mill. In 2022, there were no significant additions to restructuring and termination provisions.\n\nThe group recognises provisions for normal environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred in a future period upon a removal of non-current assets and restoring industrial landfills where a legal or constructive obligation exists. In 2022, the group recognised EUR 8 million additional environmental provision related to prior capacity closures in Finland.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n194\n\nOther provisions are mainly attributable to onerous contracts and will be incurred over a period longer than one year. In 2022, additions to other provisions include EUR 10 relating to tax dispute.\n\nProvisions for emissions include liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights. The group possesses emission rights amounting to EUR 256 million (235 million) as intangible assets.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 2.3 Operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights.\n\ncan be reasonably estimated. Due to inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the actual losses may differ significantly from the originally estimated provision.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 9.2 Litigation for details of legal contingencies.\n\n## 4.6  Working capital\n\nThe group defines operating working capital as inventories, trade receivables, trade payables and advances received which are presented separately below. The performance obligations related to advances received are typically fulfilled within 12 months of receipt of the advance. UPM is focusing on working capital efficiency and targeting a sustainable and permanent reduction in operating working capital.\n\n## Operating working capital\n\n| EURm              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Inventories       | 1,948  | 2,289  |\n| Trade receivables | 1,254  | 1,614  |\n| Trade payables    | -1,297 | -1,855 |\n| Advances received | -22    | -23    |\n| Total             | 1,883  | 2,026  |\n\n## Inventories\n\n| EURm                          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Raw materials and consumables | 1,027  | 1,128  |\n| Work in progress              | 6      | 11     |\n| Finished products and goods   | 885    | 1,116  |\n| Advance payments              | 31     | 34     |\n| Total                         | 1,948  | 2,289  |\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\n| EURm                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade receivables                       |        |        |\n| Trade receivables                       | 1,284  | 1,647  |\n| Loss allowance provision                | -30    | -32    |\n| Total trade receivables                 | 1,254  | 1,614  |\n| Prepayments and accrued income          |        |        |\n| Personnel expenses                      | 2      | 2      |\n| Interest income                         | 1      | 1      |\n| Energy and other excise taxes           | 11     | 15     |\n| Other items                             | 118    | 158    |\n| Total prepayments and accrued income    | 133    | 176    |\n| Other receivables                       |        |        |\n| VAT and other indirect taxes receivable | 155    | 326    |\n| Cash collaterals                        | 187    | 500    |\n| Other receivables                       | 53     | 80     |\n| Total other receivables                 | 395    | 906    |\n| Total                                   | 1,782  | 2,696  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nA provision is recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\n## Restructuring and termination provisions\n\nA restructuring provisions is recognised when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when the plan has been communicated to those who are affected. Employee termination provisions are recognised when the group has communicated the plan to the employees.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed. The recognition of environmental provisions is based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations. Such provisions are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located. The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised and subsequently depreciated as part of the asset. Provisions do not include any third-party recoveries.\n\n## Emission provisions\n\nEmission obligations are recognised in provisions based on realised emissions. The provision is measured at the carrying amounts of the corresponding emission rights held, which are recognised as intangible assets. In case of deficit in emission rights, the shortage is valued at the market value at the balance sheet date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nThe estimates used in determining the provisions are based on the expenses incurred for similar activities in the current reporting period taking into account the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account of any such changes. The discount rate applied is reviewed annually.\n\nThe group aims to operate in compliance with regulations related to the treatment of waste water, air emissions and landfill sites. However, expected events during production processes and waste treatment could cause material losses and additional costs in the group's operations.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nManagement judgement is required in measurement and recognition of provisions related to pending litigation. Provisions are recorded when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event, an unfavourable outcome is probable and the amount of loss\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n195",

The group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding trade receivables, days of sales outstanding (DSO) and overdue trade receivables are followed on monthly basis. Potential concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables are limited due to the large number and the geographic dispersion of customers. Customer credit limits are established and monitored, and ongoing evaluations of their financial condition is performed. The group has trade credit insurances to protect accounts receivables from significant credit losses. In certain market areas, including Asia and Northern Africa, measures to reduce credit risks include letters of credit, prepayments and bank guarantees. Maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking into account any credit enhancements, is the carrying amount of trade and other receivables.\n\nUPM does not have significant concentration of customer credit risk. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately 19% (17%) of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2023 - i.e., approximately EUR 239 million (269 million).\n\nIn 2023, trade receivables amounting to EUR 5 million (2 million) were subject to permanent write-off and the loss was recognised under other costs and expenses. In accordance with the group's accounting policy, trade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. In 2022, due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, the group increased the general provision for expected credit losses on trade\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n196\n\nreceivables, and impaired inventories and other receivables. As at 31 December 2022, the credit loss provision related to operations in Russia was EUR 8 million, impairment related to inventories EUR 10 million and impairment related to other receivables EUR 5 million. As a result of the sale of Russian operations in March 2023, there were no such credit loss provisions or impairments recognised as at 31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the method most appropriate to the particular nature of inventory, the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance is established for inventory obsolescence.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade receivables arising from selling goods and services in the normal course of business are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowance provision. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of 14-60 days, which is consistent with market practice.\n\nThe group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. The group has recognised two types of provisions for trade receivables - a general provision for lifetime expected credit losses and a provision for specified individual trade receivables, both of which are charged to the income statement. The group uses a provision matrix for estimating lifetime expected credit losses where trade receivables are segregated by businesses. The provision matrix is based on historical observed default rates, adjusted by forward looking information. It takes into account trade credit insurances, payment profile of customers and the factor that as debts get older they are more likely not to be paid. Additionally, the group recognises a provision individually for outstanding trade receivables where specific debtor information is available. In these cases there must be objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.\n\nTrade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The customer entering into\n\nbankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or finalising such proceedings, or entering into debt-restructuring are considered indicators that the trade receivables are no longer expected to be recovered. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the receivables.\n\nOther receivables consist mainly of cash collaterals pledged for commodity contracts and interest rate futures. The fair value equals to the amount of cash pledged as collateral. The cash collaterals cover the counterparties' losses in case UPM is unable to meet its obligations.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade payables arise from purchase of inventories, fixed assets and goods and services in the ordinary course of business from UPM's suppliers. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if they are due to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business or within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the payables.\n\nThe group is recognising refund liability for expected volume and other discounts arising from contracts with customers. Customer rebates include mainly volume discounts and are recognised as equal to an amount which is most likely to be paid to the customer. The carrying amount of expected customer rebates is updated at each reporting date, using the latest forecast data available.\n\nCustomer claims relating to quality complaints are accounted for as revenue related refund liability. Expected customer claims are estimated based on historical data and the amount of refund liability is updated at each reporting date. Customer claims and customer rebates are typically expected to realise within the next 12 months.\n\nAdvances received are recognised as contract liability until the performance obligation is fulfilled.\n\n## 5.  Capital structure\n\nUPM has a strong cash flow and industry-leading balance sheet that mitigates risks and enables value-enhancing strategic actions.\n\n## Net debt\n\nEUR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(EUR 2374m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.1  Capital management\n\nUPM's objective for managing capital comprising of net debt and total equity is to ensure maintenance of flexible capital structure to enable the ability to operate in capital markets and maintain optimal returns to shareholders. The group manages its financing activities, debt portfolio and financial resources via various policies that are designed to ensure optimum financing arrangements minimising simultaneously financial expenses and refinancing risk and optimising liquidity. Borrowing activities are centralised to the parent to the extent possible and cash resources are distributed within the group by the central treasury department.\n\nUPM targets a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 times or less.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n197\n\n## UPM's capital\n\n| EURm                                                          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of the parent  company          | 11,161 | 12,502 |\n| Non-controlling interest                                      | 370    | 376    |\n| Total equity                                                  | 11,531 | 12,879 |\n| Non-current debt                                              | 3,056  | 4,476  |\n| Current debt                                                  | 327    | 558    |\n| Debt held for sale                                            | 2      | 0      |\n| Total debt                                                    | 3,385  | 5,034  |\n| Total capitalisation                                          | 14,916 | 17,913 |\n| Total debt                                                    | 3,385  | 5,034  |\n| Less: Interest-bearing financial assets and  investment funds | 906    | 2,660  |\n| Less: Interest-bearing financial assets held for sale         | 47     | 0      |\n| Net debt                                                      | 2,432  | 2,374  |\n| Gearing ratio, %  1)                                          | 21     | 18     |\n| Net debt to EBITDA  1)                                        | 1.55   | 0.94   |\n\n1) Refer \u00bb Other financial information on Alternative performance measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing risk\n\nUnder all circumstances, UPM seeks to maintain adequate liquidity, which depends on a number of factors, such as the availability of cash flows from operations and access to additional debt and equity financing. UPM aims to ensure sufficient liquidity by means of efficient cash management and restricting financial investments to investment types that can readily be converted into cash and by keeping a sufficient amount of unused committed credit lines or cash as a reserve. UPM aims to minimise refinancing risks by ensuring a balanced loan portfolio maturing schedule and sufficiently long maturities. The average loan maturity at 31 December 2023 was 5.1 years (4.6 years).\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing\n\n| EURm                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at bank                            | 613    | 1,632  |\n| Cash equivalents                        | 19     | 434    |\n| Cash classified as assets held for sale | 39     | 0      |\n| Investment funds                        | 1      | 1      |\n| Committed credit lines                  | 2,909  | 5,709  |\n| of which used                           | -      | -1,378 |\n| Loan commitments                        | -      | -123   |\n| Used uncommitted credit lines           | -182   | -444   |\n| Long-term loan repayment cash flow      | -114   | -94    |\n| Debt held for sale                      | -2     | 0      |\n| Liquidity                               | 3,284  | 5,738  |\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at banks and with original maturities of three months or less.

In 2023, net debt increased by EUR 58 million. Net debt totalled EUR 2,432 million (2,374 million) at the end of 2023.\n\nIn 2020, UPM established a EUR 3 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme and launched a Green Finance Framework that aligns with the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles. UPM has since issued three Green Bonds, totalling EUR 1,750 million. The independent second party opinion concerning the framework was provided by CICERO Shades of Green, and UPM's framework was rated with the highest-grade, CICERO Dark Green. In November 2023, UPM published an updated Green Finance Framework, which was reviewed by S&P Global Ratings. The new framework also received the highest 'Dark Green' overall shading.\n\nThe proceeds from the Green Bonds have been allocated in accordance with the Green Finance Framework to eligible green projects and assets in the following categories: sustainable forest management, climate-positive products and solutions, and hydropower. The bonds do not have any financial covenants and all issued euro bonds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin.\n\n## Net debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n200\n\n## Net debt\n\n| EURm                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bonds                                 | 2,002  | 1,974  |\n| Loans from financial institutions     | 188    | 1,604  |\n| Lease liabilities                     | 612    | 583    |\n| Derivatives                           | 94     | 137    |\n| Other loans                           | 160    | 179    |\n| Non-current debt                      | 3,056  | 4,476  |\n| Repayments of non-current debt        | 20     | 9      |\n| Repayments of lease liabilities       | 94     | 84     |\n| Derivatives                           | 33     | 24     |\n| Other liabilities                     | 180    | 441    |\n| Current debt                          | 327    | 558    |\n| Debt held for sale                    | 2      | 0      |\n| Total debt                            | 3,385  | 5,034  |\n| Loan receivables                      | 4      | 4      |\n| Derivatives                           | 51     | 61     |\n| Other receivables                     | 17     | 19     |\n| Non-current interest-bearing assets   | 71     | 84     |\n| Loan receivables                      | 1      | 0      |\n| Derivatives                           | 14     | 9      |\n| Other receivables                     | 187    | 500    |\n| Investment funds                      | 1      | 1      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | 632    | 2,067  |\n| Current interest-bearing assets       | 835    | 2,576  |\n| Interest-bearing assets held for sale | 47     | 0      |\n| Total interest-bearing assets         | 953    | 2,660  |\n| Net debt                              | 2,432  | 2,374  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt comprising of bonds, bank and pension loans, lease liabilities and other loans is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the estimated life of the borrowing. UPM classifies debt as non-current unless due for settlement within a year. Most of the debt is hedged in a fair value hedge relationship as described in \u00bb Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\nReported in financing activities in cash flow statement\n\n| EURm                                                       | NON- CURRENT  LOANS INCL.

Approximately 34% (34%) of leased assets recognised on the balance sheet consists of land areas in Uruguay, which the group uses for eucalyptus plantations. Approximately 11% of leased assets on the balance sheet consists of vessels for sea transportation in Europe. Approximately 9% (24%) of the leased assets on the balance sheet consist of five power plants. UPM uses the energy generated by these plants for its own production. In 2023, the decrease in carrying value is mainly attributable to the EUR 100 million impairment charge of a leased power plant related to the closure of UPM Plattling paper mill in Germany. In addition, the group has leased one waste water treatment plant as well as several warehouses, terminals, offices and railcars. UPM also leases some production machinery and equipment like forklifts and vehicles that are insignificant to the total leased assets portfolio.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n203\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, additions to leased assets mainly relate to biochemicals refinery utilities in Leuna and new vessels for sea transportation in Europe. Impairment charges 2023 relate to the closure of the UPM Plattling paper mill and in 2022 to assets impacted by Russia's war in Ukraine. Due to the significant uncertainties related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, UPM recognised a write off of all leased assets locating or relating to operations in these countries.\n\nIn 2023, the total cash outflow for leased assets was EUR 99 (91) million. The expenses related to short-term leases recognised in the income statement in 2023 amounted to EUR 3 (3) million. The group did not have significant variable lease payments in 2023.\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at year-end 31 December 2023 totalled approximately EUR 176 (245) million, which are mostly related to a railway service agreement in Uruguay and a service agreement related waste water treatment in Leuna, Germany.\n\nBUSINESSES",

This assessment involves the exercise of judgment about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether UPM obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether UPM has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe group recognises a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases. UPM applies this to all asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less. A lease that contains a purchase option is not a short-term lease. UPM recognises lease payments of short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe lease term is determined as the non-cancellable period of the lease taking into consideration the options to extend and terminate if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise the extension option or will not exercise the termination option. If the contract is for an indefinite period of time and the group and the lessor both have a right to terminate the contract within a short notice period (12 months or less) without a significant economic penalties and termination cash payments, the contract is considered to be a short-term.\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at the commencement date and measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid during the lease term. The group uses, as a basis, discount rate implicit in the lease and if that rate cannot be readily determined, UPM uses incremental borrowing rate which comprises of currency and lease termbased reference rate and specific credit spread as well as other specific terms and conditions of a lease. Lease payments can include fixed payments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate and extension option payments or purchase options if it is reasonably certain\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n204\n\nthat the group will exercise them. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and remeasured (with corresponding adjustment to the related leased asset) when there is a change in future lease payments due to renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or reassessment of options.\n\nLeased asset comprises the initial lease liability, initial direct costs and the obligations to refurbish the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessors. The leased asset is subsequently valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Remeasurement takes place in case lease liability is remeasured and change in cash flows is based on contract terms that have been included in the original contract. The leased asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. The leased asset is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator for impairment, as for own assets.\n\nThe group has elected to separate non-lease components such as service components and other variable components and account them for as expenses, if they can be separated from the leased asset. However, the group does not separate non-lease components from the lease contracts of company cars.\n\nThe group does not apply portfolio approach of leases with similar characteristics.\n\nLeased assets are presented in the balance sheet as a separate financial statement line item. Lease liabilities are presented as part of non-current debt and current debt line items in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are part of net debt calculation of the group. Short-term lease payments are reported as rents and lease expenses. Variable lease payments are recognised within the operating costs and expenses based on the nature of the payment. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a component of finance costs in income statement. In cash flow statement, payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are recognised as financing cash flow while payments for interest portion of lease liability, short-term leases, and variable amounts not included in the measurement of the lease liability, are classified within operating cash flow.\n\n## The group as a lessor\n\nAt inception of a lease contract, the group makes an assessment whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. If the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to\n\n## 5.3  Financial assets and liabilities by category\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, loans and other financial receivables, investments in securities, trade receivables, trade payables, loans, bank overdrafts and derivatives.\n\nClassification of financial assets into different measurement categories depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing the financial asset. The measurement category of each financial asset is determined at inception. Financial\n\nownership of the asset, it is considered to be a finance lease; if not, the lease is considered to be an operating lease. The group has only a minor amount of operating lease contracts, whereby the lease payments are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nassets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right in all circumstances to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred, and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities by category at the end of 2023\n\n| EURm                                                  | FAIR VALUE  THROUGH PROFIT  AND LOSS   | EQUITY  INSTRUMENTS AT  FAIR VALUE  THROUGH OCI   | DERIVATIVES  UNDER HEDGE  ACCOUNTING   | FINANCIAL  ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AT  AMORTISED COST   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Energy shareholdings                                  | -

Their fair value amounted to EUR 2,873 million (3,607 million) at the end of 2023. For quoted bonds, the fair values are based on the quoted market value as of 31 December. At the end of 2023, all bonds were quoted.\n\nFor other non-current debt in interest-bearing liabilities fair values are estimated using the expected contractual future payments discounted at market interest rates and are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information on net debt and bonds.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n206\n\n## Fair value measurement hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                               | 2023    | 2023    | 2023    | 2022   | 2022    | 2022    | 2022    | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n|                                    | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  |\n| Financial assets                   |         |         |         |        |         |         |         |        |\n| Investment funds                   | -       | 1       | -       | 1      | -       | 1       | -       | 1      |\n| Derivatives, non-qualifying hedges | -       | 19      | -       | 19     | -       | 17      | -       | 17     |\n| Derivatives under hedge accounting | 4       | 91      | -       | 95     | 12      | 150     | -       | 162    |\n| Energy shareholdings               | -       | -       | 2,283   | 2,283  | -       | -       | 3,652   | 3,652  |\n| Total                              | 4       | 111     | 2,283   | 2,398  | 12      | 168     | 3,652   | 3,832  |\n| Financial liabilities              |         |         |         |        |         |         |         |        |\n| Derivatives, non-qualifying hedges | -       | 46      | -       | 46     | -       | 37      | -       | 37     |\n| Derivatives under hedge accounting | 6       | 128     | -       | 134    | 46      | 192     | -       | 238    |\n| Total                              | 6       | 174     | -       | 180    | 46      | 229     | -       | 275    |\n\nThere have been no transfers between levels in 2023 and 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nThis category includes derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting and investments funds. They are measured at fair value and any gains or losses from subsequent measurement are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through OCI\n\nThis category includes mainly UPM's energy shareholdings. These assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. \u00bb Refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThis category comprises loan receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, as well as trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. They are included in non-current assets unless they mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Cash and cash equivalents are always classified as current assets. Loan receivables that have a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loan receivables without fixed maturity date are measured at amortised cost. As soon as a loan receivables or cash and cash equivalents are originated or purchased, a loss allowance for 12-month expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. If credit risk increases significantly, full lifetime expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. The credit loss model applied to trade receivables is described in \u00bb Note 4.6 Working capital .\n\n## Derivatives under hedge accounting\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives used for hedging purposes are recognised in accordance with the accounting principles described in \u00bb Note 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes debt, trade payables and other financial liabilities. \u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n207\n\nThe different levels of fair value hierarchy used in fair value estimation are defined as follows:\n\n## Fair values under level 1\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Derivatives include futures and commodity forwards traded in exchange.\n\n## Fair values under level 2\n\nObservable inputs are used as basis for fair value calculations either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. For investment funds, the valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in markets that are not active. For derivatives, level 2 include OTC derivatives like forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest and currency swaps and commodity swaps. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments at level 2 include the following methods:\n\nInterest forward rate agreements (FRA) are fair valued based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date. Forward foreign exchange contracts are fair valued based on the contract forward rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency options are fair valued based on quoted market rates and market volatility rates on the balance sheet date by using the Black&Scholes option valuation model. Interest and currency swap instruments are fair valued as present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Commodity swaps are fair valued based on quoted forward prices on the balance sheet date.\n\nAn embedded derivative that is by nature a foreign currency forward contract is valuated at market forward exchange rates and is included in level 2. Embedded derivatives are monitored by the group and the fair value changes are reported in other operating income in the income statement.\n\n## Fair values under level 3\n\nFinancial assets or liabilities of which fair values are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) are classified under level 3. This category include UPM's energy shareholdings and forest assets. Fair valuations are performed at least quarterly by respective business areas or functions. Fair valuations are reviewed by the group finance management and overseen by the Audit Committee. \u00bb Refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings and \u00bb Note 4.2 Forest assets .",

The shares are included within the book entry system for securities.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n208\n\n## Treasury shares\n\n## Share-based payments reserve\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the company held 411,653 (411,653) of its own shares, 0.08% (0.08%) of the total number of shares.\n\n## Reserves\n\n| EURm                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fair value reserve                         | 1,713  | 3,062  |\n| Hedging reserve                            | -88    | -627   |\n| Share-based payments reserve               | 31     | 25     |\n| Total other reserves                       | 1,655  | 2,460  |\n| Reserve for invested non-restricted equity | 1,273  | 1,273  |\n| Translation reserve                        | 347    | 449    |\n| Total reserves                             | 3,276  | 4,182  |\n\n## Fair value reserve\n\nThis reserve represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of investments in equity securities comprising mainly of the fair value change of the energy shareholdings. Amounts are recycled only within equity upon the disposal of the asset.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred and the cost of hedging when recognised in OCI. Amounts are recognised in profit or loss when the associated hedged transactions affect profit or loss or as part of the acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment. In 2023, a gain of EUR 0 million (5) was reclassified from the hedging reserve to other financial income and expenses as a result of discontinuation of hedge accounting.\n\nThe share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value at the grant date of the share incentive plans, Performance Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan, over their vesting period.\n\n## Reserve for invested non-restricted equity\n\nReserve for invested non-restricted equity includes, under the Companies' Act, the exercise value of shareholders' investments in the company unless otherwise decided by the company.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nThis reserve includes the foreign currency differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and the effective result of transactions that hedge the group's net investments in foreign operations. There were no reclassifications from the translation reserve to profit or loss during the period resulting from inefficiency of net investment hedges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTransaction costs directly relating to the issue of new shares or share options are recognised, net of tax, in equity as a reduction in the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the parent company's shares (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the parent company until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\n1\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2023                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | 42                            | -814                                       | -11                | 155   | -627    |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | -74                           | 178                                        | 13                 | -23   | 94      |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | -                             | -                                          | 1                  | -     |         |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | 44                            | 516                                        | -5                 | -111  | 444     |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | 13                            | -120                                       | -3                 | 21    | -88     |\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2022                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | -32                           | -84                                        | -1                 | 22    | -96     |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | 65                            | 401                                        | 4                  | -94   | 376     |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | 24                            | -                                          | 1                  | -     | 25      |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | -15                           | -1,131                                     | -15                | 228   | -932    |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | 42                            | -814                                       | -11                | 155   | -627    |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n209\n\n## Share capital\n\n|                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Number of shares (1,000) | 533,736 | 533,736 |\n| Share capital, EURm      | 890     | 890     |",

Risk management\n\n## 6.1  Financial risk management\n\nThe objective of financial risk management is to protect the group from unfavourable changes in financial markets and thus help to secure profitability. The objectives and limits for financing activities are defined in the Group Treasury Policy approved by the Board of Directors. In financial risk management various financial instruments are used within the limits specified in the Group Treasury Policy. Only such instruments which market value and risk profile can be continuously and reliably monitored are used for this purpose.\n\nFinancing services are provided to the group entities and financial risk management carried out by the central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAs a consequence of the global nature of its business, UPM is exposed to risks associated with changes in exchange rates, primarily with respect to USD, UYU, GBP and CNY. Foreign exchange risk arises from contracted and expected commercial future payment flows (transaction exposure), changes in value of recognised assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and changes in the value of assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries (translation exposure). The objective of foreign exchange risk management is to limit the uncertainty created by changes in foreign exchange rates on the future value of cash flows earnings and in the group's balance sheet. Changing exchange rates can also have indirect effects, such as change in relative competitiveness between currency regions.\n\n## Transaction exposure\n\nThe group hedges transaction exposure related to highly probable future commercial foreign currency cash flows on a rolling basis over the next 12-month period based on forecasts by the respective business areas. Transaction risk arises from the changes in currency rates of highly probable transactions, which are expected to take place in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The group's policy is to hedge an average of 50% of its estimated net risk currency cash flow. Some highly probable cash flows have been hedged for longer than 12 months ahead while deviating from the risk neutral hedging level at the same time. At 31 December 2023, 53% (51%) of the forecast 12-month currency flow was hedged.\n\nThe group enters into external forward contracts, which are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk of specific future foreign currency flows. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied when possible. If hedge accounting is not possible, fair value changes of the hedging instrument are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of 2023, UPM's estimated net risk currency flow for the next 12 months was EUR 1,875 million (2,291 million).\n\nThe weighted hedging rate by currency against EUR were USD 1.09, UYU 43.02 and GBP 0.88.\n\nIn addition to commercial foreign currency flow, the group has hedged risk currency flow related to investments. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied. At the end of 2023 the hedged net risk currency flow was EUR 1 million (EUR 141 million).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n210\n\nweighted hedging rate of these hedges against EUR were China CNY 7.77 and Uruguay USD 1.10.\n\nDerivatives used for hedging translation risks are external forward contracts, cross currency swaps and currency options.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk sensitivity\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect to profit before tax due to recognised balance sheet items in foreign currency and the effect to equity arising mainly from foreign currency forwards used to hedge foreign currency flows.\n\n|                        | Profit before tax   | Profit before tax   | Equity   | Equity   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|\n| EURm                   | 2023                | 2022                | 2023     | 2022     |\n| EUR strengthens by 10% |                     |                     |          |          |\n| USD                    | 2                   | 1                   | 89       | 128      |\n| UYU                    | -                   | -                   | -14      | -15      |\n| GBP                    | -                   | -                   | 13       | 17       |\n| CNY                    | 1                   | 1                   | 10       | 10       |\n| EUR weakens by 10%     |                     |                     |          |          |\n| USD                    | -2                  | -1                  | -89      | -128     |\n| UYU                    | -                   | -                   | 14       | 15       |\n| GBP                    | -                   | -                   | -13      | -17      |\n| CNY                    | -1                  | -1                  | -10      | -10      |\n\nThe following assumptions were made when calculating the sensitivity to changes in the foreign exchange risk:\n\n- \u00b7 Major part of non-derivative financial instruments (such as cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, debt and trade payables) are either directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives i.e. the balance sheet position is close to zero. Exchange rate fluctuations have therefore minor or no effects on profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 The table includes effect of foreign currency forward contracts that hedge commercial flows or investments or net investments in foreign subsidiaries, and which have an effective hedge relationship.\n- \u00b7 The table includes also effect of foreign currency forward contracts that are not part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on profit.\n- \u00b7 The table excludes effect of foreign currency denominated future cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe interest-bearing liabilities and assets expose the group to interest rate risk, namely repricing and fair value interest rate risk caused by interest rate movements. According to the Group Treasury Policy the interest rate exposure is defined as the difference in interest rate sensitivity between assets and liabilities compared to a benchmark portfolio with a 6-month duration. The total interest rate exposure is a net debt portfolio which includes all interest bearing assets and liabilities and derivatives that are used to hedge the aforementioned balance sheet items. The policy sets risk limits and allowed deviation from 6-month benchmark net debt duration level. UPM has decided to deviate from its policy benchmark and extend the duration of net debt. At 31 December 2023 the duration of net debt was 40 (45) months. The group uses interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps,\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n211\n\ninterest rate futures and cross currency swaps, to change net debt duration.\n\nThe table below shows the nominal value of interest rate position exposed to interest rate risk in each significant currency. The position includes all cash balances, investment funds, interest bearing assets and liabilities and derivatives used to hedge these items.

UPM aims to fully hedge this balance sheet translation exposure, however, UPM might have unhedged balance sheet exposures within the limits set in group Treasury Policy.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the unhedged balance sheet exposures in net of interest-bearing assets and liabilities amounted to EUR 9 million (8 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nThe group has also accounts receivable and payable balances denominated in foreign currencies and UPM aims to fully hedge the net exposure in main currencies. The nominal values of the hedging instruments in net of accounts payable and receivable hedging were EUR 323 million (410 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nUPM's net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to foreign currency translation differences. The exchange rate differences arising from translation of foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of equity in the translation reserve relate mainly to USD, CNY and GBP. Currency exposure arising from the net investment in foreign subsidiaries is generally not hedged. However, at 31 December 2023, part of the foreign exchange risk associated with the net investments was hedged, major ones in China and Uruguay, and net investment hedge accounting has been applied.

Electricity prices rely on weather, fossil fuel and emissions allowance prices as well as the balance of supply and demand. The group's sensitivity to electricity market price is dependent on the electricity production and consumption levels and the hedging levels. The inherent price risks arise from the daily sales and purchases of electricity from the power market with spot prices, and the hedging objective is to reduce the earnings volatility that arises from electricity prices.\n\nUPM considers Nordic system and electricity price area differential (EPAD) for Finland products perfect hedges for corresponding electricity price risk components in Finland. The components of electricity price risk in the Nordic power market are hedged by entering into System and EPAD electricity derivative contracts, mostly Nasdaq Commodities futures and bilateral forwards. System and EPAD prices are considered as separately identifiable and reliably measurable risk components in electricity sales and purchase contracts as well as in the hedging instruments, as a quoted price is available. Fair value changes of designated system and EPAD derivatives are offsetting electricity sales and purchase price changes. The share of system component covers approximately 80-90% and the share of EPAD component covers 10-20% of the changes in electricity sales and purchase prices.\n\nThe electricity price risk in the Central European power market is hedged by entering into European Electricity Exchange futures. Products used for hedging hedge the entire price risk for the underlying price area.\n\nThe time frame hedged has historically been approximately rolling 5 years. Hedging level has been typically higher for the nearest years and lower for the latter years. Hedging level for a certain year has historically varied between 0-80%. UPM constantly updates its electricity production and consumption forecasts. Hedging level is calculated based on the most recent available information about the electricity production and consumption forecast.\n\nThe group applies cash flow hedge accounting for the hedging relationships when it hedges its electricity price risk. In small amounts, the group is also trading electricity forwards and futures. As well as hedging, proprietary trading risks are monitored on a daily basis. Value-At-Risk levels are set to limit the maximum risk at any given time. Cumulative maximum loss is limited by stop-loss limits.\n\n## Electricity derivatives price sensitivity\n\nSensitivity analysis for financial electricity derivatives is based on position at the end of financial year. Sensitivities change over time as the overall hedging and trading positions change. Underlying physical positions are not included in the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is calculated separately for the hedge accounted and nonhedge accounted volumes. In the analysis it is assumed that forward quotation in Nasdaq Commodities and EEX would change EUR 5/ MWh throughout the period UPM has derivatives.\n\n| EURm                                             | EFFECT   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| +/- EUR 5/MWh in electricity  forward quotations |          |        |        |\n| Effect on profit before tax                      | +/-      | 0.1    | 0.1    |\n| Effect on equity                                 | +/-      | 51.0   | 93.0   |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n212\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## 6.2  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe group uses financial derivatives to manage currency, interest rate and commodity price risks.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 6.1\n\nFinancial risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value gain or loss is recognised through the income statement or other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and on the nature of the item being hedged. Certain derivatives are designated at inception either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge), or hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries with other than the EUR as their functional currency (net investment hedge). Derivative fair values on the balance sheet are classified as non-current when the remaining maturity is more than 12 months and as current when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months.\n\nFor hedge accounting purposes, UPM documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception date. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or forecast transactions. The group also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an on-going basis, as to whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nCertain derivatives, while considered to be economical hedges for UPM's financial risk management purposes, do not qualify for hedge accounting. Such derivatives are recognised at fair value through the income statement in other operating income or under financial items.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Cost of hedging, meaning forward points of derivative forward contracts accounted as cash flow hedges, is recognised as a part of the hedging reserve. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement and classified as income or expense in the same period as that in which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the forecast external sale to the group that is hedged takes place).\n\nWhen the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a fixed asset, gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost and depreciated over the useful\n\n## lives of the assets.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the committed or forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. However, if a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised to the income statement.\n\nIn currency cash flow hedging, the hedging instrument is made in the same currency as the hedged item and hence the fair value change of the hedging instrument are expected to effectively offset the fair value\n\nchanges generated by the hedged items. Thereby the hedge ratio between the instrument and the cash flow is 1:1. Hedge accounting ceases in the case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. The group has not recognised significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nAlso in electricity price hedges, hedge accounting ceases in the case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe fair value changes of forward exchange contracts used in hedging net investments that reflect the change in spot exchange rates are recognised in other comprehensive income within translation reserve. Any gain or loss relating to the interest portion of forward exchange contracts is recognised immediately in the income statement under financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\nThe hedging instrument is always made in the same currency as the hedged investment, hence the hedge ratio in net investment hedging is 1:1. For hedging of net investments, hedge accounting ceases in the situation where the hedged item is disposed or sold during the duration of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that are prospectively highly effective are recorded in the income statement under financial items, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. The carrying amounts of hedged items and the fair values of hedging instruments are included in interest-bearing assets or liabilities.\n\nDerivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges mature at the same time as hedged items. If the hedge no longer meets\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n213\n\nthe criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the expected period to maturity.\n\nHedge accounting ceases in fair value hedge of fixed interest risk in case of early redemption of such debt, which is hedged under fair value hedge accounting. The group has not recognised significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial counterparty risk\n\nThe financial instruments the group has agreed with banks and financial institutions contain an element of risk of the counterparties being unable to meet their obligations. According to the Group Treasury Policy derivative instruments and investments of cash funds may be made only with counterparties meeting certain creditworthiness criteria. The group minimises counterparty risk also by using a number of major banks and financial institutions. Creditworthiness of counterparties is constantly monitored by Treasury and Risk Management. Due to the tight counterparty criteria, credit risk does not dominate the fair valuation of financial instruments.\n\n## Effects of IBOR reform\n\nMain effect of the IBOR reform was limited to fair value hedge accounting of long-term fixed-rate debt for changes in fair value attributable to USD LIBOR, that was used as the benchmark interest rate as long as USD LIBOR rates were published. UPM adhered to ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallback Protocol in 2023 and fallback terms stated in the protocol were followed to convert USD LIBOR based transactions SOFR based transactions. In the fair value hedging relationships where IBOR reform had an effect, fair value for both the hedged item and hedging instrument is calculated with identical valuation curve. Therefore no ineffectiveness was recorded.",

The effective tax rate was 15.2% (19.9%). In 2023 and 2022, the effective tax rate was affected by the income not subject to tax from subsidiaries operating in tax free zone and German tax rate that is higher than in Finland.

Current tax is calculated on the taxable result for the period based on the tax rules prevailing in the countries where the group operates and includes tax adjustments for previous periods and withholding taxes deducted at source on intra-group transactions. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity or as part of other comprehensive income. In these instances, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n216\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the group's tax expense and income tax liabilities involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Tax balances reflect a current understanding and interpretation of existing tax laws. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and adjusts income tax liabilities where appropriate.\n\nIn December 2022, EU member states reached agreement to implement at EU level the minimum taxation component, known as Pillar Two, of the OECD's reform of international taxation. The entities in scope will be liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between their GloBE effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate. UPM is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Finland in 2023, the jurisdiction in which UPM is incorporated, and will come into effect from 1 January 2024. Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the group has no related current tax exposure. The group applies the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023. UPM is currently evaluating Pillar Two requirements and legislation in the jurisdictions that are likely to be impacted. For the annual reporting period to 31 December 2023, some of the jurisdictions have effective tax rate below 15% as calculated in accordance with IAS 12. However, the group might not be exposed to paying Pillar Two income taxes. This is due to the impact of specific adjustments in calculating the GloBE effective tax rates compared to those calculated in accordance with paragraph 86 of IAS 12 as well as substance based income exclusion which limits the tax base. Based on initial assessment, if the Pillar Two rules had been applicable in 2023, there would not have been any impact on group's income taxes. The assessment is based on the current information available and may change as more details and guidance on the implementation of the Pillar Two rules are released. The main jurisdiction for possible exposure to additional Pillar Two income taxes is Uruguay. The financial impact would depend on the results of the Uruguay subsidiaries and the decrease in the substance based income exclusion in accordance with the OECD Pillar Two model rules in subsequent years. Due to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating GloBE income and additional guidance still being developed by OECD, the quantitative impact of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable.\n\nThe law for a temporary profit tax on the electricity sector in Finland was enacted in March 2023. The additional tax to be applied is 30% of the companies' net profits generated from the electricity business in Finland in fiscal year 2023 exceeding 10% annual return on shareholder's equity of the electricity business (in addition to normal 20 % corporate income tax rate on profits generated from electricity operations). UPM is in scope of temporary profit tax and the additional tax accrued amounted to EUR 1 million.\n\n## 7.2  Deferred tax\n\n| EURm                                                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                  |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | 66     | 86     | 83     |\n| Inventories                                          | 77     | 86     | 53     |\n| Retirement benefit liabilities and provisions        | 94     | 88     | 127    |\n| Other temporary differences                          | 175    | 475    | 269    |\n| Tax losses and tax credits carried forward           | 242    | 167    | 230    |\n| Offset against liabilities                           | -224   | -417   | -297   |\n| Total                                                | 431    | 485    | 466    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                             |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | -265   | -335   | -261   |\n| Forest assets                                        | -412   | -423   | -398   |\n| Retirement benefit assets                            | -      | -2     | -17    |\n| Other temporary differences                          | -163   | -294   | -217   |\n| Offset against assets                                | 224    | 417    | 297    |\n| Total                                                | -616   | -636   | -596   |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)                | -185   | -151   | -130   |\n\n## Movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                  |   2023 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January          |   -151 | -130   |\n| Charged to income statement           |     90 | -44    |\n| Charged to other comprehensive income |   -113 | 58     |\n| Companies acquired                    |     -5 | -26    |\n| Classified as held for sale           |    -13 | -      |\n| Exchange rate adjustments             |      7 | -9     |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) |   -185 | -151   |\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.\n\n## Tax charge to other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                     | Before tax   | Tax   | After tax   | Before tax   | Tax   | After tax   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|-------------|\n| EURm                                                | 2023         | 2023  | 2023        | 2022         | 2022  | 2022        |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans | -14          | 4     | -10         | 249          | -57   | 192         |\n| Energy shareholdings                                | -1,370       | 19    | -1,351      | 1,074        | -23   | 1,051       |\n| Translation differences                             | -120         | -     | -120        | 150          | -     | 150         |\n| Cash flow hedges                                    | 673          | -134  | 539         | -665         | 134   | -531        |\n| Net investment hedges                               | 8            | -2    | 6           | -19          | 4     | -15         |\n| Total                                               | -823         | -113  | -936        | 789          | 58    | 847         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Recognised deferred tax assets\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets requires management judgement as to whether it is probable that such balances will be utilised and/or reversed in the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2023, net operating loss carry-forwards for which the group has recognised a deferred tax asset amounted to EUR 841 million (584 million), of which EUR 772 million (514 million) was attributable to German subsidiaries. In Germany net operating loss carry-forwards do not expire. In other countries net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates and in varying amounts. Based on profit forecasts, it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the tax losses and tax credits can be utilised.\n\nThe assumptions regarding future realisation of tax benefits, and therefore the recognition of deferred tax assets, may change due to future operating performance of the group, as well as other factors, some of which are outside of the control of the group.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n217\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe net operating loss carry-forwards for which no deferred tax is recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation amounted to EUR 902 million (890 million) in 2023. These net operating loss carry-forwards are mainly attributable to certain German and French subsidiaries and do not expire, as well as to certain Uruguayan subsidiaries which expire at different times by the end of 2028.\n\nIn addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards relating to closed Miramichi paper mill due to only minor operations in Canada. These loss carry-forwards expire at different times by the end of 2029.\n\nIn Uruguay tax credits amounting to EUR 155 million have not been recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation.\n\nThe group has not recognised deferred tax liability in respect of undistributed earnings of non-Finnish subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax liability for the undistributed earnings of Finnish subsidiaries and associates as such earnings can be distributed without any tax consequences.\n\nBUSINESSES",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised net where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8.  Group structure\n\n## 8.1 Business acquisitions and disposals\n\nIn 2023, UPM sold all its business operations in Russia to Gungnir Wooden Products Trading. The group also sold its holding in ASK Altpapier Sortierung Kinsau GmbH and its 20.00 % holding in the associated company Northern SC Paper Corporation. UPM made also several minor investments and sales of equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI.\n\nIn 2022, acquired AMC AG (Advanced Methods of Coating) and made a minor investment in ASK Altpapier Sortierung Kinsau GmbH by acquiring the full share capital of of the company. UPM also sold its 33.09 % holding in the associated company Encore Ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6palvelut Oy, and made several minor investments and disposals of equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nOn 1 August 2023, it was announced that UPM Biochemicals has acquired SunCoal Industries GmbH. The acquisition enables UPM Biochemicals to strengthen the role as a leading supplier of sustainable, renewable functional fillers (RFF) to the rubber and plastic markets. UPM Biochemicals expects to realize significant synergies through the acquisition.\n\nIf the transaction had occurred on 1 January 2023, UPM's sales for January-December 2023 would have been EUR 10,461 million and profit for the period EUR 393 million. These amounts have been calculated using the group's accounting policies and by adjusting the results of the subsidiaries to reflect the amortisation that would have been charged assuming application of fair value adjustments to other intangible assets from 1 January 2023, together with the consequential tax effects.\n\nDetails of the purchase consideration, the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:\n\n2\n\n| EURm                         |    |\n|------------------------------|----|\n| Cash paid                    | 21 |\n| Deferred consideration       |    |\n| Total purchase consideration | 23 |\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n| EURm                              |   31 JUL 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|\n| Other intangible assets           |            22 |\n| Property, plant and equipment     |             1 |\n| Leased assets                     |             0 |\n| Trade and other receivables       |             1 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents         |             1 |\n| Total assets                      |            25 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities          |             5 |\n| Provisions                        |             0 |\n| Non-current debt                  |             0 |\n| Trade and other payables          |             1 |\n| Total liabilities                 |             7 |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired  |            17 |\n| Goodwill arising from acquisition |             5 |\n\nAcquisition-related costs of EUR 1 million are included in other operating expenses and are reported as items affecting comparability in UPM Biochemicals business in Other Operations.\n\nInformation on the amounts of revenue and profit or loss of the acquiree since the acquisition date included in the consolidated income statement for the reporting period is not disclosed because it would be impracticable. The acquired business has been included in the group since 31 July 2023, and the effects of the revenues and profit or loss thereof are not considered material for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe fair values of net identifiable assets acquired are provisional and dependent on final fair valuations.\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nIn 2023, UPM did not have any change in its non-controlling interests. In 2022, UPM acquired a holding with a minor non-controlling interest as a part of the acquisition of AMC AG.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nUPM consolidates acquired entities at the acquisition date which is when it gains control using the acquisition method. Consideration transferred is determined as the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued including the fair value of a contingent consideration. Acquisition related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group measures any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests are consolidated line by line into the UPM consolidated financial statements. The proportion of the profit for the period, as well as the accumulated share of total equity belonging to non-controlling interests are presented separately in the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet.\n\n218\n\n## 8.2  Principal subsidiaries and joint operations\n\n| SUBSIDIARIES                                           | COUNTRY OF  INCORPORATION   | HOLDING %   2023   | HOLDING %   2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Blandin Paper Company                                  | US                          | 100.00             | 100.00             |\n| Blanvira S.A.                                          | UY                          | 91.00              | 91.00              |\n| Cuecar S.A.                                            | UY                          | 91.00              | 91.00              |\n| Forestal Oriental S.A.                                 | UY                          | 100.00             | 100.00             |\n| Gebr.

The Trust consists of various defined benefit sections, all of which are closed to future accrual and one common defined contribution section which is open to all UPM employees in the UK. The group made contributions of EUR 0 million (6 million) to the defined benefit sections of the Scheme in 2023.

Unrecognised items\n\n## 9.1  Commitments and contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, UPM enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties. The maximum amounts of future payments for which UPM is liable is disclosed in the table below under 'Other commitments'. Property under mortgages given as collateral for own commitments include property, plant and equipment, industrial estates and forest land.\n\n| EURm                                                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| On behalf of others                                                    |        |        |\n| Guarantees                                                             | -      | 2      |\n| Other own commitments                                                  |        |        |\n| Leasing commitments for the next 12 months in  accordance with IFRS 16 | 2      | 2      |\n| Other commitments                                                      | 99     | 219    |\n| Total                                                                  | 101    | 223    |\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at the end of 2023 totals approximately EUR 176 million, which are mostly related to a railway service agreement in Uruguay and a service agreement related to waste water treatment in Leuna, Germany. Lease commitments at the end of 2022 amounted to EUR 245 million.\n\nThe decrease in other commitments during the period is mainly due to the PVO loan commitment, which matured at the end of 2023.\n\n## 9.2  Litigation\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe group is defendant or plaintiff in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations. These lawsuits primarily involve claims arising from commercial law issues.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe Group's management is not aware of any significant litigation at the end of 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, the European Commission conducted an unannounced inspection at UPM's premises. According to the Commission's press release on 12 October 2021, the Commission had concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. On 15 June 2023 the Commission published a release that it had decided to close its antitrust investigation in the wood pulp sector. According to the Commission's release, it had decided to close the investigation after a thorough analysis and careful assessment of all the evidence gathered.\n\n## 9.3  Events after the balance sheet date\n\nOn 2 January 2024, UPM announced that it has completed the sale of Steyrerm\u00fchl site and all related assets to HEINZEL GROUP, thereby closing the transaction announced in June 2022.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n222\n\n## 10.

The main differences in accounting policies of the group and the parent company relate to the measurement of financial derivatives and forest assets and recognition of defined benefit obligations, share-based payments, lease agreements and deferred income taxes.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in millions of euros and rounded and therefore the sum of individual figures might deviate from the presented total figure.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nReceivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date and other commitments are translated into euro currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Exchange rate differences arising from the valuation of trade receivables are recognised in sales and exchange rate differences on trade payables in purchases. Exchange differences arising from the measurement of other receivables and liabilities are recognised in financial items.\n\n## Tangible and intangible assets\n\nTangible and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortisation according to plan and impairments. Emission rights are recognised using net approach. Depreciation and amortization according to plan is recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\nLand and water areas, no depreciation\n\n| Intangible assets             | 5-10 years   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Buildings                     | 20-50 years  |\n| Light machinery and equipment | 5-10 years   |\n| Heavy machinery               | 15-20 years  |\n| Power plants                  | 20-30 years  |\n| Other tangible assets         | 5-20 years   |\n\nForest assets are recognised as tangible assets within land and water areas at historical cost and revaluation. No systematic depreciation or changes in value due to felling is recognised.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are stated at cost less impairments.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at cost or the lower of replacement cost and probable selling price. Costs are measured using FIFO-method. In addition to variable costs, the cost of inventories includes a portion of the fixed costs of acquisition and manufacturing.\n\n## Revaluations\n\nThe balance sheet value of land includes revaluations. No new revaluations are made and the balance sheet value of land is considered to be below their fair value.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n227\n\n## Leases\n\nLease payments of lease contracts are recognised in other operating expenses over the lease term. Lease payments due in future years under lease contracts are presented as off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions include foreseeable future expenses and losses to which the company is committed, the realization of which is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated, e.g. pension and environmental liabilities and termination and restructuring costs. Changes in provisions are recognised in income statement within particular cost items.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales include sales revenue from actual operations less indirect taxes, discounts, claims and exchange rate differences on trade receivables.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). The mandatory pensions are arranged mainly through pension insurance companies. Contributions to pension insurance companies are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nShare based compensation is recognized as an expense in the income statement over the earnings period and the related liability is booked to the balance sheet.\n\n## Closing entries\n\nParent company closing entries consists of the change in the depreciation difference and group contributions granted to group companies. The accumulated depreciation difference in the parent company has not been divided into equity and deferred tax liability.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes presented in the income statement consist of accrued taxes for the financial year and tax adjustments for prior years. The parent company has not recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, but presents the information in the notes.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nRealised results of derivative contracts and negative fair value of open derivative contracts are recognised in the income statement. Negative fair value of open derivative contracts that are not settled in cash is recognised as a provision in the balance sheet. Hedge accounting is not applied. Income and expenses of balance sheet hedging and forward foreign exchange contracts hedging commercial foreign currency flow of all group companies are recognised in financial items. Income and expenses of commodity derivatives are recognised in operating profit. Income and expenses of commodity derivative contracts of group companies are recognized in financial items.\n\nMajority of financial derivative contracts of the group are made by the parent company. All contracts are made with external counterparties",

The Decree on the unbundling of electricity business of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment of Finland (TEM 1305/2019) states that electricity business is not considered minor if the revenue exceeds 500 thousand euros. Electricity business refers to production and sales of electricity. The\n\nelectricity business of the parent entity exceeds the minimum requirement, therefore, the mentioned requirement is applicable to the company.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe unbundled financial statement of electricity business is prepared in accordance with Electricity Market Act. Transactions and balance sheet items are recorded to income statement and balance sheet in accordance with the cause-and-effect principle. The transactions and balance sheet items which are not directly derived from the electricity business, are allocated based on the size of the business.\n\n## Income statement\n\n| EURm                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sales                                             | 11     | 40     |\n| Other operating income                            | 6      | 2      |\n| Materials and services                            |        |        |\n| Raw materials and consumables purchased           | -16    | -10    |\n|                                                   | -16    | -10    |\n| Personnel expenses                                |        |        |\n| Salaries and fees                                 | -      | -      |\n| Indirect employee costs                           |        |        |\n| Pension costs                                     | -      | -      |\n| Other indirect employee costs                     | -      | -      |\n|                                                   | -      | -      |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges |        |        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                     | -1     | -1     |\n| Other operating expenses                          | -2     | -1     |\n| Operating profit (loss)                           | -3     | 29     |\n| Profit (loss) before closing entries and tax      | -3     | 29     |\n| Closing entries                                   |        |        |\n| Depreciation difference                           | 1      | 1      |\n| Income taxes                                      | -      | -6     |\n| Profit (Loss) for the period                      | -2     | 24     |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2023\n\n235",

The financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, statement of cash flows and notes, which include material accounting policy information and other explanatory information\n- \u00b7 the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 2.3 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\n## Overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Overall group materiality: \u20ac 65 million, which represents approximately 5 % of the the average profit before tax for the last three years.\n- \u00b7 The group audit scope encompassed all significant group companies, as well as a number of smaller group companies in Europe, Asia, North America and South America covering the vast majority of revenue, assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of forest assets\n- \u00b7 Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.",

An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 65 million (previous year \u20ac 95 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | Approximately 5% of the profit before tax for the last three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose profit before taxes as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which the performance of the Group is commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted  benchmark. We chose approximately 5%, which is within the range of acceptable quantitative  materiality thresholds in auditing standards. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the group. Selected specified procedures as well as analytical procedures were performed to cover the remaining group companies.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matter in the audit of the group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of forest assets\n\nRefer to note 4.2. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe group owns and leases a total of 1 073 thousand hectares of forests and plantations in Finland, the United States and Uruguay. The value of the forest assets, i.e. standing trees, amount to \u20ac 2 355 million at 31 December 2023. Forest assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows.  Young saplings and land are valued at cost. Main factors used in the valuation are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nIn testing the valuation of forest assets, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodologies adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n\n-\n\n- Assessed the discount rates applied in the valuation;\n- -Assessed the other key valuation assumptions; and,\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as stumpage price, trend price forecast, tree growth assumptions, consumer price index and inflation.\n\nIn testing the valuation of the energy shareholdings, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodology adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n- -Assessed the discount rate applied in the valuation;\n- -Assessed the future electricity prices and price trends;\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as production costs and volumes, UPM's ownership percentages, inflation, tax rate and net debt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nRefer to note 4.3. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe energy shareholdings amounted to \u20ac 2 283 million at 31 December 2023. The energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments in energy companies and are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable. The fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis. The main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends, and discount rates.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nWe have no key audit matters to report with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nThere are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.",

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Reporting Requirements\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe have been acting as auditors appointed by the annual general meeting since 30 April 1996. Our appointment represents a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 28 years. The Company arranged the latest audit tendering process in 2013. Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Mikko Nieminen has acted as the responsible auditor since 4 April 2019, representing a total uninterrupted period of five years.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the date of this auditor's report and the Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. In our opinion\n\n- \u00b7 the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements\n- \u00b7 the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Other Statements\n\nWe support the proposal that the financial statements are adopted. The proposal by the Board of Directors regarding the distribution of profits is in compliance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. We support that the Members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of the parent company should be discharged from liability for the financial period audited by us.\n\nHelsinki 14 February 2024\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nAuthorised Public Accountants\n\nMikko Nieminen Authorised Public Accountant (KHT)\n\n## Other financial information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nUPM presents certain performance measures of historical performance, financial position and cash flows, which in accordance with the 'Alternative Performance Measures' guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) are not accounting measures defined or specified in IFRS Accounting Standards and are therefore considered as alternative performance measures.
